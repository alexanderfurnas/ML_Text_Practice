reports of false alarms near
where you've been can

04:18.258 --> 04:24.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you tell us what's been going on
with those this is a city that
is so tense

04:24.798 --> 04:29.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right now it's not uncommon to
see all these vehicles running
at top speed

04:29.636 --> 04:33.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
through city streets and
incredible sense of urgency
earlier this afternoon

04:33.540 --> 04:37.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or register late this evening
there were scared that the main
plaza where so many

04:37.611 --> 04:41.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people had come to lay flowers
and pay their respects show
their solidarity

04:41.148 --> 04:47.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that plaza was evacuated there
was a suspicious activity at
least called in

04:47.053 --> 04:51.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there was also people that we're
getting scared near some of the
restaurants

04:51.224 --> 04:54.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where these visuals were both of
those turned out to be false
alarms but not

04:54.761 --> 04:59.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
before hundreds of a couple of
thousand people from the central
plaza all took

04:59.432 --> 05:03.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
off because they didn't know
whether there was another attack
house and

05:03.436 --> 05:06.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
beyond that what is your sense
of what is the what is the mood
like what are

05:06.273 --> 05:12.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people saying to you about what
they'd like to see happen next

05:12.279 --> 05:18.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is a city that's really in
the mix of both sadness and
anger you see some

05:18.285 --> 05:22.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the signs that are actually
left up here on the one hand
there's no way for

05:22.789 --> 05:28.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paris we're sorry for your loss
and then there's also a very
very strong and

05:28.328 --> 05:32.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hateful tone not just against
the terrorists but sometimes
very unpleasant

05:32.532 --> 05:37.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opinions against Muslims from
around the country around the
world so there's a

05:37.037 --> 05:41.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
national conversation
that has to happen here

05:41.208 --> 05:45.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
similar to the ones that
actually happening around the
memorials what

05:45.612 --> 05:49.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
about this issue of the
connection between the refugees
and migrants that

05:49.816 --> 05:53.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been coming into Europe and
the potential threat that this
might be a

05:53.553 --> 05:56.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vehicle for terrorists getting
into France are you hearing talk
about that

05:56.756 --> 06:03.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as well that's a conversation
that we had linked with a
senator but it's also

06:03.830 --> 06:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something that a lot more
average citizens are thinking
about on the one

06:07.400 --> 06:09.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hand they do want to do right by
the refugees they want to help
these people

06:09.502 --> 06:12.138 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in need

06:12.138 --> 06:15.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the other hand they say
listen the absolute open border
policy of Germany

06:15.976 --> 06:19.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from a few months ago
might not be the solution

06:19.512 --> 06:23.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what is the in-between step
where the French citizens can
ensure some

06:23.850 --> 06:27.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
semblance of their own security
at the same time help the people
that are on

06:27.554 --> 06:31.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their doorsteps alright

screaming and this was the
terrible part

because they were screaming at

King's College in London he
joins me now from there to
discuss the group and its

10:41.608 --> 10:45.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intentions Peter these latest
attacks sort of put to rest the
idea that Isis

10:45.545 --> 10:48.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was mostly concerned about
actions in the Middle East

10:48.781 --> 10:51.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what do you think that they are
trying to accomplish with these
most recent

10:51.017 --> 10:56.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attacks I think there are three
games here the first is
classical asymmetric

10:56.990 --> 11:02.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
warfare you're hitting us we're
going to take revenge by hitting
you where to its

11:02.662 --> 11:07.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most namely at home the second
intention is really to polarize
into divide

11:07.467 --> 11:13.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
European societies to create
that sense of Islam against the
west and to create

11:13.506 --> 11:18.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of mess in the countries
that they oppose the third
intention that often

11:18.177 --> 11:22.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
gets forgotten is also
internally I think the Islamic
state has been on the

11:22.782 --> 11:27.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
defensive end its core territory
in Iraq and Syria and this kind
of attack I

11:27.654 --> 11:31.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think motivate supporters and
gives them again the feeling
that they are part of

11:31.758 --> 11:35.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the winning team and that's
really important so this is part
of their

11:35.895 --> 11:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strategy of of not just scaring
the West off from attacks
against them but trying

11:40.066 --> 11:42.902 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
to recruit more
people to the cause

11:42.902 --> 11:47.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
absolutely and I think it's
really important to understand
case of Isis

11:47.707 --> 11:52.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that it is important to
understand the ideology but it's
also important for a

11:52.912 --> 11:57.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lot of Western recruits the
sense that they are part of
winning team that this

11:57.116 --> 12:02.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a successful ever expanding
project that's how it seemed
last year and it

12:02.121 --> 12:06.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hasn't seemed like that for a
number of months and this kind
of attack is almost

12:06.526 --> 12:10.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
diverting attention from some of
the problems that Isis is
happening in Iraq

12:10.663 --> 12:16.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Syria and for that reason it
is very important for ice is to
have a us-

12:16.102 --> 12:18.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
officials in the past have been
saying that their fight against
racist might

12:18.972 --> 12:22.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
take some patients in
might take some time

12:22.141 --> 12:26.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opinion is this a fight that can
be hastened I think it's very
dangerous to

12:26.346 --> 12:29.782 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
try to hasten it
too much I think

12:29.782 --> 12:34.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
contrary to what everyone says
the campaign that has been going
on in Iraq

12:34.187 --> 12:38.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and Syria has not been
altogether unsuccessful it has
contained the

12:38.291 --> 12:42.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Islamic state it has taken away
the notion of it as a successful

12:42.962 --> 12:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
organization in its core Tier
tree and if you want to hasten
it of course

12:47.600 --> 12:51.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
America can basically bomb the
whole place but the question
then becomes what

12:51.704 --> 12:56.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happens the day after that you
have to bring ice is down in a
way that it

12:56.843 --> 13:01.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually implodes that's the
only way in which you can have a
sustainable end to

13:01.981 --> 13:06.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Isis there's obviously been a
connection made in the last few
days between the

13:06.753 --> 13:10.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
refugees coming into Europe and
these attacks and obviously
we're torn between

13:10.923 --> 13:15.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a humanitarian disaster going on
that is sending all these people
into Europe and

13:15.094 --> 13:19.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then fears now people very real
fears of a more attacks
happening how do you see

13:19.599 --> 13:25.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that tension playing out it's
incredibly dangerous the
important thing to

13:25.038 --> 13:29.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
remember about terrorism is it
is always about not only about
killing people it's

13:29.742 --> 13:33.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also about creating a political
effect if the political effect
of these attacks

13:33.946 --> 13:40.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is that in the medium term
European societies are becoming
more polarized at

13:40.186 --> 13:44.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the far right which is already
strong a lot of countries is
trying to capitalize

13:44.023 --> 13:49.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on that is trying to merge the
refugee issue with the terrorism
is to you

13:49.962 --> 13:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the effect on european societies
could be terrible they could
even question the

13:54.233 --> 13:58.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
idea that people of different
faiths ethnicities can live
peacefully together

13:58.805 --> 14:03.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Europe so I do think we are
at a fragile moment here in
Europe and we

14:03.910 --> 14:07.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have to be really careful or I

I strongly oppose

with her on how high the federal
minimum wage should

16:06.232 --> 16:11.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

say that if somebody works 40

PolitiFact dot org

16:25.318 --> 16:28.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
let's start with the assertion
by Vermont senator Bernie
Sanders about

16:28.855 --> 16:33.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
today's income tax rates
compared to where they were back
in the fifties he

16:33.059 --> 16:37.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was asked how high he would
raise the top rate and here's
what Center said we

16:37.096 --> 16:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have to come up with an exact
number yet but will not be as
high

16:40.433 --> 16:49.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the number under dwight D
eisenhower which was ninety
percent but much of the

16:49.008 --> 16:53.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
socialist compared to high
school seniors got a lot of last
for that but

16:53.813 --> 16:57.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm how did that fact check out
ninety percent tax rate under
eisenhower is

16:57.350 --> 17:02.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that right that is right we
rated it true now there are few
things to be said

17:02.321 --> 17:07.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about this first off we're
talking about marginal income
tax rates so this is the

17:07.994 --> 17:11.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tax rate that you a person's
last dollar of income is taxed
at during the

17:11.497 --> 17:13.599 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
eisenhower

17:13.599 --> 17:21.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
days the tax rates were not high
92% and it was on people who
made quite a bit of

17:21.374 --> 17:24.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
money in that time when we
adjusted for inflation we're
talking about people

17:24.977 --> 17:32.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being taxed at over 1.7 million
dollars of income so if you
compare that to

17:32.285 --> 17:35.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people earning equivalent amount
today what would what kind of
numbers are we

17:35.988 --> 17:40.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talking about for today's today
the top tax bracket is about
thirty nine point

17:40.693 --> 17:45.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
six and four individuals it's
people who make just over four
hundred and thirteen

17:45.264 --> 17:49.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thousand dollars so it's a
little bit different than today
as they were higher

17:49.368 --> 17:54.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then ok so true for senator
Sanders there let's listen next
to him something

17:54.440 --> 17:58.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
former Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton said about
stagnant american

17:58.311 --> 18:02.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wages I have made very clear
that hard-working middle-class
families need

18:02.181 --> 18:04.417 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a raise

18:04.417 --> 18:10.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not a tax increase in fact wages
adjusted for inflation haven't
risen

18:10.122 --> 18:14.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since the turn of the last
century you and your colleagues
rated this as only

18:14.961 --> 18:19.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
half true why is that right well
literally when we looked at the

18:19.865 --> 18:24.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government statistics she wasn't
quite right the median weekly
wages now about

18:24.637 --> 18:29.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
three hundred and forty dollars
a week back in 1999 there were
three hundred

18:29.342 --> 18:34.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and fifteen dollars a week so
there's been a slight increase
however we didn't

18:34.146 --> 18:38.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say she's completely wrong
because this is a real trend of
wages stagnating

18:38.651 --> 18:42.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since the nineteen seventies she
would have been better off if
she'd widened

18:42.154 --> 18:46.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her time frame a little bit and
the other thing is the increase
that we've

18:46.158 --> 18:51.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seen since 1999 is very small so
we gave her a half true on this
so stagnant

18:51.897 --> 18:53.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
maybe not the best

18:53.866 --> 18:57.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
adjectives to be using for this
yet barely budged or maybe a
very small

18:57.903 --> 19:01.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
increase it was a small increase
and there's a real problem with
wage

19:01.240 --> 19:07.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stagnation over many decades ok
great so finally former governor
of Maryland

19:07.146 --> 19:11.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
martin O'Malley he takes a shot
at Donald Trump and then he
dared

19:11.384 --> 19:14.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
journalists to come out and
check one of his statements
about Mexican immigration

19:14.887 --> 19:18.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
let's listen to what he said the
fact of the matter is and let's
say it in our

19:18.257 --> 19:22.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debate because you'll never hear
this from that immigrant bashing
carnival

19:22.862 --> 19:28.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
barker donald trump the truth of
the matter is the truth of the
matter is

19:28.534 --> 19:34.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that immigration from Mexico
last year was he wrote back
check me go ahead

19:34.206 --> 19:36.809 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
check it out

19:36.809 --> 19:43.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ok he did you net immigration
last year from Mexico was zero
that true berated

19:43.282 --> 19:49.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it mostly true now there is
uncertainty when he says net
immigration what we're

19:49.622 --> 19:54.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talking about are the people who
came from Mexico minus all the
people who

19:54.527 --> 20:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
left the United States its
arrivals minus departures now we
don't have a

20:00.166 --> 20:04.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
direct measure of this we have
some indirect measures that kind
of tell us

20:04.303 --> 20:10.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where the situation might be and
mostly thats by estimating the
population of

20:10.009 --> 20:15.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people in the United States who
were born in Mexico now that
number has been

20:15.081 --> 20:21.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
flat for many years there was a
tiny uptick last year but it's
not clear that

20:21.287 --> 20:26.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that means that that overall
trend has has stopped at very
low numbers of

20:26.559 --> 20:32.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immigration basically it's it's
kind of staying flat when you do
that arrivals

20:32.098 --> 20:38.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vs departures so we said he was
mostly true experts we spoke
with said yes

20:38.104 --> 20:42.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immigration is just for mexico
is staying flat but again
there's some

20:42.475 --> 20:46.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
uncertainty it's complicated how
they measure it alright in Gijon
from

20:46.579 --> 20:57.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
