00:18.118 --> 00:20.087

00:20.087 --> 00:21.822
A NEW STUDY SHOWS JUST HOW MANY

00:21.822 --> 00:23.090
SCHOOLCHILDREN ACROSS THE

00:23.090 --> 00:25.192
COUNTRY ARE GROWING UP POOR.

AND IN OUR SIGNATURE SEGMENT, AN

00:26.693 --> 00:28.428
AMBITIOUS PROGRAM TO COUNT ALL

00:30.697 --> 00:32.299
>> YOU CAN'T FIGHT A WAR TO SAVE

00:32.299 --> 00:34.134
SOMETHING IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW

PRESIDENT OBAMA REPORTEDLY WILL

00:47.648 --> 00:48.815
UNVEIL A PLAN TO OFFER TAX

00:48.815 --> 00:50.150

DURING HIS STATE OF THE UNION

00:51.151 --> 00:52.819

00:55.055 --> 00:56.390
INVESTMENTS AND INHERITED

00:56.390 --> 00:57.925
PROPERTY.

00:57.925 --> 00:59.559
FOR MORE ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S

00:59.559 --> 01:01.295
PROPOSAL, ITS CHANCES OF SUCCESS

01:01.295 --> 01:02.996
AND ITS POLITICAL IMPACT, WE ARE

01:02.996 --> 01:04.197
JOINED NOW FROM WASHINGTON BY

01:04.197 --> 01:05.032
CAROL LEE.

01:05.032 --> 01:06.466
SHE IS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT

01:06.466 --> 01:11.838
FOR THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL."

01:11.838 --> 01:13.206
>> DOES THE ADMINISTRATION

01:13.206 --> 01:13.974
SAY THAT THIS WILL HELP AND

01:13.974 --> 01:14.541
HOW?

01:14.541 --> 01:17.611
>> THEIR MAIN TARGET IS THE

01:17.611 --> 01:18.979
MIDDLE CLASS.

01:18.979 --> 01:21.148
AND THEY-- THEIR ARGUMENT IS

01:21.148 --> 01:23.483
THAT IT WILL HELP THE MIDDLE

01:23.483 --> 01:26.753
CLASS BY TAKING-- CLOSING

01:26.753 --> 01:28.055
CERTAIN TAX LOOPHOLES THAT

01:28.055 --> 01:30.824
THEY SAY BENEFIT THE TOP 1%

01:30.824 --> 01:32.526
OF AMERICANS AND MAKING

01:32.526 --> 01:33.961
DIFFERENT CHANGES TO THE TAX

01:33.961 --> 01:35.329
CODE INCLUDING RAISING THE

01:35.329 --> 01:38.732
CAPITAL GAINS TAX FROM 23.8%

01:38.732 --> 01:43.670
TO 28% BY, AS YOU MENTIONED,

01:43.670 --> 01:45.439
TAXING SOME OF THESE

01:45.439 --> 01:47.307
INVESTMENTS AND ASSETS THAT

01:47.307 --> 01:49.609
PEOPLE TRANSFER TO THEIR

01:49.609 --> 01:51.378
CHILDREN, THAT CURRENTLY ARE

01:51.378 --> 01:52.379
NOT TAXED.

01:52.379 --> 01:53.313
AND A NUMBER OF OTHER

01:53.313 --> 01:54.081
THINGS.

01:54.081 --> 01:55.449
AND WHAT THEY WOULD DO WITH

01:55.449 --> 01:57.317
THAT MONEY WHICH IS ROUGHLY

01:57.317 --> 01:58.385
SEVERAL HUNDRED BILLION

01:58.385 --> 02:00.554
DOLLARS, IS PUT IT TOWARDS

02:00.554 --> 02:01.955
PROPOSALS SUCH AS TRIPLING

02:01.955 --> 02:03.590
THE CHILD TAX CREDIT, SO

02:03.590 --> 02:05.993
THAT WOULD GO FROM 1,000 TO

02:05.993 --> 02:06.994
$3,000.

02:06.994 --> 02:08.362
THEY'RE PROPOSING TO CREATE

02:08.362 --> 02:10.998
A NEW TAX CREDIT FOR

02:10.998 --> 02:12.366
HOUSEHOLDS WHERE BOTH

02:12.366 --> 02:14.468
SPOUSES WORK.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.703
AND IF THE PRESIDENT HAS

02:16.703 --> 02:18.271
UNVEILED A PROPOSAL TO OFFER

02:18.271 --> 02:19.639
FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR

02:19.639 --> 02:20.741
FOLKS AND THAT'S ANOTHER

02:20.741 --> 02:22.376
THING THAT THIS WOULD PAY

02:22.376 --> 02:23.377
FOR.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.512
SO IT'S BASICALLY THE

02:25.512 --> 02:26.713
PRESIDENT'S OPENING BID ON A

02:26.713 --> 02:28.215
NUMBER OF TAX ISSUES THAT

02:28.215 --> 02:29.816
HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING

02:29.816 --> 02:31.518
WASHINGTON FOR A LONG TIME.

02:31.518 --> 02:33.754
AND SO FAR IT HAS NOT GOTTEN

02:33.754 --> 02:35.455
A VERY WARM RECEPTION FROM

02:35.455 --> 02:36.456
REPUBLICANS.

02:36.456 --> 02:37.624
BUT THE WHITE HOUSE'S

02:37.624 --> 02:39.259
ARGUMENT IS THAT THIS WOULD

02:39.259 --> 02:41.695
HELP THE MIDDLE CLASS, THE

02:41.695 --> 02:42.329
REPUBLICANS SAY THAT THEY

02:42.329 --> 02:44.498
ARE NO FOCUSED ON THE MIDDLE

02:44.498 --> 02:45.132
CLASS.

02:45.132 --> 02:46.800
THE ECONOMY IS DOING BETTER

02:46.800 --> 02:48.502
SO NOW'S THE TIME TO DO

02:48.502 --> 02:49.870
THINGS, TAKE STEPS LIKE

02:49.870 --> 02:50.470
THIS.

02:50.470 --> 02:52.305
AND WILE CONCEDING THAT THEY

02:52.305 --> 02:53.006
PROBABLY WON'T GET

02:53.006 --> 02:56.209
EVERYTHING THAT THEY WANT,

02:56.209 --> 02:58.045
WHICH IS A VERY OPTIMISTIC

02:58.045 --> 02:59.379
VIEW OF THIS PACKAGE GIVEN

02:59.379 --> 03:00.747
THE RESPONSE THAT WE'VE SEEN

03:00.747 --> 03:01.848
FROM REPUBLICANS, THE HOPE

03:01.848 --> 03:04.051
IS THAT THIS IS AN OPENING

03:04.051 --> 03:06.019
BID TO WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE

03:06.019 --> 03:07.287
HOPES ARE BROADER

03:07.287 --> 03:08.388
NEGOTIATIONS ON SOME OF

03:08.388 --> 03:09.656
THESE INDIVIDUAL TAX CODE

03:09.656 --> 03:10.290
ISSUES.

03:10.290 --> 03:11.124
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT SO,

03:11.124 --> 03:13.126
WHAT ARE THE POLITICAL

03:13.126 --> 03:14.294
IMPLICATIONS EVEN IF IT

03:14.294 --> 03:15.862
CAN'T GET THROUGH CONGRESS?

03:15.862 --> 03:17.297
>> WELL, IT SEPTEMBERS THE

03:17.297 --> 03:20.033
PARAMETERS OF THE DEBATE FOR

03:20.033 --> 03:22.035
2015 WHICH IS TURNING INTO

03:22.035 --> 03:22.702
2016.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.137
AND THE TWO THINGS THAT THE

03:24.137 --> 03:25.772
PARTIES HAVE AGREED ON, YOU

03:25.772 --> 03:27.274
HAVE SEEN THIS IN A NUMBER

03:27.274 --> 03:28.909
OF POTENTIAL REPUBLICAN

03:28.909 --> 03:30.277
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES,

03:30.277 --> 03:31.812
YOU'VE HEARD IT FROM FORMER

03:31.812 --> 03:33.747
SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY

03:33.747 --> 03:35.182
CLINTON AND THE WHITE HOUSE

03:35.182 --> 03:37.284
IS REALLY PRESSING ON THIS

03:37.284 --> 03:39.086
ISSUE, IS THAT THE MIDDLE

03:39.086 --> 03:41.221
CLASS IS IN NEED OF HELP.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.090
AND THAT WAGES ARE STAGNANT.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.625
AND WHILE GDP IS GROWING AND

03:45.625 --> 03:47.394
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS AT NEW

03:47.394 --> 03:48.795
LOWS, THE MIDDLE CLASS IS

03:48.795 --> 03:50.797
STILL REALLY STRUGGLING AND

03:50.797 --> 03:52.332
REQUIRES SOME TARGETED

03:52.332 --> 03:53.600
MEASURES TO TRY AND BUILD

03:53.600 --> 03:54.601
THEM UP.

03:54.601 --> 03:56.303
AND SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO

03:56.303 --> 03:57.704
HEAR THE WHITE HOUSE AND

03:57.704 --> 03:59.039
DEMOCRATS DO WHEN THEY GET

03:59.039 --> 04:00.507
WITH THESE MEASURES, THE

04:00.507 --> 04:01.174
PACKAGE THAT THE PRESIDENT

04:01.174 --> 04:02.876
IS GOING TO ROLL OUT ON

04:02.876 --> 04:04.244
TUESDAY IN THE STATE OF THE

04:04.244 --> 04:05.312
UNION ADDRESS IS PUT THE

04:05.312 --> 04:06.346
BALL IN REPUBLICAN'S COURT

04:06.346 --> 04:08.215
TO SAY OKAY, WELL, WHAT ARE

04:08.215 --> 04:09.816
YOUR PROPOSALS, WHAT DO YOU

04:09.816 --> 04:10.484
WANT TO DO.

04:10.484 --> 04:11.518
AND IF YOU DON'T SUPPORT

04:11.518 --> 04:13.220
THIS, WHAT DO YOU SUPPORT.

04:13.220 --> 04:14.921
AND SO IT'S DESIGNED TO,

04:14.921 --> 04:16.289
EVEN IF IT DOESN'T PASS,

04:16.289 --> 04:18.091
MOVE THE DEBATE ALONG TO

04:18.091 --> 04:19.392
WHERE THE TWO SIDES ARE

04:19.392 --> 04:21.094
HAVING TO STAKEOUT THEIR

04:21.094 --> 04:23.130
TERRITORY THAT HEAD OF THE

04:23.130 --> 04:23.763
2016 ELECTION.

04:23.763 --> 04:24.831
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

THANK YOU SO MUCH.

04:28.935 --> 04:35.375
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

04:35.375 --> 04:36.710

04:36.710 --> 04:37.744
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS SAY

04:37.744 --> 04:39.713
MULTIPLE SHOTS WERE FIRED LAST

04:39.713 --> 04:41.114
NIGHT OUTSIDE THE DELAWARE HOME

04:41.114 --> 04:42.482

04:42.482 --> 04:43.617
NEITHER THE VICE PRESIDENT NOR

04:43.617 --> 04:44.518
HIS WIFE WERE HOME AT THE TIME

04:44.518 --> 04:45.118
OF THE INCIDENT.

04:45.118 --> 04:45.952
AUTHORITIES SAY THE VEHICLE FROM

04:45.952 --> 04:46.753
WHICH THE SHOTS CAME RACED AWAY

04:46.753 --> 04:47.521
BEFORE ANYONE COULD BE

04:47.521 --> 04:48.355
APPREHENDED.

04:48.355 --> 04:49.389
THE BIDENS' HOME IS SET BACK A

04:49.389 --> 04:50.891
FEW HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE ROAD.

04:50.891 --> 04:51.858
IN DRESDEN GERMANY, AN ANTI-

IMMIGRATION GROUP KNOWN AS

04:52.959 --> 04:53.793
PATRIOTIC EUROPEANS AGAINST

ISLAMIZATION OF THE WEST CALLED

05:08.642 --> 05:10.243
THREATS TO KILL AN ENEMY OF

05:12.879 --> 05:14.514
THE THREAT WAS CONVEYED IN

05:14.514 --> 05:16.216
ARABIC ON A TWITTER POST.

05:16.216 --> 05:17.717
RECENT ANTI-IMMIGRATION RALLIES

05:17.717 --> 05:18.985
THERE HAVE DRAWN AS MANY AS

05:18.985 --> 05:20.687
25,000 DEMONSTRATORS.

05:20.687 --> 05:22.489
IN IRAQ TODAY, ISIS FREED AT

05:24.858 --> 05:26.893
INFIRMED PRISONERS ITS FIGHTERS

05:26.893 --> 05:28.395

05:28.395 --> 05:30.864
THE GROUP DID NOT EXPLAIN ITS

05:30.864 --> 05:32.566
DECISION.

05:32.566 --> 05:33.833
THOSE RELEASED WERE YAZIDIS, A

05:33.833 --> 05:35.402
MINORITY RELIGIOUS GROUP THAT

05:35.402 --> 05:37.003
REGULARLY HAS BEEN TARGETED BY

05:37.003 --> 05:38.338
THE EXTREMISTS.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.639
AS YOU'LL RECALL, THOUSANDS OF

05:39.639 --> 05:40.640
YAZIDIS WERE STRANDED ON A

05:40.640 --> 05:42.309
MOUNTAIN LAST SUMMER AFTER ISIS

05:42.309 --> 05:43.343
SWEPT INTO IRAQ FROM SYRIA.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.477
ISRAEL HAS LAUNCHED ANOTHER

05:44.477 --> 05:45.645
ATTACK INSIDE SYRIA.

05:45.645 --> 05:47.514
ISRAELI MILITARY SOURCES CONFIRM

05:47.514 --> 05:49.382
THAT AN ISRAELI HELICOPTER FIRED

05:49.382 --> 05:50.817
MISSILES AT A CONVOY TRAVELING

05:50.817 --> 05:52.185
NEAR THE GOLAN HEIGHTS.

REPORTEDLY WERE KILLED.

05:55.922 --> 05:57.457
JUST DAYS AGO, A LEBANESE

05:57.457 --> 05:58.825
HEZBOLLAH LEADER SAID HE

05:58.825 --> 06:00.660
CONSIDERS ISRAELI STRIKES IN

06:00.660 --> 06:02.195
SYRIA AGGRESSION AND SAID SYRIA

06:02.195 --> 06:03.797
AND ITS ALLIES HAVE THE RIGHT TO

06:03.797 --> 06:05.232
RETALIATE.

06:05.232 --> 06:06.800
ISRAEL HAS STRUCK SYRIA SEVERAL

06:06.800 --> 06:08.201
TIMES SINCE THE START OF THE

06:08.201 --> 06:09.402
CIVIL WAR THERE, THE ISRAELI

06:09.402 --> 06:10.437
GOVERNMENT SAYS IT IS PART OF

06:10.437 --> 06:11.438
THEIR EFFORT TO KEEP ARMS FROM

06:11.438 --> 06:12.973
REACHING HEZBOLLAH FIGHTERS.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.941
POPE FRANCIS WRAPPED UP A WEEK-

06:17.744 --> 06:18.945
MILLIONS OF WORSHIPPERS WHO

06:18.945 --> 06:20.113
TURNED OUT IN MANILA DESPITE A

06:20.113 --> 06:21.748
STEADY RAIN.

06:21.748 --> 06:22.849
THE PONTIFF SAID FAMILIES NEED

06:22.849 --> 06:24.618
TO BE PROTECTED FROM PROGRAMS HE

06:24.618 --> 06:27.921
DESCRIBED AS BEING CONTRARY TO

06:27.921 --> 06:30.457
ALL THAT WE HOLD TRUE AND

06:30.457 --> 06:31.591
SACRED.

06:31.591 --> 06:33.260
AN APPARENT REFERENCE TO A 2012

06:33.260 --> 06:34.894
LAW THAT MADE BIRTH CONTROL MORE

06:34.894 --> 06:36.663
AVAILABLE IN THE PHILIPPINES.

06:36.663 --> 06:38.231
FIGHTING ONCE AGAIN IS

06:38.231 --> 06:39.733
INTENSIFYING IN UKRAINE, DESPITE

06:39.733 --> 06:40.967
A CEASE-FIRE BETWEEN THE

06:40.967 --> 06:42.235
GOVERNMENT AND PRO-RUSSIAN

06:42.235 --> 06:43.436
REBELS THAT WENT INTO EFFECT

06:43.436 --> 06:44.738
LAST SEPTEMBER.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.239
OVERNIGHT, GOVERNMENT TROOPS

06:46.239 --> 06:47.507
LAUNCHED AN OFFENSIVE AND

06:47.507 --> 06:48.541
AFTERWARDS SAID THEY HAD

06:48.541 --> 06:49.876
REGAINED CONTROL OF MOST OF THE

06:49.876 --> 06:51.244
AIRPORT IN THE PROVINCIAL

06:51.244 --> 06:52.879
CAPITAL, DONETSK.

06:52.879 --> 06:54.481
REBELS HAD MADE GAINS THERE IN

06:54.481 --> 06:58.051
RECENT WEEKS.

06:58.051 --> 07:01.121

SAYS NEARLY 5,000 PEOPLE HAVE

07:02.022 --> 07:03.923
BEEN KILLED SINCE FIGHTING BEGAN

07:03.923 --> 07:05.925
IN EASTERN UKRAINE IN EARLY

07:05.925 --> 07:12.565
2014.

07:12.565 --> 07:14.267
A PROMINENT NORTH KOREAN

07:14.267 --> 07:15.435
DEFECTOR HAS ADMITTED THAT PARTS

07:15.435 --> 07:16.269
OF HIS ACCOUNT ABOUT LIFE IN A

07:16.269 --> 07:17.270
LABOR CAMP THERE WERE

07:17.270 --> 07:18.738
INACCURATE.

07:18.738 --> 07:19.606
SHIN DONG HYUK WAS THE SUBJECT

07:19.606 --> 07:20.440
OF A BEST-SELLING BOOK AND

07:24.911 --> 07:25.879
TORTURED IN PRISON AND DESCRIBED

07:25.879 --> 07:26.579
HIS HARROWING ESCAPE.

07:26.579 --> 07:27.414
SHIN IS STICKING TO THE BROAD

07:27.414 --> 07:28.181
OUTLINE OF HIS EARLIER ACCOUNTS,

07:28.181 --> 07:29.182
BUT HE NOW ADMITS THAT THE TIME

07:29.182 --> 07:29.949
AND LOCATION OF CERTAIN EVENTS

07:29.949 --> 07:30.650
WERE INCORRECT.

07:30.650 --> 07:31.751
TODAY HE POSTED A MESSAGE ON

07:31.751 --> 07:33.186
FACEBOOK TO APOLOGIZE AND WROTE,

07:33.186 --> 07:34.020
"EVERY ONE OF US HAVE STORIES OR

07:34.020 --> 07:36.289
THINGS WE'D LIKE TO HIDE."

07:36.289 --> 07:37.757
BACK IN THIS COUNTRY, THE

07:37.757 --> 07:39.125
FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION

07:39.125 --> 07:40.560
HAS SUSPENDED A PROGRAM WHICH

07:40.560 --> 07:41.728
HAD ALLOWED SAFETY INSPECTORS TO

07:41.728 --> 07:42.696
SKIP SECURITY CHECKPOINTS WHILE

07:42.696 --> 07:43.963
ON THE JOB.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.598
THE DECISION FOLLOWS TUESDAY'S

07:45.598 --> 07:46.933
ARREST OF AN FAA AGENT AT NEW

07:46.933 --> 07:48.802
YORK CITY'S LAGUARDIA AIRPORT.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.004
HE HAD CARRIED A FIREARM IN HIS

07:51.004 --> 07:52.706
CARRY-ON BAG AFTER BYPASSING

INVESTMENT BY VENTURE

07:59.079 --> 08:00.246
CAPITALISTS INTO START-UPS IS

08:00.246 --> 08:01.381
SURGING.

08:01.381 --> 08:03.049
MEASURED BY DOLLARS, IT WAS UP

08:03.049 --> 08:03.917
61% LAST YEAR OVER 2013.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.185
THIS, ACCORDING TO A SURVEY BY

08:05.185 --> 08:06.019
THE NATIONAL VENTURE CAPITAL

08:06.019 --> 08:07.454
ASSOCIATION AND PRICEWATERHOUSE.

08:07.454 --> 08:09.356
THE SINGLE BIGGEST BENEFICIARY

08:09.356 --> 08:11.458
WAS UBER, WHICH USES A MOBILE

08:11.458 --> 08:12.459
APP TO CONNECT DRIVERS AND

08:12.459 --> 08:13.927
PASSENGERS.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.795
THE COMPANY NOW COMPETES WITH

08:15.795 --> 08:17.063
STANDARD TAXI SERVICE IN MORE

08:17.063 --> 08:18.531
THAN 200 CITIES AROUND THE

08:18.531 --> 08:19.766
UNITED STATES AND OVERSEAS.

08:19.766 --> 08:21.401
ALL TOLD, ESTIMATES ARE THAT

08:21.401 --> 08:22.869
VENTURE CAPITALISTS PUMPED MORE

08:22.869 --> 08:24.337
THAN $48 BILLION INTO STARTUPS

08:24.337 --> 08:26.139
LAST YEAR.

08:26.139 --> 08:27.674
NUMBERS NOT SEEN SINCE 2000, THE

08:27.674 --> 08:32.512
TAIL END OF THE DOT-COM BOOM.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.114
AND MORE THAN 50 YEARS AFTER

THIS MONTH.

08:44.758 --> 08:45.992
IN AN ACT OF DEFIANCE, MOST OF

08:45.992 --> 08:47.260
THOSE CONVICTED FOR THEIR SIT-IN

08:47.260 --> 08:50.163
CHOSE TO WORK ON A CHAIN GANG AT

08:50.163 --> 08:51.197
A COUNTY PRISON FARM RATHER THAN

08:51.197 --> 09:00.106
PAY A FINE.

09:00.106 --> 09:02.041
>> Sreenivasan: A NEWLY RELEASED

09:02.041 --> 09:03.376
REPORT BY THE SOUTHERN EDUCATION

09:03.376 --> 09:05.211
FOUNDATION SAYS A MAJORITY OF

09:05.211 --> 09:06.980
ALL PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS

09:06.980 --> 09:08.915
ACROSS THE UNITED STATES COME

09:08.915 --> 09:10.550
FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.885
EXPERTS SAY THAT COULD HAVE

09:11.885 --> 09:13.520
IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE

09:13.520 --> 09:14.721
NATION. FOR MORE ABOUT THAT, WE

09:14.721 --> 09:15.889
ARE JOINED NOW FROM WASHINGTON

09:15.889 --> 09:18.425
BY LYNDSEY LAYTON.

09:18.425 --> 09:19.559
SHE COVERED THE STORY FOR "THE

09:19.559 --> 09:21.161
WASHINGTON POST."

09:21.161 --> 09:22.162
SOUFER THE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN

09:22.162 --> 09:23.196
GETTING WORSE OVER NUMBER,

09:23.196 --> 09:23.596
RIGHT.

09:23.596 --> 09:25.031
TEN YEARS AGO IT WAS ONLY

09:25.031 --> 09:26.766
FOUR STATES THAT HAVE MORE

09:26.766 --> 09:28.468
THAN HALF THEIR POPULATION,

09:28.468 --> 09:29.536
SCHOOLCHILDREN POPULATIONS

09:29.536 --> 09:31.237
QUALIFY FOR FREE OR REDUCED

09:31.237 --> 09:33.973
LUNCHES, NOW IT'S 21 STATES.

09:33.973 --> 09:35.675
>> THAT'S RIGHT, HARI, WE'VE

09:35.675 --> 09:37.777
SEEN A REALLY RAPID

09:37.777 --> 09:38.745
ACCELERATION IN THIS GROUP

09:38.745 --> 09:39.479
OF KIDS.

09:39.479 --> 09:41.181
AND OF COURSE, YOU KNOW,

09:41.181 --> 09:43.216
PEOPLE POINT TO THE 2008

09:43.216 --> 09:44.584
RECESSION AS SOMETHING THAT

09:44.584 --> 09:45.952
REALLY MADE THESE NUMBERS

09:45.952 --> 09:46.619
EXPLODE.

09:46.619 --> 09:48.455
BUT WE'VE SEEN CONTINUED

09:48.455 --> 09:49.055
ACCELERATION.

09:49.055 --> 09:50.757
IT HASN'T STABILIZED.

09:50.757 --> 09:51.724
IT'S GETTING WORSE.

09:51.724 --> 09:53.827
AND NOW WE'RE AT 51%.

09:53.827 --> 09:56.429
SO A MAJORITY OF PUBLIC

09:56.429 --> 09:57.997
SCHOOLKIDS QUALIFY FOR FREE

09:57.997 --> 09:59.132
FOOD.

09:59.132 --> 09:59.899
>> Sreenivasan: SO WHAT ARE

09:59.899 --> 10:00.967
SOME OF THE OTHER STRAINS ON

10:00.967 --> 10:01.367
THE SYSTEM.

10:01.367 --> 10:02.669
IN YOUR STORY I REMEMBER

10:02.669 --> 10:03.703
SEEING THAT BASICALLY

10:03.703 --> 10:04.437
TEACHERS ARE STARTING TO ACT

10:04.437 --> 10:05.805
MORE THAN JUST TEACHERS,

10:05.805 --> 10:07.507
THEY ARE SOCIAL WORKERS,

10:07.507 --> 10:08.541
THEY'RE PSYCHOLOGISTS.

10:08.541 --> 10:10.510
>> WELL, IF YOU TALK TO ANY

10:10.510 --> 10:12.378
TEACHER IN A HIGH-POVERTY

10:12.378 --> 10:13.646
SCHOOL, THEY WILL TELL YOU

10:13.646 --> 10:15.748
THAT THEY SPEND A HUGE

10:15.748 --> 10:17.784
AMOUNT OF THEIR TIME JUST

10:17.784 --> 10:19.285
MAKING SURE THE KIDS ARE

10:19.285 --> 10:19.819
OKAY.

10:19.819 --> 10:22.622
I MEAN THESE KIDS DON'T COME

10:22.622 --> 10:24.557
INTO SCHOOL WONDERING AM I

10:24.557 --> 10:25.925
GOING TO TAKE A TEST TODAY.

10:25.925 --> 10:27.193
THEY COME INTO SCHOOL

10:27.193 --> 10:28.628
WONDERING AM I GOING TO BE

10:28.628 --> 10:28.995
OKAY.

10:28.995 --> 10:30.763
I TALKED WITH ONE

10:30.763 --> 10:32.131
KINDERGARTEN TEACHER, A

10:32.131 --> 10:33.399
VETERAN TEACHER FROM NEW

10:33.399 --> 10:33.900
MEXICO.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.535
SHE TEACHES IN DOWNTOWN

10:35.535 --> 10:35.935
ALBUQUERQUE.

10:35.935 --> 10:37.237
AND SHE TOLD ME THAT THE

10:37.237 --> 10:38.638
FIRST HOUR OF HER MORNING

10:38.638 --> 10:40.273
SHE DOES AN INVENTORY TO

10:40.273 --> 10:41.040
CHECKER KIDS.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.542
HAVE THEY EATEN, ARE THEY

10:42.542 --> 10:43.142
CLEAN.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.211
SHE KEEPS A DRAWER FULL OF

10:45.211 --> 10:46.913
SOCKS, SHOES, CLEAN

10:46.913 --> 10:48.948
UNDERWEAR, TOOTHBRUSHES FOR

10:48.948 --> 10:50.650
THEM, JUST TO TAKE CARE OF

10:50.650 --> 10:52.051
THEIR IMMEDIATE NEEDS.

10:52.051 --> 10:53.586
SHE CAN'T EVEN FOCUS ON THE

10:53.586 --> 10:54.554
ACADEMICS.

10:54.554 --> 10:55.555
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ARE

10:55.555 --> 10:57.156
SOME OF THE IMPACTS OR THE

10:57.156 --> 10:58.525
POTENTIAL IMPACTS FOR

10:58.525 --> 10:59.192
EDUCATION POLICY?

10:59.192 --> 11:00.627
I MEAN RIGHT NOW THERE IS A

11:00.627 --> 11:01.661
NATIONAL CONVERSATION GOING

11:01.661 --> 11:03.363
ABOUT TESTING AND WHETHER TO

11:03.363 --> 11:04.497
REAUTHORIZE NO CHILD LEFT

11:04.497 --> 11:05.498
BEHIND OR THE COMMON CORE,

11:05.498 --> 11:06.499
ET CETERA, ET CETERA.

11:06.499 --> 11:07.901
BUT HOW CAN WE REALLY FOCUS

11:07.901 --> 11:09.202
ON TESTS IF WHAT YOU ARE

11:09.202 --> 11:10.570
SAYING AND WHAT THIS TEACHER

11:10.570 --> 11:11.938
IS SAYING IS THAT YOU REALLY

11:11.938 --> 11:13.973
HAVE A DEEPER UNDERLYING

11:13.973 --> 11:14.641
PROBLEM.

11:14.641 --> 11:16.509
THE KIDS AREN'T GOING TO BE

11:16.509 --> 11:18.211
THINKING ABOUT TESTS IF THEY

11:18.211 --> 11:20.013
ARE THINKING ABOUT BEING

11:20.013 --> 11:20.847
HUNG REAL ESTATE.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.515
>> A LOT OF ADVOCATES FOR

11:22.515 --> 11:24.150
KIDS AND DEMOCRATS AND

11:24.150 --> 11:25.251
PROGRESSIVES WANT TO SEE

11:25.251 --> 11:26.619
MORE SPENDING TO CREATE WRAP

11:26.619 --> 11:28.021
AROUND SERVICES AROUND THESE

11:28.021 --> 11:28.354
KIDS.

11:28.354 --> 11:31.524
THAT THE SCHOOLS NOT ONLY

11:31.524 --> 11:32.258
NEED HELP WITH THE ACADEMICS

11:32.258 --> 11:33.760
WITH TECHNOLOGY AND

11:33.760 --> 11:34.527
CURRICULUM AND TEACHER

11:34.527 --> 11:36.195
TRAINING, BUT THEY ALSO NEED

11:36.195 --> 11:37.564
TO PROVIDE SOCIAL SERVICES

11:37.564 --> 11:38.831
FOR THESE CHILDREN.

11:38.831 --> 11:39.933
THAT'S THE ARGUMENT THAT A

11:39.933 --> 11:41.634
LOT OF PROGRESSIVES ARE

11:41.634 --> 11:42.302
MAKING.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.671
RIGHT NOW IN TOWN HERE THE

11:44.671 --> 11:47.040
CONGRESS IS ABOUT TO DEBATE

11:47.040 --> 11:49.275
THE REAUTHORIZATION OF THE

11:49.275 --> 11:51.210
MAIN FEDERAL EDUCATION LAW.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.246
AND REPUBLICANS THINK THAT

11:53.246 --> 11:54.547
PERHAPS WE'RE JUST NOT

11:54.547 --> 11:55.848
SPENDING OUR MONEY

11:55.848 --> 11:56.649
EFFICIENTLY.

11:56.649 --> 11:58.351
AND THAT IF STATES HAD MORE

11:58.351 --> 12:00.320
AUTHORITY AND MORE POWER IN

12:00.320 --> 12:01.721
THEIR SPENDING, THAT THE

12:01.721 --> 12:04.123
MONEY WOULD GO TO, YOU KNOW,

12:04.123 --> 12:05.291
THE GREATEST NEEDS.

12:05.291 --> 12:07.193
AND THAT WE NEED TO

12:07.193 --> 12:08.895
STREAMLINE SPENDING AND GIVE

12:08.895 --> 12:10.630
MORE AUTHORITY TO STATES.

12:10.630 --> 12:11.998
THERE'S A REAL DEBATE GOING

12:11.998 --> 12:13.366
ON ABOUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT

12:13.366 --> 12:14.400
THIS PROBLEM.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.568
>> Sreenivasan: ARE THERE

12:15.568 --> 12:17.036
PATTERNS THAT YOU SEE HERE

12:17.036 --> 12:18.137
EMERGING WHEN YOU LOOK AT

12:18.137 --> 12:19.205
THE DATA AROUND THE COUNTRY

12:19.205 --> 12:21.341
OR CERTAIN PARTS HIT WORSE

12:21.341 --> 12:22.875
THAN OTHERS?

12:22.875 --> 12:24.377
>> ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS

12:24.377 --> 12:25.845
GLANCE AT THE MAP.

12:25.845 --> 12:26.646
IT'S AVAILABLE AT THE

12:26.646 --> 12:27.180

FOUNDATION WEB SITE AND ALSO

12:28.114 --> 12:30.116
AT THE "WASHINGTON POST".

12:30.116 --> 12:31.584
YOU JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THAT

12:31.584 --> 12:33.252
MAP AND YOU CAN SEE THE RED

12:33.252 --> 12:34.654
AREAS WHERE YOU'VE GOT THE

12:34.654 --> 12:36.356
HIGH CONCENTRATION OF POOR

12:36.356 --> 12:38.224
KIDS, IT'S OBVIOUSLY THE

12:38.224 --> 12:39.759
SOUTH AND IT'S THE WEST.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.594
SO THOSE ARE, YOU KNOW,

12:41.594 --> 12:43.329
BORDER STATES WITH A LOT OF

12:43.329 --> 12:43.930
IMMIGRATION.

12:43.930 --> 12:44.864
THAT'S OBVIOUS.

12:44.864 --> 12:46.232
BUT THEN YOU ALSO SEE IN

12:46.232 --> 12:47.767
OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY

12:47.767 --> 12:51.037
WHERE YOU DON'T EXPECT THAT.

12:51.037 --> 12:52.405
VERMONT, FOR INSTANCE, ONE

12:52.405 --> 12:54.374
OUT OF EVERY THREE KIDS IN

12:54.374 --> 12:58.344
VERMONT HAS-- NEEDS FREE

12:58.344 --> 12:59.812
LUNCHES AND BREAKFAST.

12:59.812 --> 13:01.981
SO THE NEED IS GROWING.

13:01.981 --> 13:04.017
IT'S ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.653
AND BEYOND THE OBVIOUS

13:06.653 --> 13:08.788
ISSUES IN THE BORDER STATES,

13:08.788 --> 13:10.490
YOU CAN FIND IT ALL OVER THE

13:10.490 --> 13:10.823
PLACE.

13:31.711 --> 13:32.478
ABOUT THE GREAT DAMAGE POACHERS

13:32.478 --> 13:33.379
ARE INFLICTING ON AFRICA'S

13:33.379 --> 13:34.280
ELEPHANT POPULATION.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.281
THE BEST ESTIMATES ARE THAT TENS

13:35.281 --> 13:36.182
OF THOUSANDS OF ELEPHANTS ARE

13:36.182 --> 13:37.383

21:58.584 --> 22:00.119
ELEPHANT CENSUS.

22:00.119 --> 22:01.587
>> Reporter: AND THERE ARE MANY

22:01.587 --> 22:03.255
MORE COUNTRIES STILL TO BE

22:03.255 --> 22:07.259
COUNTED.

22:07.259 --> 22:12.364
>> Sreenivasan: HOW DO YOU COUNT

22:12.364 --> 22:15.301
ALL THE ELEPHANTS ON AN ENTIRE

22:15.301 --> 22:16.569
CONTINENT?

22:16.569 --> 22:17.369
GET AN INSIDE LOOK AT

22:17.369 --> 22:23.642
newshour.pbs.org.

22:23.642 --> 22:24.977
>> Sreenivasan: THERE IS NO

22:24.977 --> 22:26.278
SHORTAGE OF REPORTING ABOUT THE

22:26.278 --> 22:27.446
HEALTH DANGERS ASSOCIATED WITH

22:27.446 --> 22:28.280
OBESITY.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.315
BUT SCIENTISTS AT CAMBRIDGE

22:29.315 --> 22:30.416
UNIVERSITY IN ENGLAND FOLLOWED

22:30.416 --> 22:31.717
MORE THAN 300,000 PEOPLE OVER 12

22:31.717 --> 22:33.419
YEARS AND CONCLUDED THAT

22:33.419 --> 22:34.653
INACTIVITY ACTUALLY KILLS MORE

22:34.653 --> 22:35.621
PEOPLE.

22:35.621 --> 22:36.855
THE SOLUTION: WALK.

22:36.855 --> 22:38.224
BRISKLY.

22:38.224 --> 22:39.792
RICHARD MORGAN OF ITV REPORTS.

22:39.792 --> 22:42.261
FOR THIS 62 YEAR OLD WALKING IS

22:42.261 --> 22:44.830
A VITAL PART OF EVERYDAY LIFE.

22:44.830 --> 22:46.432
IN THE COMPANY OF HIS DOG

22:46.432 --> 22:48.434
CLEOPATRA, HE WALKS NEARLY TWO

22:48.434 --> 22:50.269
HOURS EACH DAY.

22:50.269 --> 22:51.870
AND HE TELLS ME, IT IS A HABIT

22:51.870 --> 22:53.739
THAT HE COULDN'T DO WITHOUT.

22:53.739 --> 22:55.174
>> AT MY AGE, STRENUOUS

22:55.174 --> 22:56.342
EXERCISE IS A BIT OUT OF THE

22:56.342 --> 22:57.610
QUESTION.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.245
BUT WALKING JUST, IT'S A

22:59.245 --> 23:02.314
PLEASURE AND IT KEEPS ME

23:02.314 --> 23:03.782
MOTIVATED.

23:03.782 --> 23:04.984
>> AND ACCORDING TO FIGURES

23:04.984 --> 23:06.719
OUT TODAY, WE WOULD ALL DO

23:06.719 --> 23:07.987
WELL TOO TAKE A LEAF OUT OF

23:07.987 --> 23:12.625
LEONARD'S BOOK.

23:12.625 --> 23:15.427
RESEARCHERS CLAIM OBESITY

23:15.427 --> 23:17.229
CAUSE 347,000 DEATHS ACROSS

23:17.229 --> 23:19.231
EUROPE IN 2008, BUT TWIST AS

23:19.231 --> 23:21.533
MANY, 667,000 DEATHS WERE

23:21.533 --> 23:22.968
PUT DOWN TO PHYSICAL

23:22.968 --> 23:25.671
INACTIVITY IT IT'S CLAIMED

23:25.671 --> 23:26.538
MODERATE EXERCISE EACH DAY

23:26.538 --> 23:28.807
CAN REDUCE THIS RISK BY 16

23:28.807 --> 23:31.477
TO 30%.

23:31.477 --> 23:32.878
THAT CAN MEAN AS LITTLE AS

23:32.878 --> 23:35.247
20 MINUTES OF BRISK WALKING.

23:35.247 --> 23:36.949
>> SOCIETY HAS CHANGED.

23:36.949 --> 23:38.317
WE'VE ENGINEERED PHYSICAL

23:38.317 --> 23:39.685
ACTIVITY OUT OF OUR EVERY

23:39.685 --> 23:40.352
DAY LIVES.

23:40.352 --> 23:42.154
WHAT WE FEED TO DO IS

23:42.154 --> 23:43.155
REVERSE THAT PROCESS.

23:43.155 --> 23:44.523
REENGINEER IT BACK IN.

23:44.523 --> 23:46.625
>> BACK IN THIS LONDON PARK,

23:46.625 --> 23:47.660
THOSE TAKING A STROLL SAID

23:47.660 --> 23:49.862
THEY HAD NO DOUBT ABOUT THE

23:49.862 --> 23:51.563
BENEFITS.

23:51.563 --> 23:54.266
>> I'M NOT GENERALLY A VERY

23:54.266 --> 23:54.867
SPORTY PERSON.

23:54.867 --> 23:59.204
BUT I LOVE WALKING THE DOG.

23:59.204 --> 24:00.572
>> YOU MOVE YOUR MUSCLES.

24:00.572 --> 24:02.007
>> I THINK EVERY NOW AND

24:02.007 --> 24:03.709
AGAIN IT'S GOOD TO BREAK A

24:03.709 --> 24:04.743
SWEAT BUT WALKING IS

24:04.743 --> 24:05.477
PROBABLY THE BEST.

24:05.477 --> 24:06.612
>> SO THE MESSAGE IS CLEAR,

24:06.612 --> 24:08.180
IF YOU WANT TO LIVE LONGER,

24:08.180 --> 24:09.548
GET YOUR TRAINERS ON,

24:09.548 --> 24:10.916
WHETHER OR NOT YOU'VE GOT A

24:10.916 --> 24:11.750
