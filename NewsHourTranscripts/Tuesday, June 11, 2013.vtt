THEY HIRED PEOPLE QUICKLY.

06:21.153 --> 06:22.851
THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD, AND

THEY HIRED PEOPLE QUICKLY.
AND THEN THEY GOT A
BOTTLENECK IN THOSE REVIEWS

06:24.886 --> 06:27.951
AND THEN THEY GOT A
BOTTLENECK IN THOSE REVIEWS
OF THEIR BACKGROUND AND THE

SO I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW,

06:40.588 --> 06:41.985
AND GIVEN OUT.
SO I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW,
THIS IS AN INCREASED RISK

THIS IS AN INCREASED RISK
WHEN YOU HIRE CONTRACTORS.

06:43.488 --> 06:45.019
THIS IS AN INCREASED RISK
WHEN YOU HIRE CONTRACTORS.
ON THE OTHER HAND, I THINK

06:45.021 --> 06:46.386
WHEN YOU HIRE CONTRACTORS.
ON THE OTHER HAND, I THINK
REALLY WHAT IT SHOWS, IS

06:46.388 --> 06:47.386
ON THE OTHER HAND, I THINK
REALLY WHAT IT SHOWS, IS
THAT THE GOVERNMENT STILL IS

06:47.387 --> 06:49.153
REALLY WHAT IT SHOWS, IS
THAT THE GOVERNMENT STILL IS
COMING TO GRIPS WITH ITS OWN

06:49.155 --> 06:49.953
THAT THE GOVERNMENT STILL IS
COMING TO GRIPS WITH ITS OWN
COMPUTER SYSTEMS.

06:49.955 --> 06:52.153
COMING TO GRIPS WITH ITS OWN
COMPUTER SYSTEMS.
ONE OF THE LARGEST NUMBER OF

COMPUTER SYSTEMS.
ONE OF THE LARGEST NUMBER OF
CONTRACTORS ARE IN THE FIELD

06:53.788 --> 06:55.619
ONE OF THE LARGEST NUMBER OF

FOR INSTANCE, WE HEARD EARLY
ON IN THIS SET, EVEN BEFORE
EDWARD SNOWDEN'S STORY HAD

07:53.225 --> 07:55.323
ON IN THIS SET, EVEN BEFORE
EDWARD SNOWDEN'S STORY HAD
COME OUT, THE LEAKS IT

PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE
TRYING TO DO THIS KIND OF
THING.

08:09.992 --> 08:11.825
TRYING TO DO THIS KIND OF
THING.
AND SO THERE ARE A LOT OF

08:11.827 --> 08:13.058
THING.
AND SO THERE ARE A LOT OF
CONTROLS IN PLACE, AND

08:13.060 --> 08:14.424
AND SO THERE ARE A LOT OF
CONTROLS IN PLACE, AND
THERE'S A LOT OF ACTIVITY IN

08:14.426 --> 08:15.791
CONTROLS IN PLACE, AND
THERE'S A LOT OF ACTIVITY IN
PLACE TO TRY TO CATCH ANY

08:15.793 --> 08:17.125
THERE'S A LOT OF ACTIVITY IN
PLACE TO TRY TO CATCH ANY
KIND OF ACTIVITIES BUT IT

PLACE TO TRY TO CATCH ANY
KIND OF ACTIVITIES BUT IT
CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT.

08:18.160 --> 08:19.525
KIND OF ACTIVITIES BUT IT
CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT.
AS DANA POINTED OUT, THERE

08:19.527 --> 08:21.292
CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT.
AS DANA POINTED OUT, THERE
ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS, IF

08:21.294 --> 08:22.592
AS DANA POINTED OUT, THERE
ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS, IF
NOT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

08:22.594 --> 08:23.625
ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS, IF
NOT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACCESS TO

08:23.627 --> 08:25.025
NOT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACCESS TO
THE HIGHEST, THE MOST

08:25.027 --> 08:25.692
PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACCESS TO
THE HIGHEST, THE MOST
SENSITIVE INFORMATION THAT

08:25.694 --> 08:26.392
THE HIGHEST, THE MOST
SENSITIVE INFORMATION THAT
OUR COUNTRY HAS.

08:26.394 --> 08:27.759
SENSITIVE INFORMATION THAT
OUR COUNTRY HAS.
AND IT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT

08:27.761 --> 08:29.458
OUR COUNTRY HAS.
AND IT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT
TO CONTROL WHO SHOULD HAVE

08:29.460 --> 08:30.592
AND IT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT
TO CONTROL WHO SHOULD HAVE
ACCESS TO WHAT INFORMATION

08:30.594 --> 08:31.226
TO CONTROL WHO SHOULD HAVE
ACCESS TO WHAT INFORMATION
AT WHAT TIME.

08:31.228 --> 08:32.325
ACCESS TO WHAT INFORMATION
AT WHAT TIME.
BECAUSE EVERYONE IS WORKING

08:32.327 --> 08:33.959
AT WHAT TIME.
BECAUSE EVERYONE IS WORKING
ON DIFFERENT PROJECTS,

08:33.961 --> 08:34.625
BECAUSE EVERYONE IS WORKING
ON DIFFERENT PROJECTS,
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS.

08:34.627 --> 08:35.992
ON DIFFERENT PROJECTS,
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS.
THEY MIGHT BE DOING RESEARCH,

08:35.994 --> 08:37.059
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS.
THEY MIGHT BE DOING RESEARCH,
SO IT CAN BECOME VERY

08:37.061 --> 08:38.026
THEY MIGHT BE DOING RESEARCH,
SO IT CAN BECOME VERY
DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHO

08:38.028 --> 08:39.326
SO IT CAN BECOME VERY
DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHO
IS DOING SOMETHING

08:39.328 --> 08:41.126
DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHO
IS DOING SOMETHING
LEGITIMATE AND WHO IS D

DO SOMETHING THEY SHOULDN'T
BE DOING.

08:42.461 --> 08:43.159
DO SOMETHING THEY SHOULDN'T
BE DOING.
>> Ifill: SO HOW DO THEY

08:43.161 --> 08:44.193
BE DOING.
>> Ifill: SO HOW DO THEY
MANAGE THIS, WHAT KIND OF

08:44.195 --> 08:45.426
>> Ifill: SO HOW DO THEY
MANAGE THIS, WHAT KIND OF
CONTROLS CAN THEY IMPOSE?

08:45.428 --> 08:46.560
MANAGE THIS, WHAT KIND OF
CONTROLS CAN THEY IMPOSE?
>> WELL, THERE ARE TWO

08:46.562 --> 08:48.593
CONTROLS CAN THEY IMPOSE?
>> WELL, THERE ARE TWO
THINGS RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

08:48.595 --> 08:49.793
>> WELL, THERE ARE TWO
THINGS RIGHT OFF THE BAT.
ONE IS THAT PEOPLE ARE

08:49.795 --> 08:51.360
THINGS RIGHT OFF THE BAT.
ONE IS THAT PEOPLE ARE
REGULARLY POLYGRAPHED, MAYBE

08:51.362 --> 08:52.394
ONE IS THAT PEOPLE ARE
REGULARLY POLYGRAPHED, MAYBE
ONCE A YEAR TO MAKE SURE

08:52.396 --> 08:54.093
REGULARLY POLYGRAPHED, MAYBE
ONCE A YEAR TO MAKE SURE
THAT THEY STILL PASS, THAT

08:54.095 --> 08:55.360
ONCE A YEAR TO MAKE SURE
THAT THEY STILL PASS, THAT
NOTHING HAS CHANGED IN THEIR

08:55.362 --> 08:56.260
THAT THEY STILL PASS, THAT
NOTHING HAS CHANGED IN THEIR
BACKGROUND THAT WOULD

08:56.262 --> 08:57.127
NOTHING HAS CHANGED IN THEIR
BACKGROUND THAT WOULD
INDICATE A RISK.

08:57.129 --> 08:58.160
BACKGROUND THAT WOULD
INDICATE A RISK.
THE OTHER THING REALLY IS

08:58.162 --> 08:59.993
INDICATE A RISK.
THE OTHER THING REALLY IS
THAT THEY DO RELY ON OTHER

08:59.995 --> 09:01.494
THE OTHER THING REALLY IS
THAT THEY DO RELY ON OTHER
EMPLOYEES TO NOTICE

09:01.496 --> 09:02.594
THAT THEY DO RELY ON OTHER
EMPLOYEES TO NOTICE
DIFFERENCES AND TO REPORT

09:02.596 --> 09:02.928
EMPLOYEES TO NOTICE
DIFFERENCES AND TO REPORT
THEM.

09:02.930 --> 09:05.228
DIFFERENCES AND TO REPORT
THEM.
AND THEY DO HAVE

09:05.230 --> 09:06.727
THEM.
AND THEY DO HAVE
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PEOPLE

09:06.729 --> 09:08.061
AND THEY DO HAVE
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PEOPLE
WHO ARE EMPLOYED TO DO JUST

09:08.063 --> 09:10.128
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PEOPLE
WHO ARE EMPLOYED TO DO JUST
THAT, TO FOLLOW PEOPLE INTO

09:10.130 --> 09:11.777
WHO ARE EMPLOYED TO DO JUST
THAT, TO FOLLOW PEOPLE INTO
THE WATERING HOLES THAT THEY

09:11.779 --> 09:12.811
THAT, TO FOLLOW PEOPLE INTO
THE WATERING HOLES THAT THEY
FREQUENT, AND INTO THE

09:12.813 --> 09:14.512
THE WATERING HOLES THAT THEY
FREQUENT, AND INTO THE
SOCIAL SETTINGS THAT THEY

09:14.514 --> 09:15.478
FREQUENT, AND INTO THE

I THINK MOST AMERICANS DON'T

THEY DON'T NEED TO SEE THE

THEY DON'T NEED TO SEE THE
CONTENT OF WHAT WE DO, BUT
JUST BY BEING ABLE TO TRACK

12:26.192 --> 12:28.589
CONTENT OF WHAT WE DO, BUT
JUST BY BEING ABLE TO TRACK
WHERE WE GO, WHAT WE DO, OUR

12:28.591 --> 12:30.023
JUST BY BEING ABLE TO TRACK
WHERE WE GO, WHAT WE DO, OUR
GEO LOCATION, THEY CAN PUT

12:30.025 --> 12:32.290
WHERE WE GO, WHAT WE DO, OUR
GEO LOCATION, THEY CAN PUT
TOGETHER A PICTURE OF WHO WE

12:32.292 --> 12:33.624
GEO LOCATION, THEY CAN PUT
TOGETHER A PICTURE OF WHO WE
ARE, HOW OLD WE ARE, HOW

12:33.626 --> 12:35.390
TOGETHER A PICTURE OF WHO WE
ARE, HOW OLD WE ARE, HOW
MUCH MONEY WE MAKE, WHO OUR

ARE, HOW OLD WE ARE, HOW

FRIENDS ARE.

12:36.225 --> 12:37.423
MUCH MONEY WE MAKE, WHO OUR
FRIENDS ARE.
IT'S REMARKABLE WHAT YOU CAN

12:37.425 --> 12:39.157
FRIENDS ARE.
IT'S REMARKABLE WHAT YOU CAN
DO WITH THAT KIND OF MEHTA

12:39.159 --> 12:40.490
IT'S REMARKABLE WHAT YOU CAN
DO WITH THAT KIND OF MEHTA
DOES DATA WHICH IS EXACTLY

THE KIND OF INFORMATION THAT

AMOUNT OF INFORMATION.

12:49.026 --> 12:49.757
GIVING AWAY A TREMENDOUS
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION.

ADVOCATES ARE MOST WORRIED
ABOUT THE THE STORAGE OF
THIS DATA.

12:59.293 --> 13:00.925
ABOUT THE THE STORAGE OF
THIS DATA.
SO I MAY NOT BE UNDER

13:00.927 --> 13:02.325
THIS DATA.
SO I MAY NOT BE UNDER
SUSPICION RIGHT NOW, TEN

13:02.327 --> 13:04.225
SO I MAY NOT BE UNDER
SUSPICION RIGHT NOW, TEN
YEARS FROM NOW, YOU KNOW,

EXHAUST.

13:10.127 --> 13:11.526
DIFFERENT SETS OF MY DIGITAL
EXHAUST.
AND THEY MAY DECIDE

13:11.528 --> 13:12.192
EXHAUST.
AND THEY MAY DECIDE
SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS.

13:12.194 --> 13:13.893
AND THEY MAY DECIDE
SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS.
SO THEY CAN GO BACK AND MINE

13:13.895 --> 13:15.592
SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS.
SO THEY CAN GO BACK AND MINE
THE DATA THAT THEY HAVE FROM

13:15.594 --> 13:17.692
SO THEY CAN GO BACK AND MINE
