JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.540 --> 00:07.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.
Gwen Ifill is away this week.

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:

00:09.877 --> 00:12.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
It is my responsibility as
commander in chief

00:12.246 --> 00:17.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not to stand by, but to make
sure that we
send a clear signal to the
Taliban and others.

00:17.317 --> 00:22.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Calling the
action an important
milestone for peace, President
Obama confirms

00:22.556 --> 00:28.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a U.S. drone strike kills the
Afghan Taliban
leader -- what this means for
the fight against

00:28.729 --> 00:30.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the terror group.

00:30.497 --> 00:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Monday:
As candidates head West, our
Politics Monday

00:33.834 --> 00:36.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
team breaks down the latest in
the race for
the White House.

00:36.837 --> 00:42.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus, during
President Obama's
trip to Vietnam, we take a look
at the generation

00:42.209 --> 00:46.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who moved back after escaping
the atrocities
of war with their parents.

00:46.580 --> 00:52.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUYNH PHAM, Art Gallery Owner:
My mother,
who I am very close to, she
actually flat-out

00:53.020 --> 00:56.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
told me that I'm no longer her
daughter if
I come back to Vietnam.

00:56.390 --> 00:59.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:59.593 --> 01:02.796 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:02.829 --> 01:16.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A historic
moment in Hanoi
today. The United States
formally dropped

01:16.076 --> 01:20.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its prohibition on selling
weapons to Vietnam.
It highlighted the dramatic
turnaround in

01:20.981 --> 01:23.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relations between the two former
enemies.

01:23.617 --> 01:25.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang has our report.

01:25.519 --> 01:28.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
This change will ensure that
Vietnam has access

01:28.588 --> 01:34.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the equipment that it needs
to defend itself
and removes a lingering vestige
of the Cold

01:34.428 --> 01:36.129 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
War.

01:36.163 --> 01:40.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In Hanoi, President
Obama officially
ended the more-than-four-decades
old arms

01:40.701 --> 01:42.469 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
embargo.

01:42.502 --> 01:48.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: At this stage,
both sides have
established a level of trust and
cooperation,

01:48.942 --> 01:55.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
including between our
militaries, that is
reflective of common interests
and mutual

01:55.182 --> 01:56.984 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
respect.

01:57.017 --> 02:01.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That mutual respect
was on full
display during the first of Mr.
Obama's three

02:01.221 --> 02:07.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
days in Vietnam. He was greeted
at the presidential
palace by a military honor
guard. At night,

02:07.828 --> 02:12.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hundreds of people lined the
streets to catch
a glimpse of the president as he
left a noodle

02:12.332 --> 02:14.134 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
shop.

02:14.167 --> 02:19.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The warming extends to commerce,
too: American
and Vietnamese companies signed
deals worth

02:19.206 --> 02:26.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
$16 billion. Lifting the arms
embargo reflects
growing U.S. concerns about
China's military

02:26.346 --> 02:32.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
buildup and territorial
ambitions in the South
China Sea. China's efforts to
exert more naval

02:32.552 --> 02:39.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
control over shipping lanes in
the sea is
troubling to both the United
States and Vietnam.

02:39.192 --> 02:44.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While acknowledging the shared
concerns, Mr.
Obama said ending the embargo
was about warming

02:44.064 --> 02:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relations between two former
foes.

02:46.700 --> 02:56.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: The decision to
lift the ban
wasn't based on China or any
other considerations.

02:56.643 --> 03:04.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was based on our desire to
complete what
has been a lengthy process of
moving towards

03:04.217 --> 03:05.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
normalization with Vietnam.

03:05.986 --> 03:10.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: China's immediate
response was
muted, but human rights groups
said Vietnam

03:10.424 --> 03:15.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was getting a reward it didn't
deserve. They
have long criticized Vietnam's
communist regime

03:15.929 --> 03:22.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for repressing dissidents. Even
as he praised
the two nations' reconciliation,
President

03:22.035 --> 03:27.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama underscored differences
over democracy
and human rights. Tomorrow, he
meets with

03:27.374 --> 03:29.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Vietnamese dissidents.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

03:31.945 --> 03:36.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We will focus
on the phenomenon
of Vietnamese Americans
returning home later

03:36.683 --> 03:38.385 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the program.

03:38.418 --> 03:42.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Iraq,
government troops
have launched a much-anticipated
offensive

03:42.489 --> 03:48.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to retake Fallujah from Islamic
State fighters.
The city about 40 miles west of
Baghdad has

03:48.795 --> 03:54.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been under the militant group's
control since
January 2014. Today, Iraqi
forces pushed their

03:54.935 --> 04:01.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way into nearby farming areas.
They were backed
by U.S. coalition airstrikes and
paramilitary

04:01.975 --> 04:03.844 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
troops.

04:03.877 --> 04:06.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Islamic State
bombings in
Syria killed nearly 150 people
today and wounded

04:06.980 --> 04:11.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at least 200 more. Five suicide
attackers
and two car bombs hit government
strongholds

04:11.751 --> 04:17.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the coastal cities of Jableh
and Tartus.
That area is home to Russian
military bases.

04:17.991 --> 04:22.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISIS also claimed responsibility
for twin
bombings in Yemen that killed at
least 45

04:22.329 --> 04:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people there. The victims had
gathered at
army recruiting centers in Aden.

04:26.766 --> 04:32.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The leader of an
anti-immigrant
party in Austria came within a
whisker today

04:32.205 --> 04:38.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of being elected president. His
support showcased
rising opposition both to
migrants and to

04:38.612 --> 04:39.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the European Union.

04:39.946 --> 04:43.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
James Mates of Independent
Television News
reports.

04:43.083 --> 04:48.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATES: Austria held its
breath. Much
of Europe held its breath. The
country interior

04:48.221 --> 04:53.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
minister walked solemnly to the
podium to
declare whether the far right
had made the

04:53.660 --> 04:58.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
biggest electoral breakthrough
since World
War II.

04:58.932 --> 05:08.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By just 31,000 votes out of 4.5
million, Norbert
Hofer of the Freedom Party had
been kept out

05:08.475 --> 05:14.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the presidential palace,
conceding defeat
on his Facebook page, but
promising supporters

05:14.247 --> 05:20.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he will be back. The country's
new president
is the mild-mannered economics
Professor Alexander

05:20.687 --> 05:25.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
van der Bellen backed originally
by the Greens,
but then by everybody as they
tried to keep

05:25.959 --> 05:27.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the far right out.

05:27.727 --> 05:31.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So Europe will breathe a sigh of
relief, but
cannot ignore the biggest lesson
here, the

05:31.898 --> 05:37.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
collapse of the center and the
rise of the
extremes of both left and right.
Centrist

05:37.704 --> 05:42.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
politicians who face wipeout
point out it's
far from just an Austrian
problem.

05:42.309 --> 05:44.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Should the rest of Europe be
worried about
this?

05:44.211 --> 05:49.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAN KRAINER, Social Democrat
M.P.: I think
the entire Europe should worry
about what

05:49.049 --> 05:55.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is going on in the entire
Europe, without
specifically looking into in one
country.

05:55.789 --> 05:59.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not that what is going on
in Austria
is so much different from what
is going on

06:00.026 --> 06:03.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in very many other European
countries.

06:03.964 --> 06:11.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATES: At a party in a
Vienna beer garden
last night, Norbert Hofer was
prematurely

06:11.538 --> 06:17.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
celebrating victory, but 49.7
percent of the
vote is hardly a defeat.

06:17.744 --> 06:23.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Center-left
parties have dominated
Austrian politics since World
War II, but

06:23.383 --> 06:26.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they were eliminated in last
month's first
round of voting.

06:26.586 --> 06:29.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Back in this
country: The
U.S. Supreme Court struck down
the murder

06:29.689 --> 06:35.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conviction for a death row
inmate in Georgia
because of racial bias in
picking his jury.

06:35.262 --> 06:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Timothy Foster was convicted in
1987 of murdering
an elderly white woman. The high
court ruled

06:40.467 --> 06:47.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
7-1 that state prosecutors
violated the Constitution
when they excluded blacks from
his jury. Foster

06:47.574 --> 06:49.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is now eligible for a new trial.

06:49.809 --> 06:55.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A Baltimore
policeman was acquitted
today in the death of Freddie
Gray, an incident

06:55.181 --> 07:00.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that sparked riots in the city
last year.
A judge found officer Edward
Nero had little

07:00.920 --> 07:07.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do with Gray's arrest and
death in custody.
Nero still faces an internal
police investigation.

07:07.961 --> 07:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In all, six officers were
charged in the case.
The trial of the first ended in
a hung jury.

07:13.533 --> 07:17.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will examine the verdict and
its implications
later in the program.

07:17.304 --> 07:22.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A major
takeover bid today
in the farm chemicals industry.
Germany's

07:22.375 --> 07:28.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bayer offered to buy Monsanto
for $62 billion.
The Saint Louis seed giant
specializes in

07:28.448 --> 07:33.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crop seeds and the widely used
weed killer
Roundup. Any deal would be
subject to a federal

07:33.520 --> 07:36.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regulatory review of how it
affects farmers
and consumers.

07:36.890 --> 07:41.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On Wall Street, a
quiet day.
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost eight

07:41.961 --> 07:49.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
points today to close below
17493. The Nasdaq
fell three points and the S&amp;P
500 slipped

07:49.469 --> 07:51.271 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
four.

07:51.304 --> 07:55.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And swarms of
insects are
now threatening the Taj Mahal in
India. Millions

07:55.175 --> 07:58.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of flies are breeding in a
polluted river
that's nearby, and they're
leaving behind

07:58.812 --> 08:04.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
green and black waste. That's
forced crews
to scrub the 17th century
monument daily.

08:05.018 --> 08:08.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Officials warn all that
scrubbing will damage
the building's famed marble
inlay work.

08:08.955 --> 08:15.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And still to come
on the "NewsHour":
the Taliban's top leader taken
out in Pakistan;

08:15.695 --> 08:21.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a shift to the general election,
even as Bernie
Sanders campaigns in California;
what an acquittal

08:21.868 --> 08:30.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
means for a Baltimore police
officer in the
death of Freddie Gray; and much
more.

08:30.443 --> 08:44.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The man who
led the Afghan
Taliban for the past year was
killed in a

08:44.457 --> 08:48.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. operation over the weekend.
The group
had been gaining ground and
waging a bloody

08:48.061 --> 08:49.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
war against the Afghan
government.

08:49.963 --> 08:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what's next for the Taliban,
and the countries
who fight it?

08:53.266 --> 08:56.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret
Warner begins our coverage.

08:56.569 --> 09:02.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Smoldering
wreckage on a
Pakistani roadside was all that
remained of

09:02.375 --> 09:06.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Taliban commander's vehicle
hours after
he died in it Saturday.

09:06.646 --> 09:13.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, in Vietnam, President
Obama officially
announced a U.S. drone strike
killed Mullah

09:13.086 --> 09:14.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Akhtar Mohammad Mansour.

09:14.888 --> 09:18.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
It has been confirmed that he is
dead. And

09:18.992 --> 09:27.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he as an individual who, as head
of the Taliban,
was specifically targeting U.S.
personnel

09:27.867 --> 09:30.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and troops inside of
Afghanistan.

09:30.203 --> 09:34.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Mullah Mansour
took over
the Afghan Taliban last summer,
after the

09:34.374 --> 09:40.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
group finally announced that
longtime leader
Mullah Omar had died in 2013.
The new leader

09:40.180 --> 09:45.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
faced down rivals, in part by
rejecting Afghan-
and U.S.-backed peace talks.

09:45.618 --> 09:51.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under his direction, Taliban
forces briefly
seized the Northern Afghan city
of Kunduz

09:51.257 --> 09:58.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last September, and carried out
a bloody assault
in Kabul itself in April,
killing 64.

09:58.731 --> 10:03.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Word of his death was welcomed
by Afghan chief
executive Abdullah Abdullah:

10:03.069 --> 10:07.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABDULLAH ABDULLAH, Afghan Chief
Executive
(through translator): He was in
charge of

10:07.707 --> 10:11.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
all terrorist attacks in
Afghanistan, and
he had direct contact with other
terrorist

10:11.945 --> 10:16.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
networks. This will bring a big
change in
the Taliban condition. His death
is a blow

10:16.182 --> 10:20.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to their abilities in carrying
out terrorist
attacks against the Afghan
people.

10:20.253 --> 10:24.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Afghan
President Ashraf Ghani
signaled that the Taliban
leader's death could

10:24.757 --> 10:29.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also open the door to renewed
peace talks.
The drone strike that killed
Mansour was the

10:30.029 --> 10:37.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
first by the U.S. inside
Baluchistan, in Southwestern
Pakistan. It's long been a
Taliban stronghold.

10:37.303 --> 10:42.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In London yesterday, Pakistan's
Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif condemned the
attack, saying

10:42.041 --> 10:43.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the U.S. gave no advance
warning.

10:43.977 --> 10:48.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NAWAZ SHARIF, Pakistani Prime
Minister (through
translator): We are protesting
strongly. This

10:48.147 --> 10:50.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is a violation of the
sovereignty of Pakistan.

10:50.183 --> 10:55.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: But
Afghanistan's government
accuses the Pakistanis of
harboring a veritable

10:55.221 --> 10:57.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who's-who of most wanted
terrorists.

10:57.824 --> 11:01.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEN. DAWLAT WAZIRI, Afghan
Defense Ministry
(through translator): The
Haqqani Network

11:01.127 --> 11:05.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is in Pakistan. Mullah Omar and
Osama bin
Laden were in Pakistan, and now
Mullah Mansour

11:06.032 --> 11:11.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was killed in Pakistan's
Baluchistan. It would
be better if Pakistan cooperated
with Afghanistan

11:11.504 --> 11:15.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and didn't give shelter to these
people who
are continuing the war in
Afghanistan.

11:15.608 --> 11:19.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Pakistani
authorities say
a passport found near the drone
strike wreckage

11:19.979 --> 11:25.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shows Mansour had just returned
from Iran.
Officials there denied the
claim.

11:25.518 --> 11:30.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the already-fractured
Taliban is
scrambling to close ranks.
Senior leaders

11:30.490 --> 11:37.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
met today, and speculation over
a successor
centers on Mansour's deputy,
Sirajuddin Haqqani,

11:37.430 --> 11:41.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a warlord seen as even more
brutal than Mansour.

11:41.668 --> 11:44.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

11:44.337 --> 11:48.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We take a
closer look at
what this means for Afghanistan
moving forward

11:48.775 --> 11:53.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Riaz Mohammad Khan, a
former Pakistani
diplomat who also served as that
country's

11:53.279 --> 11:58.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
foreign minister, and Barnett
Rubin. He was
a senior adviser at the U.S.
State Department

11:58.484 --> 12:00.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from 2009 to 2013.

12:00.253 --> 12:04.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Riaz Khan, I want to start with
you. Who was
Mullah Mansour? What do we know
about him?

12:04.490 --> 12:09.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RIAZ MOHAMMAD KHAN, Former
Pakistani Ambassador:
Well, Mullah Mansour was an
important leader

12:09.329 --> 12:12.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
under Mullah Omar.

12:12.498 --> 12:22.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And after a long struggle, he
was being recognized
as the leader of the Afghan
Taliban. Of course,

12:22.942 --> 12:30.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now he's dead. And this is going
to lead to
another round of divisive
struggling for leadership

12:30.450 --> 12:33.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
within the Taliban.

12:33.252 --> 12:41.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But apart from that, I think it
will be a
setback to the so-called quartet
process.

12:41.628 --> 12:54.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Secondly, I think we can
anticipate a spike
in violence, because, knowing
the character

12:54.040 --> 13:00.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Afghan Taliban, some of
the factions,
they would want to avenge this.
And there

13:00.780 --> 13:06.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may be some violence within
Afghanistan or
in Pakistan.

13:06.285 --> 13:09.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Barnett Rubin,
what about
the significant of this
happening in Baluchistan?

13:09.656 --> 13:14.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARNETT RUBIN, Director, Center
on International
Cooperation, New York
University: Well, first,

13:14.093 --> 13:19.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's important to recognize that
this was
-- the decision to undertake
this act was

13:19.499 --> 13:25.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inspired by the need to protect
American soldiers,
not by a strategic decision
about the course

13:25.972 --> 13:29.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the Afghan war or
Afghanistan.

13:29.142 --> 13:34.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is important about striking
Baluchistan
is, Baluchistan is the province
in Pakistan

13:34.414 --> 13:40.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where the headquarters of the
Afghan Taliban
is located, primarily in the
city of Quetta.

13:40.086 --> 13:42.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we have known that for a
very long time.

13:42.789 --> 13:49.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the United States used
drones. Mostly,
it was the CIA using drones
against terrorists

13:49.328 --> 13:55.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with global reach, like al-Qaida
or those
closely connected to al-Qaida,
in the tribal

13:55.234 --> 14:00.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
areas of Pakistan. And they had
agreed with
the military of Pakistan there
were certain

14:00.673 --> 14:03.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
areas where they could use those
drone strikes.

14:03.576 --> 14:09.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, this strike was carried out
by the United
States special forces in
Afghanistan, which

14:09.716 --> 14:16.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
means it's not part of the CIA's
anti-terrorism
campaign. It's part of the war
in Afghanistan.

14:16.556 --> 14:21.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they have extended the
territory of the
war of Afghanistan into
Baluchistan, which

14:21.461 --> 14:26.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
also puts Pakistan in a
deservedly very difficult
position, because it shows that
the leader

14:26.999 --> 14:32.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Taliban was driving a
taxi across Baluchistan
without apparently being
concerned about his

14:32.371 --> 14:37.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
security, which shows that the
top leadership
of the Taliban operates with
impunity in Pakistan,

14:37.844 --> 14:41.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which we all knew, of course,
and means that
their complaints about violating
their sovereignty

14:41.948 --> 14:46.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are null and void, because they
are constantly
violating the sovereignty of
Afghanistan by

14:46.652 --> 14:49.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sponsoring military incursions
and terrorist
acts have.

14:49.989 --> 14:54.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Riaz Khan,
what about the
idea that there is a level of
complicity?

14:55.027 --> 15:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mullah Mansour also had a fake
Pakistani passport.
What is the relationship between
the intelligence

15:00.633 --> 15:03.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agencies in Pakistan and what
they do they
know and what are they willing
to tolerate

15:03.603 --> 15:05.404 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with leadership of the Taliban?

15:05.438 --> 15:11.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RIAZ MOHAMMAD KHAN: Well, first,
I would like
to say that this shows -- this
incident shows,

15:11.210 --> 15:18.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
apart from the question of
sovereignty, that
the United States didn't trust
Pakistan.

15:18.317 --> 15:24.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is no confidence. There is
no transparency,
which is necessary for
cooperation in such

15:24.257 --> 15:34.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
matters. But as far as
complicity is concerned,
the Taliban, many -- most of the
Taliban,

15:34.934 --> 15:40.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have come to Pakistan --
had come to
Pakistan after the American
intervention.

15:40.873 --> 15:44.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And many of them have got
passports.

15:44.277 --> 15:51.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It wouldn't be surprising if he
also can use
Pakistani passport. There are
five million

15:51.517 --> 15:59.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Afghan refugees in Pakistan. And
many of them,
they have become part of the
Pakistani society.

15:59.525 --> 16:09.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is this disconnect
between Pakistan
and the United States in terms
of confidence

16:09.902 --> 16:11.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
which is necessary.

16:11.737 --> 16:17.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secondly, I should say that a
lot of blame
is placed on Pakistan ISI,
others, et cetera,

16:17.310 --> 16:25.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the troubles in Afghanistan.
But there
is -- it ignores the fact of
failure policy;

16:25.051 --> 16:29.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it ignores the fact of error of
judgment,
like, for example, Iraq.

16:29.121 --> 16:35.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a great deal of mess
over there.
Now, there is no ISI and
Pakistan over there.

16:35.761 --> 16:41.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It had been a failure of policy.
Similarly
here, the failure of policy goes
even back

16:41.734 --> 16:47.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the voting process, where the
Taliban,
reconcilable Taliban, should
have been brought

16:47.940 --> 16:51.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into the fold of the voting
process, but that
didn't happen.

16:51.944 --> 17:01.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There have been other mistakes,
like, for
example, the control of Kabul
was left to

17:01.821 --> 17:06.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Northern Alliance forces,
which were mostly
non-Pashtun. That rankled with
the Pashtun.

17:06.859 --> 17:11.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that helped, in fact, the
Taliban revive
themselves later on.

17:11.397 --> 17:19.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that kind of imbalance even
continues
today in the Afghan national
army. And that

17:19.071 --> 17:23.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the reason why it is not that
effective
in the Pashtun-dominated areas
of Afghanistan.

17:23.542 --> 17:28.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Barnett Rubin,
as Mr. Khan
just mentioned, what about the
diplomatic

17:28.347 --> 17:33.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and political implications about
the fact
that there wasn't any sort of a
signal given,

17:33.552 --> 17:37.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any permission asked before this
strike was
launched, the level of distrust
that exists

17:37.657 --> 17:39.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
between these two countries?

17:39.492 --> 17:43.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARNETT RUBIN: Well, first, I
will just say,
I agree with my friend Riaz
Mohammad Khan

17:43.195 --> 17:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that there were a lot of policy
mistakes by
the United States, in particular
missing early

17:47.600 --> 17:52.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opportunities to include the
Taliban in the
setup Afghanistan, so that they
would have

17:52.505 --> 17:56.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not fled to Pakistan.

17:56.275 --> 18:00.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, your question was, if you
can repeat
it?

18:00.680 --> 18:02.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Sorry.

18:02.381 --> 18:05.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was just asking, what about
the level of
distrust between these two
countries?

18:05.551 --> 18:07.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BARNETT RUBIN: Oh, yes.

18:07.353 --> 18:11.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, the United States has had
experiences
where, when they have given
advance notice

18:11.824 --> 18:20.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to Pakistan about a
counterterrorism action,
that somehow the target of that
action escapes.

18:20.800 --> 18:26.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And clearly, you know, of course
there are
lots of Afghans in Pakistan and
some of them

18:26.372 --> 18:32.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have Pakistani passports. But it
certainly
strains credulity to believe
that a very effective

18:32.311 --> 18:37.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
intelligence service, such as
Pakistan has,
wouldn't be aware of the
location of the leader

18:37.383 --> 18:43.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of Afghan Taliban, who
apparently not only
went to Iran, but flew 18 times
out of the

18:43.289 --> 18:47.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
international airport at
Karachi, according
to the stamps in his passport.

18:47.793 --> 18:52.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, clearly, since he was
clearly under their
protection, and they also
provided security

18:52.131 --> 18:56.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for him to be elected and for
him to hold
large gatherings last summer to
try to build

18:56.802 --> 19:01.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
support for himself, and as they
even told
us that they were trying to make
sure he could

19:01.741 --> 19:07.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
consolidate power, they
certainly didn't want
to give them advance warning
that they were

19:07.713 --> 19:09.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to make this attack.

19:09.415 --> 19:16.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Barnett Rubin,
Riaz Mohammad Khan, thank you
both.

19:16.122 --> 19:28.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now to
politics and the
battle for the Democratic Party
nomination.

19:28.634 --> 19:33.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Bernie Sanders is
pushing hard in
California, the state with the
most Democratic

19:33.773 --> 19:35.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
delegates up for grabs.

19:35.508 --> 19:41.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a rally today in Los Angeles,
he slammed
both Hillary Clinton and Donald
Trump for

19:41.347 --> 19:43.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their big donors.

19:43.282 --> 19:46.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
Secretary Clinton has several
super PACs,

19:46.585 --> 19:53.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and one of her largest super
PACs have received
many millions of dollars from
Wall Street.

19:53.325 --> 19:55.061 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BOOING)

19:55.094 --> 19:59.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Now, there
is -- with
regards to Trump, this is really
hysterically

19:59.698 --> 20:00.099 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
funny.

20:00.132 --> 20:02.001 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

20:02.034 --> 20:06.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Trump is a
multibillionaire,
or so he tells us. We don't know
if it's true

20:06.205 --> 20:06.739 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or not.

20:06.772 --> 20:08.574 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

20:08.607 --> 20:11.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: You know,
he lies every
day, so probably he's broke. I
don't know.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.779 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

20:13.813 --> 20:16.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hillary Clinton
addressed the
labor base of the party,
speaking at the Service

20:16.482 --> 20:22.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Employees International Union
Convention in
Detroit today. She also made a
nod to campaign

20:22.388 --> 20:24.657 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
finance and pivoted to Trump.

20:24.690 --> 20:28.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
We are coming to the end of the
Democratic

20:28.527 --> 20:36.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
primaries. I applaud Senator
Sanders and his
supporters for challenging us.
We are going

20:36.769 --> 20:49.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get unaccountable money out
of politics.
We are going to take on the
crisis of income

20:49.348 --> 20:50.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inequality. And we are going to
unify the
Democratic Party and stop Donald
Trump.

20:50.282 --> 20:52.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

20:52.151 --> 20:55.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that brings
us to Politics
Monday with Tamara Keith of NPR
and Amy Walter

20:55.421 --> 20:57.890 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of The Cook Political Report.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And welcome to you both this
Monday.

20:59.959 --> 21:04.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Tamara, this contest -- we
just heard
Hillary Clinton talking about
Trump, but Bernie

21:04.663 --> 21:08.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders is still talking about
her. Where
does this race stand? Over the
weekend, he

21:09.001 --> 21:12.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said to the effect, I need to be
in this race
because we don't want people
voting against

21:12.905 --> 21:17.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- voting for the lesser of two
evils, which
didn't sound like the greatest
endorsement

21:17.276 --> 21:19.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Hillary Clinton.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Well,
he is definitely not ready to
endorse Hillary

21:20.246 --> 21:22.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Clinton at this point.

21:22.081 --> 21:26.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his supporters are very much
still interested
in seeing this play out. They
don't want a

21:26.385 --> 21:31.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
choice between Donald Trump and
Hillary Clinton
if they can avoid it.
Mathematically, we should

21:31.423 --> 21:36.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say, it's almost certain, unless
something
dramatic happens, that Hillary
Clinton will

21:36.295 --> 21:38.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be the Democratic nominee.

21:38.164 --> 21:44.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why she moving on. She
has hired staff
in like -- something like nearly
a dozen swing

21:44.103 --> 21:49.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states. I talked to one Sanders'
supporter,
though, this -- who was in
Albuquerque at

21:49.375 --> 21:56.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a rally. He said, if he had to
choose between
Donald Trump and Satan himself,
he wouldn't

21:56.248 --> 21:57.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
vote for Donald Trump.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Oh.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Which is to say
that he will
vote for Hillary Clinton, but he
won't be

22:00.619 --> 22:04.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happy about it. And I heard a
lot of that
from Sanders supporters.

22:04.356 --> 22:08.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That also doesn't
sound like
a ringing endorsement, but it is
a move in

22:09.028 --> 22:10.763 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
her direction.

22:10.796 --> 22:12.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: But
that's what we're seeing in the
polls sort

22:12.565 --> 22:16.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of overall, which is the reason
that we have
seen the polls tightening is the
last time

22:16.202 --> 22:19.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we were here talking about this,
I said the
number that I was paying much
more attention

22:19.705 --> 22:24.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to than how many endorsements
Donald Trump
was getting from Republican
elites and officeholders

22:24.543 --> 22:28.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was whether or not he was
getting support
from voters on the ground,
right, the real

22:28.714 --> 22:30.482 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people who show up and vote.

22:30.516 --> 22:33.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And right now, we're seeing the
polls tightening
because voters are starting to
come home.

22:33.953 --> 22:38.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican voters who earlier in
April or
in March were saying, I don't
know if I can

22:38.123 --> 22:41.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vote for Donald Trump, now are
saying they
can vote for him.

22:41.126 --> 22:45.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The expectation is, we will see
the same thing
on the Democratic side. But the
other thing

22:45.164 --> 22:49.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're seeing is that a majority
of voters
right now both on the Democratic
side and

22:49.101 --> 22:53.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Republican side say they're
voting for
their candidate not because they
like that

22:53.906 --> 22:59.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidate. It's because they
dislike the other
one so much more. It's a vote
against, rather

22:59.044 --> 23:00.846 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than a vote for.

23:00.879 --> 23:04.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, and you're
talking about
the numbers coming together for
Donald Trump

23:04.083 --> 23:04.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Hillary Clinton.

23:04.883 --> 23:06.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Right.

23:06.685 --> 23:09.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are these numbers
-- numbers
like that, Tamara, at this stage
in a campaign,

23:09.989 --> 23:13.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are these enduring numbers? Are
they likely
to stay?

23:13.125 --> 23:19.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: It's a moment in
time. And at
this moment in time, Hillary
Clinton is fighting

23:19.798 --> 23:23.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on two fronts. Donald Trump is
beginning to
consolidate.

23:23.569 --> 23:28.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton's
unfavorables
among Bernie Sanders supporters
are actually

23:28.173 --> 23:35.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rising. And so you have this
time where people
who are polled are going to say,
I don't support

23:35.547 --> 23:37.316 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hillary Clinton.

23:37.349 --> 23:41.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, I spoke to pollster Peter
Hart earlier
today. He has a new poll out,
the NBC/Wall

23:41.820 --> 23:47.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Street Journal poll. He said
only about 10
percent of Sanders supporters
said they would

23:47.660 --> 23:52.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eventually support a Republican
or consider
supporting a Republican, which
means once

23:52.231 --> 23:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- this will shake out some.

23:54.066 --> 23:58.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's my
question, Amy.
Again, we're at May in the
campaign. We have

23:58.570 --> 24:00.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
got six months to go.

24:00.839 --> 24:06.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With high -- we call them high
unfavorables
at this point, so high for
Hillary Clinton

24:06.845 --> 24:10.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and for Donald Trump, are these
numbers, are
they likely to give as people...

24:10.249 --> 24:14.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's the real
question, because
we have never had in the history
of these

24:14.386 --> 24:18.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
polls -- Peter Hart has been
doing the Wall
Street Journal/NBC poll for a
along time.

24:18.624 --> 24:22.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's never seen -- the Wall
Street Journal
the polls has never seen this.
The ABC/Washington

24:22.194 --> 24:26.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Post poll has never seen two
candidates for
president of the United States
as unpopular

24:26.598 --> 24:29.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as these two candidates. So
we're in uncharted
territory.

24:29.835 --> 24:34.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We normally say, if you're a
really well-known
candidate and you have very high
unfavorables,

24:34.673 --> 24:38.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's not likely that people are
going to change
their perception of you between
now and the

24:38.944 --> 24:40.779 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

24:40.813 --> 24:45.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you have two really, highly
disliked people
who are eventually going to be
the nominees,

24:46.018 --> 24:51.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and you are going to have to
pick one of them.
So how voters get to that place
is going to

24:51.256 --> 24:53.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be interesting to watch for the
next six months.

24:53.359 --> 24:57.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of people have sort of
resigned themselves
to who they're voting for. Like
Tamara pointed

24:57.229 --> 25:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out, some of them are saying,
well, it's the
lesser of two evils, but maybe
they get there

25:01.467 --> 25:05.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or maybe they stay home. That's
the thing
that is going to be harder to
track.

25:05.104 --> 25:08.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes. I saw where
someone working
for Trump was saying what
Hillary Clinton

25:08.340 --> 25:14.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is going to have to do because
of her high
unfavorables is -- quote -- "to
destroy Donald

25:14.413 --> 25:15.848 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump."

25:15.881 --> 25:18.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it seems to me that may have
to be Donald
Trump's strategy as well.

25:18.717 --> 25:21.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, there might
be some mutual
destruction that goes on. And
you have to

25:21.553 --> 25:23.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wonder who is going to show up
and vote.

25:23.422 --> 25:28.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it may be that this is an
election where
the negativity is what motivates
people, rather

25:28.827 --> 25:30.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than the joy of pulling the
lever.

25:31.029 --> 25:37.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do we --
let's come back
to the Hillary Clinton-Bernie
Sanders situation,

25:37.436 --> 25:42.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amy, because you heard Hillary
today. We heard
the comments she made about
Donald Trump,

25:42.574 --> 25:45.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but she was fairly positive
about Bernie Sanders.

25:45.144 --> 25:52.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She said, I applaud Senator
Sanders for challenging
us. We're going to get, she
said, an accountable

25:52.518 --> 25:56.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
-- we're going to get
unaccountable money
out of politics. We're going to
take on the

25:56.121 --> 25:57.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
crisis of income inequality.

25:57.723 --> 26:02.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, she is talking about his
issues. He, meanwhile,
is still criticizing her.

26:02.060 --> 26:03.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

26:03.862 --> 26:07.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is, as Tamara pointed out,
fighting this
two-front war. She can't go on
the attack

26:07.166 --> 26:11.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Bernie Sanders. You're going
to see, she
barely mentions him. It's all
Trump all the

26:11.470 --> 26:13.372 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

26:13.405 --> 26:16.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The super PACs that Bernie
Sanders talks about
supporting her, they're not
going after Bernie

26:16.642 --> 26:22.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders. They're going after
Donald Trump
as well. And so the real
question is going

26:22.347 --> 26:28.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be post this primary process
in June, not
only what does Bernie Sanders
do, but will

26:28.454 --> 26:33.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the biggest spokesperson for the
Democratic
Party, President Obama, come out
and start

26:33.492 --> 26:35.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to try to make that unification?

26:35.828 --> 26:38.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That, I think, is something
you're likely
to see.

26:38.397 --> 26:42.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we should
point out that
Sanders himself and the people
around him

26:42.267 --> 26:47.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have begun to say that his main
priority is
defeating Donald Trump in the
fall, so if

26:47.306 --> 26:49.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he's not the nominee.

26:49.174 --> 26:53.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we did learn today, Tamara,
that they
have named the members of the
platform committee

26:53.612 --> 26:57.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the convention. This is where
they will
be talking about what the
Democratic Party

26:57.883 --> 27:01.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
believes in. And there are a
number of Bernie
Sanders supporters on that
committee.

27:01.119 --> 27:04.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes. And I think
this is a really
important thing.

27:04.056 --> 27:07.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders' campaign put out a
statement saying
they were happy that this had
happened. The

27:08.026 --> 27:12.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton campaign put a statement
saying, this
is great. What is happening here
is Bernie

27:12.097 --> 27:18.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders in a way is figuring out
how to land
the plane. And he is going to --
he clearly

27:18.036 --> 27:23.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wants to make an impact on this
party platform
and to be able to use that to
say, look, look

27:23.642 --> 27:25.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at what this movement has
accomplished.

27:25.511 --> 27:31.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other thing he did in the
last 48 hours
is, he endorsed Tim Canova, who
is a candidate

27:31.216 --> 27:34.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for Congress running against
Debbie Wasserman
Schultz, the DNC chairman.

27:34.152 --> 27:35.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The chairman.

27:35.754 --> 27:39.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And he did a
fund-raising e-mail.
It was a money bomb for Canova.

27:39.458 --> 27:43.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Sanders, we believe, is
going to start
doing this for other down-ballot
candidates,

27:43.462 --> 27:46.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is part of making this
about more than
just nominating Bernie Sanders.

27:46.865 --> 27:50.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But that may not
earned the
friendship forever of the chair
of the...

27:50.669 --> 27:51.503 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

27:51.537 --> 27:53.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: No, of the chair of
the DNC.

27:53.305 --> 27:57.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the offer to -- just imagine
what this
-- for both sides what these
conventions are

27:57.643 --> 28:00.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to look like. You have
Paul Ryan, who
chairs the Republican
Convention, who has

28:00.779 --> 28:06.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not yet endorsed Donald Trump,
who may have
to preside over a convention
that he's not

28:06.051 --> 28:07.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
supporting the front-runner.

28:07.819 --> 28:11.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you have the DNC chairwoman
in a fight
with the person who's not the
nominee, but

28:11.423 --> 28:16.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will certainly a role to play in
this process,
which goes to show again that
this has been

28:16.695 --> 28:22.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a roiling of the two parties.
It's obviously
much more significant on the
Republican side,

28:22.367 --> 28:26.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but I think, at the end of the
day, this is
just the beginning of what we're
seeing as

28:26.038 --> 28:31.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
either major or minor breaks in
the two parties
and their makeups.

28:31.076 --> 28:35.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it may be
true to say that
the likes of which we have never
seen before,

28:35.614 --> 28:37.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and that will continue to be
case.

28:37.449 --> 28:39.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's very true,
because, every
week, we're going to say that,
every week.

28:39.918 --> 28:41.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

28:41.086 --> 28:44.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Amy Walter, Tamara Keith, thank
you both.

28:44.122 --> 28:50.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

28:50.629 --> 28:54.499 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

28:54.533 --> 28:59.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
children
who fled Vietnam return to mixed
reception;

28:59.171 --> 29:03.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a different kind of desperate
journey, special
correspondent Malcolm Brabant's
personal story

29:03.475 --> 29:05.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of mental illness.

29:05.243 --> 29:10.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: I was taken
into a secure
locked-up ward, because I had
gone mad.

29:10.549 --> 29:14.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But, first, we
return to
Baltimore and the not-guilty
verdict for a

29:14.653 --> 29:18.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
police officer charged in the
death of Freddie
Gray.

29:18.156 --> 29:21.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Debbie Hines was in the
courtroom today. She's
a former Baltimore prosecutor
who currently

29:21.393 --> 29:23.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
practices law in Washington.

29:23.695 --> 29:24.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for joining us.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tell us first, I guess, what was
the mood
in the courtroom?

29:26.698 --> 29:29.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBBIE HINES, Former Baltimore
Prosecutor:
Well, they made very clear
before the judge

29:29.234 --> 29:33.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even came out that there wasn't
to be any
shouting, any emotions, and if
you didn't

29:33.372 --> 29:38.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think you could contain your
emotions inside
the courtroom, then you needed
to leave before

29:38.176 --> 29:43.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the judge came out. So there
wasn't really
any response inside a completely
packed courtroom.

29:43.815 --> 29:48.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK. What about
Nero himself?
What about the officer when he
heard the verdict?

29:48.120 --> 29:52.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBBIE HINES: I couldn't see his
expression
because he's from the back. I'm
looking at

29:52.991 --> 29:56.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him from the back, as all the
spectators in
the courtroom are.

29:56.428 --> 29:59.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there still wasn't any
emotion there.
And you have to understand that
the judge

29:59.931 --> 30:05.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
read about 20 minutes. It's not
just as it
comes out in a jury verdict
where it's not

30:05.170 --> 30:10.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
guilty, not guilty, not guilty.
He actually
read a very long legal opinion
describing

30:10.042 --> 30:13.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
each and every of the four
counts and how
he came to his conclusion.

30:13.578 --> 30:19.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, this is
also in this
specific individual case, right?
This isn't

30:19.651 --> 30:25.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an automatic hall pass for all
the officers.
We already had one end up in a
hung jury,

30:25.157 --> 30:27.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and now we're just talking about
officer number
two in this situation.

30:27.359 --> 30:30.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBBIE HINES: Exactly. And that
was one of
the things that Judge Barry
Williams made

30:30.629 --> 30:36.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very clear when he went over
methodically
all the facts and the evidence
that had been

30:36.968 --> 30:40.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presented, that he actually said
it might
have been different when we get
to the cases

30:40.872 --> 30:46.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Officer Miller and actually
the case of
the van driver, who, throughout
the course

30:46.311 --> 30:51.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of both trials, Officer Porter,
as well as
Officer Nero, everybody seemed
to be putting

30:51.383 --> 30:54.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of blame on the van driver
for the criminal
actions.

30:54.920 --> 30:58.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What about the
decision
here by Officer Nero to choose a
bench trial

30:58.323 --> 30:59.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
instead of a jury trial?

30:59.658 --> 31:03.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEBBIE HINES: I was reading his
lawyer's account
of that.

31:03.228 --> 31:08.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that, I think, was a superb
decision in
this case and in this case only.
There is

31:08.867 --> 31:12.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
always a risk, because,
generally -- I do
some criminal defense, and,
generally, you

31:12.871 --> 31:17.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want to have 12 people decide
your fate, more
than just one person.

31:17.676 --> 31:24.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a lot of the issues that are
surrounding
Officer Nero, they really
evolved around legal

31:24.316 --> 31:29.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issues and his facts as they fit
into the
legal issues and that's where
the burden of

31:29.321 --> 31:35.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
proof comes in. And so I think
that his attorneys
felt that his best shot was with
having a

31:35.427 --> 31:40.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bench trial and a judge who
could look at
the facts on the one hand, look
at the elements

31:40.465 --> 31:45.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the law on the other hand,
and make sure
that they fit together, without
showing any

31:45.036 --> 31:48.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
emotions as what would be likely
or might
be likely with a jury.

31:48.473 --> 31:51.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Right,
especially with a
jury this kind of a heated
climate. Maybe

31:51.710 --> 31:54.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they might want to find him
guilty of something
before they let him out.

31:54.346 --> 31:56.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DEBBIE HINES: Right.

31:56.181 --> 31:59.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, so
how does the
state prove that officers knew
about the rules

31:59.584 --> 32:02.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on how to belt down someone who
was under
arrest?

32:02.921 --> 32:06.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seems some of this case
depends on whether
or not somebody opened an
e-mail.

32:06.858 --> 32:08.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEBBIE HINES: Well, it's that.

32:08.660 --> 32:13.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then when I was looking over
the written
opinion from Judge Williams, he
also went

32:13.698 --> 32:19.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through a lot of discussing the
van driver.
And a lot of the regulations go
to actually

32:19.738 --> 32:25.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the van driver's responsibility
and his duty.
And then there were the other
officers that

32:25.277 --> 32:28.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
were involved. One was a
lieutenant and their
supervising officers.

32:28.880 --> 32:35.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think a lot of his
decision in this
case weighed heavily on Officer
Nero was only

32:35.220 --> 32:39.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a two-year, if you want to call
a veteran
-- he was a rookie. He's only
been on the

32:39.791 --> 32:45.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
force for two years. And so, in
this case,
the facts are very
fact-specific. There was

32:45.564 --> 32:52.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an e-mail that went out several
days before
Freddie Gray's arrest that
basically that

32:52.771 --> 32:56.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you have to seat-belt. It's a
mandatory seat-belting
any detainees.

32:56.374 --> 33:02.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he was off that day. So it's
not even
clear if he actually read it
because he's

33:02.214 --> 33:06.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off that day. He's not there and
there was
no evidence that it was
presented in any role

33:06.685 --> 33:08.453 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
call.

33:08.486 --> 33:11.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think the facts are very
specific, and
the judge wanted to point that
out, as to

33:11.489 --> 33:14.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what the awareness was with
respect to Officer
Nero in his case.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, so
then we have
got four more officers. This
is...

33:17.863 --> 33:19.264 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

33:19.297 --> 33:20.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEBBIE HINES: Or really five,
because they're
going to retry Porter.

33:20.532 --> 33:22.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Five, right.
That's right.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is a very long -- give
us the timeline.
What's kind of the next step
now?

33:24.803 --> 33:26.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DEBBIE HINES: OK.

33:26.605 --> 33:30.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the next step -- and this is
really, really
the biggest one. That's going to
be Officer

33:30.041 --> 33:35.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Caesar Goodson. And he is the
van driver,
and his trial is June 6. And he
is the most

33:35.247 --> 33:36.982 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
culpable.

33:37.015 --> 33:39.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, whether you're defense
or you're
the prosecution, he's the most
culpable of

33:39.951 --> 33:44.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all. And then the other officers
that are
staged after that, the trials
are leading

33:44.723 --> 33:47.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up all the way to September if
all of them
are tried.

33:47.058 --> 33:54.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think what happened with
Officer Goodson,
who is the most culpable by even
his fellow

33:54.165 --> 33:59.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officers, I think that that's
going to make
the determination of what
happens ultimately

33:59.104 --> 34:00.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the other cases.

34:00.372 --> 34:01.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Debbie Hines,
thanks so much.

34:01.740 --> 34:06.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEBBIE HINES: Thank you for
having me.

34:06.945 --> 34:18.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We return now to
Vietnam.

34:18.523 --> 34:22.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Relations between the United
States and its
former enemy have warmed since
the end of

34:22.560 --> 34:29.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the war more than 40 years ago.
Now some Vietnamese
who fled as children and became
Americans

34:29.768 --> 34:34.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have begun to go back. And the
country they
find is one transformed.

34:34.606 --> 34:38.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From Ho Chi Minh City, special
correspondent
Mike Cerre reports.

HENRY NGUYEN, IDG Ventures
Vietnam: We got
one of those calls early one
morning from

34:45.417 --> 34:51.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a friend who contacted the
embassy. He said,
the embassy car is coming, pack
the family

34:51.856 --> 34:55.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into the car, only have one bag,
and get ready
to go.

QUYNH PHAM, Art Gallery Owner:
My mother told
me one story of how the Vietcong
were coming

35:00.899 --> 35:06.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after us and we had to just lie
down and feign
death basically. She told me
that she covered

35:06.871 --> 35:08.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all of us in other people's
blood.

35:08.740 --> 35:15.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COL. TUAN T. TON, U.S. Army: If
I look back,
that's probably one of the most
dangerous

35:15.780 --> 35:19.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parts of my life, because we see
death every
second we're on that boat. My
job was just

35:19.651 --> 35:27.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scoop the water out all day
long. And it was
the fifth day, and I start
passing out, because

35:27.258 --> 35:30.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I didn't eat for five days.

35:30.161 --> 35:34.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE CERRE: An estimated
million-and-a-half
Vietnamese have migrated to the
United States

35:34.332 --> 35:40.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since the end of the war, often
at great personal
and professional sacrifice. But
for most first-generation

35:40.405 --> 35:45.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vietnamese-Americans there is
little interest
in coming back, save to visit
relatives.

35:45.243 --> 35:50.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for a younger generation of
Vietnamese-Americans
who have little reference to
either the war

35:50.281 --> 35:55.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or the communist takeover, the
draw of the
new economy and the old culture
is creating

35:55.954 --> 35:57.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a reverse diaspora.

35:57.722 --> 36:03.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENRY NGUYEN: I wouldn't say my
parents were
jumping for joy when they heard
that I was

36:03.828 --> 36:06.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interested in spending more time
in Vietnam.

36:06.231 --> 36:11.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: After fleeing
Vietnam with his
family when he was 2, Henry
Nguyen's parents

36:11.669 --> 36:18.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worked multiple and often menial
jobs as refugees
in Northern Virginia in pursuit
of the American

36:18.043 --> 36:20.278 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dream for their children.

36:20.311 --> 36:25.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Playing in rock bands and
working at McDonald's,
Henry's came true by going to
Harvard and

36:26.017 --> 36:30.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
earning his medical degree and
MBA at Northwestern.

36:30.355 --> 36:38.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Henry, growing up in
Fairfax, Virginia,
you actually worked in a
McDonald's?

36:38.063 --> 36:38.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HENRY NGUYEN: Yes. Yes.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MIKE CERRE: Really?

36:40.632 --> 36:43.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENRY NGUYEN: Just part-time one
summer. Like,
it's like every kid's first
summer job, right?

36:43.768 --> 36:46.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Welcome to McDonald's
Vietnam.

36:46.371 --> 36:52.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: Since moving back to
Vietnam full-time
12 years ago, he's now an owner
of the first

36:52.811 --> 37:03.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
McDonald's in Vietnam, the local
pro basketball
team, and runs one of the
country's largest

37:03.888 --> 37:10.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
venture capital funds as a V.C.,
an ironic
twist on wartime shorthand for
the Vietcong

37:10.762 --> 37:13.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
guerrillas, which overthrew his
South Vietnam
homeland.

37:13.731 --> 37:17.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENRY NGUYEN: Yes, but I want to
make sure
people understand that means
venture capitalist.

37:17.068 --> 37:22.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in some ways, it's funny
because even
here you could argue that
capitalism, because

37:22.474 --> 37:25.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of socialist ideology, was kind
of a dirty
word.

37:25.176 --> 37:29.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, fundamentally, I think, if
you really
look at the underlying kind of
culture and

37:29.814 --> 37:34.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drive of people here, like, it's
always been
very market-oriented anyway.

37:34.986 --> 37:40.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: Henry's initial
motivation for
coming back was to better
understand the Vietnamese

37:40.325 --> 37:46.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
culture he largely ignored while
growing up
in America. He's now married to
the daughter

37:46.364 --> 37:50.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a former prime minister and
raising his
family here.

37:50.902 --> 37:55.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What keeps him here are the
professional challenges
and opportunities in the new
Vietnam.

37:56.007 --> 38:01.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENRY NGUYEN: There's so many
ways to really
make a contribution, to make the
life of people

38:01.246 --> 38:05.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here in Vietnam better, to make
the country
better in terms of accelerating
its development,

38:05.884 --> 38:09.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and whether it's the economy,
whether it's
society, et cetera.

38:09.988 --> 38:13.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUYNH PHAM: I can totally see
the influence
like from Hopper.

38:13.191 --> 38:19.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My mother, who I am very close
to, she actually
flat-out told me that I'm no
longer her daughter

38:19.764 --> 38:24.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if I come back to Vietnam. She
has a different
history from me. And I totally
realize that

38:24.969 --> 38:29.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she couldn't fathom then her
daughter, who
she risked everything for.

38:29.707 --> 38:34.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We fled this nation, and for me,
as this conscious
adult, to say, OK, wait a
minute, I'm going

38:34.946 --> 38:39.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to go back to this country that
we fled from
-- I was really curious, and
that was the

38:39.384 --> 38:41.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reason why I came back to
Vietnam.

38:41.319 --> 38:47.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: Quynh Pham left a
comfortable
and prestigious job at an art
institute in

38:47.525 --> 38:51.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
California to start a gallery of
her own here
in Ho Chi Minh City.

38:51.963 --> 38:57.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUYNH PHAM: This is a developing
nation, and
there aren't many contemporary
art galleries

38:57.702 --> 38:59.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that work at this level in the
country.

38:59.737 --> 39:05.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: She believes the
vibrant contemporary
art scene is a reflection of
Vietnam's creative

39:05.210 --> 39:10.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
renaissance, as well as its
economic emergence
from nearly a century of
colonization, war

39:10.982 --> 39:12.750 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and unification.

39:12.784 --> 39:19.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COL. TUAN T. TON: My father was
a major in
the South Vietnamese army and my
wife's father

39:19.123 --> 39:21.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was a colonel in the Vietnamese
air force.

39:21.960 --> 39:27.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: Tuan T. Ton is a
colonel in the
United States Army. He moved
back to Vietnam

39:27.999 --> 39:33.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as the American defense attache,
the U.S.
military's chief representative
for our new

39:33.271 --> 39:38.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
defense agreements with the
Vietnamese, to
counter China's expansion
efforts in the South

39:38.343 --> 39:40.211 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
China Sea.

39:40.245 --> 39:47.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COL. TUAN T. TON: When I left
Vietnam, I never
thought I would return here,
because the image

39:47.919 --> 39:53.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that imprint in my head was so
deep, I pretty
much looking forward to what
America had to

39:53.191 --> 39:57.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
offer. And America definitely
had offered
a lot.

39:57.061 --> 40:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And not until a few years ago,
when I started
working on Vietnam issue from
Washington,

40:01.299 --> 40:07.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
D.C., I realize that it's an
opportunity for
me to serve here in my new
capacity.

40:07.672 --> 40:13.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE CERRE: He and his
Vietnamese-American
wife, Thu-Ha, live in this
four-story villa

40:13.244 --> 40:15.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the U.S. maintains for its
defense attaches.

40:15.546 --> 40:17.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is pretty nice living for
army living.

40:17.348 --> 40:20.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THU-HA TON, Wife of Col. Tuan T.
Ton: Yes.
Pretty nice, the best we have
ever lived in.

40:20.451 --> 40:23.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: The best you ever
live in the
Army, obviously, over here.

40:23.321 --> 40:26.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COL. TUAN T. TON: Yes, because
we host a lot
of foreign guests here.

40:26.924 --> 40:32.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE CERRE: Many of them
recognize the South
Vietnamese military insignias of
their parents'

40:32.530 --> 40:34.232 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
former units.

40:34.265 --> 40:37.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COL. TUAN T. TON: I display that
proudly.
My Vietnamese counterparts see
it. Here, it's

40:37.502 --> 40:40.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
only American. And we just talk
about history.

40:40.338 --> 40:46.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: It has taken some
time for the
local Vietnamese to fully
embrace the returning

40:46.210 --> 40:50.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Viet Kieus, as the
Vietnamese-Americans are
known here.

40:50.715 --> 40:56.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After nearly 40 years of tough
economic times
and living conditions since the
war, the local

40:56.454 --> 41:00.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Vietnamese are just now enjoying
the benefits
of peace and prosperity.

41:00.291 --> 41:03.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COL. TUAN T. TON: I think people
deserve it.
There's hardworking people here.

41:03.828 --> 41:05.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUYNH PHAM: It's just unreal.

41:05.596 --> 41:13.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, when I first came back
to Vietnam,
Viet Kieu was -- it was a
derogatory term.

41:13.338 --> 41:18.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Viet Kieu are considered
people who left
Vietnam. But it's changed, this
perception

41:18.776 --> 41:22.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of who Viet Kieus are, because
the government
here, the people here see that
we have been

41:22.847 --> 41:27.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
educated abroad. We have a more
international,
more global vision.

41:27.485 --> 41:33.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are able to bring these
resources, these
networks, this knowledge into
this country.

41:33.391 --> 41:38.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And they see that it's
contributing to economic
growth, and so there's much more
support for

41:38.596 --> 41:40.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what everybody is doing.

41:40.365 --> 41:44.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENRY NGUYEN: So many people
from Vietnam
now travel extensively. And,
reciprocally,

41:44.969 --> 41:49.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's so much more economic
activity, so
much many more people, whether
it's of Vietnamese

41:49.707 --> 41:53.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
origin or whether who are not of
Vietnamese
origin, have come to Vietnam and
done business.

41:53.578 --> 41:58.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this country has changed
dramatically,
socially, politically,
economically, you name

41:58.383 --> 42:00.118 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

42:00.151 --> 42:04.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUYNH PHAM: Having certain
freedoms in the
U.S. and then coming back here
and perhaps

42:04.355 --> 42:11.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feeling a little bit more
restricted, I don't
really feel we're being
hindered. I'm just

42:11.329 --> 42:18.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very aware. And, at times, to be
honest, I'm
cautious. You have got this old
communist

42:18.503 --> 42:22.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ideology, but yet we have really
embraced
capitalism here.

42:22.540 --> 42:28.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: As much as he enjoys
living and
working here, there's no
confusion in Colonel

42:28.913 --> 42:30.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ton's mind over who he is.

42:30.681 --> 42:34.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
COL. TUAN T. TON: I'm an
American officer.
There's no such thing as
Vietnamese-American

42:34.919 --> 42:37.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officer. It's only an American
officer. Over
two-thirds of my life have been
grown up in

42:38.022 --> 42:45.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United States. I served in
the United
States military. It's where I
belong.

42:45.062 --> 42:50.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENRY NGUYEN: I feel like my
experience is
not uncommon, in the sense of, I
may have

42:50.368 --> 42:56.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grown up in a time when I felt
very isolated
or separated from that identity,
but now that

42:56.407 --> 43:01.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have lived here, wow, there is
something
special that we can be a part
of, and this

43:01.712 --> 43:03.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is still our country.

43:03.281 --> 43:16.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MIKE CERRE: For the "PBS
NewsHour," Mike Cerre
in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

43:16.461 --> 43:26.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Over the weekend,
the "NewsHour"
was proud to accept the George
Foster Peabody

43:26.070 --> 43:31.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Award, the highest in broadcast
journalism,
for our coverage of the refugee
crisis in

43:31.175 --> 43:35.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Middle East and Europe, a
series we have
called Desperate Journey.

43:35.613 --> 43:40.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since he began covering those
stories last
summer, special correspondent
Malcolm Brabant

43:40.551 --> 43:47.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has brought us into the lives of
people fleeing
war and terror, often at
unimaginable personal

43:47.158 --> 43:50.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
risk, as they sought new homes
in Europe.

43:50.094 --> 43:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The stories were the work of a
team of correspondents
and producers here, but none so
important

43:56.167 --> 44:00.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as Malcolm himself, who accepted
the award
on the program's behalf.

44:00.905 --> 44:05.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because he's based overseas, few
of us here
at the "NewsHour" had ever even
met Malcolm

44:05.309 --> 44:07.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in person, until today.

44:07.411 --> 44:10.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I'm particularly happy to
have him join
me now.

44:10.681 --> 44:12.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it is so wonderful to have
you here, Malcolm.

44:12.783 --> 44:13.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Thank you very
much.

44:13.684 --> 44:14.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
congratulations.

44:14.385 --> 44:16.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Thanks a lot.

44:16.254 --> 44:18.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you first
started reporting
for us just about a year ago.
You were in

44:18.990 --> 44:24.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Europe in the very beginnings of
this refugee
-- it was then a problem in
Europe. You did

44:24.362 --> 44:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some reporting for Greece, but
you went on
to cover this story in all of
its dimensions.

44:28.599 --> 44:34.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Malcolm, did you have any idea
in the beginning
just what it was going to
become?

44:34.138 --> 44:37.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: I certainly had
no idea it
was going to be as enormous as
this.

44:38.009 --> 44:42.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I started reporting from
Greece, most
of the refugees were coming to a
holiday island

44:42.847 --> 44:48.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
called Kos. But I heard about
that this nearby
island about six hours' journey
away by boat,

44:48.819 --> 44:51.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it was called Lesbos, was
starting to receive
people.

44:51.789 --> 44:56.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I went up there. And I
had heard that
there was this strange
Englishman called Eric

44:56.928 --> 45:01.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kempson who was looking out for
the boats
and who was helping refugees on
the beaches.

45:01.132 --> 45:03.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he was my guide to start
with.

45:03.467 --> 45:07.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we have this most
extraordinary morning,
when we saw a boat in the
distance, and we

45:07.939 --> 45:12.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had to drive like crazy about
100 kilometers,
70 miles an hour, through Greek
lanes to get

45:12.710 --> 45:16.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the beach in time, as this
rubber raft
arrived.

45:16.180 --> 45:20.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was biblical almost. It
was like something
out of Exodus, seeing these
people swarming

45:20.685 --> 45:24.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
onto the beaches just not
knowing what they
were going to expect. And the
joy on their

45:24.188 --> 45:28.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
faces was unbelievable. And what
was extraordinary
was seeing the reaction of some
of the Greeks

45:28.759 --> 45:32.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who were there, because these
are a people,
the Greeks, who have also
experienced what

45:32.997 --> 45:33.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's like to flee from war.

45:34.031 --> 45:35.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

45:35.800 --> 45:39.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: And it was very
heartwarming
to see them sort of carrying out
what they

45:39.070 --> 45:43.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
call philoxenia, which is
unconditional kindness
and welcomes to strangers.

45:43.574 --> 45:46.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And this was at a
moment when
Greece had been through its own
terrible financial

45:46.777 --> 45:51.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crisis. People were in a -- many
people didn't
know where their next --
literally where their

45:51.115 --> 45:55.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
next meal was coming from, and
yet they were
welcoming these refugees.

45:55.052 --> 45:58.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Yes, because
that's in their
nature, because they understand
what it's

45:58.289 --> 46:00.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like to run away from war.

46:00.091 --> 46:04.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have been refugees. They
have had to
migrate to make living in
countries -- in

46:04.462 --> 46:07.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
places like New York, in
Toronto, you have
got all these great Greek
communities, and

46:08.032 --> 46:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they know what it's like. And so
they're very
sympathetic.

46:09.934 --> 46:14.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you watched
it, Malcolm.
You covered it in Greece. You
covered it across

46:14.071 --> 46:16.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Europe. And you saw attitudes
change.

46:16.540 --> 46:21.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Originally, the Europeans were
welcoming,
but then the fears of terrorism
grew, and

46:21.212 --> 46:22.513 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you saw a shift.

46:22.546 --> 46:24.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Yes.

46:24.448 --> 46:27.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that people were
just simply overwhelmed
by the numbers, and I think that
there are

46:27.885 --> 46:32.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some countries in Europe that
resented Germany
and Sweden, for example, for
opening the -- for

46:32.857 --> 46:35.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saying that basically everybody
was welcome.

46:35.693 --> 46:38.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think perhaps, if Germany
and Sweden
hadn't done that, then there
might have been

46:38.629 --> 46:43.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
maybe a better welcome for some
of these refugees.
But taking in a million may not
seem a lot

46:44.001 --> 46:49.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a continent of 500 million
people. But
the impact on nations like
Sweden, for example,

46:49.140 --> 46:52.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is close to my home in
Denmark, it's
really been quite enormous.

46:52.543 --> 46:56.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are really struggling
to accommodate
the 160,000 people that they're
taking in,

46:56.614 --> 47:00.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because you have to provide
schooling, you
have to provide housing. And
there is some

47:00.184 --> 47:01.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trouble in some of these asylum
centers, too.

47:01.986 --> 47:04.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The police, for example, say
that they're
on their knees. And that's one
of the reasons

47:04.789 --> 47:06.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
why there has been this
backlash.

47:06.524 --> 47:10.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But the fears of
terrorism
are real in many instances,
aren't they?

47:10.594 --> 47:15.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The numbers of
people who
have come with bad intent are
probably minuscule.

47:15.132 --> 47:19.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the vetting process
is now sort
of much -- is in place, but in
the initial

47:19.470 --> 47:25.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
waves, Europe didn't really know
who was coming
in. And so perhaps amongst all
these millions

47:25.309 --> 47:31.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of -- a million people who came
in, there
might be maybe hundreds of bad
guys. Who can

47:31.082 --> 47:32.983 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tell?

47:33.017 --> 47:37.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it is the fear that it's
actually generating
this big reaction and a fear of
Islam as well,

47:37.288 --> 47:41.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in many countries, especially
Christian ones,
which are predominantly
Christian like Poland,

47:41.358 --> 47:43.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hungary, and also Slovakia, for
example.

47:43.194 --> 47:46.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we're
certainly still
watching it unfold. we don't
know what's going

47:46.597 --> 47:51.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to happen with the many people
who are still
kind of in limbo who haven't
been -- who haven't

47:51.969 --> 47:53.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
found a home yet.

47:53.738 --> 47:55.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I want to ask you for a
minute, Malcolm,
about your own personal story,
because it

47:55.906 --> 48:00.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wasn't so very long ago you were
working for
the British Broadcasting
Corporation. You

48:00.478 --> 48:05.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were reporting from abroad for
them. In fact,
you were here in the U.S. for a
while.

48:05.216 --> 48:10.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You had your own personal
crisis, and you
wrote a book about it. But
that's another

48:10.321 --> 48:12.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
extraordinary story.

48:12.256 --> 48:15.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Well, it's --
this is a wonderful
sort of comeback for me, in a
way, because

48:15.059 --> 48:21.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought that my career was
finished. I thought
it was completely over, because
exactly five

48:21.432 --> 48:27.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years to the day that we picked
up the award
on Saturday was the day I
entered an insane

48:27.872 --> 48:29.640 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
asylum.

48:29.673 --> 48:33.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was taken into a secure,
locked-up ward
because I had gone mad. A few
days earlier,

48:33.944 --> 48:39.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had taken -- I had been given
a drug called
Stamaril, which is -- it's a
yellow fever

48:39.984 --> 48:46.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vaccine made by a company called
Sanofi Pasteur.
And it fried my brain. I was --
I was in a

48:46.157 --> 48:48.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- I had a really high fever for
about 13
days.

48:48.926 --> 48:50.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Supposed to be a
yellow fever
vaccine. Right.

48:51.028 --> 48:52.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Yes, it is.

48:52.930 --> 48:57.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's supposed to protect
you. But it devastated
my brain. And it fried my brain,
literally,

48:57.535 --> 49:02.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
affected the balance of it, and
sent me mad.
And I spent in total about a
year-and-a-half

49:02.406 --> 49:10.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in institutions, in locked-up
wards, and because
I went through various sort of
times when

49:10.347 --> 49:12.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I thought I was Christ, I
thought I was the
devil.

49:12.216 --> 49:17.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I even thought that I was a
suicide bomber.
And, eventually, the drugs and
the care and

49:17.655 --> 49:24.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the wonderful techniques of the
Danish doctors
managed to bring me back. And,
eventually,

49:24.762 --> 49:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I managed to purge myself of all
the chemicals,
basically.

49:29.567 --> 49:34.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I was finally given an
all-clear about
two-and-a-half years ago. And I
haven't had

49:34.839 --> 49:39.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a pill since. I haven't had to
go see a psychiatrist
since. And I'm back perhaps even
stronger

49:39.243 --> 49:42.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than I was before, because it
didn't kill
me. And it almost did kill me.

49:42.146 --> 49:46.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you told us
that it gave
you a much better understanding
of what those

49:46.116 --> 49:48.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who are mentally ill may have to
go through.

49:48.385 --> 49:50.187 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Absolutely.

49:50.221 --> 49:53.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I hope that it -- that this acts
for some
sort of inspiration for people
who are stigmatized

49:53.424 --> 49:59.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because of mental illness,
because that happens.
But -- and I'm very grateful to
the "NewsHour"

50:00.030 --> 50:02.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for giving me this immense
opportunity.

50:02.166 --> 50:05.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Malcolm,
we're exceedingly
grateful to you. And we wish you
the best

50:05.836 --> 50:07.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and look forward to your
reporting.

50:07.371 --> 50:12.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Thank you very
much, indeed.
Thanks. I'm grateful to you.

HARI SREENIVASAN: Later tonight
on PBS, "POV"
will air "The Return," a
documentary that

50:25.089 --> 50:30.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tracks some of the highs and
lows experienced
by convicts returning to life on
the outside

50:30.494 --> 50:34.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after California relaxed its
three-strikes
sentencing guidelines.

50:34.431 --> 50:38.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here's a look at the story of a
daughter as
she anticipates the approaching
reunion with

50:38.402 --> 50:42.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her father just released from a
years-long
prison term.

50:42.139 --> 50:49.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I hadn't heard my dad's
voice in years.
Like, the way he sounds, I don't
know even

50:49.580 --> 50:51.415 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
if I remember.

50:51.448 --> 50:59.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I was a teenager, I used to
calculate
the years, like, life in how
long is that?

50:59.690 --> 51:02.960 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is he going to die in there?

51:02.993 --> 51:09.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kai (ph), is nobody outside yet?
They drive
slow. Kai, who is that? Oh, my
stomach hurts.

51:09.767 --> 51:13.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kai (ph), is nobody outside yet?
They drive
slow. Kai, who is that? Oh, my
stomach hurts.

51:31.255 --> 51:44.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Hello. Hi. How you doing?

51:44.668 --> 51:54.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online right
now: One writer relies on her
poetry to cope

52:00.317 --> 52:05.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with her husband's cancer
treatment. Meanwhile,
her husband writes poems from
his own perspective.

52:05.956 --> 52:08.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can hear her read one of her
poems on

On Tuesday: For this week's
story in our Making
the Grade series, we travel to
Vermont, where

52:20.204 --> 52:24.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
declining student enrollment has
forced schools
to merge in order to survive.

52:24.041 --> 52:24.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

52:30.647 --> 52:36.186 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.

52:36.186 --> 52:40.657 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.
