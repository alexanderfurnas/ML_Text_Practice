>> YEAH.
WELL, WE'VE BEEN PUTTING OUT

21:51.266 --> 21:52.762
>> YEAH.
WELL, WE'VE BEEN PUTTING OUT
FIRES IN THE UNITED STATES FOR

21:52.764 --> 21:54.462
WELL, WE'VE BEEN PUTTING OUT
FIRES IN THE UNITED STATES FOR
MORE THAN A CENTURY.

21:54.464 --> 21:55.961
FIRES IN THE UNITED STATES FOR
MORE THAN A CENTURY.
WE'VE BEEN PUTTING OUT FOREST

21:55.963 --> 21:56.328
MORE THAN A CENTURY.
WE'VE BEEN PUTTING OUT FOREST
FIRES.

21:56.330 --> 21:58.526
WE'VE BEEN PUTTING OUT FOREST
FIRES.
THE PROBLEM IS THAT IN MANY

21:58.528 --> 22:00.226
FIRES.
THE PROBLEM IS THAT IN MANY
LANDSCAPES, THAT HAS MADE FUTURE

22:00.228 --> 22:01.491
THE PROBLEM IS THAT IN MANY
LANDSCAPES, THAT HAS MADE FUTURE
FIRES WORSE.

22:01.493 --> 22:03.790
LANDSCAPES, THAT HAS MADE FUTURE
FIRES WORSE.
EVERY TIME YOU PUT OUT A FIRE,

22:03.792 --> 22:05.289
FIRES WORSE.
EVERY TIME YOU PUT OUT A FIRE,
YOU USUALLY END UP LEAVING THAT

22:05.291 --> 22:06.388
EVERY TIME YOU PUT OUT A FIRE,
YOU USUALLY END UP LEAVING THAT
FUEL IN THE FOREST.

22:06.390 --> 22:08.387
YOU USUALLY END UP LEAVING THAT
FUEL IN THE FOREST.
SO IF YOU HAVE A LANDSCAPE THAT

22:08.389 --> 22:10.587
FUEL IN THE FOREST.
SO IF YOU HAVE A LANDSCAPE THAT
NORMALLY HAD FIRES COME THROUGH

22:10.589 --> 22:13.118
SO IF YOU HAVE A LANDSCAPE THAT
NORMALLY HAD FIRES COME THROUGH
IT, EVERY, SAY, 30 YEARS, AND

22:13.120 --> 22:15.318
NORMALLY HAD FIRES COME THROUGH
IT, EVERY, SAY, 30 YEARS, AND
YOU PUT OUT FIRES IN THAT

22:15.320 --> 22:16.617
IT, EVERY, SAY, 30 YEARS, AND
YOU PUT OUT FIRES IN THAT
LANDSCAPE FOR A CENTURY, THEN

22:16.619 --> 22:17.816
YOU PUT OUT FIRES IN THAT
LANDSCAPE FOR A CENTURY, THEN
YOU HAVE THREE TIMES MORE FUEL

22:17.818 --> 22:19.981
LANDSCAPE FOR A CENTURY, THEN
YOU HAVE THREE TIMES MORE FUEL
IN THAT FOREST.

22:19.983 --> 22:21.614
YOU HAVE THREE TIMES MORE FUEL
IN THAT FOREST.
THAT FUEL IS AFFECTED BY THE

22:21.616 --> 22:23.313
IN THAT FOREST.
THAT FUEL IS AFFECTED BY THE
CLIMATE AND DRIES OUT.

22:23.315 --> 22:26.078
THAT FUEL IS AFFECTED BY THE
CLIMATE AND DRIES OUT.
AND THE FIRES THAT RESULT ARE

22:26.080 --> 22:28.277
CLIMATE AND DRIES OUT.
AND THE FIRES THAT RESULT ARE
MUCH HOTTER AND MUCH FASTER BOTH

22:28.279 --> 22:30.843
AND THE FIRES THAT RESULT ARE
MUCH HOTTER AND MUCH FASTER BOTH
BECAUSE THE FUELS CAN BE MUCH

22:30.845 --> 22:32.808
MUCH HOTTER AND MUCH FASTER BOTH
BECAUSE THE FUELS CAN BE MUCH
DRYER AND AT A MUCH WARMER PLACE

22:32.810 --> 22:33.907
BECAUSE THE FUELS CAN BE MUCH
DRYER AND AT A MUCH WARMER PLACE
AND BECAUSE THERE'S MUCH MORE

22:33.909 --> 22:36.339
DRYER AND AT A MUCH WARMER PLACE
AND BECAUSE THERE'S MUCH MORE
FUEL TO BURN.

22:36.341 --> 22:37.538
AND BECAUSE THERE'S MUCH MORE
FUEL TO BURN.
