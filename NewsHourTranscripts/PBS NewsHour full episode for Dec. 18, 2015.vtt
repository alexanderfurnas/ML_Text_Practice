Good evening. I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.106 --> 00:07.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
On the NEWSHOUR tonight:

00:07.741 --> 00:13.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A vow to defeat ISIS. President Obama looks
ahead to his final year in office, in his

00:13.180 --> 00:16.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
end of 2015 news conference.

00:16.583 --> 00:21.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's Friday. Mark Shields and David Brooks
are here to analyze what the president said

00:21.521 --> 00:23.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the rest of the week's news.

00:23.757 --> 00:29.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, we head to the set of "Downton Abbey"
for a look at how the British drama has captivated

00:29.897 --> 00:30.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
American audiences.

ELIZABETH MCGOVERN, ACTRESS: The one extraordinary
difference is that, every word is written

00:36.336 --> 00:43.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by one man. I don't know of any other television
show that works that way. And I, to this day,

00:43.510 --> 00:44.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
find it absolutely mindboggling.

WOODRUFF: From President Obama today, a year-end
promise to target terror in the year to come.

01:07.167 --> 01:12.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He spoke at a White House news conference,
and sought again to allay public fears of

01:12.272 --> 01:18.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
potential attacks. At home, he called for
Americans to stay vigilant, and overseas,

01:18.045 --> 01:21.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he promised to pound away at the Islamic State
group.

BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:
ISIL's already lost about 40 percent of the

01:24.518 --> 01:30.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
populated areas it once controlled in Iraq,
and it's losing territory in Syria. Now, squeezing

01:30.657 --> 01:36.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIL's heart, its core in Syria and Iraq,
will make it harder for them to pump their

01:36.296 --> 01:38.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
terror and propaganda to the rest of the world.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

01:40.167 --> 01:42.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: We'll have an extended report on
the president's remarks on terrorism and a

01:42.736 --> 01:46.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
number of other subjects after the news summary.

01:46.173 --> 01:51.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In the day's other news, Wall Street went
down hard. The sell-off was driven by falling

01:51.311 --> 01:56.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
oil prices, the Chinese economy and foreign
reaction to the Federal Reserve's interest

01:56.750 --> 02:03.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rate hike. and, losses accelerated late as
a variety of option contracts expired.

02:03.423 --> 02:11.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In the end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
lost nearly 370 points, to close below 17,130,

02:11.598 --> 02:17.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the NASDAQ fell almost 80 points, and the
S&amp;P 500 dropped 36. For the week, the Dow

02:17.304 --> 02:22.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lost nearly 1 percent. The NASDAQ and the
S&amp;P lost a fraction of a percent.

02:22.976 --> 02:28.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Congress finished work today on sweeping tax
cut and government funding bills, and headed

02:28.782 --> 02:33.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
home for the holidays. The Senate gave final
approval to a package that includes more than

02:33.987 --> 02:42.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a trillion dollars in new federal spending
for 2016, plus $680 billion in tax cuts over

02:42.662 --> 02:43.263 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the next decade.

SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MAJORITY LEADER:
We're proving you can actually enact significant

02:47.334 --> 02:52.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
long-term reforms, achieve conservative policy
goals, and get them signed into law. So, I'm

02:52.773 --> 02:58.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
proud of what the new Senate has accomplished.
I'd like to thank the many friends across

02:58.745 --> 03:04.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the aisle who joined us in passing so many
bipartisan reforms for the American people.

03:04.551 --> 03:09.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEN. HARRY REID (D-NV), MINORITY LEADER: Months
ago, Democrats called on Republicans to work

03:09.423 --> 03:16.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with us to craft a budget agreement. We outlined
three goals. We wanted to get rid of sequestration.

03:16.496 --> 03:21.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We were able to do that. We wanted to make
sure there was parity between defense and

03:21.902 --> 03:28.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the middle class. We wanted to make sure we
kept these poison pill riders off the legislation.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
All three goals we had, we accomplished.

03:32.379 --> 03:36.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: The budget deal already passed in
the House in separate votes yesterday and

03:36.316 --> 03:41.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today. And later, President Obama signed the
legislation into law.

03:41.354 --> 03:46.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
European Union leaders vowed today to wage
an "uncompromising fight" against terror.

03:46.660 --> 03:51.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Their summit in Brussels was the first time
the 28 leaders have met since the November

03:51.598 --> 03:57.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attacks in Paris, claimed by the Islamic State
group. The group agreed to beef up immigration

03:57.838 --> 04:04.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
controls, to crack down on gun-running and
to freeze financial assets of extremist groups.

04:04.377 --> 04:11.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
More than 990,000 migrants have entered Europe
this year from Africa or the Middle East,

04:11.084 --> 04:16.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and there is still no end in sight. The International
Organization for Migration put out the new

04:16.656 --> 04:22.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
estimate today, and said more than half are
from Syria. In Geneva, a spokesman said people

04:22.562 --> 04:27.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
keep coming, despite temperatures getting
colder and sea conditions growing more dangerous.

JOEL MILLMAN, SPOKESMAN, INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION
OF MIGRATION: The flows are so strong, even

04:31.404 --> 04:39.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now, this late in the year, that perhaps by
Tuesday, or even before then, IOM estimates

04:39.279 --> 04:45.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the million person mark will pass. This
is almost five times last year's level, which

04:45.852 --> 04:46.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is extraordinary.

(EDN VIDEO CLIP)

04:48.221 --> 04:53.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: The agency also reports at least
760 migrants have died so far this year, with

04:53.593 --> 04:57.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than half of those in just the last two
months alone.

04:57.531 --> 05:03.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Prospects for peace in Yemen hit a new stumbling
block today. Talks in Switzerland were halted

05:03.170 --> 05:08.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after Shiite Houthi rebels suspended all meetings
with Yemen's government. The Houthis blamed

05:08.675 --> 05:14.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
repeated violations of a cease-fire in Yemen.
Both sides have ignored the truce, and troops

05:14.814 --> 05:20.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
loyal to the government captured a provincial
capital today, after two days of fighting.

05:20.554 --> 05:27.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In Iraq, the U.S. military says Kurdish forces
backed by heavy coalition air strikes beat

05:27.194 --> 05:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back two major Islamic State attacks this
week. In the north, 500 fighters tried to

05:33.166 --> 05:39.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
breach Kurdish positions, and at least 180
were killed. In the west, others attacked

05:39.306 --> 05:41.841 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
government lines outside Ramadi.

COL. STEVEN WARREN, U.S. ARMY: In each place,
ISIL was able to muster an offensive effort,

05:51.551 --> 05:55.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which tells us that they've still got some
fight left in them. However, and much more

05:56.022 --> 06:01.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
importantly, in each fight Iraqi forces were
able to rebuff ISIL's efforts.

WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Ash
Carter spent the day in Afghanistan, promising

06:07.100 --> 06:12.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S. support in the face of a growing Islamic
State presence there. Carter's one-day visit

06:12.539 --> 06:18.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
came after the U.S. commander in Afghanistan
warned that ISIS militants from Syria and

06:18.645 --> 06:25.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Iraq are gathering in the east. They're joining
like-minded Afghans to gain a foothold there.

06:25.218 --> 06:30.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In the U.S. presidential race, the Bernie
Sanders campaign accused the Democratic National

06:30.924 --> 06:36.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Committee today of actively aiding frontrunner
Hillary Clinton. The dispute began with an

06:36.463 --> 06:42.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
accidental breach of the DNC's database for
voters. For half an hour, Sanders staffers

06:42.836 --> 06:49.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then allegedly used it to access some of Clinton's
voter data and the DNC has now cut off the

06:49.976 --> 06:52.345 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Sanders access to all of its records.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFF WEAVER, SANDERS CAMPAIGN MANAGER: The
leadership of the DNC is now actively attempting

06:57.450 --> 07:03.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to undermine our campaign. This is unacceptable.
Clearly in this case, it looks like they are

07:03.957 --> 07:05.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
trying to help the Clinton campaign.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

07:07.761 --> 07:13.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

director for misusing the Clinton voter information.

07:13.133 --> 07:18.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And later, it filed suit to regain access
to the Democratic voter data. For its part,

07:18.705 --> 07:23.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the DNC rejected the accusation that it's
playing favorites.

07:23.243 --> 07:28.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Chicago policeman who fatally shot a black
teenager last year had his first court appearance

07:28.848 --> 07:34.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today since being indicted. Jason Van Dyke
is charged with first-degree murder and official

07:34.587 --> 07:41.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
misconduct. Police video released last month
shows him shooting Laquan McDonald sixteen

07:41.294 --> 07:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
times. It triggered protests, it forced the
police chief to quit, and prompted federal

07:46.466 --> 07:48.034 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investigations.

07:48.068 --> 07:54.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

people of the risk and ordered half the city's
cars off the road.

08:41.521 --> 08:46.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the White House briefing room was a combination
year-in-review and year-to-come.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

08:47.894 --> 08:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OBAMA: As I look back on this year, the one
thing I see is that so much of our steady,

08:53.833 --> 08:59.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
persistent work over the years is paying off
for the American people in big, tangible ways.

08:59.172 --> 09:04.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: It was an upbeat assessment from
a president soon to enter his final year in

09:04.210 --> 09:10.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
office. He claimed a list of successes -- among
them, job growth and a surge of sign-ups for

09:10.517 --> 09:13.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
health care coverage -- and he promised more
to come.

09:13.553 --> 09:17.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OBAMA: For all the very real progress America's
made over the past seven years, we still have

09:17.490 --> 09:22.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some unfinished business. And I plan on doing
everything I can with every minute of every

09:22.662 --> 09:28.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
day that I have left as president, to deliver
on behalf of the American people. Since taking

09:28.034 --> 09:32.906 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this office, I have never been more optimistic
about a year ahead than I am right now. And

09:32.939 --> 09:36.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in 2016, I'm going to leave it out all on
the field.

09:36.342 --> 09:42.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: At the same time, Mr. Obama acknowledged
the growing challenge of confronting terrorism

09:42.215 --> 09:47.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at home and abroad, after the attacks in Paris
and San Bernardino, California.

Even so, he vowed to defeat the Islamic State
group.

09:51.925 --> 09:58.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OBAMA: And we're going to do so by systematically
squeezing them, cutting off their supply lines,

09:58.598 --> 10:03.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cutting off their financing, taking out their
leadership, taking out their forces, taking

10:03.670 --> 10:05.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out their infrastructure.

10:05.438 --> 10:13.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, in order for us to stamp them out thoroughly,
we have to eliminate lawless areas in which

10:13.947 --> 10:20.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they cannot still roam. So, we can disable
them, we can dismantle much of their infrastructure

10:20.753 --> 10:27.894 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and greatly reduce the threat that they pose
to the United States our allies and our neighbors.

10:27.927 --> 10:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our long term goal has to be to stabilize
areas so that they don't have any safe haven.

10:33.399 --> 10:37.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And in order for us to do that in Syria, there
has to be an end to the civil war.

10:37.937 --> 10:43.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Today, in fact, the U.N. Security
Council approved a resolution that outlines

10:43.510 --> 10:49.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a process for a limited cease-fire in Syria,
and peace talks. The U.S. wants the ouster

10:50.016 --> 10:55.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while
Russia supports him.

10:55.121 --> 10:59.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But President Obama made clear Assad is still
a central problem.

10:59.158 --> 11:06.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OBAMA: Assad is going to have to leave in
order for the country to stop the blood letting

11:06.432 --> 11:12.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and for all the parties involved to be able
to move forward in a nonsectarian way. And

11:12.338 --> 11:18.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I do think that you've seen from the Russians
a recognition that after a couple of months,

11:18.711 --> 11:23.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're not really moving the needle that
much, despite sizable deployment inside of

11:23.616 --> 11:31.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Syria. And, of course, that's what I suggested
would happen, because there is only so much

11:31.190 --> 11:39.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bombing you can do when an entire country
is outraged and believes that its ruler doesn't

11:39.832 --> 11:41.434 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
represent them.

11:41.467 --> 11:46.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: The news conference also came just
days after more than 190 nations reached a

11:46.706 --> 11:50.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
landmark deal on arresting climate change.

11:50.209 --> 11:53.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president brushed aside Republican opposition
to the deal.

11:53.947 --> 12:00.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OBAMA: Right now, the American Republican
Party is the only major party that I can think

12:00.553 --> 12:09.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of in the advanced world that effectively
denies climate change. I mean, it's an outlier.

12:09.862 --> 12:14.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, my sense is, is this is something that
may be an advantage in terms of short term

12:14.901 --> 12:19.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
politics in the Republican primary; it's not
something that is going to be a winner for

12:19.772 --> 12:21.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Republicans long term.

12:21.407 --> 12:25.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: On the other hand, the president
praised Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan's

12:25.745 --> 12:29.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
work on crafting the 2016 budget compromise.

12:29.215 --> 12:35.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OBAMA: It was a good win. And there are some
things in there that I don't like, but that's

12:35.922 --> 12:41.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the nature of legislation and compromise.
And I think the system worked. That gives

12:41.561 --> 12:50.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
me some optimism that next year, on a narrow
set of issues, we can get some more work done.

12:50.269 --> 12:55.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Later, the president and his family
left Washington, en route to California and

12:56.009 --> 13:01.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a meeting with families of the San Bernardino
attack victims. From there, it's on to Hawaii

13:01.914 --> 13:03.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the holidays.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

13:15.094 --> 13:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: As we just reported, late this afternoon,
the 15 nations on the United Nations Security

13:20.299 --> 13:26.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Council voted unanimously to endorse a framework
for a peace process in Syria, after nearly

13:26.739 --> 13:34.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
five years of brutal civil war that's left
more than 250,000 dead and millions displaced.

13:35.014 --> 13:36.649 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
For more, we go to Hari Sreenivasan.

13:36.683 --> 13:39.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN, PBS NEWSHOUR: And with me
to explore the details of this deal, what's

13:40.019 --> 13:43.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at stake, and the long road to this point
is chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret

13:43.589 --> 13:44.891 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Warner.

13:44.924 --> 13:46.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we've seen the headline during the day.
How significant is this?

13:47.026 --> 13:48.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER, PBS NEWSHOUR CHIEF FOREIGN
AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: This is a very deal,

13:48.594 --> 13:52.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hari. You've got all the members of the
Security Council, not just the members to

13:52.965 --> 13:56.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have the region who have been involved in
this, but all the members of the Security

13:56.102 --> 14:00.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Council, some of who vehemently disagreed
about the future of Syrian President Bashar

14:00.573 --> 14:07.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
al-Assad, to agree on resolutions setting
up the process that will set up not only a

14:07.313 --> 14:13.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ceasefire between Assad and many of his opposition
groups on the ground but direct talks between

14:13.519 --> 14:19.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the two of them. And it now has the imprimatur
of the U.N. Security Council, and Ban Ki-moon,

14:19.926 --> 14:22.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the secretary general, committed to help implement
it.

14:22.995 --> 14:26.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: So, there'd been a lot of countries
working toward this, but there are four major

14:26.933 --> 14:30.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
players and smack-dab in the middle of all
this is Bashar al-Assad.

14:30.103 --> 14:36.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARNER: That's right. The major division among
many concerns his future. On one side, you've

14:36.109 --> 14:42.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
got the United States and the Gulf states
who began all this wanting Assad gone as soon

14:42.982 --> 14:48.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as possible, and both have supported opposition
groups on the ground in different ways. But

14:48.755 --> 14:55.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the other side you've got Russia and Iran,
both of them regard Syria, and Syria is a

14:55.294 --> 15:01.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
client state for different reasons. Both of
them have sent military assistance weapons

15:01.167 --> 15:07.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
advisors, even fighters, and in Russia's case
bombs, to try to shore him up.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: And there's tensions between
the United States and Russia.

15:09.976 --> 15:13.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARNER: Yes, that's very true. Then you
have another cross-cutting tension between

15:13.613 --> 15:19.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the U.S. and Russia, which would be for influence
in this process. For a long time, Russia wasn't

15:19.051 --> 15:23.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very involved and then it inserted itself
in September by beginning this bombing, and

15:23.122 --> 15:26.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
won itself a place at the table, because they
want influence over the outcome.

15:26.692 --> 15:28.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: And Saudi Arabia and Iran have
their tensions.

15:28.661 --> 15:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARNER: They certainly do. And, in fact, that's
part of the knob of all of this. Saudi Arabia,

15:33.499 --> 15:40.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leader of the Sunni states in this region,
and Iran, of course, Shiite state, huge historical

15:40.239 --> 15:43.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rivalry for primacy in this region.

15:43.476 --> 15:46.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: All right. So, what do peace
players all actually get over their disagreements

15:47.013 --> 15:48.581 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and agree to?

15:48.614 --> 15:52.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARNER: Which really is incredible. I think
it's two things, Hari. One is threat of

15:52.585 --> 15:56.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
international terrorism. Even the Chinese
foreign minister this to reporters today,

15:56.789 --> 16:01.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we've got to get the process going because
of threat of international terrorism.

16:01.694 --> 16:08.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have come to the conclusion that they
can never take on ISIS until the boil of the

16:08.634 --> 16:15.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Syrian conflict, until they launch that boil.
That remember was the original, not only attracter

16:15.608 --> 16:22.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but incubator of all of the thousands of foreign
fighters coming in, helping beef up this al

16:22.448 --> 16:28.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Qaeda in Iraq that became ISIS, helping them
establish them this caliphate in the ungoverned

16:28.921 --> 16:33.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
portion of eastern Syria and roll on into
Iraq and they recognize there's no way to

16:33.626 --> 16:35.361 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
take them on.

16:35.394 --> 16:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The second thing that they've agreed on is
that, militarily, it can't be solved. Every

16:40.466 --> 16:44.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one of them, these four countries, has supported
different groups on the ground and they now

16:44.704 --> 16:50.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all realize they have been sucked into a quagmire.
There is no military resolution, has to be

16:50.610 --> 16:52.211 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
political.

16:52.245 --> 16:55.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: All right. So, one thing at the
dead center of all this is Assad. The next

16:55.314 --> 17:00.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
steps here, this agreement doesn't mention
him by name, which is one of those central

17:00.987 --> 17:02.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tensions you mentioned.

17:02.622 --> 17:06.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARNER: Absolutely, and they had to do it
that way because the differences remain and

17:06.125 --> 17:10.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so they had to finesse it. They talk about
a political transition. The United States

17:10.396 --> 17:15.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
believes if you have a transition to an inclusive
nonsectarian government which is its language

17:15.234 --> 17:21.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they've agreed on, there is no way an autocrat
for minority Alawites can be head of that

17:21.807 --> 17:25.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government, so they think you'll eventually
get to that point and the Russians have signaled

17:25.311 --> 17:30.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the United States they're not so much wedded
to Assad as the idea of a unitary state.

17:30.583 --> 17:36.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So the steps are a very, very tall order,
which is to set up both the ceasefire in January

17:36.555 --> 17:40.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and these direct talks. I think it's going
to be very hard. There are other disagreements,

17:40.927 --> 17:45.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
including who gets to sit in for the opposition.
This is just one step in other words of trying

17:45.765 --> 17:48.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to maintain the momentum to get to the political
resolution.

17:48.567 --> 17:52.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: And getting to the cease fire,
you have to know who's on which side of the

17:52.204 --> 17:52.605 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
table.

17:52.638 --> 17:54.273 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WARNER: Right.

17:54.307 --> 17:58.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: I mean, who exactly is the enemy
of Assad, which countries think should be

17:58.044 --> 17:59.011 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at the table.

17:59.045 --> 18:01.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WARNER: Very important point.

18:01.047 --> 18:06.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The opposition which have never agreed on
anything finally had a meeting in Riyadh a

18:06.252 --> 18:10.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
week ago and they actually chose the group
that then will choose the group to sit at

18:10.423 --> 18:12.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the table, OK? It's very indirect.

18:12.892 --> 18:17.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But meanwhile, all these other countries,
all of them, have different candidates that

18:17.863 --> 18:23.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they want to nominate for too much of the
terrorist to be at the table. So, they include

18:23.769 --> 18:27.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some groups that have been clients of Iran,
some of them clients of Saudi Arabia. All

18:27.506 --> 18:32.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of that is still unresolved. Jordan is supposed
to be coordinating this, poor Jordan, so that

18:32.545 --> 18:34.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
all remains to be÷}ijf÷ resolved.

18:34.046 --> 18:35.715 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: So, big first step today.

18:35.748 --> 18:40.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But thank you very much, Margaret Warner.

18:41.020 --> 18:45.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

18:59.472 --> 19:03.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But first, to the analysis of Shields and
Brooks. That is syndicated columnist Mark

19:03.843 --> 19:06.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Shields, and "“New York Times"” columnist
David Brooks.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, gentlemen.

19:08.247 --> 19:11.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we've been listening to -- we heard
Margaret just now talking to Hari about the

19:11.784 --> 19:15.021 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Syria -- what may be Syrian progress.

19:15.054 --> 19:19.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's talk about the president. He had a news
conference today, David. But look at his record.

19:19.358 --> 19:25.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, he said we're making progress, there's
still challenges. It says at the end of this

19:25.831 --> 19:31.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
yore, how have his policies worked in Syria,
against ISIS, in Iraq, you know, in both countries?

19:31.871 --> 19:34.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Yes, there
are a couple of layers here. The first one

19:34.473 --> 19:37.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is, he said quite accurately, we can't stop
all the lone wolves. You had a couple out

19:37.877 --> 19:40.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there in San Bernardino. Obviously, we can't
stop that.

19:40.446 --> 19:46.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are we making progress? He claims we are.
That's highly disputed. ISIS remains magnetic.

19:46.585 --> 19:50.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're drawing more forces, sometimes they
take ground, sometimes they lose ground, it's

19:50.956 --> 19:53.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not clear that we're necessarily making progress
against him.

19:53.993 --> 19:57.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The third thing and the biggest backdrop is,
we've just had for six years, an existentially

19:58.030 --> 20:03.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weak policy in that area. You know, he drew
a red line with Assad, he ignored it, he was

20:03.602 --> 20:07.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
asked by people in his own administration
to be more aggressive with ISIS, early on,

20:07.540 --> 20:09.308 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he wasn't.

20:09.341 --> 20:14.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In my view, we left Iraq too early and destabilized
the region. So, the existential issue is one

20:14.580 --> 20:19.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of passivity. And so, we made some progress
recently, but I would not -- but he's arguing

20:19.285 --> 20:23.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from a place of weakness because of the things
-- the mistakes that were made in the past.

20:23.722 --> 20:25.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Existentially weak position?

20:25.424 --> 20:30.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Yes, rather
than relitigate that, I mean, 14 years of

20:30.329 --> 20:38.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
war, there is no appetite in this country
for military intervention in the Middle East.

20:38.904 --> 20:44.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president, I think, most recently has
been caught flat-footed in understandable

20:44.677 --> 20:50.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
change in public interest, priorities and
concerns. I mean, you have the Russian airliner,

20:50.382 --> 20:57.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vacation civilians shot down by the same group
that then has the attack on Paris and paralyzes

20:57.256 --> 21:02.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the great city at night and then it's followed
up at least by disciples in San Bernardino

21:02.628 --> 21:06.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
massacring civilians at a Christmas party.

21:06.699 --> 21:13.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's understandable switch, a sea change
in American attitude and concerns, and from

21:13.139 --> 21:21.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the economy and jobs, to personal safety and
survival and concern about terrorism. The

21:21.514 --> 21:25.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
White House, the president in particular,
just didn't pick that up. I don't know why.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: Why not?

21:27.653 --> 21:32.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHIELDS: I don't know why, somebody suggested,
disdain for cable news that -- or whatever,

21:32.358 --> 21:42.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't know. But he didn't. What's been missing,
I would suggest, rather than policy, because

21:42.034 --> 21:46.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Norman Schwarzkopf, the great general, said
it doesn't take courage to order men into

21:46.205 --> 21:49.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
battle, it does take courage to go into battle.

21:49.575 --> 21:55.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The opposition right now is talking loosely
about going in, and getting tough and kicking

21:55.514 --> 22:00.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tail and all the rest of it, but what is missing
is any sense of resoluteness, or strength

22:00.986 --> 22:06.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the president. He talks about it like he's
talking about the gross domestic product and

22:06.325 --> 22:09.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
how it's grown and interest rates.

22:09.195 --> 22:10.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There isn't, to me, anyway --

22:10.896 --> 22:15.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROOKS: I agree. He hasn't reflected the fear
people feel, the concern people feel, that

22:15.734 --> 22:17.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- even the anger and outrage people feel.

22:17.703 --> 22:19.271 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
SHIELDS: Yes.

22:19.305 --> 22:22.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROOKS: But that's because of who -- he
who says A must say B. And so, if you don't

22:22.641 --> 22:28.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
want to get to -- if he says A, outrage, serious
problem, you have to have a new and aggressive

22:28.447 --> 22:33.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
policy, which he doesn't want to have. He
believes in the current policy. It's a moderately

22:33.519 --> 22:37.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
aggressive, maybe. But if he wanted to step
up the rhetoric, he'd have to step up the

22:37.456 --> 22:41.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
action and he doesn't want to step up the
reaction, therefore, he can't say really,

22:41.560 --> 22:43.229 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
verbalize much.

22:43.262 --> 22:46.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Well, how do you measure resoluteness?
I mean, Mark, you're saying because of his

22:46.432 --> 22:54.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
demeanor, he seems low key. Is that how you
measure whether someone is on a course they

22:54.273 --> 22:56.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
believe in and they're going to stick with?

22:56.242 --> 23:01.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHIELDS: Well, I mean, he was caught, Judy,
the president was caught on the red line,

23:01.180 --> 23:02.348 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
drawing the red line in Syria.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.016 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: A few years ago in Syria.

23:04.049 --> 23:09.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHIELDS: I mean, that was -- and so -- and
there is a retreat from that. And, he, you

23:09.521 --> 23:15.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know, whether through bad luck or just bad
judgment or bad information, he's equated

23:15.694 --> 23:22.268 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIS to how much geography it holds, and that
isn't the fear and the fear isn't whether

23:22.301 --> 23:28.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in fact they do own more acreage or dominate
more acreage, or more towns and cities, quite

23:28.841 --> 23:38.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bluntly, to Americans. It's the potential
for real damage and anxiety in this country.

23:38.317 --> 23:43.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then he made the reference to them as
junior varsity. I mean, it was the sense that,

23:43.489 --> 23:50.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you know, he didn't understand or didn't
at least project an understanding of the real

23:50.496 --> 23:55.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
risk that these folks presented.

23:55.868 --> 24:02.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What he has come from now is the Republicans
do not have any difference in -- with the

24:02.508 --> 24:05.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
exception of Lindsey Graham who says we have
--

24:05.344 --> 24:07.346 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: You mean the candidates.

24:07.379 --> 24:08.947 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
SHIELDS: Yes.

24:08.981 --> 24:10.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROOKS: I'm not sure I agree with that.
I mean, the speeches that were given -- the

24:10.783 --> 24:13.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obama speeches, compare to the Hillary Clinton
speeches, Hillary Clinton laid out a comprehensive

24:13.619 --> 24:18.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
plan with multi-prongs on how to deal with
Syria, which is much more aggressive than

24:18.123 --> 24:23.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anything Obama is doing. Marco Rubio and Jeb
Bush were not as specific as Clinton but basically

24:23.896 --> 24:28.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it overlaps a lot of what Clinton with a few
extra things. And Obama hasn't even done that

24:28.767 --> 24:31.804 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
far. He hasn't laid out a comprehensive plan.

24:31.837 --> 24:39.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those three, Clinton, Rubio, Bush, have basically
said the Sunnis themselves have to take out

24:39.278 --> 24:46.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIS with American -- Western air support,
and that means defanging Assad, because the

24:46.719 --> 24:52.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sunnis won't do it as long as they're being
barrel bombed.

24:52.991 --> 24:56.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so, that's a strategy. And Obama hasn't
likely gone there even. And so, there is been

24:56.395 --> 24:59.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a vacuity as to how he's talking about the
issue.

24:59.398 --> 25:04.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: But how do you -- how does the president
acknowledge that without giving into what's

25:04.603 --> 25:12.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now described as a climate of fear where everything
is something to be afraid of and Americans

25:12.211 --> 25:15.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
should be really rattled by what's happened
in San Bernardino?

25:15.647 --> 25:20.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHIELDS: Well, I mean, I think a good part
of it is the tone, the sense of resoluteness

25:20.619 --> 25:27.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or not. I mean, whether it's Churchill or
whatever. I mean, words do matter.

25:27.659 --> 25:34.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But where I disagree with David is, you know,
they ask the Republicans whether it's Bush

25:34.233 --> 25:40.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or Rubio, oh, yes, yes, we do -- we need drones.
We need drones. The president used drones

25:40.539 --> 25:45.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than anybody in the history of human
kind, with much criticism from the international

25:45.811 --> 25:47.513 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
community.

25:47.546 --> 25:51.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need more airstrikes. We are using airstrikes.
We need Special Forces. There are Special

25:51.917 --> 25:55.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Forces also, without revealing American secrets.

25:55.387 --> 25:59.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But nobody, nobody, with the exception of
Lindsey Graham is saying, let's go -- I

26:00.025 --> 26:03.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mean, Mike Huckabee says, yes, we should send
troops but I can't tell you how many because

26:03.862 --> 26:10.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that would be revealing. But I mean, Rubio,
they all talk tough, but they really don't

26:10.369 --> 26:12.237 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
come out.

26:12.271 --> 26:17.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I agree with you, Hillary Clinton is the one
Democrat who does come off as more commander-in-chief-ish.

26:17.376 --> 26:19.111 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
BROOKS: Yes.

26:19.144 --> 26:23.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Well, I want to ask about the Democrats
because, typically, people say when it comes

26:23.048 --> 26:26.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to national security, it plays to the strength
of the Republicans. But, David, you're saying

26:26.452 --> 26:28.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hillary is holding her own in that.

26:28.520 --> 26:29.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BROOKS: Yes. I mean --

26:29.288 --> 26:31.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: What about Bernie Sanders?

26:31.156 --> 26:34.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROOKS: I still think it generally helps Republicans.
But if any Democrat can maintain parity, it's

26:34.660 --> 26:36.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to be Hillary Clinton. People trust
her on that.

26:36.895 --> 26:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But this is a crushing blow. The shift in
the news has been a crushing blow to Bernie

26:40.599 --> 26:43.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sanders. There are other good things have
happened to him. He's got a base of support.

26:43.469 --> 26:45.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's gotten some endorsements. But it's
just a crushing blow.

26:45.671 --> 26:52.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think this and some of the Black Lives Matter
movement are just -- don't play to the strengths.

26:52.177 --> 26:58.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so, as long as the economy is number one,
inequality is number one, that's in his wheelhouse.

26:58.450 --> 27:02.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But especially with the attention shifting
to security, that's far out of the wheelhouse.

27:02.254 --> 27:03.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: Do you agree?

27:03.856 --> 27:06.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHIELDS: Yes, there is two profiles to the
party. I mean, the Democrats are the more

27:06.592 --> 27:09.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nurturing party, the party of social justice.

27:09.495 --> 27:14.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You ask people, who's better on education?
The Democrats. Who's better on climate change

27:14.900 --> 27:19.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or preserving the environment? Democrats.
Who's better for widows and orphans? Democrats.

27:19.204 --> 27:24.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Who's better on national security and terrorism?
The Republicans. Republicans are seen as historically

27:24.176 --> 27:28.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tougher. Whether in fact this is logical,
rational, these are the perceptions. So, the

27:28.313 --> 27:30.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans have a double-digit advantage
on it.

27:30.816 --> 27:38.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, you could go through and look for
the papers that -- observing any of those

27:38.757 --> 27:43.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the stage and the only one you find is
Lindsey Graham, but they all talk a very tough

27:43.328 --> 27:44.396 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
game.

27:44.429 --> 27:46.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: But you agree Bernie Sanders has
been hurt?

27:46.398 --> 27:48.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

27:48.066 --> 27:50.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHIELDS: Bernie Sanders -- this is not Bernie
Sanders' natural area. He was chairman of

27:50.235 --> 27:56.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
veterans committee, but, no, national security
is not his strength. And Hillary Clinton is

27:56.341 --> 28:01.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seen as somebody with steel in her spine.
She's seen as tough. She's seen as experienced.

28:01.113 --> 28:05.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She may not be seen as totally honest and
she may not be seen as absolutely likable,

28:05.584 --> 28:07.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but she is seen as tough, and experienced
and smart.

28:07.486 --> 28:11.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Well, there is another Democratic
issue that's come up just today, this breach

28:11.890 --> 28:15.928 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the Democrats voter parties -- voter database.

28:15.961 --> 28:23.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Sanders campaign recognized that there
was a technical glitch. They had access for

28:23.535 --> 28:28.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
half an hour or more. They say they didn't
do anything with that information they had

28:28.206 --> 28:33.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
access to. The Clinton campaign says they
did. The DNC has now shut down the Sanders'

28:33.645 --> 28:35.213 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
camp access.

28:35.247 --> 28:38.584 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is this -- I mean, right now, the Sanders
camp is suing the DNC, the Clinton people

28:38.617 --> 28:41.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are holding news conferences. Is this -- what
does this add up to, David?

28:42.020 --> 28:46.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROOKS: Well, the first bad part for the Sanders
campus, they saw a window and grabbed it,

28:46.992 --> 28:50.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and a couple -- at least a couple of staffers
did. Not just one. A couple of staffers grabbed

28:50.762 --> 28:53.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some information they probably didn't have
access to.

28:53.465 --> 28:57.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nonetheless, I do not think that people are
going to see Bernie Sanders as a corrupt man.

28:57.369 --> 28:59.004 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
SHIELDS: Yes.

28:59.037 --> 29:02.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROOKS: That is not his weak spot. So, I don't
think he'll be particularly hurt by this.

29:02.608 --> 29:06.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What could happen on the other hand is the
Clinton campaign is now in the midst of a

29:06.178 --> 29:12.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
massive overreaction, on Twitter and this
press conference, massively overreacting and

29:12.818 --> 29:17.889 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
making it look like they are the bully establishment.
And I don't know -- on the Republican side,

29:17.923 --> 29:22.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there is such a fervent anti-establishment
feel, that if somebody had a chance to run

29:22.227 --> 29:24.196 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
against the RNC for that candidate, golden.

29:24.229 --> 29:28.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm not sure the Democrats are that anti-establishment.
But it sure gives Bernie Sanders an opening

29:28.967 --> 29:33.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to say, the big powers in Washington, along
with Hillary Clinton are sealing up this game

29:33.639 --> 29:37.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and trying to shut me down, and I think that's
fertile for him.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHIELDS: Let me agree with David.

29:39.811 --> 29:45.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bernie Sanders, 2 million donors. Average
contribution is $30. Nobody else is even remotely

29:46.018 --> 29:49.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
close to that. It's a remarkable campaign.
It's gotten bigger crowds in the Republican

29:49.421 --> 29:53.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
front runner. I mean, he's really been,
it's a remarkable candidacy.

29:53.392 --> 30:02.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this -- Judy, the window is open, all
right? The curtains are up and the pretty

30:02.401 --> 30:09.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
girl is standing there in her night gown and
the Sanders people look in. They weren't breaking

30:09.241 --> 30:13.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in, they weren't trying to get in but it's
available. They look at the information for

30:14.012 --> 30:15.714 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
30 minutes, OK?

30:15.747 --> 30:19.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Clinton people, the last thing in the
world they want to be talking about is electronic

30:19.551 --> 30:23.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
data and computers with the Clinton email
problem.

30:23.321 --> 30:28.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And with Debbie Wasserman, the chair of the
Democratic National Committee having limited

30:28.193 --> 30:30.762 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the debates to five debates now --

30:30.796 --> 30:31.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: Democratic.

30:31.463 --> 30:32.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHIELDS: Democratic debates.

30:32.230 --> 30:33.799 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOODRUFF: Right.

30:33.832 --> 30:38.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHIELDS: One-half -- not even one-half as
the Republicans. It was open, free party.

30:38.603 --> 30:42.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Saturday night when -- Saturday night, the
lowest TV night of the week, that's when

30:42.774 --> 30:43.709 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they want it --

30:43.742 --> 30:45.410 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Another one coming up tomorrow night.

30:45.444 --> 30:48.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHIELDS: Tomorrow night, to limit it. Looks
like they tilted already in Hillary Clinton's

30:48.980 --> 30:50.816 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
favor.

30:50.849 --> 30:54.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And now she's depriving Bernie Sanders' campaign
of the one thing they have which is the information?

30:54.953 --> 31:00.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, their campaign was a door-to-door,
person-to-person campaign and they're going

31:00.192 --> 31:04.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to deprive them of that? I mean, it just looks
like David against Goliath, boy, I'm rooting

31:04.629 --> 31:06.331 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for David.

31:06.364 --> 31:09.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: So, what started out as an accusation
against the Sanders camp you're saying could

31:09.534 --> 31:12.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
end up helping Sanders?

31:12.137 --> 31:18.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROOKS: Yes, but the question is how much
anti-establishment is in the Democratic Party.

31:18.677 --> 31:22.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maybe they don't mind the establishment. Yes,
I sort of like the people that run my party.

31:22.114 --> 31:24.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans don't think that. They hate the
people that run their party. But I'm not

31:24.783 --> 31:26.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sure about the Democrats.

31:26.418 --> 31:30.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHIELDS: Yes, I just think -- I think bullying
and unfairness. And they've already had

31:30.689 --> 31:37.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
criticism from Tulsi Gabbard, the Democratic
vice chair of the committee, criticized Wasserman

31:37.829 --> 31:42.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the limited number of debates to favor
and to tilt in the advantage of Hillary Clinton,

31:42.868 --> 31:47.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
already. So, boy, I just think -- I think
the Clinton people are playing it dumb.

31:47.205 --> 31:50.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: This may have increased the audience
for tomorrow night, Democratic.

31:50.675 --> 31:52.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHIELDS: Let's hope.

31:52.277 --> 32:02.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Mark Shields, David Brooks, thank
you.

32:02.120 --> 32:04.890 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(MUSIC)

32:04.923 --> 32:11.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: As the holidays approach, it is
a time of the year when many are more focused

32:11.763 --> 32:17.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on trying to help those in need. We have a
look at a program that helps those on hard

32:17.903 --> 32:21.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
times learn new skills and find jobs.

32:21.373 --> 32:22.407 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

32:22.440 --> 32:24.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

32:24.142 --> 32:28.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is where rubber
meets the road, when you learn about management

32:28.380 --> 32:30.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and how to take care of your kitchen.

32:30.348 --> 32:33.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN, PBS NEWSHOUR CORRESPONDENT:
Morning class work at a well-established if

32:33.418 --> 32:39.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unlikely culinary school in our nation's capital;
the students, mere weeks from graduation.

32:39.324 --> 32:45.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, who can give me the
first principle of a hazard analysis critical

32:45.197 --> 32:46.865 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
control point?

32:46.898 --> 32:50.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: It's new territory for most of them.
Some are recently homeless, others recovering

32:50.368 --> 33:03.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from drug and alcohol addiction, newly-released
from prison or chronically unemployed.

33:03.748 --> 33:08.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Located in the basement of a large homeless
shelter just blocks from the White House and

33:08.553 --> 33:14.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S. capitol, D.C. Central Kitchen is the
nation's largest community kitchen. Its full-time

33:14.860 --> 33:20.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
professional staff, helped out by a steady
stream of volunteers, puts out 5,000 meals

33:20.398 --> 33:26.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a day, which are sent to homeless shelters,
schools, half-way houses and other non-profits

33:26.238 --> 33:28.707 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the area.

33:28.740 --> 33:33.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Much of the kitchen's output is prepared from
donated ingredients -- produce, canned goods,

33:33.912 --> 33:38.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
meat and fish that local restaurants and food
retailers would otherwise throw away.

33:38.550 --> 33:41.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE CURTIN, D.C. CENTRAL KITCHEN CEO: We
do so many things, all of which however are

33:41.486 --> 33:46.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
focused on and around the idea that waste
is wrong. And that waste could be --

33:46.091 --> 33:46.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BROWN: Waste is wrong?

33:46.958 --> 33:48.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CURTIN: Waste is wrong.

33:48.660 --> 33:54.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As a nation, almost 40 percent of the food
that we produce of the day goes in the garbage.

33:54.132 --> 33:57.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And yet, people are hungry. There's something
really, really wrong with that.

33:57.936 --> 34:04.376 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: For D.C. Central Kitchen CEO Mike Curtin,
reversing food waste is one-half the kitchen's

34:04.409 --> 34:05.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
two-pronged mission.

34:06.011 --> 34:08.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CURTIN: And while we're doing that, we're
training men and women who are coming out

34:08.647 --> 34:14.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of incarceration, battling addiction, surviving
abuse, homelessness and unemployment for jobs

34:14.686 --> 34:19.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in this hospitality business. We're trying
to bring these two things together around

34:19.457 --> 34:24.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the same table in a way that's going to create
positive economic growth and opportunity for

34:24.229 --> 34:25.764 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
everyone.

34:25.797 --> 34:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's better that we
start from here, because if we try to pile

34:28.199 --> 34:31.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
(ph) this way, we're going to get tired
because we're pushing all of this --

34:31.569 --> 34:36.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: That means the culinary program and
its students are deeply embedded in the kitchen's

34:36.408 --> 34:41.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
daily activities. It can be demanding, even
a little intimidating at times.

34:41.579 --> 34:43.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Say "thank you, chef,"
for what?

34:43.515 --> 34:45.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you, chef, for
straightening out my life.

34:45.951 --> 34:47.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MAEL: Any time.

34:47.652 --> 34:53.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: There is a kind of tough-love at work
here, and often, a bond of shared experience.

34:53.391 --> 34:54.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You know what this is like.

34:54.693 --> 34:55.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARIANNE ALI, DIRECTOR, CULINARY TRAINING
PROGRAM: Oh, absolutely.

34:55.527 --> 34:56.962 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BROWN: Tell me what you came from.

34:56.995 --> 35:00.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALI: I had a 20-year rough bout with heroin.

35:00.932 --> 35:04.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: Marianne Ali is director of the culinary
training program.

35:04.502 --> 35:08.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALI: I would say crack saved my life, because
if it wasn't, I could have probably been

35:08.740 --> 35:15.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a heroin addict for longer. But crack takes
you down so fast, and I was at the bottom

35:15.213 --> 35:17.048 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of rock bottom.

35:17.082 --> 35:22.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: She eventually got clean, went to culinary
school, then got a job with D.C. Central Kitchen.

35:22.687 --> 35:24.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What did you think you could bring to it?

35:24.456 --> 35:30.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALI: I knew that I could serve as an example,
you know, hopefully; that people would look

35:30.795 --> 35:38.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at me and say, "If she did it, then maybe
perhaps there's a chance", because recovery

35:38.403 --> 35:40.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is all, it's a lot about hope.

35:40.071 --> 35:45.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: But making a new start takes more than
knife skills and hope. Many of the changes

35:45.310 --> 35:49.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
required of these students are personal and
take place on the inside.

35:49.547 --> 35:54.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALI: How do I deal with my anger? How do I
deal with somebody who is an authority? How

35:54.853 --> 36:01.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do I deal with juggling, having to go see
my P.O. and being here on time and doing what

36:01.659 --> 36:05.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I need to do -- it's a lot to have to balance.

36:05.330 --> 36:11.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: Students Tamyra Hill and Terrell Nicholson
agree. She is a mother of three who's struggled

36:11.036 --> 36:12.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to find work in recent years.

36:12.737 --> 36:17.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMYRA HILL, CULINARY STUDENT: For me, the
hardest time is just being outside the classroom

36:17.475 --> 36:21.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and finding time to study and finding time
to prep for exams. Like I said, I have children;

36:21.246 --> 36:24.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have to help them with their homework, and
then after they are in bed I have to take

36:24.682 --> 36:29.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the time to study for myself. So, for me,
that has been -- I won't say a struggle,

36:29.821 --> 36:33.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but it has been the part I have to constantly
work on.

36:33.658 --> 36:38.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: Nicholson was released from prison
not long before he came to the program.

TERRELL NICHOLSON, CULINARY STUDENT: I never
had a problem getting a job; it was keeping

36:42.367 --> 36:49.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it that I had a problem with because I was
going interview and get a job, and I would

36:49.407 --> 36:55.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
work. But I would allow other influences to
keep me from staying focused.

36:55.847 --> 37:02.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: Teaching chefs Daniela Hurtado (ph)
and Anand Shantam see the challenges some

37:02.120 --> 37:05.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of their students face, trying to move from
one way of life to another.

37:05.857 --> 37:12.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANAND SHANTAM, CHEF INSTRUCTOR: If you've
got someone who's been unemployed, gone through

37:12.964 --> 37:19.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
addiction. It's hard to come into a learning
situation where they now have to get disciplined,

37:19.404 --> 37:28.813 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be on time, take constructive feedback and
not see it as criticism, but see it as an

37:28.847 --> 37:30.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
opportunity to grow.

37:30.482 --> 37:33.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANIELA HURTADO, CHEF INSTRUCTOR: Having the
right attitude. People will bump into you

37:33.885 --> 37:40.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
yes, the right attitude. People will bump
into, and sometimes you are defensive. And

37:40.758 --> 37:46.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from the environment that they are coming
from, sometimes it's kind of harsh. So, it's

37:46.865 --> 37:51.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not personal; those are some of the challenges
that we try to deal with here.

37:51.136 --> 37:57.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: The culinary training program runs
14 weeks -- including a four-week internship

37:57.609 --> 38:03.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in local restaurants and three weeks of guided
job-search -- and it boasts a stunning 80

38:03.615 --> 38:05.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
percent graduation rate.

38:05.717 --> 38:07.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Still, not everyone makes it.

38:07.886 --> 38:11.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CURTIN: We might find that they're not quite
ready. They haven't hit a place in their life

38:11.256 --> 38:20.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where they see this as a best path to take.
Addiction is a brutal mistress, and sometimes,

38:20.365 --> 38:23.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it takes longer for some people to work their
way out of it than others.

38:23.835 --> 38:28.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: The students we talked to felt they
were beginning to find their feet, and they

38:28.173 --> 38:29.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
credited the kitchen.

38:29.874 --> 38:32.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NATHANIEL TROLLER, CULINARY STUDENT: I have
three kids, so I want to be the father figure

38:32.343 --> 38:36.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for them so they won't chase the same things
I went through in my life.

38:36.481 --> 38:38.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LANDRELL JORDAN, CULINARY STUDENT: Coming
in here taught me how to get into the roots

38:38.149 --> 38:44.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of where my anger is coming from; the pain,
it taught me how to deal with it out, as you

38:45.023 --> 38:48.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
talk about, get it out, feel better about
myself, you know? And here I am now, I'm

38:48.426 --> 38:50.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
doing positive, something that I love.

38:50.562 --> 38:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: What do you think is the key to making
it work? Why does it work?

38:55.233 --> 38:58.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CURTIN: Because we meet people where they
are. We're really not here to judge what people

38:58.770 --> 39:02.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have done, or where they've been, or the decisions
they've made. We're here to talk about the

39:02.574 --> 39:07.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
future and to take what people have innately
and give that a little context and say this

39:07.579 --> 39:10.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is what you can do. If you work hard, if you
commit yourself, if you dedicate yourself

39:10.882 --> 39:13.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to this, you can be successful.

39:13.451 --> 39:19.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: And with 90 percent of the kitchen's
students finding jobs upon graduation, that

39:19.057 --> 39:22.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
formula seems to be working.

39:22.727 --> 39:30.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
From downtown Washington, D.C., I'm Jeffrey
Brown for the PBS NEWSHOUR.

39:35.340 --> 39:44.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: The blockbuster successful British
TV series, "“Downton Abbey"” begins its

39:44.415 --> 39:51.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sixth and final season here on PBS next month.
We got an inside look at the show, its creator

39:51.189 --> 39:54.626 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and explore why so many Americans love it.

39:54.659 --> 39:56.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

39:56.461 --> 40:04.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: The music is instantly recognizable,
as is the tail -- that's Isis, the dog -- both

40:04.769 --> 40:10.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
part of the opening credits to the blockbuster
British television drama, "Downton Abbey."

40:10.508 --> 40:15.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the past five years, the Crawley family
and their servants have entertained us, and

40:15.747 --> 40:22.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in January, the drama begins its sixth and
final season on PBS.

40:22.053 --> 40:28.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The last chance for a few more one-liners
from the dowager countess of Grantham, played

40:28.760 --> 40:36.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
exquisitely by Dame Maggie Smith.

40:36.768 --> 40:44.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And surely, one final calamity to beset lady's
maid Anna and her butler husband Bates.

40:44.375 --> 40:51.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The mastermind of this runaway success is
Sir Julian Fellowes; also an actor, film director,

40:51.049 --> 40:55.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and, in his spare time, a conservative member
of Britain's House of Lords.

40:55.753 --> 41:01.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, "Downton Abbey" coming to an end, is this
-- are you saying goodbye to a dear friend?

41:01.893 --> 41:03.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Or is it just -- have you already moved on?

41:03.695 --> 41:07.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIAN FELLOWES, CREATOR: No, I wouldn't
say I have moved on. I mean, "Downton" has

41:07.398 --> 41:13.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been an extraordinary milestone. You've
spent a lot of time in this industry, working

41:13.171 --> 41:17.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very hard on things that don't do terribly
well, the public doesn't get them or whatever,

41:17.408 --> 41:21.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and then you suddenly ring the bell. It's
been fantastic.

41:21.779 --> 41:28.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Fantastic beyond belief, becoming
the top-rated PBS drama of all time.

41:29.020 --> 41:36.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Globally, "Downton" airs in over 220 countries
with a worldwide audience of 120 million people.

41:36.427 --> 41:41.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FELLOWES: I never think it's a good idea to
outstay your welcome. And it seems right to

41:41.532 --> 41:44.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leave, so, I don't think we're doing the wrong
thing, but it's been a happy time.

41:44.535 --> 41:50.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: A happy time with roots in a book
by American historian Carol Wallace, author

41:50.808 --> 41:55.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of "To Marry an English Lord," Sir Julian's
inspiration for the series.

41:55.213 --> 41:59.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAROL WALLACE, AUTHOR, "“TO MARRY AN ENGLISH
LORD"”: When he had been asked by the producers

41:59.083 --> 42:08.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to write a series about English aristocrats,
he had been reading "To Marry an English Lord."

42:08.559 --> 42:14.732 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he said he thought it was all very well
for these heiresses to marry, but then what

42:14.766 --> 42:21.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happened to them 20 years later when they
were -- I think he put it -- "freezing in

42:21.072 --> 42:28.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a house in Cheshire, aching for Long Island"?
And that, of course, Cora Grantham's dilemma,

42:28.780 --> 42:30.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there she is right there.

42:30.548 --> 42:35.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Wallace's book tells the true stories
of young American heiresses who left the U.S.

42:35.853 --> 42:41.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the late 1800s to shop for husbands in
England. Their money attracted down at the

42:41.859 --> 42:46.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
heels aristocrats who had titles and little
else.

42:46.063 --> 42:49.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What would he have seen in these stories,
in this history?

42:49.200 --> 42:56.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WALLACE: I think what Julian saw, the source
of the drama is exactly the asymmetry of expectation

42:56.474 --> 43:01.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- what these American girls thought marriage
was going to be and what it turned out to

43:01.045 --> 43:08.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be, and how their American expectations kind
of, trailed along with them and formed their

43:08.319 --> 43:15.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relationships and their ideas of marriage
as they would 2030 years later.

43:15.293 --> 43:22.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: The American girl of "Downton Abbey",
Cora Crawley, countess of Grantham, is played

43:22.099 --> 43:25.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by Elizabeth McGovern.

43:25.570 --> 43:35.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELIZABETH MCGOVERN, ACTOR: I am shocked at
how sad I do feel to say goodbye to people

43:35.613 --> 43:44.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELIZABETH MCGOVERN, ACTOR: I am shocked at
how sad I do feel to say goodbye to people

43:44.522 --> 43:52.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and houses and the family. It's been a definite
life-changing kind of time for all of us.

43:52.530 --> 43:54.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: In what way?

43:54.265 --> 44:02.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MCGOVERN: Well, we've all been through something
that just felt it's had a big impact on our

44:02.140 --> 44:05.209 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
personal lives and we have been in it together.

44:05.243 --> 44:11.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: The drama began in 1912, the day
after the sinking of the Titanic, and has

44:11.549 --> 44:18.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
proceeded through World War I, the Spanish
flu and the jazz age. Season six is set in

44:18.256 --> 44:26.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
1925 and opens to find many formerly rich
families abandoning the life "Downton" epitomizes,

44:26.063 --> 44:32.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unable to afford the expanse. Like the character
she plays, McGovern is married to an Englishman

44:32.403 --> 44:34.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and lives in the U.K.

44:34.539 --> 44:37.742 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How is it different from other television
series?

44:37.775 --> 44:44.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MCGOVERN: Well, the one extraordinary difference
is that every word is written by one man.

44:44.315 --> 44:50.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't know of any other television show
that works that way. And I, to this day, find

44:50.755 --> 44:52.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it absolutely mindboggling.

44:52.590 --> 44:56.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Julian Fellowes did not intend on
being the sole writer.

44:56.994 --> 45:03.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FELLOWES: I was actually thrilled to get other
people to do it, but, for some reason which

45:03.801 --> 45:11.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I can't really explain, the series seem to
have quite a distinctive voice. And we did

45:11.242 --> 45:16.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
try, at the beginning, to see if we could
get other people to replicate that voice.

45:16.080 --> 45:22.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we tried with very good people. But it
seemed that if we wanted to sustain this particular

45:22.386 --> 45:23.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
voice, it had to be me.

45:23.988 --> 45:30.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REBECCA EATON, MASTERPIECE: It's coming
from his heart, his experience, his passion.

45:30.628 --> 45:37.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: PBS' Masterpiece presents "Downton
Abbey" in the United States, and Rebecca Eaton

45:37.101 --> 45:39.270 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is the program's executive producer.

45:39.303 --> 45:44.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EATON: There's a lot of heart in it. There's
a lot of generosity. These are characters

45:44.141 --> 45:49.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who are taking care of each other. And that
is a lot of who Julian is.

45:49.280 --> 45:56.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FELLOWES: We dealt with all the characters
very evenly.

45:56.654 --> 46:01.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We didn't say, "The family are the important
characters and the servants are the comic

46:01.058 --> 46:06.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relief, or servants are gallant on suffering
but the family is horrible," all of which

46:06.330 --> 46:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would have been a treatment in an earlier
period.

46:08.666 --> 46:14.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: You give equal time to everyone,
so, in a way you're looking at that age old

46:14.572 --> 46:23.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
struggle that we are dealing with today in
2015 about inequality, discrimination and

46:23.047 --> 46:25.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the rest of it. And you bring your own set
of views to that.

46:25.850 --> 46:30.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FELLOWES: It's this business of entitlement,
that a child of the middle or upper caste

46:30.554 --> 46:35.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is brought up to believe that certain things
are sort of their right, that this is the

46:35.426 --> 46:40.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way they will live. Whereas other people are
brought up to feel like outsiders -- "oh,

46:40.264 --> 46:44.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you're overreaching, so that's not for the
likes of us", and all this stuff still goes

46:44.135 --> 46:45.736 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

46:45.770 --> 46:50.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It does interests me. It shocks me and it
drives me mad when people try to pretend it

46:50.474 --> 46:55.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doesn't exist, because, of course, it doesn't
exist for them. There are millions of people

46:55.479 --> 47:00.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who are being cheated of their proper destiny
because it does still exist.

47:00.051 --> 47:04.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Do you think "Downton" contributes
to the conversation, to the discussion of

47:04.689 --> 47:06.257 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that?

47:06.290 --> 47:11.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FELLOWES: I hope it contributes. I mean, I
think in our society, particularly for the

47:11.195 --> 47:18.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"me-me-me generation," there is a kind of
underlined solipsism in so many of us that

47:18.235 --> 47:25.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the only life that's really happening is our
own. And everyone else's life is sort of dependent

47:25.342 --> 47:27.078 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on our life.

47:27.111 --> 47:36.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One of the important things about drama is
to remind the viewer that everyone is 100

47:36.687 --> 47:41.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
percent at the center of their own life. That
there is no life being lived under that roof

47:41.158 --> 47:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that is more or less important; that Mary
or Daisy, what happens to them is just as

47:48.999 --> 47:55.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
important. And that's why we have equal dramatic
weight for all the stories, to show that.

47:55.673 --> 48:00.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: What do you think will give people
great joy and excitement and surprise, in

48:00.111 --> 48:04.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a good way? And what do you think will leave
people sad or devastated or disappointed?

48:04.782 --> 48:10.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FELLOWES: I adore these questions because
they're always asked in such optimism, as

48:10.654 --> 48:16.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if there is any chance that I'll answer.
I mean, of course, there are some things in

48:16.994 --> 48:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the season that will make people sad and there
are other things that will make them happy.

48:22.700 --> 48:25.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Maggie will say some things that I hope
will make them laugh.

48:25.836 --> 48:29.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: What should fans expect, the audience
expect?

48:29.373 --> 48:36.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MCGOVERN: I would say that the audience will
feel satisfied that they've had a chance to

48:36.280 --> 48:46.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say goodbye to every character in a gratifying
way. I think they'll feel full and not shortchanged.

48:46.490 --> 48:52.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FELLOWES: It's enough for me that people
enjoyed it, and they had a thing on Sunday

48:52.329 --> 48:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
night and they would say to each other, hurry
up, "“Downton"” is starting in five minutes

48:56.734 --> 48:58.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or whatever. I love that.

48:58.369 --> 49:02.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that if we all manage to produce
a show that families could watch together

49:02.306 --> 49:06.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and argue over the water cooler in the office
the next day, that's enough of an achievement

49:06.710 --> 49:11.982 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for me. I don't need to feel that the world
will never be the same again after "Downton,"

49:12.016 --> 49:15.085 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
because it will.

49:15.119 --> 49:24.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And beginning the first Sunday in
January, fans can lose themselves in the lives

49:24.562 --> 49:27.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the people they have come to know as friends.

49:28.032 --> 49:41.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUBTITLE: Downton Abbey by the numbers: There
have been 255 cast members, 350 sets, 900

49:41.645 --> 49:42.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
crew, and 790 filming days.

49:42.613 --> 49:44.181 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(END VIDEOTAPE)

49:44.215 --> 49:46.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And a news update before we go,
the Pentagon announced it is investigating

49:46.684 --> 49:52.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
airstrikes today that may have killed Iraqi
soldiers. It would be the first friendly fire

49:52.423 --> 49:57.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deaths since the United States began bombing
the Islamic State in Iraq.

49:57.995 --> 50:03.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And finally, a bit of good news as we update
our recent story on how stress may be causing

50:03.834 --> 50:05.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
asthma among some kids.

50:06.003 --> 50:07.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

50:07.705 --> 50:13.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Last week, in a joint reporting
project with the Detroit News, we profiled

50:13.210 --> 50:18.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Seretha Lattimore (ph) and Duane Cole (ph),
Detroit parents who had been homeless for

50:18.549 --> 50:25.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than a year, often sleeping in the car
with their four youngest children. Nine-year-old's

50:25.723 --> 50:32.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Malik's asthma often is so severe, he'll
vomit or pass out especially on stressful

50:32.830 --> 50:33.797 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
days.

50:33.831 --> 50:37.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALIK COLE: I feel like I'm hurting, I'm
dying.

50:37.468 --> 50:43.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: As the weather turned colder in
late October, Malik's condition became unmanageable.

50:43.741 --> 50:49.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His parents reluctantly decided to turn the
children over to Child Protective Services

50:49.546 --> 50:55.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
until they could find stable housing. Malik
and his siblings were divided among four separate

50:55.886 --> 50:57.788 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
foster homes.

50:57.821 --> 51:04.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, much of that changed. The nonprofit
Detroit Rescue Mission ministry responded

51:04.128 --> 51:10.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the story by handing the family keys to
a fully-furnished, five-bedroom home. They

51:10.601 --> 51:15.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will be able to live there rent-free for two
years. They will then have the option to buy

51:15.773 --> 51:17.474 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the house.

51:17.508 --> 51:22.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The deal also comes with financial and educational
training for the parents, tutoring for the

51:23.013 --> 51:27.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kids, and a fully-stocked kitchen just in
time for Christmas.

51:27.518 --> 51:28.819 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(END VIDEOTAPE)

51:28.852 --> 51:31.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: What a great story and we're going
to follow that family.

51:31.956 --> 51:37.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On the NEWSHOUR online, we have a new project
we're excited to share with you. It's a science

51:37.294 --> 51:42.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
adventure story designed to be read to your
children at bedtime. For the first in our

51:42.166 --> 51:46.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
series, we tell the tale of the scientists
who journeyed deep into an underground cave

51:46.937 --> 51:53.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to dig up a remarkable trove of fossils, the
bones of a mysterious species called homo

51:53.610 --> 51:55.245 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
naledi.

51:55.279 --> 52:00.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These stories are designed to work well on
phones, tablets or to be printed out. We hope

52:00.117 --> 52:05.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you enjoy. All that and more is on our Web
site, pbs.org/newshour.

52:05.122 --> 52:11.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And a reminder about some upcoming programs
on PBS. Gwen Ifill is preparing for "Washington

52:11.228 --> 52:13.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

GWEN IFILL, WASHINGTON WEEK: As an eventful
year winds to an end, the president makes

52:17.634 --> 52:23.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his pitch, the Democrats begin to squabble,
interest rates go up and a budget gets passed.

52:23.374 --> 52:27.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Oh, and then there was that Republican debate.
We'll cover it all tonight on "Washington

WOODRUFF: On PBS NEWSHOUR Weekend Saturday,
how the city of Boston is using real-time

52:34.551 --> 52:38.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
data to track how well it delivers city services
to residents.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

52:40.057 --> 52:44.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARTIN WALSH, MAYOR OF BOSTON: Boston as a
city does a good job, both of creating services

52:44.828 --> 52:48.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in different areas. But we've never measured
how we do.

52:48.332 --> 52:52.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REPORTER: Walsh has a large data dashboard
in his office displaying real time information

52:53.003 --> 52:58.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from across the city, like the number of potholes
filled and the number of community center

52:58.542 --> 53:03.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
visits. A map shows each neighborhood Walsh
has visited this month and how often.

53:03.447 --> 53:06.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WALSH: I'm constantly looking at the screen.
I'm constantly looking at the measurements

53:06.784 --> 53:11.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of where we were in a day, where we were in
a year and looking at it. And it gives me

53:11.255 --> 53:17.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the opportunity to call a department head
or a manager or a cabinet chief, and ask them,

53:17.995 --> 53:20.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
why is something so low, why is something
so high?

53:20.464 --> 53:24.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REPORTER: So, from your office, here at city
hall, you basically have your finger on the

53:24.068 --> 53:25.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pulse of what's going on?

53:25.269 --> 53:26.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WALSH: Every single department, every single
day.

spice is raising havoc across America.

That's the NEWSHOUR for tonight. I'm Judy
Woodruff. Have a great weekend. Thank you

53:41.652 --> 53:46.990 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
