FROM SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, JEFF, GIVEN THE TOPSY-TURVY

02:08.428 --> 02:09.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATURE OF THIS CAMPAIGN CYCLE

02:09.997 --> 02:11.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND REALLY THAT THE NEWS SEEMS

02:11.498 --> 02:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE WHAT HAPPENS OFF THE

02:12.833 --> 02:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRAIL, NOT NECESSARILY WHAT

02:13.900 --> 02:15.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE DOING AS THEY CAMPAIGN,

02:15.736 --> 02:16.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE THERE STILL FACTORS THAT

02:16.803 --> 02:18.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD IMPACT THE ELECTION IN THE

02:18.238 --> 02:20.440 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE OUTCOME.

02:25.379 --> 02:26.813 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK THE ONE REAGAN-CARTER

02:26.813 --> 02:28.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEBATE IN 1980, WHICH HAPPENED

02:28.582 --> 02:29.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST A WEEK BEFORE THE ELECTION,

02:29.950 --> 02:31.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HELPED TURN THAT INTO A

02:31.151 --> 02:32.652 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LANDSLIDE.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.021 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CAMPAIGN OF GEORGE W. BUSH

02:34.021 --> 02:35.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS ALWAYS ARGUED THAT THEY LOST

02:35.789 --> 02:38.125 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE POPULAR VOTE BECAUSE OF A

02:38.125 --> 02:40.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LATE-BREAKING STORY ABOUT BUSH'S

02:40.060 --> 02:41.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOUTHFUL DRUNK DRIVING ARRESTS

02:41.695 --> 02:42.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT COST HIM, THEY THINK, A FEW

02:42.929 --> 02:44.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILLION EVANGELICALS.

02:44.398 --> 02:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT BY AND LARGE, THIS IS THE

02:46.533 --> 02:48.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERIOD-- DEBATES ARE OVER-- WHEN

02:48.435 --> 02:50.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RACE STABILIZES, WHICH IS

02:50.637 --> 02:53.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY A FIVE-POINT LEAD WITH ONE

02:53.006 --> 02:54.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEEK TO GO MEANS MUCH MORE THAN

02:54.608 --> 02:55.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A FIVE-POINT LEAD WITH A MONTH

02:55.776 --> 02:56.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO GO.

02:56.476 --> 02:58.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THE HOPE OF THE TRUMP

02:58.011 --> 03:00.280 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAMPAIGN IS THAT THERE ARE THESE

03:00.280 --> 03:01.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT TOLD THE

03:01.815 --> 03:02.749 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLLSTERS THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE

03:02.749 --> 03:03.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR TRUMP.

03:03.116 --> 03:04.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY POINT TO THE BREXIT

03:04.217 --> 03:05.118 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESULTS.

03:05.118 --> 03:05.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT

03:05.952 --> 03:07.254 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BREXIT POLLS WERE ACTUALLY

03:07.254 --> 03:09.589 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY, VERY CLOSE.

03:09.589 --> 03:11.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, WHILE IT'S POSSIBLE, IT'S

03:11.958 --> 03:13.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALSO POSSIBLE THAT, YOU KNOW,

03:13.126 --> 03:14.828 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMEN WHO WERE ON THE FENCE MAY

03:14.828 --> 03:15.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE BEEN PUSHED TO VOTE FOR

03:15.796 --> 03:18.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON BY TRUMP'S VARIOUS

COMMENTS.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT BY AND LARGE, YOU WOULDN'T

03:21.168 --> 03:22.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WANT TO BET THE FARM OR EVEN THE

03:22.869 --> 03:25.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHICKEN COOP ON A SUDDEN LATE

03:25.072 --> 03:26.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHIFT THIS LATE IN THE CAMPAIGN.

>> Sreenivasan: IS THERE A

03:27.674 --> 03:29.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POSSIBILITY FOR OVER-CONFIDENCE

03:29.543 --> 03:30.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THE CLINTON SIDE?

03:30.677 --> 03:31.711 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, THEY SAY THAT "WE'RE NOT

03:31.711 --> 03:32.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKING ANYTHING FOR GRANTED,"

03:32.679 --> 03:34.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT GIVEN WHERE THE MAJORITY OF

03:34.748 --> 03:36.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE POLLS ARE LEANING, WHERE THE

03:36.283 --> 03:37.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBABILITY PREDICTION MARKETS

03:37.784 --> 03:39.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO FORTH, AND GIVEN THAT

03:39.386 --> 03:40.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY THE ONLY POLL THAT

03:40.754 --> 03:41.788 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATTERS IS THE ONE THAT HAPPENS

03:41.788 --> 03:42.889 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

CLEAR LEAD FOR ONE CANDIDATE.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS IT THAT CANDIDATE'S

SUPPORTERS WHO THINK, "WELL, WHY

BOTHER, WE'VE WON?"

03:52.699 --> 03:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR IS IT THE TRAILING

03:53.733 --> 03:54.768 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CANDIDATE'S SUPPORTERS WHO

03:57.871 --> 03:59.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK YOU ALSO HAVE TO ACCOUNT

03:59.739 --> 04:01.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THE FACT THAT THE GROUND

04:01.641 --> 04:03.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GAME THAT WE SAW IN THE OBAMA

04:03.844 --> 04:05.178 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAMPAIGNS THAT IS VERY MUCH

04:05.178 --> 04:06.113 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN EVIDENCE IN THE CLINTON

04:06.113 --> 04:09.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAMPAIGN MAY COUNTER THAT.

04:09.182 --> 04:11.251 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS, NOW THAT THEY BELIEVE

04:11.251 --> 04:13.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY HAVE A CLEAR LEAD, THE

04:13.220 --> 04:14.187 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS GOING ALL

04:14.187 --> 04:15.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT TO PULL OUT THEIR VOTERS FOR

04:15.489 --> 04:17.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DOWN-BALLOT RACES-- WE'RE

04:17.390 --> 04:18.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT IN A

04:18.792 --> 04:19.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PIECE THAT WILL BE ON THE AIR

04:19.893 --> 04:20.560 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOMORROW.

04:20.560 --> 04:21.595 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT

04:21.595 --> 04:22.562 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN

04:22.562 --> 04:25.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOWS WITHOUT THE SENATE IN THE

04:25.232 --> 04:27.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRATIC HANDS, HER ROLE IF

04:27.134 --> 04:28.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE IS ELECTED PRESIDENT WILL BE

04:28.435 --> 04:29.870 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFINITELY TOUGHER.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.538 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I DON'T THINK OVER-CONFIDENCE

04:31.538 --> 04:32.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS GOING TO PLAY MUCH OF A ROLE

04:32.672 --> 04:33.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON NOVEMBER 8.

04:33.773 --> 04:34.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WITHOUT GIVING

04:34.474 --> 04:35.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOO MUCH AWAY ABOUT YOUR PIECE

04:35.675 --> 04:36.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOMORROW, HOW BIG IS THAT

04:36.776 --> 04:37.544 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COATTAIL EFFECT?

04:37.544 --> 04:39.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THAT?

04:39.279 --> 04:40.113 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I CAN GIVE YOU A DEFINITIVE

04:40.113 --> 04:42.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANSWER-- SOMETIMES IT IS AND

04:42.015 --> 04:43.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETIMES IT ISN'T.

04:43.850 --> 04:44.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN LYNDON JOHNSON WON A

04:44.985 --> 04:46.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LANDSLIDE IN 1964, HE BROUGHT

04:46.686 --> 04:48.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TONS OF DEMOCRATS IN ON DOWN-

04:48.955 --> 04:49.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BALLOTS.

04:49.789 --> 04:50.824 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REAGAN DID THE SAME THING IN

04:50.824 --> 04:51.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
1980.

04:51.458 --> 04:54.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE HELPED GET THE G.O.P. CONTROL

04:54.194 --> 04:55.962 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE SENATE WITH 12 SEATS, WON

04:55.962 --> 04:57.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
33 SEATS IN THE HOUSE.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WHEN NIXON WON A HISTORIC

04:59.466 --> 05:01.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LANDSLIDE IN '72, IT HAD NO

05:01.168 --> 05:01.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPACT.

05:01.835 --> 05:04.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND MY GUESS, OR THEORY IF I

05:04.004 --> 05:05.839 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WANT TO FANCY IT UP, IS WHEN AN

05:05.839 --> 05:08.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTION IS IDEOLOGICAL, IT CAN

05:08.408 --> 05:09.809 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE SERIOUS COATTAIL EFFECTS

05:09.809 --> 05:10.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE VOTERS ARE SAYING WE

05:10.810 --> 05:12.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WANT A CHANGE IN DIRECTION.

05:12.679 --> 05:14.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I BELIEVE IF CLINTON WINS IT IS

05:14.814 --> 05:17.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LARGELY A REPUDIATION OF TRUMP,

05:17.017 --> 05:18.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RATHER THAN SOME COMMITMENT TO

05:18.718 --> 05:20.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HER AGENDA.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT AS I SAID, THE OTHER THING

05:22.756 --> 05:23.790 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WE KNOW-- AND WE'LL TALK

05:23.790 --> 05:25.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THIS TOMORROW-- IS PEOPLE

05:25.025 --> 05:26.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPLIT THEIR TICKETS LESS.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, A HUGE WIN FOR CLINTON IS

05:28.228 --> 05:29.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKELY IT TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

05:29.863 --> 05:31.264 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPACT, PARTICULARLY IN THAT

05:31.264 --> 05:32.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SENATE RACE AND MAYBE EVEN IN

05:32.599 --> 05:33.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE HOUSE AS WELL.

05:33.667 --> 05:34.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: IS THERE GOING

05:34.367 --> 05:35.602 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE AN EVENT, AT LEAST UP TO

05:35.602 --> 05:37.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS POINT, THAT HELPED DEFINE

05:37.737 --> 05:39.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RACE, WHETHER IT'S DEBATE

05:39.272 --> 05:41.808 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERFORMANCES OR IT'S THE LEAKED

05:41.808 --> 05:43.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIDEO OF DONALD TRUMP'S COMMENTS

05:43.777 --> 05:45.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR THE PAPER CUT AFTER PAPER CUT

05:45.111 --> 05:46.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF WIKILEAKS E-MAILS BEING

05:46.580 --> 05:48.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELEASED WEEK AFTER WEEK?

05:48.481 --> 05:49.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE GENERAL THEORY AMONG

05:49.416 --> 05:51.184 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACADEMICS IS THAT CAMPAIGN

05:51.184 --> 05:54.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVENTS DON'T HAVE A KIND OF

05:54.421 --> 05:56.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HUGELY CONSEQUENTIAL EVENT.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS YEAR LOOKS LIKE IT MAY

05:58.625 --> 05:59.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHALLENGE THAT CONVENTIONAL

05:59.859 --> 06:02.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WISDOM BECAUSE THE FIRST DEBATE

06:02.028 --> 06:03.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE

06:03.463 --> 06:04.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TURNING POINT.

06:04.331 --> 06:05.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP HAD CLOSED TO WITHIN A

06:05.498 --> 06:07.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POINT OR TWO IN VIRTUALLY EVERY

06:07.267 --> 06:09.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLL, AND ONCE THAT FIRST DEBATE

06:09.369 --> 06:11.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENDED, CLINTON'S LEAD BEGAN TO

06:11.037 --> 06:13.173 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROW, AND IT HAS STILL GROWN AND

06:13.173 --> 06:16.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW STABILIZED UP TO THIS POINT.

06:16.276 --> 06:17.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REMEMBER, THE FUNDAMENTALS, THE

06:17.911 --> 06:19.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ECONOMIC DATA AND STUFF,

06:19.179 --> 06:20.547 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PREDICTED A CLOSE RACE.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THIS MAY BE A CASE WHERE AN

06:22.616 --> 06:24.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVENT ACTUALLY HAD AN IMPACT.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.219 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE QUICK FOOTNOTE-- THE

06:26.219 --> 06:27.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ECONOMIC FUNDAMENTALS, BARACK

06:27.721 --> 06:29.022 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBAMA'S APPROVAL RATINGS HAVE

06:29.022 --> 06:30.657 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL MOVED IN A DIRECTION IN THE

06:30.657 --> 06:32.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAST MONTH OR TWO THAT HELPS THE

06:32.459 --> 06:33.326 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRATS.

06:33.326 --> 06:34.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT I STILL THINK WE'RE GOING TO

06:34.194 --> 06:34.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOK BACK AT THAT FIRST

06:34.961 --> 06:36.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

AND SOUTH AFRICA SAID THE COURT

18:58.938 --> 19:00.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOULD NOT BE TELLING IT TO

19:00.906 --> 19:03.209 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

20:13.813 --> 20:17.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL SIX CURRENT PROSECUTIONS OR

20:17.550 --> 20:19.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROSECUTIONS IN THE PROCESS ARE

20:19.985 --> 20:22.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF AFRICANS, AND SO FAR, THE

20:22.888 --> 20:25.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I.C.C. HAS NOT INDICTED OR

CHARGES HAVE BEEN PRESSED.

20:41.340 --> 20:42.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO AFRICAN LEADERS HAVE

20:42.641 --> 20:44.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID-- THEY'VE COMPLAINED FOR A

20:44.276 --> 20:46.278 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUPLE OF YEARS NOW OR MORE

20:46.278 --> 20:48.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IT'S ONLY AFRICANS THAT THE

20:48.814 --> 20:50.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I.C.C. IS PRESSING CHARGES

20:50.216 --> 20:52.251 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAINST, AND THEY THINK THAT

20:52.251 --> 20:53.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS UNFAIR.

20:53.619 --> 20:55.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW, TO BE

20:55.121 --> 20:56.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLEAR, THE UNITED STATES IS A

20:56.388 --> 20:57.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIGNATORY, BUT IT HAS NOT

20:57.556 --> 20:58.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RATIFIED.

20:58.290 --> 20:59.425 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT IS NOT AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF

THE I.C.C.

21:00.126 --> 21:02.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, IF THESE NATIONS START TO

21:02.228 --> 21:03.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITHDRAW, WHAT HAPPENS TO THE

21:03.262 --> 21:04.830 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVERALL WEIGHT THAT THE I.C.C.

21:04.830 --> 21:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARRIES?

21:08.033 --> 21:09.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK THAT IT COULD

TREMENDOUSLY WEAKEN.

21:11.704 --> 21:14.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

INTERNATIONAL LAW EXPERTS WHO

21:19.044 --> 21:22.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY THIS COULD SERIOUSLY WEAKEN

21:22.081 --> 21:23.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE I.C.C.

21:23.516 --> 21:24.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS YOU SAY, THE UNITED STATES IS

21:24.984 --> 21:26.152 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT A FULL MEMBER.

21:26.152 --> 21:27.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT
