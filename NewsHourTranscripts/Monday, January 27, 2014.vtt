THE POINT.                      
THEY WERE PROTESTING THE SIM    

41:17.042 --> 41:18.069
THE POINT.                      
THEY WERE PROTESTING THE SIM    
BEE OWE SIS OF CHURCH AND       

41:18.070 --> 41:18.402
THEY WERE PROTESTING THE SIM    
BEE OWE SIS OF CHURCH AND       
STATE.                          

41:18.404 --> 41:19.431
BEE OWE SIS OF CHURCH AND       
STATE.                          
PROCESSING THE FACT THAT THE    

41:19.433 --> 41:20.793
STATE.                          
PROCESSING THE FACT THAT THE    
HEAD OF THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX    

41:20.796 --> 41:21.857
PROCESSING THE FACT THAT THE    
HEAD OF THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX    
CHURCH WAS COMPANING FOR        

41:21.859 --> 41:23.152
HEAD OF THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX    
CHURCH WAS COMPANING FOR        
PUTIN AND AGAINST THE           

41:23.154 --> 41:24.514
CHURCH WAS COMPANING FOR

PUTIN AND AGAINST THE           
PROTESTORS.

41:26.244 --> 41:26.940
PROTESTORS.                     
SO I THINK THAT IT IS VERY      
DIFFICULT TO ANSWER THE         

41:26.942 --> 41:27.936
SO I THINK THAT IT IS VERY      
DIFFICULT TO ANSWER THE         
QUESTION HOW DOES RUSSIA SEE    

41:27.938 --> 41:28.633
DIFFICULT TO ANSWER THE         
QUESTION HOW DOES RUSSIA SEE    
THEM.                           

41:28.636 --> 41:29.664
QUESTION HOW DOES RUSSIA SEE    
THEM.                           
BECAUSE RUSSIA IS NOT A         

41:29.665 --> 41:30.327
THEM.                           
BECAUSE RUSSIA IS NOT A         
WHOLE COUNTRY.                  

41:30.330 --> 41:31.856
BECAUSE RUSSIA IS NOT A         
WHOLE COUNTRY.                  
RUSSIA IS A COUNTRY THAT IS     

41:31.858 --> 41:33.551
WHOLE COUNTRY.                  
RUSSIA IS A COUNTRY THAT IS     
EXTREMELY POLARIZED AND         

41:33.552 --> 41:36.640
RUSSIA IS A COUNTRY THAT IS     
EXTREMELY POLARIZED AND         
RIPPED APART BY THE LAST 14     

41:36.642 --> 41:37.970
EXTREMELY POLARIZED AND         
RIPPED APART BY THE LAST 14     
YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP.          

41:37.972 --> 41:39.564
RIPPED APART BY THE LAST 14     
YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP.          
SO THERE IS THE RUSSIA THAT     

41:39.566 --> 41:40.960
YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP.          
SO THERE IS THE RUSSIA THAT     
WATCHES TELEVISION THAT SEES    

41:40.962 --> 41:42.255
SO THERE IS THE RUSSIA THAT     
WATCHES TELEVISION THAT SEES    
THEM AS WOMEN WITHOUT WANT      

41:42.257 --> 41:46.075
WATCHES TELEVISION THAT SEES    
THEM AS WOMEN WITHOUT WANT      
IN AND BEHAVED A BOMB INABLY    

41:46.077 --> 41:47.006
THEM AS WOMEN WITHOUT WANT      
IN AND BEHAVED A BOMB INABLY    
IN THE CHURCH.                  

41:47.008 --> 41:49.065
IN AND BEHAVED A BOMB INABLY    
IN THE CHURCH.                  
AND THEN THE MUCH SMALLER       

41:49.067 --> 41:51.091
IN THE CHURCH.                  
AND THEN THE MUCH SMALLER       
RUSH THAT DOESN'T WATCH         

41:51.093 --> 41:52.154
AND THEN THE MUCH SMALLER       
RUSH THAT DOESN'T WATCH         
TELEVISION THAT ARE SOMEHOW     

41:52.156 --> 41:53.185
