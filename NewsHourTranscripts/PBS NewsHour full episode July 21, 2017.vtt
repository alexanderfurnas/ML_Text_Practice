HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.

00:05.633 --> 00:06.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

00:06.633 --> 00:08.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Judy Woodruff is away.

00:08.066 --> 00:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On tonight's "PBS NewsHour":
a White House shakeup.

00:10.533 --> 00:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Press Secretary Sean Spicer
resigns after a disagreement
with President Trump -- what

00:14.300 --> 00:18.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the change means for the
administration, as it
struggles to stay on message.

00:18.433 --> 00:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also ahead, 50 years after the
Detroit riots, we ask how those
tumultuous times have shaped

00:24.900 --> 00:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relations between the city's
white and black communities.

00:26.566 --> 00:29.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Is the
city of Detroit better
off today than it was?

00:29.700 --> 00:30.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LORETTA HOLMES,
Detroit: Heck no.

00:30.700 --> 00:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: In the '60s?

00:31.700 --> 00:32.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LORETTA HOLMES: No.

00:32.966 --> 00:35.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Better
off than five years ago?

00:35.100 --> 00:36.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LORETTA HOLMES:
Than five years ago?

00:36.533 --> 00:38.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Yes, because now I
can see the change.

00:38.533 --> 00:40.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
And it's Friday.

00:40.533 --> 00:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks
are here to analyze yet
another busy week of news.

00:44.333 --> 00:46.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Plus, Barefoot Contessa.

00:46.466 --> 00:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ina Garten invites us into her
kitchen to tell us the story
of how she went from a federal

00:50.166 --> 00:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bureaucrat to a
household name, as one of
America's beloved cooks.

00:53.633 --> 00:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
INA GARTEN, Chef: I taught
myself how to cook when
I worked in Washington
using Julia Child's

00:59.766 --> 01:01.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cookbooks.

01:01.733 --> 01:05.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:07.566 --> 01:10.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:10.333 --> 01:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Moving and
shaking today in the White
House communications staff.

01:18.466 --> 01:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sean Spicer resigned as press
secretary after just six months,
saying the president needs

01:23.300 --> 01:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a -- quote -- "clean slate."

01:25.333 --> 01:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it was widely reported that
he objected to the naming of
Wall Street financier Anthony

01:29.133 --> 01:31.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Scaramucci as
communications director.

01:31.766 --> 01:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At a White House briefing,
Scaramucci sought to play
down talk of any discord.

01:35.633 --> 01:37.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, Incoming
White House Communications
Director: For me, as
it relates to Sean, it

01:37.366 --> 01:42.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
speaks volumes to who he
is as a human being, who
he is as a team player.

01:42.733 --> 01:44.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

01:44.800 --> 01:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So his attitude is, if
Anthony's coming in, let me
clear the slate for Anthony.

01:47.233 --> 01:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I do appreciate that about
Sean, and I love him for it.

01:49.800 --> 01:52.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I don't have any
friction with Sean.

01:52.200 --> 01:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
Scaramucci also named
Spicer's deputy, Sarah
Huckabee Sanders, to be the

01:56.300 --> 01:58.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
new press secretary.

01:58.433 --> 02:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a statement, President Trump
praised Spicer's work, and said
-- quote -- "Just look at his

02:01.133 --> 02:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
great television ratings."

02:03.100 --> 02:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The spokesman for the
president's legal team, Mark
Corallo, also resigned today.

02:06.666 --> 02:10.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That came amid reports that the
lawyers are hunting possible
conflicts of interest by

02:10.966 --> 02:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
special counsel Robert Mueller.

02:12.933 --> 02:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mueller is investigating Russian
meddling in the 2016 election.

02:16.533 --> 02:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The White House would neither
confirm nor deny the reports.

02:19.966 --> 02:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president's lead lawyer did
deny a Washington Post account
that they're examining whether

02:24.700 --> 02:28.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Mr. Trump could pardon
relatives, aides
and even himself.

02:28.666 --> 02:33.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We will take a closer
look at all of this
after the news summary.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Israeli-Palestinian
tensions erupted into
street battles today between
police and protesters

02:36.933 --> 02:38.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in Jerusalem and the West Bank.

02:38.866 --> 02:43.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At least three Palestinians were
killed, and nearly 400 hurt.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Exploding stun grenades
drowned out Friday prayers in
Jerusalem, as ambulance sirens

02:48.866 --> 02:51.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wailed.

02:51.033 --> 02:55.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Palestinians called it a
day of rage, protesting
Israel's installation
of metal detectors at

02:55.366 --> 02:58.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a holy site revered by
both Muslims and Jews.

02:58.400 --> 03:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
This place is made
for worshipping God.

03:01.833 --> 03:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They cannot prevent Muslims
from entering to pray.

03:04.433 --> 03:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They are acting against God.

03:06.433 --> 03:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Israelis
put up the metal detectors
after Arab-Israeli gunmen

03:09.200 --> 03:12.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
killed two police
officers last Friday.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It happened at the complex known
as the Temple Mount to Jews and
the Noble Sanctuary to Muslims.

03:18.966 --> 03:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Inside, Al-Aqsa Mosque, the
third holiest site in Islam, and
the Dome of the Rock, they're

03:22.333 --> 03:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bordered by the Western Wall,
the holiest site in Judaism.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tensions have been building
ever since the shooting.

03:29.200 --> 03:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Overnight, the streets of
Jerusalem's Old City were
filled with protesters throwing

03:33.533 --> 03:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stones and security forces
firing back with grenades.

03:37.233 --> 03:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, police refused to
remove the metal detectors, and
barred Muslim men younger than

03:43.100 --> 03:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
50 from entering the holy site.

03:45.300 --> 03:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Security checkpoints also
blocked busloads of Muslims
traveling to Jerusalem.

03:49.300 --> 03:51.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICKY ROSENFELD, Israeli
Police Spokesman: The security
measures will continue in and

03:51.400 --> 03:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around the area of the Old City
and the Temple Mount, in order
to prevent any further terrorist

03:55.800 --> 03:58.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
attacks.

03:58.400 --> 04:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But the
grand mufti of Jerusalem
rallied thousands of
Muslims to pray outside

04:01.200 --> 04:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the gates of the old city, under
the watch of Israeli forces.

04:04.700 --> 04:07.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He predicted a
long test of wills.

04:07.033 --> 04:10.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMIN AL-HUSSEINI, Grand Mufti of
Jerusalem (through translator):
We do accept any restrictions

04:10.366 --> 04:12.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on the door of the
Al-Aqsa Mosque.

04:12.433 --> 04:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Therefore, all the Palestinian
people reject these gates
and refuse to accept or enter

04:17.200 --> 04:19.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
through them.

04:19.266 --> 04:22.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The violence
broke out after prayers, and
spilled over to towns across

04:22.966 --> 04:25.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the West Bank.

04:25.500 --> 04:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later, the day of rage
turned to grief, as
mourners held a funeral
for one of the Palestinian

04:29.500 --> 04:31.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
dead.

04:31.600 --> 04:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a Palestinian stabbed
three Israelis to death
in a West Bank settlement.

04:34.300 --> 04:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, Palestinian President
Mahmoud Abbas announced he's
freezing contacts with Israel

04:38.666 --> 04:40.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on all levels.

04:40.733 --> 04:44.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Afghanistan, the
U.S. military confirms
that a NATO airstrike
mistakenly killed Afghan

04:44.533 --> 04:46.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
troops today.

04:46.533 --> 04:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officials say it happened during
an operation against Taliban
fighters in Helmand Province

04:49.533 --> 04:51.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the south.

04:51.166 --> 04:54.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The provincial governor
says at least two
Afghan commanders died.

04:54.500 --> 04:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson
is urging Gulf nations to
lift their economic blockade

04:58.533 --> 05:00.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Qatar.

05:00.566 --> 05:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and
the UAE have imposed sanctions
on Qatar over charges of

05:04.433 --> 05:05.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
financing terror groups.

05:05.966 --> 05:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, Tillerson met with
the Omani foreign minister.

05:08.900 --> 05:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He commended the oil
state's efforts to comply
with an agreement on
curbing terror financing.

05:13.733 --> 05:17.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary
of State: They have been very
aggressive in implementing

05:17.166 --> 05:19.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that agreement.

05:19.266 --> 05:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we are -- I think we're
satisfied with the effort
they are putting forth.

05:21.300 --> 05:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think they also have indicated
a willingness to sit with the
four parties and negotiate,

05:25.033 --> 05:27.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
discuss the demands.

05:27.066 --> 05:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Meanwhile,
Qatar's emir denounced the
blockade as a smear campaign,

05:32.533 --> 05:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but said he's open to dialogue.

05:34.533 --> 05:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump is demanding
that Iran release the American
citizens it is holding.

05:38.133 --> 05:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a statement this evening,
the White House warned of new
and serious consequences unless

05:42.700 --> 05:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tehran frees all unjustly
imprisoned Americans.

05:46.166 --> 05:49.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At least three U.S. citizens
are currently jailed in Iran.

05:49.666 --> 05:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A powerful earthquake shook
the coasts of Turkey and
Greece early today, killing at

05:53.800 --> 05:55.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
least two people.

05:55.833 --> 05:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The quake was centered near the
Greek island of Kos, and the
Turkish tourist hub of Bodrum.

06:01.866 --> 06:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nearly 500 people were injured,
and the tremor caused heavy
damage to buildings, roads and

06:06.333 --> 06:07.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
historical sites.

06:07.866 --> 06:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thousands of tourists were
forced to sleep outdoors.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Some tried to leave,
but got stranded.

06:12.833 --> 06:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
We were woken up at
1:30 in the morning.

06:17.800 --> 06:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We were wondering what happened.

06:19.633 --> 06:20.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everything was shaking.

06:20.866 --> 06:23.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We panicked and didn't
know what was going on.

06:23.033 --> 06:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we quickly gathered our
stuff and went out of the hotel,
because, as it was several

06:27.533 --> 06:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
floors high, we didn't want
it to fall on our heads.

06:30.733 --> 06:31.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Everyone was out in the street.

06:31.966 --> 06:33.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was a massive panic.

06:33.733 --> 06:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In the hotel lobby, vases
and lamps were upside down.

06:36.666 --> 06:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The two
people killed were identified as
tourists from Turkey and Sweden.

06:40.800 --> 06:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The State Department has
announced a ban on Americans
traveling to North Korea.

06:45.233 --> 06:50.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A statement today cited
the serious risk of
arrest and long-term
detention in the North.

06:51.700 --> 06:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The move follows the death of
college student Otto Warmbier.

06:53.866 --> 06:58.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He was jailed in North
Korea on a charge of
stealing a propaganda
poster, then sent home

06:59.000 --> 06:59.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in a coma.

He died last month.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And on Wall Street, stocks
ended the week in retreat.

07:03.466 --> 07:07.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Dow Jones industrial
average lost 31 points
to close at 21580.

07:07.100 --> 07:10.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Nasdaq fell two
points, and the S&amp;P 500
lost about one point.

07:10.666 --> 07:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the week, the Dow was
down a fraction of a percent.

07:13.600 --> 07:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose more than
1 percent, and the S&amp;P
was up half-a-percent.

07:17.600 --> 07:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the
"NewsHour": multiple White House
shakeups, Press Secretary Sean

07:24.500 --> 07:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Spicer and the president's
legal team; the partisanship
that's plagued efforts to revamp

07:28.000 --> 07:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the nation's health care;
Mark Shields and David Brooks
analyze the week's news; and

07:32.733 --> 07:37.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
much more.

07:44.666 --> 07:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a tumultuous day in
the Trump administration,
with a major shakeup
involving the public

07:49.266 --> 07:51.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
faces of the Trump presidency.

07:51.366 --> 07:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All this came among new reports
of conflict within Mr. Trump's
legal team, as they prepare

07:56.066 --> 07:59.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to respond to the
investigation by special
counsel Robert Mueller.

07:59.700 --> 08:04.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We break it down now
with Rosalind Helderman,
political enterprise and
investigations reporter

08:04.033 --> 08:05.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for The Washington Post.

08:05.200 --> 08:06.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for joining us.

08:06.900 --> 08:10.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What's the Trump legal
team's strategy to deal
with this investigation?

08:10.033 --> 08:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSALIND HELDERMAN, The
Washington Post: Well, we
reported today that the
legal team is examining

08:14.300 --> 08:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a broad array of options that
would allow it -- or would
lead to the restraining or

08:20.733 --> 08:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
restricting of the special
counsel's investigation.

08:24.266 --> 08:29.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At present, they say they are
cooperating with special counsel
Bob Mueller, but we understand

08:31.233 --> 08:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they are doing research
into possible conflicts by
Bob Mueller himself, conflicts

08:36.000 --> 08:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of interest or members of his
staff that he is assembling.

08:38.800 --> 08:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Keep in mind that conflict of
interest is one of the only
things in the regulations

08:43.533 --> 08:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
establishing the special
counsel that can be used by
the attorney general or in this

08:50.533 --> 08:53.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
case the acting attorney
general, Rod Rosenstein, to
dismiss the special counsel.

08:53.766 --> 08:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So they are looking at that and
a number of other things that
would try to curb this sort

08:58.600 --> 09:01.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of scope of this
expanding investigation.

09:01.700 --> 09:05.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Did
any of these conflicts
of interests come up when
Mueller was originally

09:05.533 --> 09:07.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
assigned to the task?

09:07.033 --> 09:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Did Jeff Sessions or anyone
else give him a pass on these?

09:10.233 --> 09:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROSALIND HELDERMAN: Yes,
that's a good question that
we don't entirely know yet.

09:14.233 --> 09:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We do know that President
Trump himself has said that he
interviewed Bob Mueller to be

09:21.133 --> 09:24.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FBI director very shortly
before his appointment
as special counsel.

09:26.733 --> 09:29.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the conflict that we
reported today the White House
has been examining is, of

09:29.466 --> 09:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all things, Bob Mueller's
membership at the Trump
National Golf Course
in Northern Virginia.

09:36.466 --> 09:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Apparently, White House advisers
tell us there was some variety
of dispute over his membership

09:41.400 --> 09:43.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fees at that club.

09:43.066 --> 09:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, Mueller's office has
told us that's not true.

09:45.733 --> 09:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was no membership fee
dispute, so we're continuing to
try to learn more about that.

09:49.600 --> 09:54.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But whatever happened at
the golf club, President
Trump clearly didn't
see it as an impediment

09:56.666 --> 09:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to potentially appointing Bob
Mueller to be FBI director, so
it's interesting that they're

09:59.433 --> 10:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now returning to that topic.

10:01.433 --> 10:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Let's talk
a little bit about the legal
team that seems to be changing,

10:04.333 --> 10:06.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at least faces, in
the past few days.

10:06.166 --> 10:08.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ROSALIND HELDERMAN:
That's right.

10:08.266 --> 10:11.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We saw today the resignation
of Mark Corallo, who had been
sort of the spokesman for the

10:11.700 --> 10:13.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
team.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He had been officially the
spokesman for Marc Kasowitz.

10:15.966 --> 10:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a New York-based attorney
who had worked with Donald Trump
on various matters for many

10:22.333 --> 10:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years who has been until
today the leader of this team.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There have been some
reports that he is leaving
the team altogether.

10:30.466 --> 10:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our reporting is that Kasowitz
is remaining aboard, but is
going to take a reduced role.

10:35.433 --> 10:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The leader now is John Dowd,
who was hired last month, a
veteran Washington litigator.

10:42.433 --> 10:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had been involved in
the investigation of Pete
Rose of baseball fame.

10:46.133 --> 10:48.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's leading the team.

10:48.200 --> 10:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jay Sekulow, familiar to
television viewers, remains on
the team as sort of its public

10:53.400 --> 10:55.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
face.

10:55.333 --> 10:57.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The individual
that you mentioned, Mr.
Dowd, actually came out in

10:57.366 --> 11:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Wall Street Journal and kind
of questioned this reporting
that The Washington Post had

11:01.200 --> 11:06.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
done and said that it's not true
that President Trump and his
team were looking into the act

11:07.400 --> 11:10.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of possibly pardoning
his aides or himself.

11:10.966 --> 11:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are multiple lawyers.

11:12.466 --> 11:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is it just the lawyers that
you spoke to vs. Mr. Dowd?

11:14.566 --> 11:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROSALIND HELDERMAN: So, we
feel very comfortable in
our sourcing for our story.

11:18.333 --> 11:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When he said that this morning,
we did add those comments
-- they were on the record

11:22.533 --> 11:26.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
- - to our story to
reflect his denial.

11:26.500 --> 11:31.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We feel comfortable that
our story was accurate
and accurately reflected
conversations that

11:31.033 --> 11:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have been going on amongst
this large legal team.

11:34.666 --> 11:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would note Mr. Dowd gave an
interview to The Wall Street
Journal in which he said that

11:41.700 --> 11:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in fact the legal team is not
at all interested in the topic
of conflicts of interest.

11:44.600 --> 11:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, Jay Sekulow was quoted in
that very same story as saying
they are looking at conflicts,

11:49.000 --> 11:52.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that any reasonable
lawyer would do so.

11:52.100 --> 11:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there was a conflict right
there in the same story from
two different lawyers for

11:56.933 --> 11:59.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the team.

11:59.466 --> 12:01.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: If I'm
a lawyer representing
somebody like the
president, wouldn't it be

12:01.166 --> 12:04.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
normal for me to say
let's look at the tools
that my clients have?

12:04.833 --> 12:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If one of the tools includes a
presidential pardon, shouldn't
I just investigate what

12:09.633 --> 12:11.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the parameters of
that pardon are?

12:11.933 --> 12:13.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ROSALIND HELDERMAN:
Yes, absolutely.

12:13.966 --> 12:18.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And as we reported, we
do believe that this
was a conversation about
legal options, that

12:20.666 --> 12:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this wasn't the president saying
that he plans to pardon himself
or that he believes he is

12:25.333 --> 12:29.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ultimately going to
need a pardon, which
is to say he believes
he's going to be accused

12:29.166 --> 12:31.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of a crime.

12:31.200 --> 12:35.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was a conversation
about legal options and the
powers of the presidency.

12:37.066 --> 12:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How does the president go about
or what's the breadth of his
authority to pardon staff,

12:42.300 --> 12:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to pardon family members,
and indeed what does the
Constitution say and the law say

12:45.566 --> 12:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about a president pardoning
himself, which actually is a
question of rather distinct

12:50.233 --> 12:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dispute in the legal community?

12:52.333 --> 12:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
and, finally, briefly, in the
sources that you have spoken

12:54.966 --> 12:59.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with, is the shakeup or
at least the changeover
in the legal team, as
well in the communications

12:59.200 --> 13:01.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
department ,part of
something bigger?

13:01.333 --> 13:05.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROSALIND HELDERMAN: I think
there's a sort of sense of a
White House on edge right now.

13:06.533 --> 13:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's a lot of turmoil.

13:08.466 --> 13:12.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I certainly wouldn't
guarantee that we have seen
the end of the changes.

13:12.266 --> 13:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, we will all note that
the president had those very
harsh words for Attorney General

13:16.700 --> 13:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeff Sessions earlier
this week in an interview
with The New York Times.

13:21.100 --> 13:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're told that people in the
White House were quite surprised
that those comments didn't

13:25.133 --> 13:26.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
result in Jeff
Sessions resigning.

13:26.900 --> 13:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He instead came out and said
he planned to stay on the job.

13:29.700 --> 13:31.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, that's in the air.

13:31.933 --> 13:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The chief of staff, Reince
Priebus, there's been many,
many rumors that he's on his way

13:36.300 --> 13:37.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out.

13:37.766 --> 13:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I don't think that the
team is settled by any means.

13:41.433 --> 13:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All
right, Rosalind Helderman
at The Washington Post,
thanks so much for

13:44.000 --> 13:45.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
joining us tonight.

13:45.533 --> 13:50.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ROSALIND HELDERMAN:
Thank you for having me.

HARI SREENIVASAN: From the
White House to Capitol Hill.

14:00.833 --> 14:03.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For seven months, congressional
Republicans have taken a
sharply partisan route on health

14:03.600 --> 14:05.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
care.

14:05.533 --> 14:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have made several attempts
to repeal and replace the
Affordable Care Act, which

14:08.533 --> 14:10.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have failed.

14:10.033 --> 14:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But why did Republicans go
partisan in the first place?

14:12.466 --> 14:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of a cultural
shift in Congress years in
the making for both parties.

14:17.366 --> 14:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Our Lisa Desjardins explains.

that every Republican

MAN: Our Democratic friends
are trying to make it more
difficult for President Trump

14:34.066 --> 14:35.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

tune.

LISA DESJARDINS: More blame
than legislation on the floor.

Veteran GOP Senator Susan
Collins of Maine has

SUSAN COLLINS (R), Maine: We are
in a time of hyper-partisanship
that is unlike any other

14:56.733 --> 15:00.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that I have seen in
my time in the Senate.

15:00.300 --> 15:03.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Some
examples this year?

15:03.066 --> 15:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans going it alone on
health care, with a partisan
House vote and a Republican-only

15:10.466 --> 15:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
closed-door process in
the Senate, Democrats
forcing symbolic late-night
sessions and boycotting

15:15.600 --> 15:19.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
committee hearings,
slowing the legislative
process to a near stop.

15:19.633 --> 15:24.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this month, Republican
Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell blamed
Democrats for his decision

15:25.700 --> 15:26.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to postpone the
Senate's August recess.

15:26.633 --> 15:28.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:28.666 --> 15:30.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader: Due
to this unprecedented
level of obstruction

15:30.600 --> 15:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we have been experiencing,
we will be in session the
first two weeks of August.

15:34.733 --> 15:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: All just five
weeks after this: a gunman
opening fire on a Republican

15:41.733 --> 15:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
baseball practice, leaving House
Majority Whip Steve Scalise
initially in critical condition,

15:47.000 --> 15:48.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and still recovering.

15:48.900 --> 15:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The attack brought a chorus
of calls for bipartisanship.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

15:53.766 --> 15:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), House
Minority Leader: We are not
one caucus or the other in this

15:54.666 --> 15:55.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
House today.

15:55.666 --> 15:57.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

15:57.166 --> 15:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House: We are united.

15:59.166 --> 16:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Later that day,
the managers of the Republican
and Democratic teams urged

16:02.266 --> 16:03.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an end to the sharp divide.

16:03.800 --> 16:05.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

16:05.866 --> 16:09.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOE BARTON (R), Texas: We
have an R or a D by our name,
but our title -- our title is

16:15.333 --> 16:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
United States representative.

16:17.633 --> 16:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: We caught up
with Representatives Joe Barton
and Mike Doyle again, and asked

16:24.400 --> 16:25.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
if things have changed.

16:25.400 --> 16:26.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

16:26.866 --> 16:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE DOYLE (D), Pennsylvania:
There's no cure for this.

16:28.100 --> 16:30.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it's not just
our responsibility.

16:30.133 --> 16:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bipartisanship either gets
fanned or, you know, encouraged
by outside forces, too.

16:36.966 --> 16:40.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But both
say too many members get
attention now with sharp words.

16:40.866 --> 16:42.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

16:42.833 --> 16:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOE BARTON: At the end of
every two years, do you want
to go home and say, man, I gave

16:45.500 --> 16:49.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a heck of a press conference,
or do you want to put something
else on your wall, that you

16:49.866 --> 16:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have got a bill signed into law?

16:51.833 --> 16:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Barton admits
he was once a young bomb
thrower, and accepts some blame

16:55.433 --> 16:56.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for his party.

16:56.433 --> 16:57.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

16:57.900 --> 17:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOE BARTON: When I got elected,
I joined the Gingrich group.

17:00.133 --> 17:03.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So I was a part of the
problem at the time.

17:03.233 --> 17:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In the
1994 Republican Revolution,
then-new Speaker Gingrich
made partisan battles

17:09.066 --> 17:11.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a central strategy.

17:11.033 --> 17:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Years later, in 2013, Democrats
upped the partisan ante,
changing Senate rules to push

17:17.333 --> 17:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
through some nominees
with no Republican votes.

17:19.900 --> 17:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, partisanship, even
partisanship, is as old as
Congress itself, from duels,

17:26.900 --> 17:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to a near fatal beating inside
the Senate chamber, to this
staircase outside the House

17:30.366 --> 17:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chamber, where you can still
see what is said to be blood
stains from where a newspaper

17:34.033 --> 17:39.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reporter shot a former
member of Congress in 1890.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But divide can have a
purpose, says Amy Walter of
The Cook Political Report.

17:46.266 --> 17:49.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook
Political Report: I don't
think partisanship in
and of itself is a bad

17:49.466 --> 17:51.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
thing.

17:51.933 --> 17:55.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The challenge is when that
alone is what prevents
people from working
together to do other things.

17:58.933 --> 18:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Part of the
trouble, fewer moderates.

18:01.833 --> 18:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Data from The Cook Political
Report shows that, 20 years
ago, more than a third of all

18:06.566 --> 18:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House districts were
moderate, voting similarly
to the nation as a whole.

18:11.233 --> 18:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, since then, House districts
have become more partisan,
red or blue, and the number

18:17.600 --> 18:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of moderate or swing
seats has fallen by half.

18:20.100 --> 18:24.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And they have all
been replaced by ideologues
either on the left or the right.

18:24.566 --> 18:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: One reason,
special interest groups on the
left and the right are spending

18:28.833 --> 18:33.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
record amounts of money
in ads, and increasingly
scoring lawmakers' votes
on sometimes narrow

18:34.900 --> 18:35.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issues.

18:35.900 --> 18:37.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Again, Susan Collins:

18:37.133 --> 18:39.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

18:39.200 --> 18:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN COLLINS: Unfortunately,
there's a lot of pressure
from outside special interest

18:44.466 --> 18:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
groups to toe the party line.

18:47.600 --> 18:52.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They want 100 percent fidelity,
100 percent of the time, to
100 percent of their views.

18:56.900 --> 19:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, if you deviate, you are
going to feel the consequences.

19:03.933 --> 19:08.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: All
this underscores how a
major issue like health
care remains unresolved,

19:09.700 --> 19:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and it sets up a great struggle.

19:11.666 --> 19:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To get anything done,
Republicans in power may soon
have to work with Democrats.

19:17.366 --> 19:20.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Lisa Desjardins.

19:20.966 --> 19:25.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

19:33.400 --> 19:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
what's stifling race relations
in Detroit 50 years after the

19:40.400 --> 19:43.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
1967 riots; lessons on life and
cooking from Ina Garten; and a
behavioral scientist's advice

19:45.666 --> 19:47.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on talking to your
kids about marijuana.

19:47.933 --> 19:51.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But, first, the analysis
of Shields and Brooks.

19:51.233 --> 19:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist
Mark Shields and New York
Times columnist David Brooks.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's good.

19:56.233 --> 19:57.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It looks like you're
paying attention.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, Hari.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right.

20:00.233 --> 20:01.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, let's start
with health care.

20:01.900 --> 20:04.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This week, we started
with repeal and replace.

20:04.900 --> 20:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then it went to
repeal now, replace later.

20:07.700 --> 20:09.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Neither of those seem
to be going anywhere.

20:09.566 --> 20:14.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: The
Republicans' health care
plan had three problems.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It wasn't healthy, it wasn't
caring, and there was no plan.

20:18.100 --> 20:19.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

20:19.333 --> 20:21.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: It was
just that simple.

20:21.766 --> 20:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you can't get
people to vote for something
when they don't know,
A, what it is, there's

20:24.333 --> 20:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no public case for it, but,
beyond that, it just -- the
conservatives, led by Rand Paul,

20:30.766 --> 20:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
objected that it didn't root
out and repeal Obamacare.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That was correct.

20:36.100 --> 20:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the moderates, embodied by
Susan Collins, who we just saw
in the previous piece, objected

20:42.200 --> 20:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that it was going to hurt,
unnecessarily and gratuitously,
millions of Americans who are

20:46.266 --> 20:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
needy and depend on Medicaid.

20:48.266 --> 20:49.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
True.

20:49.466 --> 20:52.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, the two were
almost irreconcilable.

20:52.633 --> 20:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think they can't figure
out now how to leave the
field without embarrassment.

20:59.133 --> 21:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ideally, if you're a Republican,
you do not want to vote on this.

21:02.633 --> 21:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You do not want to vote
Tuesday, because it's going
to be used against you.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is incredibly unpopular.

21:07.533 --> 21:09.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's got 16 percent
support in the country.

21:09.900 --> 21:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is not one person
of the 213 in Republican
- - in the House of
Representatives voted against

21:16.366 --> 21:19.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it who regrets having
voted against it.

21:19.100 --> 21:24.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there are scores of House
members in the 217 who voted
for it who are nervous that

21:24.833 --> 21:25.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they voted for it.

21:25.633 --> 21:26.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, that's where it is.

21:26.866 --> 21:29.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I
don't think it's dead.

21:29.600 --> 21:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, from what I hear,
they're leaning on Mike Lee,
the senator who has been a no

21:33.066 --> 21:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vote who is the decisive no
vote, to change his mind, to
buy him out with something and

21:37.500 --> 21:39.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
offer him something.

21:39.500 --> 21:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then they figure, once they
get him on board, there are
probably another Republican

21:41.733 --> 21:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
15 senators who would like to
vote no, but they don't want
to be the one person who kills

21:45.566 --> 21:47.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

21:47.700 --> 21:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the feeling, if you
can get Mike Lee, you can
get some of the others.

21:49.733 --> 21:51.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they might pass it.

21:51.766 --> 21:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wouldn't say it's likely,
but I think -- I just think
it's too early to say it's dead

21:54.733 --> 21:56.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

21:56.466 --> 22:00.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The second thing to say
is, Mitch McConnell has
two parts of his job.

22:00.766 --> 22:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The one is to create a
process where reasonable
legislation gets promoted.

22:07.133 --> 22:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the second is to whip
for that legislation.

22:09.100 --> 22:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think he did an abysmal
job on one job and a
pretty good job on job two.

22:12.733 --> 22:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As Mark said, you have got a
plan with 16 percent approval.

22:16.633 --> 22:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nobody in the Senate likes
it, including the Republicans.

22:19.533 --> 22:21.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They all hate having
to vote for it.

22:21.166 --> 22:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he still got 48 votes.

22:23.133 --> 22:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's kind of impressive.

22:25.100 --> 22:29.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the underlying problem
is, you have a chance to
change, to reform health care.

22:30.700 --> 22:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are a lot of conservative
ideas to reform health care.

22:32.133 --> 22:33.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it would solve
some problems.

22:33.600 --> 22:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You could pick some things that
a lot of people would like.

22:35.733 --> 22:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You could have catastrophic
coverage for the 20-odd million
people that are still uninsured

22:39.633 --> 22:41.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
after Obamacare.

22:41.700 --> 22:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You could do a lot of -- offer a
lot of things to a lot of people
and do it in a conservative

22:44.633 --> 22:45.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

22:45.866 --> 22:47.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But that's not what this
Republican Party does.

22:47.533 --> 22:50.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They just say, we
want to cut Medicaid.

22:50.100 --> 22:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're unwilling to
talk about anything positive,
though there are some things in

22:53.733 --> 22:55.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the bill.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's just, what can
we take away from you?

22:57.066 --> 22:59.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what can we take away
from the poor and the
needy and the children?

22:59.300 --> 23:04.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it's a publicity and
a substantive disaster
area that they're just
trying to live with.

23:04.200 --> 23:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What about
the president's role in this?

23:06.133 --> 23:09.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: The president's
role in it is mercurial.

23:09.666 --> 23:13.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He said let Obama
founder and burn.

23:13.633 --> 23:18.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then the next day,
he says no, within 24
hours to the Republican
senators, you have got to

23:18.433 --> 23:19.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
come up with a plan.

23:19.666 --> 23:21.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He knows nothing
about the specifics.

23:21.633 --> 23:23.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He knows nothing
about the substance.

23:23.300 --> 23:25.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's made no public case for it.

23:25.166 --> 23:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't -- I think David
makes a very compelling point.

23:29.633 --> 23:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would just say this, that
Mitch McConnell had a reputation
as this master strategist.

23:37.166 --> 23:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what Mitch McConnell's
greatest accomplishment
as leader has been is
that he denied a hearing

23:42.833 --> 23:46.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to one of the sixth
most qualified nominees
to the Supreme Court
in the last century.

23:46.966 --> 23:49.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's it.

23:49.066 --> 23:52.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a big difference between
obstruction and construction and
putting together a coalition.

23:52.166 --> 23:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's a lot easier to get
people to vote against something
than it is to vote for something

23:56.133 --> 23:58.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and to take a chance.

23:58.200 --> 24:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when you're denied the
individual mandate, that is you
let healthy young people not pay

24:05.066 --> 24:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anything, you leave as a
pool of people for insurance
who are older and sicker.

24:11.266 --> 24:13.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Therefore, it's going
to be more expensive.

24:13.300 --> 24:17.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, you know, this isn't
rocket scientists, in spite of
the president saying it's a lot

24:17.133 --> 24:19.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more complicated than it is.

24:19.600 --> 24:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I thought
something important
happened with the
Republican views with the

24:22.100 --> 24:23.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

24:23.600 --> 24:25.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were having all these
meetings in the White House.

24:25.600 --> 24:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, apparently, they'd have
these substantive meetings with
Mike Pence or with somebody

24:29.200 --> 24:30.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
else, with staff.

24:30.400 --> 24:31.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they would talk
through things.

24:31.633 --> 24:33.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They would try to
make some progress.

24:33.766 --> 24:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then the president would
dip in and do something, say
something extremely stupid,

24:36.800 --> 24:38.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
extremely ill-informed.

24:38.866 --> 24:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then they would all
groan and live through it
and wish he would leave.

24:42.500 --> 24:43.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And then he would go.

24:43.933 --> 24:47.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so that could be a
change in psychology.

24:47.233 --> 24:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Everybody in the Senate has
problems with the president.

24:49.800 --> 24:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if you begin to have, oh,
he's just the crazy uncle,
like an attitude of contempt,

24:56.766 --> 24:59.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then relationships between
the Republicans on the Hill
and the White House really do

24:59.466 --> 25:01.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
begin to change.

25:01.066 --> 25:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not some guy, oh, he
has some political magic.

25:02.700 --> 25:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's some guy who really just
is annoying and gets in the way.

25:05.966 --> 25:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Let's talk
about the interview that he gave
to, some people would call it

25:09.033 --> 25:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the paper of record, and
the President Trump calls it
the failing New York Times.

25:13.300 --> 25:18.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In this conversation, which is
worth reading in its entirety,
it's just fascinating, he

25:19.500 --> 25:21.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lashes out at lots
of his supporters.

25:21.100 --> 25:23.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He undermines his
own attorney general.

25:23.933 --> 25:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He goes after almost a
broadside to Robert Mueller.

25:27.533 --> 25:29.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He talks about
blackmail and Comey.

25:29.433 --> 25:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What did you glean out of that?

25:31.433 --> 25:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: First, our
subscription levels have been
way up since the Trump era.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one of our journalists
tweeted out, we even
fail at failing.

25:36.833 --> 25:38.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's how bad we are.

25:38.933 --> 25:40.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

25:40.633 --> 25:42.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: And there
are a couple things to
say about the interview.

25:42.866 --> 25:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One, I was shocked by the
lack of just articulateness.

25:47.500 --> 25:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We all hate it when we read
a transcript of ourselves.

25:49.933 --> 25:52.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's always embarrassing,
but not that embarrassing.

25:52.166 --> 25:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These really are random --
they're not even thoughts.

25:55.266 --> 25:59.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They're just little word
patterns, one following
another, about Napoleon,
about this and that.

25:59.866 --> 26:03.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a disturbing level
of incoherent thinking.

26:03.666 --> 26:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Second, it is -- you know,
people who work for the White
House work for the guy 16, 20

26:08.533 --> 26:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hours a day, And
Jeff Sessions in the
administration among them,
and to dump over everybody.

26:15.900 --> 26:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then what is interesting
to me psychologically,
usually, when someone
is corrupt or -- they

26:19.766 --> 26:23.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are clever.

26:23.366 --> 26:25.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They try to dissemble.

26:25.000 --> 26:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They mask their corruption with
some attempt to be dishonest.

26:29.833 --> 26:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump, give him credit,
he's completely transparent.

26:32.233 --> 26:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He basically said in that
interview, my corruption can
be found in my tax returns.

26:37.200 --> 26:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you look into my tax
returns, I will fire you.

26:40.033 --> 26:45.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He transmits everything that
he's thinking out in public
in an incredibly transparent

26:45.733 --> 26:47.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

26:47.600 --> 26:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we're looking at a fact
where Bob Mueller will
probably go to the tax returns.

26:49.800 --> 26:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump will
probably fire Bob Mueller.

26:51.833 --> 26:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then we will be in some
sort of constitutional crisis.

26:53.900 --> 26:57.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's all telegraphed
right there out in the open.

26:57.366 --> 27:00.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: I
was amazed by it.

27:00.000 --> 27:05.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, first of all, I guess
just on a personal level, this
is a man for whom there is no

27:06.200 --> 27:08.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
loyalty, no sense of
loyalty in anybody.

27:08.366 --> 27:13.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, Jeff Sessions, whatever
one thinks of him, was a
Republican senator from Alabama,

27:13.366 --> 27:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the first senator in the
country to endorse Donald
Trump, and a strong supporter.

27:17.733 --> 27:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as attorney general, all
Donald Trump cares about, is
Jeff Sessions going to protect

27:25.866 --> 27:27.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me?

27:27.066 --> 27:29.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it shows I think
a couple things.

27:29.666 --> 27:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It shows the obsession he has
with the Russian investigation.

27:34.200 --> 27:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no two ways about it.

27:36.300 --> 27:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, again, he recycles
these baseless charges about
Jim Comey, that he perjured

27:43.166 --> 27:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
himself in testimony before the
Senate Intelligence Committee,
which he didn't, that he leaked

27:49.466 --> 27:52.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
confidential information,
which he didn't.

27:52.033 --> 27:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And -- but there's absolutely
no sense of loyalty that he
has to anyone else, Donald

27:58.900 --> 28:00.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

28:00.966 --> 28:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just find that -- you
know, we talk about, is there
smoke there or whatever?

28:04.266 --> 28:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His obsession with the
Russian investigation,
now he's back blaming
Rod Rosenstein for firing

28:10.766 --> 28:12.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Comey.

28:12.800 --> 28:15.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he went on Lester Holt
on NBC News and took credit
for it, said, didn't make any

28:15.166 --> 28:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
difference what Sessions
and Rosenstein recommended.

28:17.933 --> 28:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was going to fire him anyway.

28:20.300 --> 28:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I'm just -- there's
no coherence to the man,
but there's an obsession.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Well, let's
talk a little bit about somebody
who has been loyal to the

28:28.466 --> 28:31.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president, Sean Spice,
who stepped down today.

28:31.033 --> 28:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He resigned over the
announcement that Anthony
Scaramucci was going to
be named communications

28:35.400 --> 28:36.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
director.

28:36.400 --> 28:38.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Scaramucci played it down.

28:38.433 --> 28:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He and Spicer and I think Reince
Priebus were all scheduled to
go on FOX tonight in a sort

28:43.466 --> 28:45.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of unified show, right?

28:45.733 --> 28:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But what do you make of it?

28:47.833 --> 28:52.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I mean,
Sean Spicer, prior to going to
work at the White House, those

28:54.766 --> 28:57.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of us who had dealt with him
over the years, he was likable,
he was helpful, he was a loyal

28:57.733 --> 28:59.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republican, but
a square shooter.

28:59.800 --> 29:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As soon as he made the bargain
to go to work for Donald Trump,
you know, I don't know if

29:06.433 --> 29:10.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
he sold his soul, but
he sold part certainly
of his self-respect.

29:10.433 --> 29:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The very first thing Trump
demanded that he do was to go
out and lie about the size of

29:15.233 --> 29:17.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the crowd on inauguration.

29:17.133 --> 29:20.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And Sean Spicer did it.

29:20.800 --> 29:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then he lied about the
orders that Barack Obama
had, in fact, bugged,
wiretapped, President

29:28.600 --> 29:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obama had, the headquarters
of Donald Trump's building.

29:35.533 --> 29:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then it was that three
million undocumented immigrants
had voted on Election Day, and

29:41.966 --> 29:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's why Donald Trump --
I mean, so, it was tragic to
watch this erosion of his own

29:49.533 --> 29:50.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
integrity.

29:50.966 --> 29:55.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And he's not a bad guy
or anything of sort.

29:55.066 --> 30:00.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But everybody, I can honestly
say, with rare exception, who
has been associated with this

30:01.600 --> 30:04.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
administration and
this president has
been diminished by it.

30:04.433 --> 30:05.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Their reputation
has been tarnished.

30:05.933 --> 30:08.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're smaller people
as a result of it.

30:08.033 --> 30:10.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's tragic.

30:10.066 --> 30:10.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Does it
give you a glimpse into
the state of Twitter?

30:10.866 --> 30:12.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

30:12.333 --> 30:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, that's the exact
point I was going to make.

30:14.333 --> 30:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, I can't think of anybody
whose reputation has been
enhanced by going into the Trump

30:16.366 --> 30:17.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration.

30:17.900 --> 30:20.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rex Tillerson was a serious
businessman, well-respected.

30:20.400 --> 30:23.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeff Sessions was a
serious senator, pretty
conservative, quite serious.

30:23.833 --> 30:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sean Spicer was a normal
communications guy in
Congress -- or in Washington.

30:28.766 --> 30:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So he's like an anti-mentor.

30:31.200 --> 30:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He takes everybody around
him and he makes them worse.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so that's what
Spicer had to face.

30:36.533 --> 30:41.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he will have to live
with that and live with
the reputational damage
that he's incurred.

30:42.733 --> 30:45.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Scaramucci is a very
interesting case.

30:45.100 --> 30:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's a guy from Long Island.

30:47.666 --> 30:49.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump is from Queens.

30:49.033 --> 30:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They made it big
financially in the big city.

30:51.033 --> 30:53.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have some sort
of parallel careers.

30:53.200 --> 30:54.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Scaramucci is a
very friendly guy.

30:54.733 --> 30:58.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Everybody is sort of
like a fun game to him.

30:58.133 --> 31:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I thought his performance
today was quite good, actually.

31:01.633 --> 31:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so it could be that he will
flourish in this White House.

31:04.533 --> 31:05.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's very smart.

31:05.833 --> 31:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's not to be intellectually
underestimated.

31:07.533 --> 31:10.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It could be he's chief
of staff before long.

31:10.600 --> 31:12.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And we will see.

31:12.566 --> 31:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he's someone who has a
much more deft personal manner,
as well -- while being kind

31:19.133 --> 31:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of a wild guy, than anybody
else in there right now.

31:21.133 --> 31:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally,
John McCain, this past week, it
was -- the entire Senate vote

31:27.000 --> 31:29.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was delayed because
of a surgery.

31:29.033 --> 31:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it turned out what
they found in that surgery
was much more serious.

31:32.833 --> 31:34.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

31:34.433 --> 31:38.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, I just think that
John McCain stands alone.

31:38.500 --> 31:43.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I make no apologies for
thinking that highly of him.

31:45.433 --> 31:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At a time when you look at
these people on television,
starting with Scaramucci, a bad

31:50.800 --> 31:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
guy who has a good performance,
they're flag lapel pin patriots.

31:56.166 --> 31:58.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
John McCain never
wore a flag lapel.

31:58.433 --> 32:01.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
John McCain didn't
wave the flag.

32:01.200 --> 32:03.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He defended it.

32:03.233 --> 32:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's been a leader in the
United States Senate on so
many issues, and especially,

32:09.500 --> 32:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, not just simply taking
on big tobacco and big money,
but reaching across the aisle.

32:14.533 --> 32:17.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And de Gaulle said that the
cemeteries of Europe are
full of indispensable men.

32:19.600 --> 32:24.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I would say John McCain
is irreplaceable in
our national life.

32:25.766 --> 32:27.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I just pray
that he recovers.

32:27.400 --> 32:29.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Very
briefly to just his
position in the Senate?

32:29.100 --> 32:30.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

32:30.100 --> 32:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have covered him a long time.

32:31.533 --> 32:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think we both
think more highly of him.

32:32.700 --> 32:34.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's a man with intense
internal honesty.

32:34.833 --> 32:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He sometimes did stuff that
was political, but he always
seemed to -- he never, never

32:38.133 --> 32:39.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lied to himself.

32:39.666 --> 32:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
David Brooks, Mark Shields.

32:41.300 --> 32:43.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The transcript of this
will be very clear.

32:43.866 --> 32:45.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

32:45.100 --> 32:49.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
Thank you both.

32:50.633 --> 32:53.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you.

32:53.866 --> 32:58.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tonight, we
begin a look back, over the
next few weeks, at the unrest

33:00.266 --> 33:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that hit cities across
America in the summer of 1967.

33:04.266 --> 33:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Detroit particularly captured
the nation's attention.

33:07.133 --> 33:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fifty years later,
special correspondent
Soledad O'Brien reports
on what sparked it all and

33:11.666 --> 33:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the scars that remain today.

33:13.633 --> 33:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: On July 23, 1967,
Detroit was hit by a riot.

33:19.833 --> 33:21.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LORETTA HOLMES, Detroit:
Everything broke loose.

33:21.366 --> 33:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Forty-three dead, thousands
injured, and the city in flames.

33:23.933 --> 33:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: All we could hear is
fire engines and police sirens.

33:27.300 --> 33:32.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES CRAIG, Detroit Police
Chief: I guess, when I'm being
politically correct, I will

33:32.166 --> 33:33.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
say unrest.

33:33.166 --> 33:34.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's a riot.

33:34.166 --> 33:35.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a straight-out riot.

33:35.166 --> 33:37.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: It was just pure rage.

33:37.966 --> 33:42.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Detroit had been what
some people thought was a model
city, a place where blacks and

33:44.300 --> 33:46.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whites had found a
way to get along.

33:46.533 --> 33:51.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAN: There was a lot of
enmity and anger between
the young black guys and
the young white police

33:54.566 --> 33:56.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
officers.

33:56.033 --> 33:58.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think we locked up
about 7,000 people total.

33:58.666 --> 34:03.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: A lot of people hollering
and screaming and saying, why
do you keep messing with us

34:03.466 --> 34:05.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and not go to your
neighborhoods?

34:05.500 --> 34:10.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: There were more
than 2,500 buildings
that were destroyed,
looted or burned to the

34:10.100 --> 34:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ground, over 1,200 injured.

34:13.300 --> 34:14.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: A rebellion.

34:14.833 --> 34:16.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Insurrection.

34:16.066 --> 34:17.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: The white community
was calling it a riot.

34:17.800 --> 34:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Detroit
1967, a riot or rebellion?

34:24.200 --> 34:26.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
To this day, they still
debate what it was.

34:26.733 --> 34:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN MCKANE, Former Detroit
Police Officer: A lot of the
smoke was on 12th Street, which

34:32.600 --> 34:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is what it was called then.

34:35.100 --> 34:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: The
disturbances began on
12th Street, since renamed
Rosa Parks Boulevard.

34:40.533 --> 34:43.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They started spontaneously
after a routine police raid on
an illegal bar or what locals

34:44.766 --> 34:46.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
called a blind pig.

34:46.966 --> 34:51.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Dan McKane was a young
street cop in Detroit's
tactical mobile unit.

34:51.133 --> 34:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN MCKANE: Each precinct had
a vice crew, and they would
arrest the proprietors, and

34:58.000 --> 35:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then probably write tickets
to the rest of the guys.

35:00.700 --> 35:05.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: How would
you have described the Detroit
Police Department back in 1967?

35:05.533 --> 35:10.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAN MCKANE: Well, it
was majority white male.

35:10.366 --> 35:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Tensions
between the police and
the African-American
community appeared

35:15.033 --> 35:16.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to have reached their limit.

35:16.266 --> 35:18.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LORETTA HOLMES:
It came to a boil.

35:18.600 --> 35:20.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
People were just tired
of being hassled.

35:20.533 --> 35:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They was tired of them coming
into their neighborhoods.

35:23.200 --> 35:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Loretta Holmes
was in that blind pig that
night, to welcome back soldiers

35:29.066 --> 35:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
coming home from Vietnam.

35:30.300 --> 35:32.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Suddenly, police burst in.

35:32.066 --> 35:34.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LORETTA HOLMES: And then
I saw a sledgehammer
come through the door.

35:34.933 --> 35:37.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Next thing we know, the
police were in there.

35:37.600 --> 35:39.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They took us downstairs.

35:39.100 --> 35:43.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
About four -- I would say three
or four paddy wagons parked.

35:43.500 --> 35:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And oh, my God, it was a
million people out there.

35:47.300 --> 35:52.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's like somebody got on
the bullhorn and said, come
to 12th and Clairmount.

35:54.200 --> 35:57.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: The angry
crowd outside exploded into
five days of full-out violence.

35:59.633 --> 36:03.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
"LIFE" magazine captured
15-year-old Frank
Robinson playing in the
rubble that was left

36:04.700 --> 36:06.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of 12th Street.

36:06.833 --> 36:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANK ROBINSON, Detroit: They
threw a couple bricks through
windows, and the police didn't

36:08.133 --> 36:09.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
come.

36:09.133 --> 36:10.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
People saw an opportunity.

36:10.600 --> 36:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: And the
opportunity was to do what?

36:13.500 --> 36:15.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FRANK ROBINSON: To loot.

36:15.600 --> 36:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It may have turned into a
racial situation later, but
from the beginning, it was just

36:18.866 --> 36:21.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people seeing an
opportunity to loot.

36:21.933 --> 36:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Detroit's
violent unrest was the largest
in the U.S. in about 100 years.

36:28.400 --> 36:32.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Violence had also
erupted earlier in
Newark and Los Angeles.

36:32.333 --> 36:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Quickly, President Lyndon
Johnson named a commission
to explore the causes.

36:39.300 --> 36:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Named for its chair, Illinois
Governor Otto Kerner, the Kerner
Commission's only surviving

36:43.866 --> 36:46.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

FRED HARRIS, Former Oklahoma
Senator: What we said was, we
can describe with particularity

36:51.533 --> 36:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the conditions that
exist in the places where
these riots occur, almost
criminally inferior

36:58.500 --> 37:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
schools, no jobs, housing
really terrible, and we have
to get at these kinds of basic

37:07.966 --> 37:09.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
problems.

37:09.533 --> 37:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's certainly true again.

37:11.666 --> 37:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: What was
the biggest finding of the
Kerner Commission report?

37:14.333 --> 37:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED HARRIS: Our nation is
moving towards two societies,
one white, one black, separate

37:19.933 --> 37:21.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and unequal.

37:21.433 --> 37:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: The report
was rejected by the president.

37:24.233 --> 37:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
None of its recommendations
were ever adopted.

37:26.333 --> 37:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHEILA COCKREL, Former Detroit
City Councilwoman: The fact that
it never went anywhere, that

37:29.233 --> 37:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it really didn't drive the
level of policy and drive the
level of people dealing with

37:36.633 --> 37:41.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
race, is a testament to
how deep-seated and how
tough it is to not only
have the conversations,

37:44.266 --> 37:46.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but to make the change
that would be required.

37:46.200 --> 37:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Sheila Cockrel,
who served on the Detroit
City Council for 15 years,

37:50.700 --> 37:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says white flight already
plaguing Detroit escalated
rapidly after the unrest.

37:57.633 --> 37:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Other forces were at play.

37:59.700 --> 38:03.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The auto industry was
hit by an oil crisis
and foreign competition.

38:03.966 --> 38:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There were two decades
of government corruption.

38:07.266 --> 38:12.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2008 the global
financial crash hit
Detroit particularly hard.

38:14.200 --> 38:17.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, then, in 2013, Detroit
became the largest municipality
ever to file for bankruptcy.

38:20.400 --> 38:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Detroit police are
adamant that they are trying to
repair their relationship with

38:25.133 --> 38:27.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the public.

38:27.100 --> 38:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have trained police
officers in all 12 precincts to
build stronger community ties.

38:32.366 --> 38:33.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Officer Donald Parker.

38:33.566 --> 38:35.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How do you build trust
in a neighborhood?

38:35.866 --> 38:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD PARKER, Detroit Police
Department: Building now is us
filtering into the community,

38:40.566 --> 38:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying hi to Ms. Jones,
and saying, hey, we're
here, we're here, we're
touchable, we're reachable,

38:44.333 --> 38:47.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to let them know not
to be afraid of us.

38:47.866 --> 38:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: The composition
of the force has also changed.

38:50.933 --> 38:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In 1967, it was 5
percent African-American.

38:54.233 --> 38:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, it is about 65 percent
African-American, including
the chief, James Craig.

39:01.233 --> 39:05.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES CRAIG: Well, what happened
50 years ago, I can't say
would never happen in Detroit,

39:06.633 --> 39:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
because there's still issues.

39:08.633 --> 39:12.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have one of the highest
poverty rates, and while we have
an above-average relationship

39:12.900 --> 39:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the community, there's
the issue of opportunities.

39:16.933 --> 39:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And while that's getting better
and while the city has made
a major turnaround, there's

39:23.966 --> 39:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still this belief that, while
the turnaround is happening
in certain parts of the city,

39:26.900 --> 39:28.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it's not in others.

39:28.900 --> 39:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: A sign of
the work remaining to be done:
Detroit's poverty rate is double

39:32.900 --> 39:35.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what it was in 1967.

39:35.466 --> 39:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The city struggles with
segregation, inadequate
housing and has the
lowest school test scores

39:41.466 --> 39:46.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and graduation
rates in the nation.

39:48.400 --> 39:52.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Anika Goss-Foster is with Future
City Detroit, which imagines
modern-day uses for blighted

39:54.566 --> 39:55.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
properties.

39:55.800 --> 39:58.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Goss-Foster's focus
is the next 50 years.

39:58.733 --> 40:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANIKA GOSS-FOSTER, Detroit
Future City: We call
them dinosaurs, where
there are old monster

40:02.666 --> 40:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plants that are now sitting
vacant in the middle of
residential neighborhoods.

40:07.066 --> 40:12.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: The old Packard
plant, a dinosaur, abandoned
since the 1990s, is being

40:14.100 --> 40:17.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
developed into the shops
and galleries in hopes of
reviving the neighborhood.

40:17.266 --> 40:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANIKA GOSS-FOSTER: Things aren't
happening the way as quickly
as they want it to happen.

40:20.933 --> 40:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they certainly aren't
happening at a rate
where it should happen.

40:27.900 --> 40:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if you really pushed,
there are a lot of good things
happening all over the city.

40:31.000 --> 40:35.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are parks that are
being taken care of that have
never been taken care of bore.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The city is completely lit.

40:37.500 --> 40:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People are much more involved
in their neighborhoods
than they have ever been.

40:41.800 --> 40:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN:
Entrepreneurs and business
leaders have transformed
7.2 miles of downtown

40:48.800 --> 40:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into a booming neighborhood that
has attracted tourists, tech
start-ups and new businesses.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the boom hasn't yet trickled
down into the neighborhoods
that Goss-Foster is trying

40:59.400 --> 41:01.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to develop.

41:01.466 --> 41:03.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANIKA GOSS-FOSTER: I think
that there are a lot of black
people that would say they

41:03.066 --> 41:04.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
do feel left out.

41:04.366 --> 41:06.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I wouldn't say that
they feel ignored.

41:06.800 --> 41:10.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think they feel like,
when is it my turn?

41:10.100 --> 41:12.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Right,
to get investment.

41:12.066 --> 41:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANIKA GOSS-FOSTER: To
get the same kind of
attention and investment.

41:15.600 --> 41:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Neglect felt
firsthand by Loretta Holmes.

41:19.633 --> 41:21.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LORETTA HOLMES: We
don't have anything.

41:21.400 --> 41:22.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's nothing there anymore.

41:22.866 --> 41:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: So, what
happened to the neighborhoods?

41:25.200 --> 41:27.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LORETTA HOLMES:
People moved out.

41:27.300 --> 41:28.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People moved out.

41:28.300 --> 41:29.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They left.

41:29.366 --> 41:30.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They walked away.

41:30.366 --> 41:32.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No kept the property up.

41:32.566 --> 41:34.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Loretta
Holmes stayed behind.

41:34.766 --> 41:36.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LORETTA HOLMES: We
were in Central.

41:36.800 --> 41:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We were totally a community.

41:39.233 --> 41:40.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We were a community.

41:40.533 --> 41:42.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is what we did.

41:42.166 --> 41:44.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We took care of each other.

41:44.266 --> 41:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: She mentors
students at her alma mater,
Detroit's Central High.

41:48.266 --> 41:49.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LORETTA HOLMES: We
give scholarships.

41:49.800 --> 41:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We go ahead and we will buy the
jerseys for the football team.

41:53.933 --> 41:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kids that doesn't have a
coat, we do it undercover,
because we don't want
the other kids to know.

42:00.900 --> 42:05.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Her investment
in kids is what gives her
hope for a better future for

42:05.233 --> 42:06.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Detroit.

42:06.633 --> 42:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is the city of Detroit
better off today than it was?

42:09.133 --> 42:10.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LORETTA HOLMES: Heck no.

42:10.133 --> 42:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: In the '60s?

42:11.433 --> 42:13.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LORETTA HOLMES: No.

42:13.366 --> 42:14.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

42:14.366 --> 42:15.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No, because it's...

42:15.633 --> 42:17.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Better
off than five years ago?

42:17.800 --> 42:20.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LORETTA HOLMES:
Than five years ago?

42:20.400 --> 42:22.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Yes, because now I
can see the change.

42:22.500 --> 42:24.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I really can.

42:24.600 --> 42:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Change that,
for a city with a history of
racial conflict and struggle,

42:30.266 --> 42:32.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is long overdue.

42:32.200 --> 42:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Soledad O'Brien in Detroit.

cookbooks and TV shows.

42:59.433 --> 43:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
William Brangham recently
went to see Ina Garten at her
home on Long Island, New York,

43:03.333 --> 43:05.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

her life and career.

43:05.466 --> 43:07.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Can
I have another bite?

43:07.000 --> 43:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INA GARTEN, Chef: You can
have as much as you like.

43:08.233 --> 43:09.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

43:09.433 --> 43:10.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
This is the best job.

43:10.233 --> 43:11.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

43:11.233 --> 43:12.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
INA GARTEN: Isn't it?

43:12.466 --> 43:13.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is what I get
to do for a living.

43:13.266 --> 43:14.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Isn't it unbelievable?

43:14.500 --> 43:16.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
It's fantastic.

43:16.233 --> 43:19.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Ina Garten is one of the
most famous and beloved
cooks in America today.

43:19.666 --> 43:24.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Better known as the

cookbooks, with millions
of copies sold, a
string of hit TV shows.

43:29.533 --> 43:32.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
INA GARTEN: Just because it's
a weeknight dinner doesn't
mean it has to be boring.

43:32.466 --> 43:34.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And a
legion of devoted fans.

43:34.933 --> 43:37.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
INA GARTEN: This is my
little secret garden.

43:37.066 --> 43:40.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We
visited Garten at her
home and headquarters
in East Hampton, New

43:40.466 --> 43:42.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
York.

43:42.633 --> 43:46.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We talked in the huge
barn she had built next
to her House that's now
her office, test kitchen

43:47.333 --> 43:49.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and TV studio, all in one.

43:49.466 --> 43:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
INA GARTEN: This is where
the show is shot, and this
is where we test recipes.

43:51.533 --> 43:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And every morning, I walk
across the lawn and I meet the
two people, Barbara and Lidey,

43:55.266 --> 43:56.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who work with me.

43:56.800 --> 43:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we just go, OK, what
are we going to do today?

43:58.333 --> 43:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's
the extent of your commute?

43:59.333 --> 44:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INA GARTEN: That's my commute.

44:00.366 --> 44:01.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

44:01.866 --> 44:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INA GARTEN: It's like 100 yards,
I think, maybe less, maybe 50.

44:03.100 --> 44:04.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Pretty amazing.

44:04.033 --> 44:05.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INA GARTEN: It's pretty amazing.

44:05.466 --> 44:07.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I usually just put it
right in the middle.

44:07.333 --> 44:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Garten's
career began 40 years ago.

44:09.533 --> 44:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, at first, she gave no
hint as to how she'd evolve.

44:13.233 --> 44:18.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the 1970s, newly married to
husband Jeffrey, Garten was a
budget analyst in Washington,

44:18.700 --> 44:20.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
D.C.,

44:20.633 --> 44:22.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
INA GARTEN: I was
working at OMB, Office of
Management and Budget.

44:22.266 --> 44:23.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For
the federal government?

44:23.466 --> 44:25.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
INA GARTEN: Yes,
for Ford and Carter.

44:25.933 --> 44:28.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I worked on
nuclear energy policy.

44:28.033 --> 44:30.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How's that for precedent
for the food business?

44:30.233 --> 44:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It
makes no sense whatsoever.

44:31.400 --> 44:32.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

44:32.400 --> 44:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INA GARTEN: I ran from it.

44:34.400 --> 44:38.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And by the late '70s, I thought,
I have been working here for
four years, and nothing has

44:38.266 --> 44:39.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
happened.

44:39.766 --> 44:42.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I just didn't feel like
I had any impact on anything.

44:42.166 --> 44:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I hit 30, and I thought, I
want to do what I want to do.

44:45.700 --> 44:47.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I thought, I want to
be in the food business.

44:47.766 --> 44:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: One day, she
saw an ad for a specialty food
store for sale in the Hamptons,

44:51.933 --> 44:54.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the exclusive beach
destination for New Yorkers.

44:54.466 --> 44:58.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
INA GARTEN: I went home and
I told Jeffrey about it, and
he said, pick something you

44:58.300 --> 44:59.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
love to do.

44:59.833 --> 45:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you love doing it, you
will be really good at it.

45:01.900 --> 45:06.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I made her a very low
offer, the woman who was selling
it, thinking, well, we will

45:06.200 --> 45:07.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
come back.

45:07.200 --> 45:08.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We will negotiate.

45:08.200 --> 45:09.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We drove back to Washington.

45:09.666 --> 45:11.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was in my office the next
day and the phone rang.

45:11.766 --> 45:13.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And she said, thank
you very much.

45:13.333 --> 45:15.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I accept your offer.

45:15.033 --> 45:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I just remember going,
oh (EXPLETIVE DELETED).

45:16.400 --> 45:17.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

45:17.866 --> 45:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What
have I gotten myself into?

45:19.433 --> 45:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INA GARTEN: What have I done?

45:23.100 --> 45:24.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
And that was it?

45:24.100 --> 45:26.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
INA GARTEN: That was it.

45:26.166 --> 45:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two months later, I was behind
the counter of a specialty
foods store, trying to figure

45:28.433 --> 45:30.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it out.

45:30.366 --> 45:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
store she bought was called
the Barefoot Contessa.

45:32.400 --> 45:35.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That was the nickname
of the prior owner.

45:35.800 --> 45:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was 1978, and this
was Garten's very first
job in the food industry.

45:41.666 --> 45:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, had you been a cook before?

45:42.566 --> 45:43.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
INA GARTEN: No.

45:43.566 --> 45:44.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Not at all?

45:44.766 --> 45:45.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
INA GARTEN: I'd never
worked in a store.

45:45.800 --> 45:47.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I never worked in a restaurant.

45:47.466 --> 45:50.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I mean, I cooked at
home, but that's not
really the same thing.

45:50.000 --> 45:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I taught myself how to cook
when I worked in Washington
using Julia Child's cookbooks.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And you have
had no training beyond that?

45:57.166 --> 45:58.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
INA GARTEN: No.

45:58.166 --> 45:59.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

45:59.400 --> 46:00.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
That's amazing.

46:00.266 --> 46:02.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
INA GARTEN: Thank you.

46:02.366 --> 46:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The store was
a smash, and later moved to a
bigger location in East Hampton.

46:05.500 --> 46:09.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
After 18 years, she sold
the store and tried her
hand at a new venture.

46:09.833 --> 46:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 1999, the Barefoot Contessa
cookbook was published, and it
quickly became a bestseller.

46:16.266 --> 46:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nine additional books have
followed, each a bestseller.

46:19.033 --> 46:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All contain her trademark
simple and accessible recipes.

46:22.333 --> 46:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
INA GARTEN: I think that I
had a very clear vision when I
started writing cookbooks what

46:27.000 --> 46:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wanted it to be, and that you
would open the book, that you
would look at the photograph

46:30.666 --> 46:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and go, that looks delicious.

46:32.700 --> 46:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then you would look at the
recipe and say, I can actually
make that and I can make

46:36.400 --> 46:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it with ingredients I can
find in the grocery store.

46:38.666 --> 46:40.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't think that's
changed at all.

46:40.633 --> 46:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Having taught
yourself how to cook, does
that inform the recipes that

46:44.333 --> 46:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
end up in your book, because
you're thinking of them not
from a professionally trained

46:47.866 --> 46:50.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mind, but someone who
did this on her own?

46:50.633 --> 46:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INA GARTEN: That's really smart.

46:52.766 --> 46:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Actually, when I first started
writing cookbooks, I remember
thinking to myself, what makes

46:54.866 --> 46:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
me think I can write a cookbook?

46:56.333 --> 46:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are these great chefs
who are really trained.

46:58.566 --> 47:03.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as I started, I realized,
actually, what is my lack is
actually exactly right, because

47:06.266 --> 47:08.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I can connect with --
cooking's hard for me.

47:08.800 --> 47:09.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I never worked on...

47:09.966 --> 47:11.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Cooking is hard for you?

47:11.200 --> 47:13.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
INA GARTEN: It is
so hard for me.

47:13.133 --> 47:14.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Anybody that works
with me will tell you.

47:14.766 --> 47:16.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's so hard for me.

47:16.866 --> 47:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why my recipes
are really simple, because I
want to be able to do them.

47:23.200 --> 47:26.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Soon,
executives at the Food Network
came calling, and calling, and

47:30.866 --> 47:32.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
calling.

47:32.300 --> 47:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I understand you were reluctant
at first to do television?

47:34.500 --> 47:35.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
INA GARTEN: Reluctant
is the understatement.

47:35.933 --> 47:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Really?

47:37.400 --> 47:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INA GARTEN: I just said no
over and over and over again.

47:40.033 --> 47:41.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Why?

47:41.533 --> 47:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INA GARTEN: I just didn't
think I'd be good on TV.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just couldn't imagine
why anybody would watch it.

47:45.766 --> 47:48.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And Food Network,
fortunately, kept coming
back again and again.

47:48.900 --> 47:50.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they said, just try it.

47:50.966 --> 47:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I thought, well, I will
just do 13 shows, and then
they will leave me alone.

47:53.366 --> 47:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And that
was how many shows later?

47:54.866 --> 47:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INA GARTEN: And, happily,
that was 15 years later.

47:56.300 --> 47:57.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:57.300 --> 47:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INA GARTEN: I'm still doing it.

47:59.133 --> 48:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm going to show you my
recipes and my techniques.

48:01.633 --> 48:05.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
Barefoot Contessa series
is now 13 seasons' strong.

48:05.466 --> 48:07.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
INA GARTEN: You too
can cook like a pro.

48:07.466 --> 48:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Her latest
version, "Cook Like a Pro,"
shows tips and techniques aimed

48:11.333 --> 48:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at helping viewers become more
comfortable in the kitchen.

48:13.833 --> 48:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
INA GARTEN: Everything you
need to know, from trussing
the bird to carving it.

48:17.733 --> 48:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What do
you know of your audience?

48:19.900 --> 48:21.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Who is watching it?

48:21.900 --> 48:25.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
INA GARTEN: You know, there's
this moment in time when I
really got a vision of who

48:25.766 --> 48:27.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the audience was.

48:27.500 --> 48:29.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I was walking up Madison
Avenue, and there was a
woman in a big fur coat.

48:29.433 --> 48:32.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she said, "Oh, darling,
love your cookbooks."

48:32.100 --> 48:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I thought, that's very nice.

48:33.400 --> 48:35.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Then I kept going.

48:35.466 --> 48:39.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
About a half-a-block later, a
truck driver pulled over and
said, "Hey, baby, love your

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
show."

48:40.000 --> 48:41.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:41.200 --> 48:43.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
INA GARTEN: And I
thought, that's food.

48:43.233 --> 48:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think my cookbook audience
might be slightly different
from my TV audience, but I think

48:47.633 --> 48:49.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
they're people that
are interested in food,
and that's everybody.

48:49.966 --> 48:53.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You're doing a beautiful
job, I have to tell you.

48:53.133 --> 48:54.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
You're just saying that.

48:54.233 --> 48:55.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:55.966 --> 48:57.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: During
our visit, Garten showed
us a few simple recipes.

48:57.733 --> 49:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can see her demonstrate
them on our Web site.

49:00.366 --> 49:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, she says her days
are now spent testing new
recipes for her upcoming 11th

49:05.933 --> 49:07.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cookbook.

49:07.166 --> 49:08.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's due in the
fall of next year.

49:08.500 --> 49:10.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
INA GARTEN: I love
what I'm doing.

49:10.166 --> 49:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm really happy doing it, and
I hope I can do It forever.

49:13.400 --> 49:14.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I'm having a ball.

49:14.833 --> 49:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Ina Garten,
so great to talk to you.

49:16.933 --> 49:18.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

49:18.466 --> 49:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INA GARTEN: Well, it was so much
fun to talk to you too, William.

HARI SREENIVASAN: Online,
one "NewsHour" staffer
shares what Ina Garten
taught her about life,

49:26.866 --> 49:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
love, and dijon vinaigrette.

49:28.700 --> 49:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

49:40.100 --> 49:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Finally tonight: With marijuana
legal in some form in 26 states
and the District of Columbia,

49:46.266 --> 49:48.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
many of our kids have
questions about pot.

49:48.633 --> 49:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAND Corporation behavioral
scientist Elizabeth
D'Amico offers her
humble opinion on how to

49:53.833 --> 49:55.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
answer their queries.

49:55.866 --> 49:59.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH D'AMICO,
RAND Corporation: Among
family and friends, I'm
regarded as the Dear

50:01.033 --> 50:03.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Abby of adolescent
so-called bad behavior.

50:03.566 --> 50:05.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's the reason why.

50:05.533 --> 50:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because I have researched
alcohol and drug use among teens
for more than 20 years, and

50:09.533 --> 50:14.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I'm a parent, people
always assume I have
devised a foolproof
strategy for talking to

50:14.133 --> 50:16.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
kids about such issues.

50:16.133 --> 50:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lately, I have been fielding
a lot of questions about
marijuana legalization.

50:22.433 --> 50:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do feel like I have an
edge when it comes to talking
to my kids about marijuana.

50:25.733 --> 50:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, sometimes, it seems like
I am sharing information on
the fly, as I drive my kids

50:30.500 --> 50:32.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
down a busy L.A.
street to school.

50:32.966 --> 50:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Since recreational marijuana
was legalized in California
last fall, a new billboards

50:37.200 --> 50:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pop up all the time to advertise
the fine art of smoking
weed and where to buy it.

50:44.233 --> 50:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This leads my kids, 11 and
13, to ask a lot of questions:
Why do people smoke marijuana?

50:49.500 --> 50:53.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It can't be bad if
it's legal and they can
advertise, right, mom?

50:53.633 --> 50:58.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
As always, it is best
to give balanced, honest
answers based on facts.

50:58.333 --> 51:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why do people smoke marijuana?

51:00.900 --> 51:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some may smoke it for medical
reasons, to help with pain.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Others may smoke
it recreationally.

51:06.400 --> 51:08.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Parents might liken
it to alcohol.

51:08.366 --> 51:11.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You know how some people
have a glass of wine
with dinner to relax?

51:11.500 --> 51:14.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now some may smoke pot
for the same reason.

51:14.700 --> 51:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's also important that
your kids know that getting can
change their mood and behavior.

51:21.600 --> 51:25.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And just like alcohol, tell
your kids it's illegal to drive
after you have smoked pot.

51:27.466 --> 51:30.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I tell my kids the main reason
that marijuana is illegal for
those under 21 is because their

51:30.466 --> 51:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brains are still developing,
and marijuana can affect their
concentration and memory.

51:35.266 --> 51:37.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It may mean you don't
do as well in school.

51:37.766 --> 51:40.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That can mean fewer
opportunities, like
getting a good job.

51:40.833 --> 51:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Given this changing legal
landscape, my kids and yours are
going to be exposed to marijuana

51:45.800 --> 51:48.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as frequently as
they are to alcohol.

51:48.433 --> 51:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now that it's legal, here
come the marketing campaigns,
which all make smoking pot seem

51:53.933 --> 51:56.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
normal.

51:56.033 --> 52:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And just like alcohol and
tobacco ads, marijuana ads
may influence their choices.

52:00.933 --> 52:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My own research has shown that
middle school kids who reported
seeing ads for medical marijuana

52:07.366 --> 52:10.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were more likely to report
smoking pot one year later.

52:10.600 --> 52:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You can't just say, don't do it.

52:12.633 --> 52:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you can get the facts, share
them with your kids, and help
them make a healthy choice.

52:21.233 --> 52:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

come, plus, why President Trump
