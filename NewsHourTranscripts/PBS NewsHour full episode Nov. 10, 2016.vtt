everything

00:13.680 --> 00:17.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we can to help you succeed,
because, if you
succeed, then the country

00:17.351 --> 00:20.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

00:26.593 --> 00:28.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
transition of power.

00:28.462 --> 00:31.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: Mr. President,
it was a great honor being with

look forward to being with you
many, many
more times in the future.

00:34.835 --> 00:40.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Thursday:
previewing the first 100 days of
a Trump presidency,

00:40.774 --> 00:43.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how the campaign rhetoric could
become policy.

00:43.243 --> 00:45.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the fight for
Iraq.

00:45.712 --> 00:51.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
While the siege in Mosul
continues, we look
at how the city of Kirkuk fought
back against

00:51.118 --> 00:53.020 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ISIS fighters.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NAJMALDIN KARIM, Governor of
Kirkuk, Iraq:
There's something about Kirkuk
that's so different

00:55.822 --> 00:57.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from everywhere else.

00:57.291 --> 01:01.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In other places, when these
things happen,
people hide or run away.

01:01.328 --> 01:03.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They just evacuate.

01:04.031 --> 01:05.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The people of Kirkuk do the
contrary.

01:05.666 --> 01:08.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

is back in New York City
tonight, after a

01:26.086 --> 01:28.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
day of first meetings in
Washington.

01:28.689 --> 01:33.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was the formal launch of the
transition
of power, and there was no sign
of the bitter

01:33.360 --> 01:36.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
broadsides that marked the
campaign.

01:36.363 --> 01:38.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage.

01:38.165 --> 01:40.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Well, I just had the opportunity
to have an

01:40.934 --> 01:43.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
excellent conversation with
president-elect
Trump.

01:43.136 --> 01:47.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: President Obama
welcomed Donald
Trump to the Oval Office today,
just days

01:47.574 --> 01:52.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after he called the Republican
dangerous and
unqualified, and after Mr. Trump
called the

01:52.646 --> 01:54.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Obama record a disaster.

01:54.381 --> 01:58.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, how did their first
face-to-face meeting
go?

01:58.485 --> 02:09.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: I have been very
encouraged
by the, I think, interest in
president-elect

02:09.396 --> 02:18.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's wanting to work with my
team around
many of the issues that this
great country

02:18.605 --> 02:20.340 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
faces.

02:20.374 --> 02:25.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We now are going to want to do
everything
we can to help you succeed,
because, if you

02:25.212 --> 02:26.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
succeed, then the country
succeeds.

02:26.446 --> 02:29.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: I have
great respect.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The meeting lasted for almost an
hour-and-a-half.

02:32.252 --> 02:37.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it could have -- as far as
I'm concerned,
it could have gone on for a lot
longer.

02:37.824 --> 02:43.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We really -- we discussed a lot
of different
situations, some wonderful and
some difficulties.

02:43.830 --> 02:49.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I look forward to being with
you many,
many more times in the future.

02:49.703 --> 02:53.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: As reporters shouted
questions,
Mr. Obama even offered his
successor a bit

02:53.874 --> 02:55.242 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of advice.

02:55.275 --> 02:58.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Here's a good
rule.

02:58.111 --> 02:59.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Don't answer any questions when
they just
start yelling.

02:59.112 --> 03:00.080 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

03:00.113 --> 03:01.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: It's always the
last one.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: White House Press
Secretary Josh
Earnest said the meeting was a
little less

03:03.617 --> 03:05.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
awkward than some had expected.

03:05.352 --> 03:09.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
I feel confident in telling you
that they

03:09.056 --> 03:10.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
didn't resolve all their
differences.

03:10.957 --> 03:15.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I also feel confident in
telling you that
they didn't try to resolve all
their differences.

03:15.729 --> 03:22.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What they sought to do was to
lay the foundation
for an effective transition from
the Obama

03:22.235 --> 03:23.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
presidency to the Trump
presidency.

03:23.637 --> 03:26.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Another part of that
foundation?

03:26.706 --> 03:28.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Relations with Congress.

03:28.508 --> 03:32.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When he becomes president, Mr.
Trump will
preside over a unified
government, Republicans

03:32.779 --> 03:36.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in charge here at the White
House and on Capitol
Hill.

03:36.216 --> 03:40.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The question is how unified
those Republicans
will be.

03:40.654 --> 03:44.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meeting with the president-elect

House Speaker Paul Ryan, whose
relationship

03:44.858 --> 03:48.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
with candidate Trump was
sometimes rocky,
pledged to work together.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.697 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

going to turn that victory into
progress for

the American people.

03:53.433 --> 03:56.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we are now talking about how
we are going
to hit the ground running to
make sure that

03:56.436 --> 03:59.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we can get this country turned
around and
make America great again.

03:59.139 --> 04:03.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Trump made clear
that some
of the Republican House's
priorities are also

04:03.477 --> 04:05.178 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his priorities.

04:05.212 --> 04:09.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Whether it's
health care or
immigration, so many different
things, we

04:09.116 --> 04:11.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will be working on them very
rapidly.

04:11.618 --> 04:15.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think we will be putting
things up pretty
quickly.

04:15.555 --> 04:19.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He also met with

as evidence.

05:30.430 --> 05:36.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

continue to fight for our

NATALIA ARISTIZABAL: This is
actually for
our communities and for us to be
able to have

07:37.057 --> 07:44.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a space that is safe, but that
allows us to
yell and to shed our anger and
tears, but

07:44.197 --> 07:47.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do it together, because that's
the only way
that we're going to get through
this.

reaction
overseas to the Trump victory.

07:54.074 --> 07:58.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president of the European
Commission called
for clarity today from the
president-elect

07:58.645 --> 08:01.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on trade, climate change and
NATO.

08:01.648 --> 08:07.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jean-Claude Juncker spoke in
Berlin, and noted
that Mr. Trump has voiced doubts
or criticism

08:07.654 --> 08:09.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on all three issues.

08:09.622 --> 08:14.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER, President,
European Commission
(through translator): We expect
the designated

08:14.294 --> 08:17.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. president to be clear on
what his intentions
are.

08:17.230 --> 08:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We would like to know how things
will proceed
with the global trade policy.

08:20.367 --> 08:24.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We would like to know what
intentions Mr.
Trump has regarding the
alliance.

08:24.371 --> 08:28.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We must know what climate
policies he intends
to pursue, and all this must be
cleared up

08:28.508 --> 08:30.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the next few months.

08:30.443 --> 08:34.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile,
British Prime Minister
Theresa May spoke with
president-elect Trump

08:34.214 --> 08:35.382 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by phone.

08:35.415 --> 08:38.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her office says that he invited
her to visit
him soon.

08:38.785 --> 08:43.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And South Korea's President Park
Geun-hye
had her own phone chat.

08:43.423 --> 08:47.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Candidate Trump had talked of
withdrawing
some U.S. forces from the South.

08:47.761 --> 08:52.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Park's office quoted him
as saying,
"We are going to be with you 100
percent."

08:52.265 --> 08:57.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A top adviser
to the president-elect
caused a stir over Israeli
settlements today.

08:57.437 --> 09:02.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jason Greenblatt told Israeli
Army Radio -- quote
-- "West Bank settlements are no
obstacle

09:02.509 --> 09:03.810 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to peace."

09:03.843 --> 09:06.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That would be a marked departure
from longstanding
U.S. policy.

09:06.312 --> 09:10.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, a man
accused of exploding bombs in
New York City

09:10.550 --> 09:14.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and New Jersey had his first
appearance in
federal court.

09:14.287 --> 09:19.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ahmed Khan Rahimi is facing
terrorism charges
for the September attacks that
injured 30

09:19.959 --> 09:20.927 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

09:20.960 --> 09:22.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He didn't enter a plea today.

09:22.395 --> 09:26.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rahimi was born in Afghanistan,
but is now
a U.S. citizen.

09:26.065 --> 09:30.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And the man
who bills himself
America's toughest sheriff has
been turned

09:30.637 --> 09:32.405 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out of office.

09:32.439 --> 09:37.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Longtime Arizona lawman Joe
Arpaio lost his
reelection bid on Tuesday after
24 years in

09:37.544 --> 09:39.012 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
office.

09:39.045 --> 09:41.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He'd gained prominence for his
aggressive
stance on illegal immigration.

09:41.614 --> 09:46.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he also sparked federal
investigations
of alleged racial profiling.

09:46.319 --> 09:52.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what a President
Trump could do in his first 100
days in office;

09:52.559 --> 09:58.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why women didn't vote the way
many expected;
the Islamic State's attempt to
take over another

09:58.631 --> 10:04.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Iraqi city; and much more.

10:04.370 --> 10:16.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A peaceful
transfer of power
is a pillar of American
democracy.

10:16.616 --> 10:21.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As President Obama welcomed
president-elect
Trump in the Oval Office, we
take a look back

10:21.788 --> 10:26.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at how these transitions have
gone in the
past with Jon Meacham, author of
"Destiny

10:26.759 --> 10:30.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Power: The American Odyssey
of George
Herbert Walker Bush."

10:30.563 --> 10:35.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Nancy Gibbs, she's editor in
chief at
"TIME" magazine and the
co-author of "The

10:35.969 --> 10:36.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Presidents Club."

10:36.970 --> 10:39.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you back
to the program.

10:39.038 --> 10:40.740 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jon Meacham, to you first.

10:40.773 --> 10:44.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know we don't have a lot to go
on, just
that short photo opportunity in
the Oval Office,

10:44.711 --> 10:47.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but how did it look to you that
this transition
is getting off?

10:48.014 --> 10:51.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON MEACHAM, Presidential
Historian: Well,
better than expected, given that
48 hours

10:51.251 --> 10:53.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ago they were at each other's
throats.

10:53.686 --> 10:58.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the bar has been lowered in
many ways in
this campaign.

10:58.525 --> 11:01.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so why wouldn't that be true
in terms
of a transition?

11:01.961 --> 11:05.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that President Obama has
hit all the
right notes.

11:05.198 --> 11:09.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that president-elect
Trump has hit
all the right notes since
election night,

11:09.168 --> 11:10.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as did Secretary Clinton.

11:10.970 --> 11:15.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think that this may be
the shortest
honeymoon ever, but at least
it's a period

11:15.675 --> 11:17.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of some tranquility after the
storm.

11:17.777 --> 11:23.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nancy Gibbs, as
someone who
has studied transitions going
back for many

11:23.049 --> 11:24.851 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
presidents, how does this one
look so far?

11:24.884 --> 11:29.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY GIBBS, "TIME": Well, it
looks actually
like a pattern we have seen
before, which

11:29.355 --> 11:35.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is two politicians of different
parties who
have been very tough as
political opponents

11:35.962 --> 11:39.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who very quickly come together
when they find
themselves in a new position.

11:39.766 --> 11:46.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This tradition goes back to
1952, when Harry
Truman invited the newly elected
Dwight Eisenhower

11:46.506 --> 11:49.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to the White House after
Eisenhower's election.

11:49.576 --> 11:53.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those two men could not stand
each other and
were barely on speaking terms.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were very, very bitter
rivals.

11:55.415 --> 12:01.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet Truman, who himself had
taken office
with no preparation so suddenly
when Franklin

12:01.220 --> 12:05.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Roosevelt died, felt, in the
nuclear age it
was just too dangerous for
anyone to walk

12:05.758 --> 12:07.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into the Oval Office unprepared.

12:07.660 --> 12:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so he invited Eisenhower to
come, briefed
him, had the Cabinet secretaries
meet.

12:14.267 --> 12:18.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Eisenhower in turn did the same
thing with
John F. Kennedy, once again a
young man from

12:18.438 --> 12:22.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a different party whom
Eisenhower had very
little respect for.

12:22.475 --> 12:23.743 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But they respect the office.

12:23.776 --> 12:26.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they particularly respect
the demands
of it.

12:26.479 --> 12:30.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they want to make sure that
the guy who
is coming in to take over
understands just

12:30.183 --> 12:31.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what it is that he's facing.

12:31.985 --> 12:35.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, a lot of us
don't realize
that it's been -- there's been
bitterness

12:35.221 --> 12:37.190 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going back for a long time.

12:37.223 --> 12:43.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jon Meacham, what are examples
of what -- of
a transition that has worked
well, where it

12:43.796 --> 12:48.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has -- where the two sides have
had to overcome
some challenges, but they have
made it happen?

12:48.968 --> 12:51.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON MEACHAM: Well, I don't think
we have to
go back very far.

12:51.104 --> 12:57.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, if you go back to the
dismal autumn
of 2008, when a lot of people
believed that

12:57.343 --> 13:03.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the economy, I think, as
President Bush put
it at the time, that the sucker
could go down,

13:03.049 --> 13:07.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and there were an enormous
number of emergency
financial steps that had to be
taken.

13:07.553 --> 13:12.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have heard both President
Obama and
President Bush talk about how
smooth that

13:12.125 --> 13:13.526 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
transition was.

13:13.559 --> 13:18.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, as Nancy says, it
speaks well
of the office.

13:18.164 --> 13:24.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other factor here, I think,
is politicians
admire vote-getters, even if
they disagree

13:24.370 --> 13:27.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with everything that they did to
get the votes.

13:27.507 --> 13:34.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so there's a certain
clubbiness here,
that they respect strength, they
respect those

13:34.280 --> 13:36.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who master the world that they
have mastered.

13:36.549 --> 13:41.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I suspect -- though
President Obama might
not admit it, I suspect that
somewhere in

13:41.688 --> 13:48.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his being, there's a curiosity
about this
man who has shaken up American
politics so

13:48.461 --> 13:49.429 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
profoundly.

13:49.462 --> 13:51.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about that,
Nancy Gibbs?

13:51.264 --> 13:56.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What are some of the factors
that might lend
themselves to a more successful
handover of

13:56.369 --> 13:58.237 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
power?

13:58.271 --> 14:02.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY GIBBS: One thing I think
that is important
to bear in mind is, some part of
this is very

14:02.175 --> 14:07.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
practical about the nuts and
bolts of a smooth
transition, not just at the
level of president

14:07.513 --> 14:12.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to president, but Cabinet
members, White House
staff members, national security
officials,

14:12.852 --> 14:16.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of having as much communication
as possible,
so that that goes smoothly.

14:16.923 --> 14:18.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But some part of this is
theater.

14:18.791 --> 14:23.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think particularly after a
very bitter
campaign of the kind that we
just saw, there's

14:23.596 --> 14:28.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a recognition that the country
needs to see
this, that the world needs to
see it, that

14:28.601 --> 14:33.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the country comes first and the
well-being
of the people comes first, and
to see these

14:33.773 --> 14:39.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two teams working together is an
important
part of sort of national
reconciliation.

14:40.012 --> 14:45.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Jon Meacham,
how much
has that played into transition
in the past,

14:45.618 --> 14:51.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because -- especially right now,
these two
men have their own differences,
but we're

14:51.290 --> 14:53.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
watching a country that's still
very divided.

14:53.259 --> 14:55.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JON MEACHAM: Oh, absolutely.

14:55.695 --> 15:01.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first peaceful transfer from
one party
in power to the other party was
in 1800.

15:01.801 --> 15:06.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was a very close-run
thing because
of a controversy with the
election between

15:06.305 --> 15:13.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Adams and Jefferson, and they
were insistent
that the constitutional order
clean up that

15:13.579 --> 15:17.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anomaly in the Electoral College
and make
this transition happen.

15:17.049 --> 15:18.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That set a pattern.

15:18.885 --> 15:23.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the remarkable things,
when you think
about it, is that we had in the
Union states

15:23.923 --> 15:26.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an election in 1864.

15:26.759 --> 15:32.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are certain -- to go to
Nancy's point,
there are certain rituals that
send an important

15:32.365 --> 15:37.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cultural and political signal
that the body
politic is intact.

15:37.103 --> 15:40.039 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It may be fighting each other.

15:40.072 --> 15:46.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One arm may be trying to punch
the other fist,
but, ultimately, it is one
country, and the

15:46.412 --> 15:48.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
political order is bigger than
any one person.

15:48.781 --> 15:52.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Nancy Gibbs,
if you're
Donald Trump, the
president-elect, what are

15:52.285 --> 15:57.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you looking for from President
Obama and the
people around him?

15:57.056 --> 16:00.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, conversely, what is
President Obama looking
for from the Trump team?

16:00.193 --> 16:06.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY GIBBS: Well, you know,
this is going
to be so interesting to watch,
because, naturally,

16:06.399 --> 16:11.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anyone who has just been elected
president
may think that they have all the
answers and

16:11.137 --> 16:15.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have no need for advice, that
they have just
had the affirmation of the
country that they

16:15.875 --> 16:17.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are ready to lead.

16:17.276 --> 16:20.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they very quickly discover
how much they
don't know.

16:20.112 --> 16:25.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think that it was
interesting that
president-elect Trump today
talked about turning

16:25.284 --> 16:27.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to President Obama for counsel.

16:27.620 --> 16:32.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's a long tradition of
that as well,
again, from former political
adversaries,

16:32.758 --> 16:39.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from people who don't share any
partisan views
in common, and yet recognize the
need to be

16:39.298 --> 16:42.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talking to each other and the
resource that
former presidents can be.

16:42.768 --> 16:47.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I suspect, you know,
president-elect Trump
would like to know that he can
call President

16:47.039 --> 16:49.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obama in months to come when he
needs to.

16:49.742 --> 16:53.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think President Obama
would like to
know that that phone line is
open, as it has

16:53.679 --> 16:56.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been in the past between sitting
presidents
and their predecessors.

16:56.816 --> 16:57.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JON MEACHAM: The real...

16:57.817 --> 16:58.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jon Meacham, go
ahead.

16:58.818 --> 16:59.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JON MEACHAM: Sorry.

16:59.852 --> 17:03.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The real danger, as Nancy is
saying, is hubris.

17:03.155 --> 17:08.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And President Kennedy didn't
have -- Nancy
mentioned Eisenhower didn't
think much of

17:08.194 --> 17:10.129 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Kennedy.

17:10.162 --> 17:13.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, Kennedy didn't think much
of Eisenhower,
thought he was too bureaucratic,
the decision-making

17:13.099 --> 17:17.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was too militaristic, owed too
much to Eisenhower's
military command years.

17:17.870 --> 17:24.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kennedy comes in, wants a
freewheeling style,
empowers the CIA, empowers kind
of a more

17:24.343 --> 17:27.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
improvisational decision-making
world.

17:27.146 --> 17:30.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that led him to the Bay of
Pigs in April
of 1961.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what does he do after that
disaster?

17:32.351 --> 17:37.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He picks up the phone and he
invites Dwight
Eisenhower to come to Camp
David, and they

17:37.623 --> 17:39.091 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do it all again.

17:39.125 --> 17:42.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They sort of had -- they had to
have a second
transition to some extent.

17:42.795 --> 17:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think that's the great
cautionary
example.

17:47.533 --> 17:50.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These men need to listen to each
other and
learn quickly.

17:50.970 --> 17:54.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, what's for
sure is, all
eyes are on the two of them.

17:54.273 --> 17:56.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we thank both of you, Jon
Meacham, Nancy
Gibbs.

17:56.943 --> 17:59.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We appreciate it.

17:59.845 --> 18:09.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JON MEACHAM: Thanks, Judy.

18:09.155 --> 18:15.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: After that
transition to
the White House, Donald Trump
will settle

18:15.995 --> 18:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in for his first day of work,
January 21,
2017.

18:19.999 --> 18:24.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's already proposed the
actions he wants
to take within his first 100
days in office,

18:24.704 --> 18:28.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but which campaign promises can
he realistically
tackle in that time?

18:28.874 --> 18:34.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on this, we're joined
now by Alan
Gomez, immigration reporter for
USA Today,

18:34.480 --> 18:38.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Julie Rovner, senior
correspondent for Kaiser
Health News, and Scott Horsley,
White House

18:38.651 --> 18:42.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
correspondent for NPR, who was
at the White
House today for Trump's meeting
with President

18:42.888 --> 18:43.856 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Obama.

18:43.889 --> 18:46.826 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Scott, let me start with you.

18:46.859 --> 18:53.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has specified -- he has
specified a contract
with his voters that range --
that has a lot

18:53.432 --> 18:55.267 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of things on it.

18:55.301 --> 18:58.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It ranges everything from
repealing Obamacare
to backing out of trade deals to
undoing all

18:58.437 --> 19:00.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the executive actions.

19:00.272 --> 19:04.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, which of those are
achievable in the first
100 days?

19:04.110 --> 19:07.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT HORSLEY, National Public
Radio: Well,
some of the things, like
repealing Obamacare,

19:07.613 --> 19:09.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will take cooperation from
Congress.

19:09.181 --> 19:10.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that may be more
time-consuming.

19:10.950 --> 19:16.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But some of them, Donald Trump
can at least
start on, on day one, or maybe
day three.

19:16.522 --> 19:18.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Day one, I think, is a Saturday.

19:18.324 --> 19:23.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But very early on, he can start
to undo some
of the executive orders that
President Obama

19:23.062 --> 19:24.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has put in place.

19:24.897 --> 19:29.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And President Obama has used
executive orders
to advance a lot of things that
he was unable

19:29.535 --> 19:34.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to push through a
Republican-controlled Congress
in areas like immigration, where
he granted

19:34.874 --> 19:39.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a reprieve to young people who
came into the
country illegally as children, a
reprieve

19:39.045 --> 19:40.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from deportation.

19:40.446 --> 19:43.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That could be undone quickly by
Donald Trump.

19:43.416 --> 19:47.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The big area on those executive
orders is
climate change.

19:47.753 --> 19:52.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Much of the president's climate
agenda has
been executed administratively,
or through

19:52.391 --> 19:57.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the executive branch and through
the EPA,
and Donald Trump has promised to
unwind that.

19:57.763 --> 20:02.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The clean power plan -- the
Clean Power Plan,
which regulates coal-fired power
plants, for

20:02.301 --> 20:08.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
example, that's really the heart
of what the
U.S. did as part of the Paris
climate accords.

20:08.074 --> 20:09.909 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is something that could
be reversed.

20:09.942 --> 20:14.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's on hold anyway right now
because of legal
challenges, but that could be
reversed really

20:14.413 --> 20:16.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very quickly by president-elect
Trump.

20:16.982 --> 20:21.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Julie Rovner,
one of the
key cornerstones to all the
Republicans really

20:21.654 --> 20:25.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that were running were to repeal
and replace
Obamacare.

20:25.691 --> 20:29.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's listen to a clip of part
of this contract
that president-elect Trump made
in his recent

20:29.929 --> 20:31.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
speech at Gettysburg.

20:31.464 --> 20:35.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: The Repeal
and Replace Obamacare Act.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

20:37.536 --> 20:42.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Fully repeal
Obamacare and replace
it with health savings accounts.

20:42.975 --> 20:44.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we can do that.

20:44.176 --> 20:45.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Two parts to
that.

20:45.444 --> 20:46.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First, the repeal, how easy is
that?

20:46.779 --> 20:48.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER, Kaiser Health
News: Not that
easy.

20:48.514 --> 20:51.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It turns out, if you actually
want the repeal
the entire law, you will need 60
votes in

20:51.884 --> 20:55.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Senate, unless they get rid
of the filibuster,
which seems unlikely.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They don't have -- the
Republicans don't have
60 votes.

20:57.790 --> 21:02.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They can repeal parts of it
using a budget
process, but even that will take
some time,

21:02.228 --> 21:05.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because, in order to get to that
bill, they
have to do a budget resolution
first.

21:05.831 --> 21:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That will take at least a matter
of weeks.

21:07.633 --> 21:11.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is not something that's
likely, even
a partial repeal, to be
accomplished in the

21:11.337 --> 21:13.139 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
first 100 days.

21:13.172 --> 21:14.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Are there any
things that
they can do to try and create
disincentives

21:14.974 --> 21:19.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for insurance companies or to
try and decrease
the amount of Medicaid that's
going out?

21:19.311 --> 21:22.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: Well, they could
do a lot of
things.

21:22.548 --> 21:26.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because the Republican Congress
has been saying
repeal and replace pretty much
since the bill

21:26.452 --> 21:32.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
became a law in 2010, President
Obama has
had to do a lot of implementing
it by executive

21:32.591 --> 21:34.059 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
order.

21:34.093 --> 21:36.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And President Trump could just
reverse a lot
of those executive orders.

21:36.195 --> 21:38.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He could make all kinds of
mischief for the
law.

21:38.764 --> 21:42.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But one of the things that
they're talking
about doing in this -- it's sort
of a two-step

21:42.268 --> 21:46.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
repeal, then replace, because,
they can't
repeal all of it.

21:46.071 --> 21:49.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They'd repeal part of it and
they would let
it stay in effect for some
portion of time

21:49.508 --> 21:51.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
while they try to come up with a
replacement.

21:51.810 --> 21:55.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's hard to know whether
they want to
do a lot of disincentives if
they're intending

21:55.114 --> 21:59.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to leave it intact, so they
don't end up taking
health insurance away from 20
million people.

21:59.285 --> 22:03.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Alan Gomez,
another one
of the cornerstones of this
campaign that

22:03.422 --> 22:08.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
resonated with so many of his
voters was to
build a wall between the United
States and

22:08.794 --> 22:09.728 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Mexico.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's take a listen to another
clip.

22:11.163 --> 22:14.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: End Illegal
Immigration Act.

22:14.733 --> 22:16.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

22:16.335 --> 22:22.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Fully fund the
construction
of a wall on our southern
border.

22:23.008 --> 22:24.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Don't worry about it.

22:24.109 --> 22:26.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Remember, I said Mexico is
paying for the
wall.

22:26.178 --> 22:29.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What are the
walls in between
that idea and reality?

22:29.481 --> 22:35.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ, USA Today: Well,
building a wall
and getting -- and figuring out
how to get

22:35.254 --> 22:40.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Mexico to fund that is
absolutely something
that he has to work with
Congress on.

22:40.259 --> 22:44.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have to create a whole
legal mechanism
to try to withhold the
remittances that are

22:44.063 --> 22:48.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to go back to Mexico that
he says are
going to be the basis for paying
for this

22:48.400 --> 22:49.802 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wall.

22:49.835 --> 22:52.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And just funding it is going to
require a
lot of work from Congress.

22:52.771 --> 22:57.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this is one area where the
president absolutely
has a lot of discretion when it
comes to deportations,

22:57.943 --> 23:02.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to refugees, to who gets
admitted into the
country, those other things that
he talked

23:02.114 --> 23:03.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about throughout the campaign.

23:03.182 --> 23:04.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has a lot of power in that
area.

23:04.750 --> 23:06.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Alan, about
the deportations.

23:06.652 --> 23:10.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, how much -- or how
many people
are allowed to stay in this
country right

23:10.689 --> 23:15.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now who are not actively being
prosecuted
to be deported because of what
President Obama

23:15.661 --> 23:17.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has done through executive
action?

23:17.463 --> 23:23.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ: Well, right now,
it's been about
over 800,000 young undocumented
immigrants

23:23.068 --> 23:27.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who have been granted -- it's
called the Deferred
Action for Childhood Arrivals
program, DACA.

23:27.706 --> 23:31.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there's 800,000 kids who
have that right
now.

23:31.377 --> 23:35.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was created by a memorandum
by the Department
of Homeland Security.

23:35.781 --> 23:40.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, President Trump's secretary
of homeland
security can just rescind that,
institute

23:40.953 --> 23:44.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a new one, and all of a sudden
all those kids
are open to deportation.

23:44.990 --> 23:49.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's also the question of
the entire
Border Patrol, all of
Immigration and Customs

23:49.495 --> 23:51.363 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Enforcement.

23:51.397 --> 23:56.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They can now be sort of
refocused, retasked
on going out and finding more
people and getting

23:56.068 --> 23:57.970 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
them deported.

23:58.003 --> 24:03.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He would need more money to ramp
up the deportations
to the level that he's talked
about, but,

24:03.442 --> 24:07.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the short term, he can
absolutely redirect
them and really increase that
deportation

24:07.479 --> 24:09.181 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
apparatus.

24:09.214 --> 24:11.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Scott Horsley,
one of the
things -- one of the first
things on that

24:11.283 --> 24:16.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contract that Donald Trump has
with his voters
is to -- he wants to impose term
limits on

24:16.755 --> 24:18.490 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Congress.

24:18.524 --> 24:21.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as we saw, as -- Senate
Leader Mitch
McConnell yesterday, that's not
going to be

24:21.393 --> 24:24.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something that the Senate takes
up, not that
this is a failure of his
contract before he

24:24.730 --> 24:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even gets into office, but this
is a relationship
business.

24:27.933 --> 24:29.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCOTT HORSLEY: That's right.

24:29.868 --> 24:33.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think Senator McConnell
called that
a nonstarter, even though it's
right at the

24:33.105 --> 24:34.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
top of the 100-days agenda.

24:34.973 --> 24:40.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, in terms
of those things
in that contract, what does the
president-elect

24:40.512 --> 24:46.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do, Scott Horsley, to try to
figure out ways
where things can be more
palatable to a Congress

24:46.318 --> 24:48.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's willing and interested in
working with
him?

24:48.854 --> 24:53.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT HORSLEY: Well, there was a
lot of stuff
on that list that Donald Trump
hasn't talked

24:53.425 --> 24:55.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a lot about during the campaign.

24:55.227 --> 24:59.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And a lot of that
drain-the-swamp stuff wasn't
really a major focus of his
campaign.

24:59.531 --> 25:03.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The term limits, the lobbying
limits, that
was not something that he
campaigned on for

25:03.402 --> 25:05.771 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
months and months at a time.

25:05.804 --> 25:09.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The real priorities -- and these
are the things
that he talked about when he
went up to the

25:09.308 --> 25:13.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hill today to meet with Mitch
McConnell and
House Speaker Paul Ryan.

25:13.178 --> 25:17.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He focused on jobs, immigration,
and health
care.

25:17.149 --> 25:19.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
By health care, he means
repealing the Affordable
Care Act.

25:19.985 --> 25:23.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, certainly, those are all
issues that
a Republican Congress will look
on favorably.

25:23.155 --> 25:26.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Julie Rovner,
one of the things that we have
learned is

25:26.392 --> 25:31.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that it's reported 100,000
people signed up
for Obamacare after the results
of the election

25:31.864 --> 25:33.699 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
came in.

25:33.732 --> 25:41.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I say that because the
replace is one
part that is very complicated,
as you mentioned.

25:41.273 --> 25:46.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Paul Ryan seems to be fairly
confident that,
with a president who will not
veto this, that

25:46.812 --> 25:48.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it's more possible.

25:48.580 --> 25:51.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But how complicated is it to try
to come up
with something that they're
going to have

25:51.216 --> 25:53.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to have some bipartisan
agreement on to get
forward, going forward?

25:53.919 --> 25:55.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: Well, it's very
complicated.

25:55.687 --> 26:00.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, first, for the people who
are signing
up now for 2017, every
indication is that

26:00.192 --> 26:05.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that coverage will start on
January 1, 2017,
and continue probably even until
the end of

26:05.931 --> 26:10.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2017, possibly until the end of
the following
year, because what Congress
seems to want

26:10.068 --> 26:15.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do is do this partial repeal
and pick a
date out in the future,
basically give themselves

26:15.274 --> 26:18.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time, let the program exist as
it is, give
themselves time to come up with
that replacement.

26:19.011 --> 26:22.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That replacement, though, as you
mentioned,
is going to be very difficult.

26:22.147 --> 26:26.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans have had six years
to come up
with the replace part of repeal
and replace.

26:26.118 --> 26:31.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And sort of the best they have
been able to
come up with is a still pretty
outline outline

26:31.290 --> 26:33.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that House Speaker Ryan came out
with last
summer.

26:33.425 --> 26:37.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But turning that into a real
program might
be difficult, and it might not
be able to

26:37.763 --> 26:39.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
get through the Senate.

26:39.565 --> 26:43.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, it's a pretty risky
proposition, although
they have vowed so hard to
repeal the law

26:43.802 --> 26:45.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that they pretty much can't not.

26:45.604 --> 26:48.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And,
politically, there's
20 million people who are now
issued that

26:48.207 --> 26:49.942 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weren't.

26:49.975 --> 26:52.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: That's right, and
20 million
people whose insurance is tied
directly to

26:52.077 --> 26:56.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Affordable Care Act, so who
really would
be at risk of losing that
coverage if the

26:56.248 --> 26:58.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
law were simply repealed and
nothing replaced
it.

26:58.450 --> 27:01.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Alan Gomez,
another thing
that the president-elect has
said repeatedly

27:01.253 --> 27:04.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is about the concern that he has
about refugees
coming into the country.

27:04.957 --> 27:08.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said he wanted to -- quote --
"begin removing
the more than two million
criminal illegal

27:08.694 --> 27:12.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immigrants from the country,
cancel visas
to foreign countries that won't
take them

27:12.764 --> 27:19.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back, and suspend immigration
from terror-prone
regions where extreme vetting
can't happen."

27:19.104 --> 27:23.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the second part of that, how
does he implement
extreme vetting, or how do his
advisers or

27:23.675 --> 27:26.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
his future Department of
Homeland Security
head do that?

27:26.612 --> 27:30.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ: Well, that's another
area where
he has a lot of power.

27:30.449 --> 27:34.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When it comes to refugees, first
off, President
Obama has increased the number
of refugees

27:34.686 --> 27:41.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the U.S. has accepted each
year from
70,000 to 85,000 to 110,000 in
2017.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Trump could bring that
down to zero.

27:43.328 --> 27:45.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's completely in the purview
of the president.

27:45.364 --> 27:49.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, when it comes to
blocking immigrants
coming from other countries, at
first, he

27:49.568 --> 27:51.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
called it a ban on Muslims.

27:51.370 --> 27:55.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He later changed that to say
that he wants
to ban people who are coming
from countries

27:55.374 --> 27:59.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that sponsor terrorism, who are
fostering
terrorism.

27:59.244 --> 28:03.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's a provision in the
Immigration
Nationality Act that allows a
president to

28:03.715 --> 28:09.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bar specific immigrants or whole
classes of
immigrants who are deemed
detrimental to the

28:09.421 --> 28:11.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
interest of the United States.

28:11.323 --> 28:14.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, right now, there's a lot of
immigration
lawyers around the country
sitting there saying,

28:14.960 --> 28:19.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he could absolutely do that, and
it would
be really hard to challenge that
in court,

28:19.064 --> 28:24.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
because courts have
traditionally allowed
presidents to really take the
lead when it

28:24.636 --> 28:26.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
comes to immigration.

28:26.538 --> 28:30.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Alan Gomez from
USA Today, Scott Horsley from
NPR, Julie Rovner,

28:30.175 --> 28:36.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thank you so much for joining
us.

28:36.682 --> 28:46.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: When it comes to
economics,
president-elect Trump has
promised to revive

28:46.725 --> 28:51.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: When it comes to
economics,
president-elect Trump has
promised to revive

28:51.830 --> 28:58.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American manufacturing, get
tough on trade
with China, cut taxes and invest
in infrastructure.

28:58.971 --> 29:03.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman,
sat down with historian Adam
Tooze to put

29:03.809 --> 29:06.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mr. Trump's agenda in
perspective.

29:06.144 --> 29:08.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of his weekly series
Making Sense.

29:08.714 --> 29:14.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Columbia
University's Adam Tooze,
historian of the economics of
World War II

29:14.186 --> 29:19.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Germany in a book called "The
Wages of Destruction,"
and more recently author of "The
Deluge" on

29:19.658 --> 29:25.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
World War I and its economics,
at the moment,
he's working on a book about the
crash of

29:25.397 --> 29:32.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2008, all of which qualified
him, I thought,
to put Donald Trump's economic
plans in historical

29:32.971 --> 29:34.673 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
context.

29:34.706 --> 29:36.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM TOOZE, Columbia University:
Well, I think,
as a historian, what strikes one
the most

29:36.575 --> 29:42.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about this program is just
simply its nationalism,
with his commitment to the
redevelopment of

29:42.481 --> 29:47.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American manufacturing and
industrial jobs,
providing jobs for the
constituency that was

29:47.886 --> 29:49.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so important in electing him.

29:49.755 --> 29:51.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But he's addressing
that constituency?

29:51.590 --> 29:55.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM TOOZE: That is certainly
the promise
of his campaign and the promise
of his economic

29:55.227 --> 29:56.662 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
program.

29:56.695 --> 30:00.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This economic program is really
the pickup
truck of economic programs.

30:00.499 --> 30:03.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the Ford F-150 of economic
programs.

30:03.502 --> 30:05.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's about manufacturing.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's about oil, fossil fuels.

30:07.372 --> 30:14.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a deliberate, forceful
reassertion of
an image of American
industrialism that we

30:14.413 --> 30:15.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have inherited from the 20th
century.

30:15.947 --> 30:19.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: As a historian, do
you find that
anachronistic?

30:19.518 --> 30:23.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM TOOZE: Well, in some
senses, I think
it's almost deliberately
anachronistic.

30:23.755 --> 30:27.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's a retro feel to the
Trump program.

30:27.926 --> 30:32.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one can understand the
politics of that
at this moment.

30:32.230 --> 30:36.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an effort to buy time for a
constituency
of workers who have really been
suffering

30:36.668 --> 30:42.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the last 20 years, and who
need to be prepared
and be given time to prepare for
a transition

30:42.407 --> 30:48.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a very different type of
employment that
we may moving on to in the
coming decades.

30:48.447 --> 30:53.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What will be interesting to see
is whether
or not we see from the
administration initiatives

30:53.952 --> 30:59.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on higher education for this
work force, because
if those kinds of training
opportunities are

30:59.658 --> 31:05.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not provided, then I do think
this program
begins to look like a defensive
holding action,

31:05.630 --> 31:10.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a rear-guard action, buying time
for workers
who might not otherwise find
positions in

31:10.736 --> 31:12.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the 21st century.

31:12.671 --> 31:15.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But this was the
rationale for
saving the auto industry, wasn't
it, the Democratic

31:15.774 --> 31:24.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Party's rationale, which is, we
preserve jobs,
at least for a while, to keep
the people who

31:24.149 --> 31:25.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have had them employed.

31:25.550 --> 31:28.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADAM TOOZE: I think there's a
real common
ground here, in fact.

31:28.253 --> 31:34.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was an exception within the
Obama administration's
economic policy, a crisis that
he inherited

31:34.059 --> 31:37.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from the previous
administration, and felt
it was essential to carry
through on.

31:37.896 --> 31:43.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in a sense, I think one can
see the Trump
program as if it were that
element of the

31:43.368 --> 31:51.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bailout of 2009 writ very large,
and now extended
out towards both fossil fuels,
and, on the

31:51.143 --> 31:55.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other hand, the infrastructure
program, which
is such a key element of the
spending side

31:55.781 --> 31:57.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the Trump program.

31:57.582 --> 32:03.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: You're a scholar of
the economics
of the First World War, and the
economics

32:03.388 --> 32:06.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the Second World War, and
Germany in particular.

32:06.158 --> 32:07.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is there a connection in your
mind?

32:07.893 --> 32:11.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADAM TOOZE: Though you might as
well have
also said FDR and the New Deal.

32:11.096 --> 32:18.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the 1930s are the birth
moment of
modern public sector,
government-driven infrastructure

32:18.503 --> 32:20.572 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
spending.

32:20.605 --> 32:24.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The heyday perhaps of American
public infrastructure
is the Sputnik moment of the
1950s, the Eisenhower

32:24.442 --> 32:29.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration, for instance,
which rolls
out the modern interstate
system.

32:29.381 --> 32:32.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The highway system of the United
States is
built during this period.

32:32.851 --> 32:39.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This has a proud American
history behind it,
which Trump, in some sense, has
seized ownership

32:39.424 --> 32:41.126 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of.

32:41.159 --> 32:44.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But this is a
program that has
been associated with the
Democratic Party,

32:44.930 --> 32:46.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not the Republican Party.

32:46.731 --> 32:50.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM TOOZE: Well, I think,
there, you have
to be careful, because, in the
Trump stimulus

32:50.101 --> 32:52.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
package, there were two
elements.

32:52.037 --> 32:57.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is the infrastructure
investment program,
which at this moment doesn't
have the financing

32:57.876 --> 33:00.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spelled out in any effective
form.

33:00.245 --> 33:07.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we do have is a gigantic
matching tax-cutting
program as a way of stimulating
the economy.

33:07.786 --> 33:12.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: How have these tax
cuts worked,
when you look back at economic
history?

33:12.791 --> 33:15.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADAM TOOZE: There's no doubt
that they act
as a stimulus.

33:15.427 --> 33:17.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How could they not, in a sense?

33:17.062 --> 33:19.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're giving cash back to
households.

33:19.831 --> 33:22.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But they have two aspects.

33:22.300 --> 33:28.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One is that they're
unpredictable, and that
often rich and more affluent
households are

33:28.073 --> 33:30.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
slow to spend the funds.

33:30.275 --> 33:33.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other thing about tax cuts
is that they're
redistributive.

33:33.411 --> 33:37.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So they tend, naturally, to
benefit those
who pay tax.

33:37.649 --> 33:42.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And income tax in particular in
the United
States is concentrated on the
top half of

33:42.053 --> 33:46.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the income distribution, and
very heavily
skewed towards the top 10 or
even top 1 percent.

33:46.591 --> 33:51.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you stimulate the economy
by means
of a tax cut, the people that
you tend to

33:51.296 --> 33:53.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be benefiting are the better
off.

33:53.231 --> 34:00.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: So much of
president-elect Trump's
economic policy is focused on
unfair competition

34:00.672 --> 34:02.908 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from China.

34:02.941 --> 34:09.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is he not right to say that the
competition
has been unfair, and ought we
not be doing

34:09.547 --> 34:11.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
something about it?

34:11.383 --> 34:15.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM TOOZE: Viewing that complex
relationship
one-sidedly from the aspect of
manufacturing

34:15.353 --> 34:20.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the impact of Chinese
imports on the United
States makes sense from the
point of view

34:20.292 --> 34:22.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the Rust Belt of the United
States.

34:22.727 --> 34:27.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It may even make sense as a
political strategy
for a candidate running for
office.

34:27.532 --> 34:33.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a dramatic unwinding of that
relationship,
by way of an aggressive trade
policy, is one

34:33.338 --> 34:37.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the nightmare scenarios for
the global
economy as a whole, because it
would result

34:37.242 --> 34:42.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a spiraling depreciation of
the dollar,
a surge in American interests
rates, a collapse

34:42.681 --> 34:44.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the market for American
government debt.

34:44.416 --> 34:47.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would be terrible both for
the United States
and China.

34:47.585 --> 34:53.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The sorts of sectors which
feature so largely
in the Trump program, and its
rhetoric, account

34:53.959 --> 34:58.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now for perhaps only about 15
percent of the
American work force.

34:58.463 --> 35:00.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: And that's
manufacturing.

35:00.699 --> 35:05.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ADAM TOOZE: That's
manufacturing, industry,
mining, construction, heavy
manual blue-collar

35:05.503 --> 35:07.272 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
work.

35:07.305 --> 35:10.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The vast majority of Americans
are employed
in service sector industries,
and many of

35:10.475 --> 35:13.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
those sectors are highly
internationalized.

35:13.178 --> 35:17.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The most high-value added
sectors, notably
the tech sector, is massively
globalized.

35:17.415 --> 35:23.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, for them, it would be a
disaster if America's
trade policy was to go down a
spiraling route

35:23.054 --> 35:24.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
towards protectionism.

35:24.823 --> 35:29.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Could the Trump
constituency
be seeing something that a lot
of the rest

35:29.060 --> 35:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of America simply denies, that
is, that there
aren't going to be that many
good jobs in

35:35.734 --> 35:42.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the future because of automation
technology,
and, therefore, there's a need,
a social need,

35:42.707 --> 35:48.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a moral need for the country to
preserve their
jobs for at least as long as we
can?

35:48.279 --> 35:54.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM TOOZE: What I think the
appeal of the
Trump program has been is that
it offers some

35:54.152 --> 36:01.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of concrete, specific,
historically rooted,
a familiar image of how ordinary
Americans,

36:02.027 --> 36:03.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
regular Americans can earn their
living.

36:03.461 --> 36:05.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In the here and
now.

36:05.263 --> 36:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM TOOZE: In the here and now,
right now,
in a way in which we understand
and appreciate,

36:08.533 --> 36:11.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and which gives people a sense
of dignity
and value.

36:11.836 --> 36:19.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the niche, the gap
which this
program fills is one which
previous Democratic

36:19.310 --> 36:22.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
administrations, for all their
futuristic
embrace of globalization...

36:22.514 --> 36:24.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Bridge to the 21st
century.

36:24.282 --> 36:27.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM TOOZE: There was a bridge
to the 21st
century, and yet, somehow, for
very large

36:27.919 --> 36:32.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
number of Americans, it was
unclear how you
got from one place to the other,
from being

36:32.857 --> 36:39.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a manual working-class man to
being some part
of a Brooklyn-based sharing
economy.

36:39.898 --> 36:45.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That lack of clarity is, in a
sense, what
this vision of manufacturing
work rejuvenated

36:45.603 --> 36:46.571 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fills.

36:46.604 --> 36:50.742 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Adam Tooze, thank
you very much.

36:50.775 --> 36:58.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADAM TOOZE: Been a pleasure.

36:58.249 --> 37:05.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: More than half
the U.S. population
and more than half of the voters
in this election

37:05.790 --> 37:07.692 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were women.

37:07.725 --> 37:13.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among them, 42 percent voted for
Donald Trump,
54 percent went for Hillary
Clinton, essentially

37:13.598 --> 37:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the reverse of how men voted.

37:15.834 --> 37:21.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We explore how American women
view the prospect
of a Trump presidency now with
Missy Shorey.

37:21.673 --> 37:24.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She is executive director of
Maggie's List.

37:24.042 --> 37:28.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a political action group
that works to
elect conservative women to
Congress.

37:28.446 --> 37:31.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Goldie Taylor, she is editor
at large
for The Daily Beast.

37:31.616 --> 37:34.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you back
to the program.

37:34.786 --> 37:37.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Missy Shorey, you were
supporting Donald Trump.

37:37.755 --> 37:38.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He was your candidate.

37:38.756 --> 37:40.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How are you feeling about it?

37:40.492 --> 37:41.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MISSY SHOREY, Executive
Director, Maggie's
List: Well, first of all, thank
you, Judy.

37:41.993 --> 37:43.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, Goldie, thank you for your
service.

37:43.761 --> 37:46.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And happy birthday to the Marine
Corps.

37:46.131 --> 37:51.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Elated would be one word, but
it's very important
to say, as a Trump supporter,
I'm incredibly

37:51.536 --> 37:55.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happy, but it's very important
that we don't
gloat, but, rather, we're
grateful.

37:55.607 --> 37:59.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Goldie
Taylor, you didn't
support Mr. Trump.

37:59.577 --> 38:01.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How are you feeling?

38:01.379 --> 38:05.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOLDIE TAYLOR, The Daily Beast:
You know,
I certainly have to agree that
this is a time

38:05.083 --> 38:07.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of unity for the country, that
it isn't a
time for gloating.

38:07.886 --> 38:11.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is a time to roll up our
sleeves and really
get to work.

38:11.823 --> 38:13.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's going to come really,
I think,
from all of us.

38:13.925 --> 38:17.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Missy Shorey,
what do you say
to the women?

38:17.128 --> 38:23.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen pictures of women
crying, women
upset about the election of
Donald Trump.

38:23.268 --> 38:24.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What would you say to them?

38:24.569 --> 38:27.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MISSY SHOREY: I understand that
people can
be upset.

38:27.906 --> 38:32.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Certainly, I was upset, as well
as many other
people, when we saw reelections
of people

38:32.944 --> 38:34.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who are much more liberal.

38:34.445 --> 38:36.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The past last two
administrations were very
hard for a lot of people.

38:36.814 --> 38:42.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the important thing is to
remember that,
every time people protest, every
time they

38:42.453 --> 38:46.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yell, every time they have a
cry-in, if you
will, whether it be men or women
or students

38:46.758 --> 38:50.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
across America, they're delaying
the healing
process.

38:50.495 --> 38:51.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is a democracy.

38:51.896 --> 38:54.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's so important for us to
respect that.

38:54.365 --> 38:59.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was proud that the American
electorate selected
President Obama, to have our
first African-American

38:59.938 --> 39:00.905 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

39:00.939 --> 39:02.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was proud of that.

39:02.807 --> 39:06.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm proud now that so many
voices of people
who haven't voted for decades
are now voting.

39:06.511 --> 39:09.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Goldie Taylor,
you want to
respond to that?

39:09.781 --> 39:15.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in particular, what is it
that you think
women -- about women's
reactions, some of

39:15.453 --> 39:18.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
them, to Donald Trump's
election, what is
that saying?

39:18.189 --> 39:21.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GOLDIE TAYLOR: Well, I think we
all have something
really to be proud of here.

39:21.426 --> 39:24.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it's really the
peaceful transition
of power.

39:24.829 --> 39:29.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And whether there are protests
or tears, that
too is protected by our
Constitution.

39:29.100 --> 39:33.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that it's something that
we all really
should embrace and that, as this
administration

39:33.972 --> 39:38.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comes to growth, that there will
be a torrent
of support for his agenda, and
there will

39:38.977 --> 39:41.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also be a torrent of opposition
for that agenda.

39:41.613 --> 39:46.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we do that in a peaceful
manner, if we
engage in meaningful discourse,
if we really

39:46.050 --> 39:49.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
grapple with the issues before
us, I think
that we all win.

39:49.954 --> 39:53.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that, once we sort
of get through
the emotional upheaval of this
-- and, yes,

39:53.925 --> 39:57.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there was a tremendous emotional
upheaval
with the last two elections of
President Obama

39:57.962 --> 40:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- once we get over that, then
we really have
to get about the work of really
governing.

40:02.734 --> 40:05.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that's going to be
so awesomely
important.

40:05.403 --> 40:10.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, to ask for the reaction,
I think that
there were a fair number of
women and men

40:10.508 --> 40:14.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who were wholly vested in the
notion that
we were going to break that
ultimate glass

40:14.345 --> 40:16.147 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ceiling.

40:16.180 --> 40:21.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For me, it was less about
symbolism than about
the policies that we think may
or may not

40:21.552 --> 40:23.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
come from this administration.

40:23.254 --> 40:27.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking of
the message,
I want you both to again look at
a little

40:27.358 --> 40:31.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bit of what Hillary Clinton had
to say yesterday
in her concession speech
directed at young

40:31.229 --> 40:33.131 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
women.

40:33.164 --> 40:36.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
And to all the little girls who
are watching

40:36.401 --> 40:45.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this, never doubt that you are
valuable and
powerful and deserving of every
chance and

40:45.543 --> 40:50.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opportunity in the world to
pursue and achieve
your own dreams.

40:50.581 --> 40:57.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Missy Shorey, how
should young
women who are -- children, young
girls who

40:57.455 --> 41:00.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are old enough to understand
what's going
on, how should they see this?

41:00.758 --> 41:04.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The first woman who gets close
to the presidency
is rejected.

41:04.562 --> 41:08.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MISSY SHOREY: I would argue that
they should
know that they can achieve
anything, especially

41:08.599 --> 41:11.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if they work hard for it on
their own merit.

41:11.736 --> 41:14.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's something that
necessarily didn't
happen here.

41:14.238 --> 41:18.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, looking at Maggie's List,
for example,
we have outstanding women.

41:18.176 --> 41:20.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had a 66 percent win rate in
the general
election this year.

41:21.012 --> 41:22.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're very proud of that.

41:22.847 --> 41:29.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And looking to women like Martha
McSally and
Mia Love and Elise Stefanik as
young, very

41:29.420 --> 41:33.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dynamic leaders in the U.S.
House, they can
see that path.

41:33.524 --> 41:34.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now, granted, let's get clear.

41:34.892 --> 41:36.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's not the White House.

41:36.260 --> 41:39.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, indeed, Hillary Clinton has
gotten the
closest anyone else has.

41:39.564 --> 41:44.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But our founder, Margaret Chase
Smith, was
also placed in nomination by a
formal party,

41:44.268 --> 41:46.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Republican Party, in 1964.

41:46.571 --> 41:49.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, from that standpoint, it is
attainable.

41:49.741 --> 41:54.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I really appreciate Hillary
Clinton reminding
every woman of that, because it
is a uniting

41:54.946 --> 41:55.913 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
message.

41:55.947 --> 41:58.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I thought she was very gracious
in that moment.

41:58.249 --> 42:01.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's very important that we
all keep carrying
that forward.

42:01.352 --> 42:05.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I certainly hear and agree
with what Goldie
is saying and that same thing.

42:05.256 --> 42:11.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Are we upset that this
conversation literally
downgraded the way it did on
both sides?

42:11.262 --> 42:12.897 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
You bet.

42:12.930 --> 42:16.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, more importantly, it's now
about the
business of putting America back
on track

42:16.968 --> 42:18.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and literally making it great
again.

42:18.903 --> 42:22.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we should say
the women
Missy was mentioning -- Missy
Shorey was mentioning

42:22.140 --> 42:26.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
are members of Congress,
Republican members
of Congress.

42:26.144 --> 42:32.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Goldie Taylor, what about the --
Hillary Clinton's
message to young women and what
young women

42:32.283 --> 42:34.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in particular should be thinking
right now?

42:34.652 --> 42:38.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOLDIE TAYLOR: You know, I do
think that it
was a message certainly of
grace.

42:38.956 --> 42:44.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if we look across the
country and what
also happened on Tuesday night
is that there

42:44.529 --> 42:49.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were other women elected to the
United States
Senate, you know, Kamala Harris
from California,

42:49.834 --> 42:52.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tammy Duckworth from Illinois.

42:52.236 --> 42:57.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Harry Reid's seat, there will be
a woman in
his seat come this next term.

42:57.175 --> 43:00.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those are brand-new things for
this U.S. Senate.

43:00.445 --> 43:07.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that they will bring
their own
cultural lens to this job.

43:07.418 --> 43:12.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But having women elected to high
office, while
we certainly aspire to those
things, they

43:12.890 --> 43:18.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are really an outcome, you know,
rather than
sort of, you know, the causal
issue.

43:18.329 --> 43:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we see women attaining high
office, we
know that something else is
happening in America.

43:22.834 --> 43:24.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that means gender equality
is growing.

43:24.869 --> 43:26.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's really the important
part of this.

43:27.004 --> 43:31.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether or not man or a woman is
sitting in
the office is less relevant to
me than how

43:31.776 --> 43:34.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they choose to govern, how they
choose to
represent their constituencies.

43:34.445 --> 43:37.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me
just, though,
come back to the gender
question, finally,

43:37.582 --> 43:39.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
quickly to both of you.

43:39.350 --> 43:43.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Missy Shorey, what does this
election say
about the willingness of the
American people

43:43.554 --> 43:45.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to accept a woman as president,
do you think?

43:45.957 --> 43:50.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MISSY SHOREY: Well, the fact
that you had
someone who was a major nominee
and also another

43:50.161 --> 43:54.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
woman who was running on the
ticket and made
her way to the top-tier debates,
Carly Fiorina,

43:54.532 --> 43:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shows we're more than ready.

43:55.967 --> 43:57.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It just needs to be the right
woman.

43:57.735 --> 44:02.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Goldie
Taylor, are you
worried that it may be -- that
the message

44:02.373 --> 44:06.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sent may be that they're not
ready yet, we're
not ready yet for a woman
president?

44:06.744 --> 44:10.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOLDIE TAYLOR: I think the
country is more
than ready, as judged by the
popular vote

44:10.248 --> 44:14.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from Tuesday night, that Hillary
Clinton really
certainly did our country proud.

44:14.385 --> 44:20.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we, as women, I think, there
is something
to look to and to point to.

44:20.157 --> 44:24.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, again, Hillary Clinton,
while she was
a great national party
candidate, isn't the

44:24.996 --> 44:27.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only woman that's ever going to
run for president
again.

44:27.265 --> 44:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so I think this country is
more than ready.

44:29.534 --> 44:33.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, one of these days,
one woman
is going to crack that ultimate
glass -- is

44:33.437 --> 44:35.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to burst through that
ultimate glass
ceiling.

44:35.473 --> 44:38.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On that note, I
will thank
both of you.

44:38.409 --> 44:43.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Goldie Taylor and Missy Shorey,
we appreciate
it.

44:43.347 --> 44:51.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MISSY SHOREY: Thank you.

44:51.689 --> 44:59.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the
challenges overseas
that the new administration will
inherit is

44:59.196 --> 45:00.998 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the war in Iraq.

45:01.032 --> 45:05.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been almost a month since
the operation
to retake the ISIS-held city of
Mosul began.

45:05.703 --> 45:10.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Early on, the extremists sought
to divert
Kurdish forces from the fight by
attacking

45:10.575 --> 45:16.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kirkuk, the oil capital of
Northern Iraq that's
been held by the Kurds for more
than two years.

45:16.380 --> 45:19.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Special correspondent
Christopher Livesay
recently visited the multiethnic
city to see

45:19.917 --> 45:22.420 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
how it withstood the attack.

45:22.453 --> 45:30.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY: Kirkuk is
over 100 miles
southeast of the ISIS-held city
of Mosul.

45:30.561 --> 45:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, on October 21, no one could
tell the
difference.

45:35.399 --> 45:40.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was just four days into the
Iraqi-led offensive
to recapture Mosul, but, as
Kirkuk residents

45:40.972 --> 45:45.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
slept, a unit of ISIS fighters
launched an
attack on multiple locations
throughout the

45:45.743 --> 45:46.711 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
city.

45:46.744 --> 45:49.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The assault would last more than
two days.

45:49.313 --> 45:56.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When it was over, 116 people
were dead, including
police, military, and civilians,
and more

45:56.887 --> 46:00.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than 80 of the ISIS fighters
were killed.

46:00.891 --> 46:05.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among the dead and injured,
guests at the
neighboring Dar al Salam and
Snobar hotels

46:05.630 --> 46:06.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the city center.

46:06.964 --> 46:08.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mustafa Mohammed owns both.

46:08.899 --> 46:10.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is the aftermath of an RPG
right here?

46:10.034 --> 46:11.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MUSTAFA MOHAMMED, Hotel Owner:
That's right.

46:11.035 --> 46:12.503 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

46:12.536 --> 46:14.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they went on the second
floor and third
floor and the fourth floor.

46:14.205 --> 46:19.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY: You can
still see the
bullet holes that riddle the
walls.

46:19.210 --> 46:24.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Out this window here, you can
see what looks
like a bulletproof vest spread
open.

46:24.782 --> 46:29.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have got a pot full of food,
bottles of
waters, ammunition belts and
clothing strewn

46:29.754 --> 46:31.389 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
about.

46:31.422 --> 46:34.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once inside the hotel, the
militants had a
commanding view of government
areas.

46:34.992 --> 46:39.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The hotel is just across the
street from the
compound of Najmaldin Karim, the
governor

46:39.563 --> 46:41.365 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Kirkuk.

46:41.399 --> 46:43.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NAJMALDIN KARIM, Governor of
Kirkuk, Iraq:
We watched them on our monitor
and the cameras

46:43.668 --> 46:44.635 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from outside.

46:44.669 --> 46:46.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We could see them.

46:46.404 --> 46:52.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when they tried to come out,
a couple
of them came to detonate their
belt, and they

46:52.043 --> 46:53.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
were killed by our police.

46:53.878 --> 46:57.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY: That sounds
terrifying,
to be watching something like
that when you're

46:57.448 --> 46:59.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inside the target they're trying
to penetrate.

46:59.517 --> 47:01.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NAJMALDIN KARIM: Well, you don't
think about
fear at that time.

47:01.986 --> 47:04.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You think about how to kill
them.

47:04.188 --> 47:07.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY: The attack
was indeed
suppressed.

47:07.258 --> 47:11.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it still achieved much in
the Islamic
State's broader military
strategy, as it undergoes

47:11.696 --> 47:14.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a punishing offensive in and
around Mosul.

47:14.732 --> 47:20.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When ISIS attacked Kirkuk, they
managed to
divert thousands of anti-ISIS
fighters away

47:20.404 --> 47:22.173 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from Mosul.

47:22.206 --> 47:26.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The attack was so audacious, it
recalled the
ISIS takeover of Mosul two years
ago, thanks

47:26.677 --> 47:29.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in large part to the support of
the locals.

47:29.480 --> 47:33.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It appears ISIS hoped for a
similar welcome
in Kirkuk.

47:33.117 --> 47:34.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But that's not what happened.

47:34.952 --> 47:38.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NAJMALDIN KARIM: Their aim was
to come and
control this building, to be in
it, and declare

47:38.389 --> 47:43.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they that have controlled Kirkuk
and Kirkuk
was now part of the Islamic
State.

47:43.260 --> 47:47.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's something about Kirkuk
that's so different
from everywhere else.

47:47.164 --> 47:51.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In other places, when these
things happen,
people hide or run away.

47:51.168 --> 47:54.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They just evacuate.

47:54.105 --> 47:56.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The people of Kirkuk do the
contrary.

47:56.140 --> 48:01.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They put their belts on, they
put their guns
on, and their ammunitions, and
they will come

48:01.812 --> 48:03.314 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

48:03.347 --> 48:06.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Actually, we lost 34 people who
had just come
on their own as volunteers.

48:06.884 --> 48:11.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they were just killed,
because they didn't
know where the terrorists were,
and they were

48:11.288 --> 48:13.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
coming on the streets.

48:13.324 --> 48:21.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the people of Kirkuk are
very, very resilient,
and I think was in -- ISIS was
in for a surprise.

48:21.599 --> 48:25.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY: But the
attack may have
aggravated ethnic tensions.

48:25.035 --> 48:30.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amnesty International and the
United Nations
have accused Kurdish authorities
of driving

48:30.508 --> 48:34.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hundreds of Arab families out of
the city
in an act of retaliation.

48:34.945 --> 48:37.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NAJMALDIN KARIM: First of all,
that's not
true.

48:37.982 --> 48:44.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Several hundred families is
nothing compared
to 115 (INAUDIBLE) and families
who are all

48:44.955 --> 48:46.490 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Sunni Arabs in this city.

48:46.524 --> 48:50.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If there was such a policy, none
of these
would have been allowed to come
in.

48:50.261 --> 48:55.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY: Kirkuk is a
melting pot
of virtually every ethnic group
in Iraq, Kurds,

48:55.366 --> 48:57.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Turkmen, and Arabs.

48:57.101 --> 49:03.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They have co-existed for
centuries, but tensions
are not uncommon, and sometimes
violent.

49:03.274 --> 49:08.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISIS, which is made up of
Sunnis, has exploited
those tensions, and depended on
the support

49:08.345 --> 49:11.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of sympathetic Sunni Arabs
across Iraq and
Syria.

49:11.649 --> 49:15.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, in Kirkuk, that alliance
appears weak.

49:15.152 --> 49:20.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During our interview with the
governor, a
Sunni Arab named Mohammed Jawad
Ali Jasim

49:20.624 --> 49:22.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
arrived to tell us his story.

49:22.126 --> 49:24.562 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NAJMALDIN KARIM: He says he
killed two ISIS.

49:24.595 --> 49:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY: He says
ISIS militants
stormed into his home seeking
refuge.

49:29.567 --> 49:35.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, Jasim says he shot two
of them dead
with his own AK-47.

49:35.139 --> 49:40.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Out of desperation, the third
attacker detonated
a suicide bomb, wounding him.

49:40.277 --> 49:46.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sheik Anwar Al-Asi is the emir
of the Al-Ubaid
Tribes, a prominent Sunni in
both Kirkuk,

49:46.750 --> 49:48.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as well as ISIS-held territory.

49:49.019 --> 49:53.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says that many Sunnis,
including members
of his tribes, supported ISIS at
the beginning.

49:53.991 --> 49:57.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHEIKH ANWAR AL-ASI, Emir,
Al-Ubaid Tribes
(through translator): There is
some.

49:57.394 --> 49:59.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I can't deny that.

49:59.163 --> 50:00.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is a section that helps
ISIS.

50:00.965 --> 50:04.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY: Those views
have made
him a target.

50:04.301 --> 50:10.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two years ago, ISIS blew up his
home near
Kirkuk when he refused to join
their alliance.

50:10.641 --> 50:13.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, its riches aren't
limited to cultural
diversity.

50:13.510 --> 50:16.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kirkuk is a trove of natural
resources.

50:16.513 --> 50:21.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This oil field and others like
it make Kirkuk
the largest producer oil
producer in all of

50:21.151 --> 50:23.120 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Northern Iraq.

50:23.153 --> 50:28.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that makes Kirkuk an even
more attractive
prize to Islamic State, which
fueled its unprecedented

50:28.359 --> 50:33.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expansion across Iraq and Syria
in large part
by selling crude on the black
market.

50:34.031 --> 50:39.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These fields are just a short
distance from
Hawija, a vast area held by ISIS
on the border

50:39.069 --> 50:41.572 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Kirkuk.

50:41.605 --> 50:46.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amir Taleb Faruq commands the
Hawija front
line for the Peshmerga, the
Kurdish military

50:46.410 --> 50:50.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
force that's been the most
successful bulwark
against ISIS since its invasion.

50:51.015 --> 50:55.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMIR TALEB FARUQ, Peshmerga
Commander (through
translator): ISIS attacked over
in this area

50:55.953 --> 50:57.454 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
six days ago.

50:57.488 --> 51:00.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, just as in the past, we
subdued them,
and they didn't break through.

51:00.824 --> 51:04.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY: Moments
later, an explosion
in ISIS territory.

51:05.029 --> 51:07.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Smoke billows from a white
building.

51:07.364 --> 51:12.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coalition forces launched an
airstrike on
the same area the night before.

51:12.069 --> 51:18.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coalition airstrikes have been
instrumental
in repelling ISIS from Kirkuk.

51:18.042 --> 51:23.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Major General Westa Rasul shows
us some armored
ISIS vehicles they captured
after a battle.

51:23.781 --> 51:25.349 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're known as death cars.

51:25.382 --> 51:26.350 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
MAJ.

51:26.383 --> 51:28.252 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

51:28.285 --> 51:31.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WESTA RASUL, Peshmerga (through
translator):
Last year, ISIS sent three of
these cars towards

51:31.155 --> 51:32.222 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Kirkuk.

51:32.256 --> 51:33.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Two of them were halted.

51:33.991 --> 51:38.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of them made it three
kilometers past
the Peshmerga front line,
because nothing

51:38.095 --> 51:39.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can stop these things.

51:39.630 --> 51:42.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY: These ISIS
death traps
are virtually indestructible.

51:42.533 --> 51:44.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RPGs can't take them out.

51:44.034 --> 51:46.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Machine gun fire can't take them
out.

51:46.236 --> 51:47.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But airstrikes can.

51:47.304 --> 51:49.073 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And one did in this case.

51:49.106 --> 51:53.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the exit wound of an
airplane that
fired down a missile on this
thing and took

51:53.043 --> 51:54.578 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it out.

51:54.611 --> 51:58.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Peshmerga and the Iraqi army
now have
Hawija surrounded, says the
general.

51:58.482 --> 52:03.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the border is vast and, in
some places,
porous, despite a sprawling wall
the Peshmerga

52:03.654 --> 52:06.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have built between Kirkuk and
the Islamic
State.

52:06.890 --> 52:11.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's believed that the fighters
who launched
the attack on Kirkuk came from
this area,

52:11.795 --> 52:13.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and locals fear they could come
again.

52:13.263 --> 52:14.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MUSTAFA MOHAMMED: You get used
to it.

52:14.565 --> 52:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY: So, it
might happen again.

52:15.866 --> 52:16.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's just that you're not
worried.

52:16.867 --> 52:17.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUSTAFA MOHAMMED: It might be.

52:17.868 --> 52:18.836 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It might be.

52:18.869 --> 52:20.404 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

52:20.437 --> 52:22.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY: But that
isn't stopping
him from rebuilding his hotels.

52:22.840 --> 52:27.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Despite the risks from ISIS and
lingering
sectarian divisions in Kirkuk,
he says the

52:27.578 --> 52:29.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
city will endure.

52:29.146 --> 52:31.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kirkuk will outlive ISIS, he
says.

52:31.815 --> 52:34.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the future of Iraq is less
certain.

52:34.718 --> 52:40.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Christopher Livesay
