00:47.414 --> 00:50.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
buy their tickets somewhere else
from someone who will offer them

WOODRUFF: Republican Donald
Trump gets back to campaigning
tonight, now that he's virtually

01:13.774 --> 01:19.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wrapped up the GOP nomination
for president. But as he works
to win over voters, he faces

01:19.913 --> 01:25.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new resistance from leaders in
his own party. The latest
example came today from Paul
Ryan,

01:25.352 --> 01:28.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
speaker of the House
of Representatives.

01:28.355 --> 01:32.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We begin our coverage with John
Yang, who's covering tonight's
Trump event in West Virginia.

JOHN YANG, PBS NEWSHOUR
CORRESPONDENT: For Donald Trump,
tonight's event in Charleston

01:37.064 --> 01:42.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
isn't about next week's primary,
it s all about winning the fall
campaign.

01:42.102 --> 01:47.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK KEYSER: He come out, he won
Indiana, secured the nomination
and one of the first

01:47.207 --> 01:50.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things that come out of his
mouth was we're going to help
people in West Virginia, we're

01:50.310 --> 01:54.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
going to help people in
Pennsylvania, we're going to get
coal back on the market.

01:54.548 --> 01:59.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YANG: And in today's "New York
Times," Trump outlined goals for
his first 100 days in office.

01:59.186 --> 02:04.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They include: designing the wall
he says he'll build on the
Mexican border, stopping Muslim

02:04.958 --> 02:09.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immigration, auditing the
Federal Reserve, and repealing
the Affordable Care Act.

02:09.563 --> 02:13.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He also went on CNBC, making
his economic pitch to voters.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE: They have two jobs in
some cases, and they're

02:16.570 --> 02:21.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
making less money than they made
20 years ago. And that's why
you're wondering what's

02:21.041 --> 02:25.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going on and why they're not
liking Republicans or Democrats.
I mean, they're not liking
either,

02:25.879 --> 02:28.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be honest with you.

02:28.281 --> 02:33.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YANG: But there's was new
evidence that Trump has a long
way to go to rally his own party

02:33.120 --> 02:38.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
behind him. House Speaker Paul
Ryan said today, he s not ready
to back Trump, and there

02:38.992 --> 02:42.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was more. "Politico" obtained a
recording of Republican Senator
John McCain speaking

02:42.462 --> 02:45.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at a recent fundraiser.

02:45.365 --> 02:52.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA:
If Donald Trump is at the top of
the ticket, here in Arizona,

02:52.706 --> 02:55.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with over 30 percent of the vote
being the Hispanic vote, no
doubt that this may be the

02:55.742 --> 02:57.677 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
race of my life.

02:57.677 --> 03:01.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YANG: Nevertheless, top Trump
aides have begun the behind the
scenes overtures to party
leaders.

03:01.481 --> 03:05.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They've already had some
success. A number of Republican
members of Congress, are signing

03:05.085 --> 03:07.788 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
up to lend their support.

03:07.788 --> 03:12.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, the Democrats are
still battling. Bernie Sanders
is in West Virginia, too.

03:12.726 --> 03:15.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT),
DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE: It's about time we
started in the

03:15.028 --> 03:17.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wealthiest nation in the
world to talk about poverty.

(CHEERS)

03:20.133 --> 03:24.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YANG: Still dogging Hillary
Clinton despite her big lead in
delegates.

03:24.838 --> 03:28.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Clinton already has Trump
squarely in her sights.

03:28.008 --> 03:31.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HILLARY CLINTON (D),
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think
that anybody running for office
should

03:31.211 --> 03:37.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spend as much or more time
listening than talking and I
know I will be way ahead in

03:37.050 --> 03:40.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that category against Donald
Trump, there s no doubt about
that.

03:40.387 --> 03:43.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
YANG: She spent today
campaigning and fundraising in
California.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

03:45.692 --> 03:51.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YANG: People have been waiting
for hours in the cold rain in
Charleston, waiting for Donald

03:51.098 --> 03:57.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump to do what he says working
on Hillary Clinton, the
beginning of a general election

03:57.003 --> 04:01.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaign. A lot of the people
online say they re excited to
see Trump as the nominee for the

04:01.241 --> 04:04.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
very first time -- Judy.

04:04.211 --> 04:08.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: So, John, do you sense
there is something different in
how they see him now

04:08.548 --> 04:11.451 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
that he's the
presumptive nominee?

04:11.451 --> 04:15.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
YANG: I think there is
excitement that he's now the
guy, he has now cleared the way
to

04:15.822 --> 04:19.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the nomination and that he ll
start to take on Hillary
Clinton. A lot of the people we

04:19.526 --> 04:22.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
talked to said they were
very excited to see that.

04:22.796 --> 04:29.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of talk here about West
Virginia. They hope he can help
West Virginia's economy,

04:29.536 --> 04:35.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
particularly the coal workers we
talked to, who were -- expressed
some anger at what they

04:35.208 --> 04:40.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
heard from Hillary Clinton
lately about putting coal
workers out of work, Judy.

04:40.981 --> 04:47.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And, John, what have
you learned about how Donald
Trump may be shaping a different

04:47.521 --> 04:52.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of campaign going into the
general election against
Secretary Clinton, assuming it
is

04:52.959 --> 04:54.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Secretary Clinton?

04:54.795 --> 04:59.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YANG: Well, that's the big
question, Judy. These campaign
-- this campaign has been unlike

04:59.799 --> 05:05.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anything we've ever seen before.
Not much television ads. A lot
of social media. A lot

05:05.105 --> 05:08.675 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
of free media.
Television interviews.

05:08.675 --> 05:13.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He only has one event a day,
usually late in the day like
this one because he's going

05:13.747 --> 05:19.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
home every night, commuting to
New York and flying out again
the next day. The big question

05:19.653 --> 05:23.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is whether this will change in
the general election, although
some may say you don t

05:23.256 --> 05:25.692 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tinker with success -- Judy.

05:25.692 --> 05:30.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And, finally, John, we
know that Hillary Clinton's
opponent Bernie Sanders

05:30.830 --> 05:36.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is also in West Virginia today.
Any read on the kind of
reception he's getting there?

05:36.403 --> 05:41.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YANG: He s a pretty strong lead
in the polls, about 8-point lead
in the last pre-primary

05:41.875 --> 05:47.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
poll. And what's fueling his
campaign are a lot of the same
issues and the same forces

05:47.747 --> 05:54.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the same demographics that
is giving Trump a lot of
strength here. This is a state
of

05:54.621 --> 06:02.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
poor white voters, a lot of whom
are hurting very much from the
economy, a lot of people

06:02.996 --> 06:08.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hurting from the downturn in the
coal industry, a lot of those
things giving fuel to Sanders'

06:08.235 --> 06:12.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaign and it's also likely to
help him at some of the other
states down the road

06:12.405 --> 06:18.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like Kentucky, right down until
that big showdown in California.

06:18.979 --> 06:24.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he's going to be dogging
Hillary Clinton every step of
the way right to the end --
Judy.

06:24.184 --> 06:29.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: John Yang reporting
for us from what will be a Trump
campaign event in Charleston,

06:29.356 --> 06:30.490 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
West Virginia -- we thank you.

06:30.490 --> 06:33.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
YANG: Thanks, Judy.

06:33.793 --> 06:38.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: We'll take a closer
look at how Republicans are
dividing over Donald Trump

06:38.331 --> 06:41.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as their nominee a little
later in the program.

SREENIVASAN: In the day's other
news, a raging wildfire forced
new evacuations in the heart

06:46.039 --> 06:51.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Canada's oil sands country.
Wind-driven flames had already
put more than 80,000 people

06:51.511 --> 06:56.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to flight, from Fort McMurray in
Alberta. There were more towns
to the south that were

06:56.883 --> 07:00.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
evacuated as the fire swept
across tinder-dry woodlands.

PAUL DAVIES, INDEPENDENT
TELEVISION NEWS: They are
driving away from homes they
have

07:06.793 --> 07:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
abandoned to the flames. The
fire so close, it's showering
sparks from trees it's consuming

07:13.266 --> 07:18.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alongside the road. And caught
in this vision of Armageddon,
thousands of families running

07:18.138 --> 07:21.041 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for their lives.

07:21.041 --> 07:27.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How long it will be before Fort
McMurray will welcome people
again, no one can know.

07:27.580 --> 07:32.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The city had laid on a fleet of
buses to help the less
advantaged escape from the
inevitable

07:32.852 --> 07:36.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
destruction, but there were
strict limits on what
possessions could be taken. For
many,

07:36.856 --> 07:40.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it was the clothes they could
carry and their pets but no
more.

07:40.593 --> 07:44.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONNA GOALLAMOT, EVACUEE: You
don't know what's burned and
what s not burned, when you can

07:44.397 --> 07:50.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go back. Now you're sitting here
and all you see is red flames.
It's pretty scary.

07:50.704 --> 07:55.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVIES: The evacuation so far
prevented loss of life but in
the suburbs where the flames

07:55.942 --> 08:00.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have done their worse and moved
on, there is little left for
people to return to.

08:00.980 --> 08:05.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two thousand buildings have been
destroyed and tonight there are
fears large portions

08:05.418 --> 08:08.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

hospital for treatment.
Officials

08:31.945 --> 08:36.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

It was unclear whose

Davutoglu had held his office

with President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan, who's pushing for
greater

09:22.629 --> 09:27.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

prime minister pledged continued

his crackdown on dissent.

TURKEY (translated): My loyalty
to our president will continue

09:35.842 --> 09:40.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
until the last breath I will
breathe. Nobody has or will hear
a single word against our

Everybody should know that and I
would never let people exploit

as Europe is relying on Turkey
to cut off the flow of

assaults reported in the
military

09:59.799 --> 10:04.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

E-cigarettes turn nicotine into

Meanwhile,

significantly among young people
and cigar smoking continues to

12:52.271 --> 12:59.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
be a problem among high

millions of kids are being
introduced

12:59.278 --> 13:05.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

ADMINISTRATION: No child, no
teenager should be exposed to

14:14.420 --> 14:18.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nicotine. Nicotine is addictive.
E-cigarettes have nicotine in
them. Kids should not be

14:18.925 --> 14:22.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
inhaling those products
into their lungs.

14:22.328 --> 14:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a separate debate about
whether e-cigarettes have a
public health benefit to some
current

14:27.033 --> 14:32.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cigarette smokers who might be
able to use the product to
transition away from harmful

14:32.305 --> 14:36.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cigarettes, but there should be
no harm reduction questions
about kids. Kids should not be
using

14:36.242 --> 14:40.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
e-cigarettes and today's action
will take this product out of

to transition away from
conventional cigarettes using
this as a way to step down?

14:51.891 --> 14:57.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZELLER: FDA is a public health
protection and consumer agency
and we will make policy

14:57.063 --> 15:02.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where the science takes us. The
fact is that 70 percent of all
adult e-cigarettes consumers

15:02.168 --> 15:07.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
today are still smoking
cigarettes together with their
e-cigarettes. So, we don't know

15:07.140 --> 15:12.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if they're transitioning away
from e-cigarettes or if along
the way, 70 percent of all adult

15:12.678 --> 15:14.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
e-cigarette users are still
smoking cigarettes, they're
losing interest in quitting
conventional

15:14.714 --> 15:16.315 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cigarettes.

15:16.315 --> 15:18.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: So, how do we
measure all this, where's the
science behind exactly what s

15:18.651 --> 15:21.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
happening, how the
behaviors are changing?

15:21.354 --> 15:26.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZELLER: FDA is making a massive
investment in what we call the
regulatory science to

15:26.526 --> 15:31.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get answers to two fundamental
questions -- who is using
products like e-cigarettes and
how

15:31.464 --> 15:38.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are they being used? We are
following 46,000 children and
adults to get answers to
questions

15:38.337 --> 15:42.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which products are you using,
why are you using them, and how
our patterns of use changing?

15:42.408 --> 15:45.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: So, the industry is
also pushing back as expected.
And saying, look, the fees

15:45.945 --> 15:50.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the process and structure
you have for the applications is
going to essentially close

15:50.183 --> 15:53.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
down some of those small
businesses and small
manufacturers and it s
essentially going

15:53.019 --> 15:56.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to protect the big tobacco
companies that have shifted and
you really will be giving

15:56.489 --> 15:59.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
them an advantage
over the long haul.

15:59.091 --> 16:03.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZELLER: This is a public health
issue. Beyond e-cigarettes we're
talking about the need

16:03.262 --> 16:09.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to regulate cigars. Every single
day, more teenage boys light up
a cigar for the first

16:09.101 --> 16:13.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time than light up a regular
cigarette. So, between cigars
and e-cigarettes, we have a

16:13.272 --> 16:18.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lot of work to do to protect
kids from the harms of tobacco
products.

16:18.411 --> 16:24.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are costs that are
associated with becoming
regulated. We have tried to
address the concerns

16:24.283 --> 16:28.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of small businesses. And I
disagree with the assessment
that this is an industry that's

16:28.487 --> 16:33.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going out of business. They may
have to transition away from the
conventional model that we see

16:33.059 --> 16:36.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a typical vape shop, but
there is time to submit the
applications, time for us to

16:36.729 --> 16:39.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
conduct our reviews and
we ll take it as it goes.

16:39.966 --> 16:42.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Some of the health
advocates are saying, listen,
there is almost too much

16:42.568 --> 16:47.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time involved, there s up to
three years and some of these
folks can continue to sell

16:47.573 --> 16:49.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their wares that they are
selling today, knowing that at
that point is when they have to
sunset

16:49.942 --> 16:52.011 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their business.

16:52.011 --> 16:55.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZELLER: And that s what we ve
done today is reasonable and
sensible regulation. We

16:55.982 --> 17:01.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
received over 135,000 comments
as part of our rule making
process. And on the issue

17:01.254 --> 17:06.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of flavors in e-cigarettes, we
got comments across the board,
from public health groups

17:06.158 --> 17:09.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that said flavors should be
band, to users of e-cigarette
who said, anecdotally, that's

17:09.495 --> 17:11.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what got me off cigarettes.

17:11.797 --> 17:17.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we think we've struck the
right middle of the road here.
The key point here is that

17:17.403 --> 17:22.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what FDA has done today is
foundational. Finally,
e-cigarettes, cigars and hookah
will be regulated

attracts the young kids is the
flavors, why not have something

17:30.549 --> 17:34.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that addresses the
flavors today?

17:34.020 --> 17:38.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZELLER: We will be able to
address the rule of flavors in
each and every one of the
applications

17:38.024 --> 17:42.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the companies submitted for
marketing authorization, and
they will have to answer

17:42.361 --> 17:47.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our questions about what role
are the flavors in your products
playing in initiation by

17:47.166 --> 17:50.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kids and initiation by anyone
who's never used the product?
We'll be able to handle

17:50.336 --> 17:52.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that through the applications.

17:52.271 --> 17:57.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: There is also
concern there is a grandfather
date going back to 2007. It s

17:57.076 --> 18:02.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
essentially saying we're going
to start the rule making back
then. Well, are you maybe

18:02.782 --> 18:06.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
protecting devices that were
more dangerous and didn't have
to comply with the rules that

18:06.452 --> 18:08.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you're imposing today?

18:08.621 --> 18:14.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZELLER: The grandfather date is
a legislative and legal issue,
and what we said is that,

18:14.093 --> 18:18.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as a regulatory agency, we can't
change the date by which certain
products would receive

18:18.798 --> 18:23.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
grandfather status and be
exempt from pre-market review.

18:23.035 --> 18:27.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What some in industry are trying
to do is advance the grandfather
date in a way that

18:27.173 --> 18:31.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we think and the administration
thinks will be harmful to public
health by forever exempting

18:31.911 --> 18:36.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
all currently marketed
e-cigarettes and cigars from a
pre-market review by the Food
and Drug

18:36.015 --> 18:39.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Administration. We think that
would be bad for health.

18:39.285 --> 18:42.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: If Congress can
change the date in one
direction, they can change it in
the

18:42.054 --> 18:44.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other. What happens to the
entire force of the law if that
grandfather date is moved

18:44.924 --> 18:47.560 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to, say, 2016?

18:47.560 --> 18:52.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZELLER: If that legislation
passes, we think that public
health will be harmed because

18:52.298 --> 18:57.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of the most important
responsibilities that Congress
gave FDA was to apply public

18:57.203 --> 19:01.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health principles to determine
which products would be
authorized for marketing. If
they

19:01.273 --> 19:04.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
received grandfather status and
we don't have the opportunity to
apply those public health

19:04.944 --> 19:07.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
principles, we don't think
that's good for public health.

19:07.380 --> 19:16.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Mitch Zeller from
the FDA -- thanks so much for
joining us.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ZELLER: Thank you.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.894 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

19:21.894 --> 19:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Now, back to the
race for the White House.

19:27.266 --> 19:31.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As we reported, House Speaker
Paul Ryan today became the
highest ranking Republican yet

19:31.303 --> 19:35.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to say he's not ready to
support Donald Trump.

19:35.708 --> 19:41.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We examine the divisions the
Trump nomination is driving with
two conservatives on either

19:41.380 --> 19:45.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
side of the split. We start with
a Trump supporter,
Representative Tom Marino who
joins us from

19:45.418 --> 19:48.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
State College, Pennsylvania.

19:48.421 --> 19:51.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Congressman Marino, thank
you for joining us.

19:51.891 --> 19:55.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You endorsed Donald Trump as
early as just about anybody in
the House of Representatives

19:55.394 --> 19:57.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
back in February. Why?

19:57.997 --> 20:02.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REP. TOM MARINO (R),
PENNSYLVANIA: Well, it's very
simple. I'll answer that with a
rhetorical

20:02.234 --> 20:07.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
statement. How's it been knowing
the last 30 years having
governors, senators, and career

20:07.573 --> 20:14.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
politicians being president,
we're $20 trillion in debt, 20
million people out of work,
businesses

20:14.146 --> 20:19.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are leaving the country in
droves, the borders are not
secured, people tell me in my
district

20:19.385 --> 20:22.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're afraid they're not going
to be able to even send their
kids to school because

20:22.788 --> 20:26.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they don't know if they're going
to have a job or find a job.

20:26.292 --> 20:32.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Donald Trump has hired tens
of thousands of people. He's the
only candidate that has

20:32.064 --> 20:34.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
signed the front of a paycheck.

20:34.667 --> 20:39.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just was talking to him the
other day -- and you know what
one of his first meetings among

20:39.438 --> 20:43.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
others is going to be? It s
going to be with businesspeople,
business women and men,

20:43.509 --> 20:47.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who can tell Donald what the
problem, is why they have to
leave this country.

20:47.146 --> 20:49.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I think it's a no-brainer.

20:49.949 --> 20:53.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Congressman, what do
you say to fellow Republicans
who say they don't believe

20:53.586 --> 20:57.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Donald Trump is really,
truly conservative?

20:57.623 --> 21:05.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARINO: Well, you know, I m a
conservative. Donald is a --
he's an individual that touches

21:05.364 --> 21:12.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all Americans, Republicans,
Democrats and independents. He's
a populist. He's bringing

21:12.104 --> 21:17.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more and more people out to vote
that ever came out to vote in
the past.

21:17.510 --> 21:22.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's going to have -- when the
primary is over, he's going to
have more votes from the

21:22.548 --> 21:29.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans than any other
presidential primary candidate
in the history of this country.

21:29.789 --> 21:34.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's built a $10 billion
business by surrounding him with
the best and the brightest, and
I

21:34.727 --> 21:37.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't see what any of these
other people have to offer.

21:37.930 --> 21:42.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The American people are sick and
tired of being sick. They're
sick and tired of the

21:42.568 --> 21:47.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
establishment, the career
politicians, the so-called
political bosses in Washington,

21:47.706 --> 21:52.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, really, what we needed to
do was bulldoze Washington and
start over.

21:52.044 --> 21:56.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And, Congressman, the
other -- one of the other
criticisms one hears about Mr.

21:56.482 --> 22:02.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump is about his temperament.
There are some who say they
might be willing to support

22:02.421 --> 22:07.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him but worry as president he
doesn't have the temperament to
be leader of the free world.

22:07.193 --> 22:11.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARINO: Well, if he didn't have
the temperament to be the
president, I don't think he
would

22:11.830 --> 22:17.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be as successful as he is in
business. I have been with him
many times, smoking with him

22:17.937 --> 22:22.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
many times. He asked my
advice. I give it to him.

22:22.374 --> 22:27.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't say just exactly what
you might want to hear because
I m that kind of a person,

22:27.346 --> 22:31.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but just look in the past. What
has -- what does Hillary Clinton
have to offer? You know,

22:31.116 --> 22:37.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what do other candidates have to
offer as far as creating jobs?

22:37.389 --> 22:42.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's known all over the world
and he's certainly going to let
the rest of the world know that

22:42.261 --> 22:45.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we don't think we're better than
anyone else, but we re not going
to be taken advantage

22:45.798 --> 22:51.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of anymore like we have been in
trade, like we have been in
foreign affairs concerning

22:51.403 --> 22:56.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Putin. He's going to take China
on. I think they know that he's
a serious guy and I believe

22:56.642 --> 23:01.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he's going to make this
country great again with the
help of the American people.

23:01.947 --> 23:06.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And what do you say to
the leader in your own party in
the House of Representatives,

23:06.085 --> 23:10.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Speaker Paul Ryan, who said
today he's not ready to support
Donald Trump because he still

23:10.422 --> 23:14.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has work to do to
unify your party?

23:14.260 --> 23:20.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARINO: Well, Paul is new at the
job. It's a big switch going
from the chairman over

23:20.532 --> 23:25.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the speaker of the House
because there is no one in the
public's eye than the speaker

23:25.504 --> 23:28.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
other than the president.

23:28.674 --> 23:33.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I'm going to give Paul the
benefit of the doubt. We're back
in D.C. next week. We'll

23:33.846 --> 23:39.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a discussion about that.
There it is a responsibility
there that he has to work

23:39.985 --> 23:44.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to bring the party together and
I know he and Donald have been
having discussions.

23:44.590 --> 23:47.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Representative Tom
Marino of Pennsylvania, we thank
you very much.

23:47.960 --> 23:51.196 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARINO: It's always my pleasure.

23:51.196 --> 23:56.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And Donald Trump has
responded to Speaker Ryan this
evening. In his statement,

23:56.168 --> 24:01.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he said, quote, "I am not ready
to support Speaker Ryan's
agenda. Perhaps in the future

24:01.573 --> 24:06.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we can work together and come to
an agreement about what is best
for the American people.

24:06.779 --> 24:10.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have been treated so badly
for so long that it's about time
for politicians to put

24:10.349 --> 24:13.319 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
them first."

24:13.319 --> 24:18.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now for a view from a
conservative critic of Donald
Trump, we turn to John
McCormack,

24:18.090 --> 24:20.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
senior writer at "The
Weekly Standard" magazine.

24:20.559 --> 24:23.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John McCormack, welcome.

24:23.128 --> 24:27.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why are you opposed to Mr.
Trump as the party's nominee?

24:27.166 --> 24:29.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN MCCORMACK, THE WEEKLY
STANDARD: Well, you know, what
you heard Paul Ryan say today

24:29.968 --> 24:34.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is that we want a standard
bearer who bears our standards.
And you could view that from

24:34.873 --> 24:38.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one respect as a matter of
ideology, something that Paul
Ryan would say is that we're
going

24:38.610 --> 24:41.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have a debt crisis if we
don't get entitlements under
control, Donald Trump is
completely

24:41.747 --> 24:44.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not a conservative on that
and many other issues.

24:44.817 --> 24:49.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for me, really, the issue is
more of temperament and
character. I think that for the
past ten

24:49.121 --> 24:53.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
months, Donald Trump has proven
to be nothing less than an
unstable conspiracy theorist

24:53.759 --> 24:57.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with an authoritarian streak.
You know, he has -- he got his
start in politics saying

24:57.963 --> 25:03.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Barack Obama's birth certificate
was fake. He suggests that
George W. Bush knowingly

25:03.135 --> 25:07.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lied that there are weren't
weapons of mass destruction in
Iraq. That s an unproven

25:07.206 --> 25:11.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conspiracy theory. Just this
week, he said that Ted Cruz's
father was involved in the

25:11.643 --> 25:13.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JFK assassination.

25:13.545 --> 25:18.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That s just sheer lunacy, and it
doesn t, it s not the kind of
stability that you

25:18.050 --> 25:22.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want in a commander-in-chief.
So, for me, I d be willing to
take a chance on Donald

25:22.054 --> 25:25.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump, if you just simply want
quite (ph) as conservatives I
like. But again, on matters

25:25.424 --> 25:28.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of character and temperament, I
just don't think he's there.

25:28.260 --> 25:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Well, you probably
heard, I talked with Congressman
Tom Marino of Pennsylvania,

25:34.900 --> 25:39.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who I asked him that temperament
question, and he said, well,
he's been a successful

25:39.571 --> 25:41.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
businessman. He said his
temperament is what's helped him
get him where he is today. What

25:41.807 --> 25:44.042 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about that?

25:44.042 --> 25:47.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MCCORMACK: Well, if you look at
a lot of his business dealings,
you know, he's really just

25:47.813 --> 25:53.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
insulted a lot of people, been
very aggressive. He's gotten
where he is more out of his fame

25:53.819 --> 26:00.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than business acumen. I mean,
just in his campaign, we've seen
him denigrate women,

26:00.025 --> 26:04.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he has insulted even prisoners
of war when he said of John
McCain, tat I like people

26:04.430 --> 26:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who weren't captured. I can't
believe a patriotic party has
chosen someone who has
denigrated

26:08.100 --> 26:10.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
prisoners of war like that.

26:10.302 --> 26:13.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And until Donald Trump can prove
he's a man of character and a
man of temperament, which

26:13.439 --> 26:16.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he hasn t done, which I don't
think he can do, I can t support
him.

26:16.775 --> 26:20.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Are you saying you
don t think you could come
around -- you and others who

26:20.979 --> 26:25.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agree with you, couldn't come
around to support Donald Trump
if he demonstrates temperament

26:25.851 --> 26:30.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you say you look for in a
president changes and maybe
comes up with positions on
issues

26:30.489 --> 26:32.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that you can agree with?

26:32.825 --> 26:35.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MCCORMACK: Well, I think the
Donald Trump that we've seen
over the last ten months is

26:35.894 --> 26:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the real Donald Trump. I don't
see him, you know, apologizing
publicly to all the women

26:41.266 --> 26:46.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's insulted -- degraded,
really -- to the prisoner of war
people like John McCain, to

26:46.038 --> 26:51.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
excommunicate the nationalists
who have found a welcoming home
in his campaign, to prove

26:51.643 --> 26:54.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he has a sober and steady
hands. You know, I mean, he
bounces all over the place

26:54.880 --> 26:58.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on tissues. He can't control his
worst impulses, as he insults
Heidi Cruz, he threatened to,

26:58.617 --> 27:01.620 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
quote, "spill the beans" on her.

27:01.620 --> 27:04.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It s not the stability you re
seeing, and I think the person
you've seen in the

27:04.656 --> 27:08.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last ten months is the real
Donald Trump. So, I don't think
I'll be able to support

27:08.026 --> 27:12.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him in November. I hope there is
a third party candidate, maybe
somebody like Dr. Coburn

27:12.197 --> 27:15.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from Oklahoma. Time is running
out to get on the ballot, but I
hope there's a viable

27:15.367 --> 27:18.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
option for principled
conservatives in November.

27:18.170 --> 27:21.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Well, that s what I
want to ask you, John McCormack.
What do you and other

27:21.106 --> 27:26.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conservatives do who aren't able
to support Donald Trump? If you
support a third party,

27:26.345 --> 27:31.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't that automatically help
the Democratic nominee who's
likely to be Hillary Clinton?

27:31.183 --> 27:34.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MCCORMACK: Well, you know, the
polls show right now that
Hillary Clinton is going to

27:34.186 --> 27:38.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
beat Donald Trump whether or not
conservative. It's very likely
she'll beat him whether or

27:38.257 --> 27:43.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not conservatives support Donald
Trump. A recent CNN poll found
84 percent of Republican

27:43.562 --> 27:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back Donald Trump. Hillary
Clinton was leading Trump
overall by 13 percentage points,
which

27:47.266 --> 27:50.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
means if you have 100 percent of
Republicans supported Donald
Trump, he would still lose

27:50.636 --> 27:53.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to Hillary Clinton.

27:53.038 --> 27:56.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, at the end of the
day, conservatives, they just
kind of take a stand and say
that

27:56.542 --> 28:00.746 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they believe that both
candidates are disqualified. On
one hand, you see Hillary
Clinton, someone

28:00.746 --> 28:04.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who s Supreme Court nominee
would trample the Constitution,
send the country hurdling

28:04.750 --> 28:09.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the left, and then Donald
Trump, who as I said, is simply
unfit to be commander-in-chief.

28:09.187 --> 28:12.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you just have to take a
stand, let the chips fall where
they may. You can hope that

28:12.324 --> 28:14.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there is a third party
principled candidate there and
if not, write somebody in and
vote

28:14.459 --> 28:16.762 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
down ballot.

28:16.762 --> 28:19.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: I want to ask you
about another point that we
heard Congressman Marino make,

28:19.998 --> 28:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that is, he said Trump
appeals -- he s a populist. He s
appealing to Democrats,

28:21.466 --> 28:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to independents, as well as
Republicans. Why wouldn't Donald
Trump be able to put together

28:21.600 --> 28:23.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a coalition that could
prevail in November?

28:23.268 --> 28:23.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF, PBS NEWSHOUR
ANCHOR: I want to ask you about
another point that we heard

28:23.969 --> 28:24.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congressman Marino make, and
that is, he said Trump appeals
-- he s a populist. He s

28:24.503 --> 28:29.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

November?

28:33.545 --> 28:36.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MCCORMACK, THE WEEKLY
STANDARD: Well, it hasn't
happened so far. He has the
highest

28:36.415 --> 28:41.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unfavorable ratings of any
candidate in the modern era.
Roughly 65 percent of Americans

28:41.587 --> 28:47.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have an unfavorable view of him.
His net unfavorability rating is
minus 37 percent, Hillary
Clinton

28:47.759 --> 28:52.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is minus 17. So, she's not all
that unpopular but he's a lot
more unpopular than she is.

28:52.230 --> 28:56.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He would have to be a different
person in the next six months to
have people have a

28:56.068 --> 28:59.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
different view of him. I m not
sure he's capable of that. I
highly doubt it.

28:59.371 --> 29:03.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: So, just quickly, you
don't see the Republican Party
and conservatives coming

29:03.542 --> 29:07.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
together between now and
November to support him?

29:07.346 --> 29:11.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MCCORMACK: I think a lot of
principled conservatives simply
won't be able to. I don't think
that

29:11.350 --> 29:16.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the fact he's now the
presumptive nominee doesn't
change the fact he's manifestly
unfit

29:16.288 --> 29:19.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be president of the United
States and commander-in-chief,
and neither do I think Hillary
Clinton is

29:19.791 --> 29:23.662 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
qualified to be
commander-in-chief, given what
her Supreme Court nominees would
do to

29:23.662 --> 29:26.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Constitution and where
they would take this country.

Pretty much as paradisal as

Flying to Guadeloupe?

SOLMAN: Because upstart
Norwegian Airlines, some call it
the Southwest Airlines of
Europe,

30:39.371 --> 30:44.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is now undercutting the few big
post-merger carriers and their
few foreign partners, which

30:44.710 --> 30:47.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
among them control U.S.
skies for travel abroad.

30:47.913 --> 30:51.016 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Anders Lindstrom of Norwegian.

30:51.016 --> 30:54.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDERS LINDSTROM, NORWEGIAN AIR:
So the fare is not unique for a
European airline, it just

30:54.920 --> 31:00.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that really highlights how
overpriced the American aviation
market really is.

31:00.025 --> 31:06.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: Founded in 1993, the
low-cost airline is profitable,
due to several advantages:

31:06.965 --> 31:12.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
high load factors; our plane was
90 percent full; brand-new
Boeings, the most fuel-efficient

31:12.404 --> 31:15.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
planes on earth. But
mainly, says Lindstrom --

31:15.807 --> 31:20.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDSTROM: We don't have all the
decades of maintenance costs and
labor costs that the

31:20.479 --> 31:25.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
airlines traditionally do. So,
we're starting with new
aircraft, new crew, which really

31:25.650 --> 31:28.186 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
keeps fares low.

31:28.186 --> 31:32.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: And, of course, low
fares tend to mean full planes.
But in the end, says aviation

31:32.858 --> 31:35.594 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
industry watcher
Michael E. Levine --

31:35.594 --> 31:39.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL E. LEVINE, NEW YORK
UNIVERSITY: The main difference
is labor arrangements. They're

31:39.197 --> 31:46.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a new airline, their pilots have
low seniority, they have more
productive labor arrangements.

31:46.104 --> 31:52.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: Arrangements like not
using hubs and instead flying
non-stop point to point so

31:52.244 --> 31:55.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pilots and crew can live near
the airports they fly from. And
that's the Southwest model,

31:55.947 --> 31:57.616 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right?

31:57.616 --> 32:02.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One type of aircraft, all the
pilots qualified to fly it.

32:02.821 --> 32:06.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LINDSTROM: Yes, it's a
simplified version, and that's
something goes across all low
cost

32:06.024 --> 32:08.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
airlines around the world.

32:08.627 --> 32:13.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: What seemed odd, though,
was that the big carriers, who
used to fly to Guadeloupe

32:13.265 --> 32:19.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the '70s, haven't, for years,
save for a few American airlines
flights from Miami.

32:19.571 --> 32:23.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How come no American carrier
saw this as an opportunity?

32:23.508 --> 32:27.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEROME SIOBUD, GUADELOUPE
AIRPORT: We think that they were
afraid not to fill their plane.

32:27.579 --> 32:32.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Norwegian took the risk and they
are now flying full planes.

32:32.317 --> 32:38.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: Jerome Siobud manages
Guadeloupe's airport. He says
that because this is legally

32:38.190 --> 32:44.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
France, it's part of the
European Union, which in the
1980s voted to prohibit
countries from

32:44.296 --> 32:49.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
offering monetary guarantees to
airlines, basically bidding for
their business. So,

32:49.501 --> 32:53.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
U.S. carriers abruptly
stopped coming.

32:53.104 --> 32:57.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SIOBUD: You know that this is
part of the business and the
industry, as part of the

32:57.309 --> 33:00.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
European community, we
can not do that, so --

33:00.478 --> 33:05.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: But when Norwegian
decided to test the U.S. market
by flying to now under-served

33:05.917 --> 33:11.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Guadeloupe, it demanded no
guarantees. And business boomed.

33:11.056 --> 33:16.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SIOBUD: Sixty-thousand thousand
passengers to the U.S. in 2015.
And after three months

33:16.528 --> 33:22.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in 2016, we have 42,000
people flying to the U.S.

33:22.300 --> 33:26.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: A more than 150 percent
increase in traffic. The U.S.
seemed ripe for discount

33:26.905 --> 33:30.408 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
global carriers.

33:30.408 --> 33:35.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Unfortunately, the U.S.
Department of Transportation was
sitting, for two years, on a
Norwegian

33:35.280 --> 33:39.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
request to expand
transatlantic service.

33:39.050 --> 33:41.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: American
pilots don't want Norwegian to
spread its wings.

33:41.920 --> 33:46.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLMAN: The opposition? Big
carriers and their unions.

33:46.491 --> 33:49.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Only with
your support will we stop this
scheme that threatens the

33:49.494 --> 33:51.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
future of U.S. airlines
and their employees.

33:51.897 --> 33:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are
in a fight for our future.

33:55.533 --> 34:00.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: This video from the
Airline Pilots Association,
titled "The Wolf is at the
Door,"

34:00.005 --> 34:02.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was directed against Norwegian.

34:02.707 --> 34:06.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We must stop
it now or fight the growth of
pilot-shopping around

34:06.211 --> 34:09.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the world, at third
world prices.

34:09.114 --> 34:14.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDSTROM: So they were saying
that we were hiring cheap Asian
labor to operate the flights

34:14.352 --> 34:17.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to and from the U.S.,
which is very incorrect.

34:17.122 --> 34:19.557 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
SOLMAN: Again,
Norwegian's Lindstrom.

34:19.557 --> 34:25.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LINDSTROM: We have more
U.S.-based cabin crew than any
other international airline. We
have

34:25.196 --> 34:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about 300 in the U.S. We will be
tripling if not quadrupling in
the next year as we

34:28.033 --> 34:30.035 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
grow.

34:30.035 --> 34:34.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: So in your view, this is
just a classic example of
businesses and labor trying to

34:34.806 --> 34:37.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
protect their own turf, or their
own jobs, their own profits?

34:37.108 --> 34:39.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LINDSTROM: Yes, very much so.

34:39.611 --> 34:44.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SOLMAN: But with the big
airlines finally making profits
after years of losses, their

34:44.215 --> 34:48.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opposition is understandable,
says industry expert Levine.

34:48.219 --> 34:56.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEVINE: They're not really
interested in seeing anyone else
in. The airlines are afraid that

34:56.561 --> 35:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if customers are given the
choice, they'll buy their
tickets somewhere else from
someone

35:01.066 --> 35:05.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who will offer them a better
deal. The last I heard, that was
capitalism.

35:05.337 --> 35:10.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: On the very day we flew,
as it happens, Norwegian's
request was finally ruled upon.

35:10.976 --> 35:15.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We asked Anders Lindstrom about
it after we got to Guadeloupe.

35:15.580 --> 35:18.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So yesterday the Department of
Transportation permit you've
been waiting for for two years

35:18.183 --> 35:21.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now finally came through.
This a big deal?

35:21.586 --> 35:25.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDSTROM: It's a big step. It's
a tentative approval and we're
hoping for the final approval

35:25.490 --> 35:31.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in just a few months. That will
mean that we can expand into the
U.S. but also use the

35:31.262 --> 35:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
same aircraft, expanding from
Europe into other markets such
as India, South Africa,

35:35.133 --> 35:37.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and South America.

35:37.769 --> 35:43.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: Meanwhile, what's good
for Norwegian is good for
Guadeloupe. Over-reliant since

35:43.508 --> 35:47.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the '80s on just one country for
its second biggest industry,
says tourism official Sandra

35:47.178 --> 35:49.180 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Venite.

35:49.180 --> 35:51.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SANDRA VENITE, TOURISM OFFICIAL:
Ninety percent of our tourists
are from mainland France.

35:51.282 --> 35:54.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is the people
that are here.

35:54.252 --> 35:57.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: And so the deal with
Norwegian is low cost, no frills
fares to get the American

35:57.956 --> 36:00.225 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tourists back?

36:00.225 --> 36:05.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VENITE: Yes, exactly. For once,
it benefited us to be French, to
get an airline flying

36:05.597 --> 36:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from the U.S. to the French
Caribbean. How crazy is that?

36:08.933 --> 36:10.035 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

36:10.035 --> 36:14.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLMAN: But $69 fares from
New York and watch out!

36:14.305 --> 36:18.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VENITE: We have capacity to
absorb the demand. We just need
more Americans in Guadeloupe.

36:18.676 --> 36:22.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need to go back to where
we were in the '70s.

36:22.380 --> 36:28.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: And with real airline
competition, Guadeloupe expects
to get there. As for Norwegian s

36:28.520 --> 36:31.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
future, says Michael
E. Levine --

36:31.289 --> 36:38.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEVINE: You can do the kind of
thing we're talking about pretty
well as a new, relatively

36:38.663 --> 36:47.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
small niche airline. As you
grow, your labor force becomes
more senior. You're under a

36:47.472 --> 36:54.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lot of the pressures that make
these other airlines less
efficient. Norwegian's challenge

36:54.712 --> 37:00.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is to figure out how to grow and
maintain its competitive edge.
That is something that

37:00.652 --> 37:05.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
many airlines have failed
at over the years.

37:05.690 --> 37:11.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: But it's not something
that Guadeloupe has to worry
about, it seems, not for a
while.

37:11.129 --> 37:17.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the PBS "NewsHour" --
come on in, the water's fine!

37:17.669 --> 37:31.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is economics correspondent

France, in the Caribbean.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

37:36.254 --> 37:43.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: The tense state of
relations between the U.S. and
Saudi Arabia has been

37:43.394 --> 37:48.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
roiled lately by two issues: a
pending bill in Congress that
would allow lawsuits against

37:48.766 --> 37:54.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
countries found to have been
involved in terrorist attacks on
American soil, and the so-called

37:54.672 --> 37:59.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
"28 pages," parts of a
congressional inquiry after
September 11th that are said to
detail

37:59.244 --> 38:03.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
possible Saudi complicity
in aiding the attacks.

38:03.281 --> 38:07.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here to tell us more about both
is chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret Warner.

38:07.118 --> 38:10.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, first, let's talk about the
bill, what's in it and what's
the status of it.

38:10.355 --> 38:12.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER, PBS CHIEF
FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRSPONDENT:
The bill, Hari, would carve

38:12.457 --> 38:17.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out a special exemption in
what's called the Foreign
Sovereign Immunity Act which
every

38:17.428 --> 38:22.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country has a similar act and
observe, which is you don't sue
foreign governments, with

38:22.934 --> 38:27.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a few narrow exceptions. There
was an exception made for
terrorism, but only if you were
on

38:27.772 --> 38:31.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the state-sponsored terrorism
list which Saudi isn't.

38:31.743 --> 38:39.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, these 9/11 victims families
have been trying to push this,
get this bill in a court.

38:39.250 --> 38:44.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was rejected by a federal
judge in September saying,
sorry, violates this act. So
that's

38:44.722 --> 38:48.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sort of what's new here.

38:48.359 --> 38:53.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It passed unanimously a session
ago in the Senate, but now, it's
run into a buzz saw

38:53.464 --> 38:57.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of White House opposition. You
have President Obama telling
Charlie Rose if we let this

38:57.936 --> 39:03.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happen we'll have foreign
citizens suing our government.
All the senior members of the

39:03.708 --> 39:06.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
administration have
come out against this.

39:06.344 --> 39:11.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, and then, last -- two weeks
ago, Senator Lindsey Graham, one
of the 22 co-sponsors

39:11.583 --> 39:18.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and lawyer by training put a
hold on the bill. So, people
thought it was dead. But several

39:18.156 --> 39:23.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
widows came to see him last
week. He was working on
language. And today, I learned
very quietly

39:23.528 --> 39:26.864 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he removed his hold on Tuesday.

39:26.864 --> 39:31.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what's happening now is that
the two main co-sponsors,
Republican John Cornyn and
Democrat

39:31.736 --> 39:37.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chuck Schumer of New York are
essentially counting heads. They
want to make sure nobody

39:37.475 --> 39:42.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in their caucus objects, no one
else is going to put a secret
hold on it, and then they ll

39:42.280 --> 39:45.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ask Mitch Zeller if he will
bring it to the floor.

39:45.350 --> 39:51.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: What role do the 28
pages play in this. They're
discrete but melt together.

39:51.556 --> 39:58.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARNER: Yes, they do. And a lot
is sort of a public relations
side. A White House official

39:58.229 --> 40:03.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said to me that "60 Minutes"
report that appeared, what,
three weeks ago in which the
head of

40:03.635 --> 40:09.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the congressional investigation,
co-sponsor Bob Graham, and three
of the 9/11 Commission

40:09.707 --> 40:16.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
members, which you know was an
independent, came out and said
there is very -- they didn't

40:16.114 --> 40:21.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say "evidence" but strong signs
of Saudi complicity in aiding
some of the hijackers -- as we
recall

40:21.386 --> 40:26.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
15 of the 19 were Saudis -- and
in particular the two who were
in San Diego.

40:26.157 --> 40:30.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, mysteriously, they
meet a man who gives them an
apartment, and these are two

40:30.695 --> 40:35.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
guys who don't speak any English
and have had no experience
living in the West. So,

40:35.166 --> 40:41.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there are a lot of threads in
there. What one White House
official said is that "60

40:41.673 --> 40:47.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Minutes" report has been like is
that rocket has been a booster
to the Saudi lawsuit bill.

40:47.178 --> 40:51.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a top staffer of one of the
senators involved said much the
same. He said, we were kind

40:51.015 --> 40:54.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of bumping along on the Saudi
lawsuit bill, and suddenly, it's
front and center.

40:54.986 --> 40:57.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Likely to turn into
a presidential campaign issue?

40:57.989 --> 41:03.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARNER: Well, maybe. The thing
is that both Hillary Clinton and
Donald Trump have actually

41:03.294 --> 41:10.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
endorsed the Saudi lawsuit bill
and especially when they were in
New York and on New York

41:10.468 --> 41:16.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
radio and television. So, I
don t -- I think the only thing
that could become political

41:16.541 --> 41:20.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is if President Obama, who is
supposed to decide on the 28
pages, supposedly by the

41:20.745 --> 41:25.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
end of next month, if he were to
say I m not releasing them, then
it could be an issue.

41:25.483 --> 41:28.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: What's the White
House's reaction been to all
this?

41:28.052 --> 41:34.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARNER: Oh, the White House is
apoplectic. And the way one
senior, very senior official

41:34.158 --> 41:37.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just before the president was
going to Saudi Arabia, he said
this is the last thing we

41:37.962 --> 41:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need. The Saudis are violently
opposed to this. They say they
don t mind releasing

41:41.833 --> 41:48.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
28 pages, but they feel they re
being absolutely, you know, put
in the crosshairs on this bill

41:48.439 --> 41:55.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, in fact, at one point, the
foreign minister threatened to
sell all of their assets,
foreign

41:55.246 --> 42:00.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
assets, 750 billion on the
market. He since rescinded that
but still they are very
concerned.

42:00.418 --> 42:05.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Chief White House
correspondent Margaret Warner,
thanks so much.

42:28.613 --> 42:32.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
two Los Angeles museums,
together presenting a major
retrospective of the work of
Robert

42:32.183 --> 42:35.153 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mapplethorpe.

42:35.153 --> 42:40.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mapplethorpe was best known for
his homo-erotic photographs and
explicit sadomasochistic
imagery,

42:40.525 --> 42:45.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the political and legal
battles around them.

42:45.396 --> 42:51.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even now, we've chosen not to
present his most controversial
work. But the new exhibition,

42:51.202 --> 42:54.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Robert Mapplethorpe: The
Perfect Medium", wants us to see
how much more there was to

42:54.205 --> 42:56.140 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the artist.

BROWN: Britt Salvesen is a
curator at the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art.

43:03.047 --> 43:10.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SALVESEN: For several years
after the culture wars debate of
the late '80s, early '90s,

43:10.087 --> 43:17.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was impossible to see the
work as art because we were
preoccupied with its status as
evidence,

43:17.528 --> 43:19.230 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
let's say.

43:19.230 --> 43:22.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BROWN: As part of
that culture war.

43:22.200 --> 43:27.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SALVESEN: Yes. And that really
forestalled an assessment of his
artwork.

43:27.772 --> 43:33.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: Mapplethorpe grew up in a
conservative Irish Catholic
household in Queens, New York,

43:33.110 --> 43:39.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and in the 1970s became part of
the city's burgeoning gay scene.
He focused from the

43:39.150 --> 43:44.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
beginning on three main
subjects: portraiture, including
artists and celebrities of the
day,

43:44.755 --> 43:48.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
floral still lifes,
and sex and the body.

43:48.459 --> 43:53.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SALVESEN: Those are very
traditional art historical
subjects, I mean long before
photography.

43:53.164 --> 43:59.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the question becomes, how do
you make them your own? And I
think Mapplethorpe does it

43:59.804 --> 44:06.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
through a refinement, a
reduction of extraneous
elements. His sense of
perfection and beauty

44:06.310 --> 44:09.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is what he applies to those
traditional subjects.

44:17.855 --> 44:22.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
acquired the artist's archives
from the Mapplethorpe Foundation
five years ago.

44:22.727 --> 44:28.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTINEAU: You won't find wilted
flowers in his pictures. He
liked flowers at their most

44:28.866 --> 44:34.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
powerful and most erect. Once
they started wilting, he'd get
rid of them. He really didn't

44:34.972 --> 44:37.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
like flowers. He liked
pictures of flowers.

44:37.575 --> 44:41.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: Was he after perfection?
Was he after beauty?

44:41.112 --> 44:45.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARTINEAU: He was after
perfection. And beauty was high
up there as well.

44:45.883 --> 44:51.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: One regular subject was
Patti Smith, the poet and later
famed rock musician. She

44:51.989 --> 44:56.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wrote about their youthful times
in her National Book Award
winning memoir, "Just Kids," and

44:56.694 --> 45:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in 2010 told me about her friend
and the ambition they shared.

45:02.166 --> 45:06.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATTI SMITH, SINGER/SONGWRITER:
Robert really believed in
himself. Robert was a very
interesting

45:06.103 --> 45:14.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
boy, because he was quite shy,
yet absolutely confident in his
abilities and that he would

45:14.145 --> 45:18.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
someday, you know, achieve
acclaim. He saw his --

45:18.015 --> 45:19.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BROWN: He knew that,
he felt that?

45:19.517 --> 45:22.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SMITH: He felt that, absolutely.

45:22.820 --> 45:29.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: He would achieve fame,
but for the public at large that
came in 1989 when North

45:29.160 --> 45:33.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carolina Senator Jesse Helms
took to the Senate floor to
decry federal funding for a
traveling

45:33.731 --> 45:36.100 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
exhibition of
Mapplethorpe's work.

45:36.100 --> 45:40.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. JESSE HELMS (R), NORTH
CAROLINA: I don't even
acknowledge that it's art. I
don't even

45:40.671 --> 45:43.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
acknowledge that the fellow who
did it was an artist. I think he
was a jerk.

45:43.908 --> 45:49.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: Bowing to political
pressure, Washington's Corcoran
Museum cancelled the show, and
when

45:49.146 --> 45:52.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it went on to the Cincinnati
Arts Center, its director was
arrested and charged with

45:52.683 --> 45:57.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
obscenity. He was
later acquitted.

45:57.021 --> 46:02.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Mapplethorpe's work would
for years after be seen in this
context. The Los Angeles
exhibitions

46:02.727 --> 46:08.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
contain the controversial work,
accompanied by warning signs of
their explicit content.

46:08.699 --> 46:14.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mapplethorpe himself, this is
his last self-portrait, died of
AIDS, at age 42, just before the
cultural

46:14.572 --> 46:16.841 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tempest burst.

46:16.841 --> 46:20.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FENTON BAILEY, FILMMAKER: He
said that his life was the work
of art and the pictures

46:20.978 --> 46:28.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were secondary. The ultimate
work of art as far as he was
concerned was his life.

46:28.019 --> 46:34.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: His life? So, I mean,
he's creating himself as a work
of art? Is that --

46:34.191 --> 46:41.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RANDY BARBATO, FILMMAKER: And
documenting his life. I think
that's part of why so much

46:41.332 --> 46:49.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of his art has such impact,
because there's an honesty to
it. There's an intimacy to it.

46:49.540 --> 46:51.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everything
was a means to an end to his
career.

46:51.409 --> 46:54.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He
was a new type of art.

46:54.412 --> 47:00.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: In conjunction with the
joint exhibition, filmmakers
Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato

47:00.051 --> 47:03.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
released an HBO documentary
called "Look at the Pictures," a
portrait of the man and his

47:03.921 --> 47:05.790 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
times.

47:05.790 --> 47:07.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The whole
point of being an artist is to
learn about yourself, the

47:07.158 --> 47:17.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
photographs I think are less
important than the life that
one s leading.

47:17.134 --> 47:23.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BAILEY: I think he was playing
something of a game of cat and
mouse with his audience

47:23.240 --> 47:28.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and critics. I think he knew
that it would provoke, but he
also said he never was intending

47:28.512 --> 47:30.347 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to shock people.

47:30.347 --> 47:34.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: I mean, do you take that
at face value? How could it not
shock people?

47:34.685 --> 47:39.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BAILEY: I do and I don't. You
know, exactly. I mean, he knew
that the key here was to
photograph

47:39.356 --> 47:46.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things, to document things that
people considered outside of the
realm of art. The way he did

47:46.931 --> 47:52.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it was to elevate them and make
them beautiful. The composition
and the lighting was incredible.

47:52.136 --> 47:58.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, he made what other
people just dismissed as
pornography, he made it art, and
made us

47:58.109 --> 48:00.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
look at it seriously.

48:00.444 --> 48:07.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARBATO: It's ironic, we live in
a world now where you can access
the most explicit imagery

48:07.184 --> 48:14.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the tip of, you know, at your
fingertips, yet as a society
we're still incredibly
puritanical

48:14.625 --> 48:27.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about sex. And so his images
still, the explicit ones, I
think people still find it
challenging

48:27.905 --> 48:32.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and uncomfortable. And I think
that's important. I I think it's
important for people to ask

48:32.143 --> 48:35.045 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
themselves why.

48:35.045 --> 48:39.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: And these many years
later, as "Robert Mapplethorpe:
The Perfect Medium" shows,
there's

48:39.283 --> 48:42.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
also much to look at anew.

48:42.987 --> 48:49.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
From Los Angeles, I m Jeffrey
Brown for "The PBS NewsHour".

SREENIVASAN: Finally, another
installment in our brief but
spectacular series. Tonight,

49:01.038 --> 49:05.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we hear from 91-year-old Flossie
Lewis. A former English teacher,
she now lives at the

49:05.976 --> 49:10.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Piedmont Gardens Senior Living
Community in the Bay Area. Lewis
keeps busy by writing

49:10.047 --> 49:13.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fiction and offers us insight on
what it feels like to grow old.

49:13.117 --> 49:15.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

49:15.019 --> 49:18.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FLOSSIE LEWIS, 91-YEAR-OLD:
Getting old is a state of mind.
Now, I m 91. I m badly

49:18.856 --> 49:25.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
crippled, but I still think
I m 15. Will this go viral?

49:25.162 --> 49:31.602 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We hope so.

49:31.602 --> 49:41.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEWIS: There are several ways I
keep myself stimulated. By
dragging myself to Piedmont

49:41.912 --> 49:47.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Avenue on my walker or in my
wheelchair, and you should see
me use my wheelchair.

49:47.985 --> 49:52.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I write light verse for "The
Crest" which is our newspaper,
and every month you can

49:52.890 --> 49:58.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
find a sly little bit of
verse from Flossie Lewis.

49:58.329 --> 50:05.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other way I keep being
stimulated is just watching
politics. And if that isn't
enough

50:05.236 --> 50:13.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to drive you crazy, I don't know
what is. You do struggle to keep
yourself neat and

50:13.210 --> 50:16.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
clean and fashionable.

50:16.347 --> 50:27.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there is always the
possibility that romance comes
your way. Just liking someone is
a treat

50:27.391 --> 50:35.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because part of being old is to
get cranky. There is indigestion
and your teeth fall out

50:35.399 --> 50:43.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and suddenly you need hearing
aides and you feel increasingly
unattractive, and then somebody

50:43.908 --> 50:49.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says, "How nice you look today,
Mrs. Lewis! Or, you're a real
kick, Flossie!"

50:49.513 --> 50:56.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And you feel good about
yourself. You pick yourself up
and you say, "I m going to get

50:56.153 --> 51:01.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through it. I m going to get
through it because I have a
reason to get through it."

51:01.759 --> 51:07.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Really growing old is when you
discover that you haven't a
reason to get through it
anymore,

51:07.364 --> 51:16.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that you would like to go to
sleep with a certain amount of
dignity. Accepting the

51:16.106 --> 51:27.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fact the body is going to go but
the personality doesn't have to
go, and that thing which is

51:27.618 --> 51:35.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the hardest to admit is that
character doesn't have to go.

51:35.092 --> 51:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I m Flossie Lewis. This is my
brief but spectacular take on
growing old.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

51:44.768 --> 51:48.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: What a charmer. I
want to be Flossie Lewis.

51:48.672 --> 51:51.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: If Washington
politics is the key to
longevity, through this election
year,

51:51.275 --> 51:52.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you should get another
a few years to live --

51:52.943 --> 51:55.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: I know.

51:55.112 --> 52:03.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

And recapping the day s major
stories, Donald Trump began
working to build his fall
presidential

52:08.258 --> 52:12.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaign and win over Republican
leaders. But House Speaker Paul
Ryan says he is not

52:12.529 --> 52:15.599 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ready to support Trump.

52:15.599 --> 52:21.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A raging wildlife forced new
evacuations near Fort McMurray,
Alberta, in the heart of

52:24.608 --> 52:29.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And an airstrike in northwest
Syria killed at least 28 people
in a crowded refugee camp

52:29.613 --> 52:34.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
near the Turkish border. It was
unclear who launched the strike.

52:34.685 --> 52:40.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On "The NewsHour" online right

elephant tusks and rhino horns
ever

52:40.557 --> 52:47.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
