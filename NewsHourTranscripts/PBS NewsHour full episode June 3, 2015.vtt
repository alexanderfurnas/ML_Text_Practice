WEBVTT

00:12.012 --> 00:15.482
GWEN IFILL: The Pentagon
mistakenly ships live anthrax to
dozens of labs.

00:15.482 --> 00:17.217
Good evening. I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:17.217 --> 00:20.320
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:20.320 --> 00:26.393
Also ahead this Wednesday:
despair and anger in China, as
divers race to rescue any
survivors

00:26.393 --> 00:30.230
trapped in the hull of a
capsized ship sinking deeper.

00:30.230 --> 00:35.469
GWEN IFILL: Then, we take a
broader look at Asia's rising
superpower with former Treasury

00:35.469 --> 00:39.006
Secretaries Henry Paulson and
Robert Rubin, who say we should
be strengthening ties with

00:39.006 --> 00:40.874
China.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.844
ROBERT RUBIN, Former U.S.
Treasury Secretary: I think we
would benefit greatly from
Chinese

00:43.844 --> 00:47.447
investment in this country, and
I think we should be proactively
seeking it.

00:47.447 --> 00:51.618
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus, sticker
price shock: why the cost of
health care could skyrocket

00:51.618 --> 00:55.155
for some Americans come 2016.

00:55.155 --> 00:57.557
GWEN IFILL: Those are some of
the stories we're covering on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:57.557 --> 00:59.459
(BREAK)

00:59.459 --> 01:04.031
JUDY WOODRUFF: Authorities in
China called in scores more
divers today, hoping to reach

01:04.031 --> 01:08.902
and rescue more than 400 people
still missing on a capsized
cruise ship.

01:08.902 --> 01:12.372
Tornado-force winds
literally blew the vessel

01:12.372 --> 01:17.611
over late Monday, as it sailed
up the Yangtze River from
Nanjing. Only 14 people have

01:17.611 --> 01:22.082
been found alive, and families
are demanding answers.

01:22.082 --> 01:26.386
Lucy Watson of Independent
Television News filed this
report from the scene.

01:26.386 --> 01:34.628
LUCY WATSON: The wait to be
told anything is agonizing. All
Li Ling (ph) and her family

01:34.628 --> 01:39.566
want is to be taken to the river
to see where their parents could
be. But they're being

01:39.566 --> 01:41.668
stopped.

01:41.668 --> 01:46.606
MAN (through translator): I
haven't been able to close my
eyes or sleep since it sank.

01:46.606 --> 01:50.677
We have been told nothing.
Anything we do know has come
from the Internet.

01:50.677 --> 01:55.682
WOMAN (through translator): I
just want to go to the water to
see it for myself.

01:55.682 --> 02:01.621
LUCY WATSON: But if she could
get there, this is what she
would see, the reality of

02:01.621 --> 02:06.760
recovered bodies atop a mighty
vessel now barely visible.

02:06.760 --> 02:12.733
Apart from a few moments of
triumph and rescue yesterday,
this operation has been hampered

02:12.733 --> 02:18.238
by a strong current, murky
waters and bad weather after
this country's worst maritime

02:18.238 --> 02:24.978
disaster in recent memory.
Cranes are poised to salvage a
wreck, and this search area has

02:24.978 --> 02:30.450
been extended. Rescuers
stand waiting, still hoping.

02:30.450 --> 02:33.553
But the military and the
medics are ever ready onshore.

02:33.553 --> 02:36.356
LIU JIN, Director General, China
Information Ministry: We will
not give up the hope to

02:36.356 --> 02:41.028
find survivors until the last
minute. When the five ships
gather together, the experts

02:41.028 --> 02:47.234
-- also, the experts will make
our decisions with an evaluation
how to be going on.

02:47.234 --> 02:52.272
LUCY WATSON: The government is
promising an investigation,
because the safety of this

02:52.272 --> 03:00.013
state-owned boat is being
questioned. For now, any anger
is being contained, and nobody

03:00.013 --> 03:05.419
is yet apportioning blame.
Grief is overriding everything.

03:05.419 --> 03:11.792
GWEN IFILL: In the day's other
news, more than 700 migrants
made it to shore in Myanmar

03:11.792 --> 03:16.930
in an overloaded fishing boat.
The country's navy towed the
vessel in, after holding it

03:16.930 --> 03:23.937
at sea for days. Many on board
were Muslim Rohingya and some
were Bangladeshi. Police

03:23.937 --> 03:28.708
separated the two groups and
sent the Bangladeshis away in
buses. The Rohingya were put
inside

03:28.708 --> 03:34.448
a warehouse. Myanmar is largely
Buddhist and doesn't recognize
the Rohingya as citizens.

03:34.448 --> 03:37.484
JUDY WOODRUFF: The corruption
scandal that's engulfed soccer
rolled on today, with reports

03:39.486 --> 03:46.326
the FBI is investigating how
World Cups were awarded. They
came a day after Sepp Blatter,

03:46.326 --> 03:51.465
head of soccer's governing body,
FIFA, announced he's resigning.
The Russian sports minister

03:51.465 --> 03:58.004
insisted today that plans to
play the 2018 World Cup in his
country will go forward.

03:58.004 --> 04:01.942
VITALY MUTKO, Russian Sports
Minister (through translator):
Blatter is the president of

04:01.942 --> 04:07.214
FIFA and he has always
maintained warm relations with
Russia. But, in general, the
decision

04:07.214 --> 04:11.551
on hosting the World Cup was
made by the executive committee
of FIFA, and it is a legal
decision.

04:11.551 --> 04:14.855
No resignations can
affect or change it.

04:14.855 --> 04:19.726
JUDY WOODRUFF: The government
of Qatar likewise rejected any
talk that it might be stripped

04:19.726 --> 04:24.931
of the 2022 World Cup. The
foreign minister said his
country is the victim of --
quote

04:24.931 --> 04:28.802
-- "prejudice and racism"
against Arab Islamic States.

04:28.802 --> 04:34.074
GWEN IFILL: A suspect in a
Boston terror investigation
talked of killing police before

04:34.074 --> 04:39.846
he was shot dead by officers.
That's according to federal
court documents filed today.
Usaama

04:39.846 --> 04:44.384
Rahim had been under long-term
surveillance when he was shot
and killed early Tuesday.

04:44.384 --> 04:48.922
The police commissioner says
he lunged with a large knife.

04:48.922 --> 04:53.493
WILLIAM EVANS, Boston Police
Commissioner: Our officers went
out there to only question

04:53.493 --> 05:01.468
the individual, because the
level of our concern rose to the
level that we needed to question

05:01.468 --> 05:07.974
him. I think we never
anticipated what his reaction
would be, and that he would pull

05:07.974 --> 05:13.647
out obviously a military knife
and approach the officers.

05:13.647 --> 05:18.251
GWEN IFILL: Video of the
shooting was shown to community
leaders today. They say it

05:18.251 --> 05:23.323
confirmed Rahim was shot in the
front, not the back. But they
say it's not clear if

05:23.323 --> 05:29.129
police needed to use deadly
force. Meanwhile, an alleged
accomplice, David Wright, was
arrested

05:29.129 --> 05:34.901
last night on a charge of
conspiracy to obstruct justice.
He appeared in federal court
today.

05:34.901 --> 05:38.939
JUDY WOODRUFF: Former Rhode
Island Governor Lincoln Chafee
has formally entered the race

05:38.939 --> 05:44.611
for the Democratic presidential
nomination in 2016. As a U.S.
senator, Chafee was the

05:44.611 --> 05:49.382
only Republican to vote against
the Iraq War. Later, he turned
independent and then he

05:49.382 --> 05:51.851
became a Democrat.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.654
He made his formal announcement
today in Arlington, Virginia.

05:54.654 --> 05:59.459
LINCOLN CHAFEE (D), Presidential
Candidate: If we as leaders
show good judgment and

05:59.459 --> 06:07.534
make good decisions, we can fix
much of what is ailing us. We
must deliberately and carefully

06:07.534 --> 06:15.609
extricate ourselves from
expensive wars. Just think of
how better this money could be
spent.

06:15.609 --> 06:19.512
JUDY WOODRUFF: Chafee is the
fourth Democratic candidate in a
field dominated, so far, by

06:19.512 --> 06:22.082
front-runner Hillary Clinton.

06:22.082 --> 06:27.487
GWEN IFILL: In economic news,
the U.S. trade deficit fell
sharply in April, by 19 percent.

06:27.487 --> 06:32.325
The March deficit had been the
worst since 2008, after a labor
dispute ended at West

06:32.325 --> 06:37.163
Coast ports and a backlog of
Chinese goods flooded in.

06:37.163 --> 06:42.469
And on Wall Street today, the
Dow Jones industrial average
gained 64 points to close near
18080.

06:42.469 --> 06:48.642
The Nasdaq rose more than 20
points. The S&P 500 added four.

06:48.642 --> 06:53.046
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a spike in the number of labs
that mistakenly received

06:53.046 --> 07:00.020
live anthrax; out-of-pocket
costs for health care on the
rise; what did the Red Cross buy

07:00.020 --> 07:06.026
with half-a-billion dollars
originally raised to rebuild
homes in Haiti?; what a mighty

07:06.026 --> 07:14.100
China means for the U.S. and
global stability; and debating
development along the Grand
Canyon.

07:14.100 --> 07:26.646
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Pentagon
today gave new information about
that scare over live anthrax

07:26.646 --> 07:34.120
samples. Officials said 51 labs
in 17 states, plus Washington,
D.C., and three foreign
countries

07:34.120 --> 07:39.192
received the suspected live
spores. That's a larger number
than what was previously
disclosed.

07:39.192 --> 07:42.962
At a news conference today,
Deputy Defense Secretary Robert
Work sought to reassure the

07:43.296 --> 07:44.964
public.

07:44.964 --> 07:48.702
ROBERT WORK, U.S. Deputy Defense
Secretary: We continue to work
with the CDC to ensure

07:48.702 --> 07:54.941
that all possible safeguards are
taken to prevent exposure at the
labs in question and

07:54.941 --> 07:59.879
that any worker that might have
had risk of exposure, even to
these low-concentrated samples,

07:59.879 --> 08:03.516
they are closely monitored.

08:03.516 --> 08:08.988
We know of no risk to the
general public from these
samples. To provide context,
the concentration

08:08.988 --> 08:15.762
of these samples are too low to
infect the average healthy
individual. Everyone in

08:15.762 --> 08:21.201
the Department of Defense takes
this issue very seriously,
because it is a matter of

08:21.201 --> 08:26.206
public health and also the
health of all of the members of
our department.

08:26.206 --> 08:30.043
JUDY WOODRUFF: Joining me now
to tell us more about what
happened and the response

08:30.043 --> 08:34.547
is Nancy Youssef. She's the
senior national security
correspondent for The Daily
Beast.

08:34.547 --> 08:37.650
Nancy, welcome back
to the program.

08:37.650 --> 08:44.424
So, many more samples of anthrax
were sent out to these labs than
was known before. Why

08:44.424 --> 08:47.260
is this coming out in bits
and pieces like this?

08:47.260 --> 08:49.696
NANCY YOUSSEF, The Daily Beast:
Well, part of it is that it
takes several days to determine

08:49.696 --> 08:54.033
which samples were sent out that
were positive and which were
negative.

08:54.033 --> 08:59.839
This is out of 400 lots, and
from each lot comes several
scores of samples that are sent

08:59.839 --> 09:03.877
to various labs, and so they're
going through lot by lot and
doing testing. The number

09:03.877 --> 09:07.614
that we're giving is only out of
four lots, 1 percent. And in
100 percent of the cases

09:07.614 --> 09:11.051
that have tested so far, it has
come back positive for anthrax.

09:11.051 --> 09:15.688
And so it portends of a lot more
laboratories and states coming
up as recipients of live

09:15.688 --> 09:17.490
anthrax.

09:17.490 --> 09:21.027
JUDY WOODRUFF: So there could
be more coming out, is what
you're saying?

09:21.027 --> 09:22.495
NANCY YOUSSEF: Yes, that's
right. The briefing that you
showed today, they said

09:22.495 --> 09:25.698
it repeatedly to
anticipate more.

09:25.698 --> 09:30.737
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, tell us,
what is it -- they said today
that so far no one has

09:30.737 --> 09:33.740
been infected. Are they certain
of that and what are they saying
about the danger

09:33.740 --> 09:35.708
to the public?

09:35.708 --> 09:38.878
NANCY YOUSSEF: Well, they're
saying no one has been infected,
but they're also giving

09:38.878 --> 09:44.551
antibiotics to 31 personnel,
nine of them here, 22 overseas,
as a precautionary measure.

09:44.551 --> 09:50.323
And so there is some concern on
that point. But to the public,
it doesn't appear that

09:50.323 --> 09:55.995
there was any danger because
these are samples that are sent
to laboratories, laboratories

09:55.995 --> 10:02.235
often that -- whose technicians
are vaccinated, whose facilities
are well protected for such

10:02.235 --> 10:04.103
measures.

10:04.103 --> 10:09.175
And so the danger is not so much
to the public in terms of
getting anthrax through those

10:09.175 --> 10:13.613
shipments, but the idea of live
anthrax being sent out to an
untold number of laboratories,

10:13.613 --> 10:15.348
states and workers.

10:15.348 --> 10:19.185
JUDY WOODRUFF: So why is it
being shipped out to so many
places?

10:19.185 --> 10:23.723
NANCY YOUSSEF: So, what
happened after the anthrax
letter scare of 2001, in which
powdered

10:23.723 --> 10:27.560
anthrax was sent to Senator
Daschle and a number of news
agencies, is there was a real

10:27.560 --> 10:33.733
uptick in funding for research
on anthrax and detection
methods, because there was a

10:33.733 --> 10:37.203
fear that this was going to be
an external threat, a form of
bioterrorism.

10:37.203 --> 10:42.709
As it turns out, it was an
internal threat. And so the DOD
keeps these spores, if you

10:42.709 --> 10:47.380
will, provides them to these
laboratories for the purpose of
doing detection research,

10:47.380 --> 10:52.986
other kinds of research to
ensure that places can prevent
anthrax from being brought in.

10:52.986 --> 10:57.323
For example, the Pentagon Force
Protection Agency was one of the
ones to receive live

10:57.323 --> 11:00.760
anthrax, and they use that to
detect -- to make sure that
those coming to the Pentagon

11:00.760 --> 11:03.496
are not bringing in
live anthrax with them.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.266
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just
quickly, finally, Nancy, are
they any closer to understanding

11:06.266 --> 11:07.634
why this happened,
what was the lapse?

11:07.634 --> 11:09.636
NANCY YOUSSEF: No.

11:09.636 --> 11:13.139
And, in fact, today's press
conference suggested that we're
further away from answers. They

11:13.139 --> 11:20.146
said that they had methods in
place to make sure that live
anthrax didn't go out. And

11:20.146 --> 11:24.050
yet, because there is no
standard practice, that
everybody sort of has their own
way of

11:24.050 --> 11:28.354
determining what's accepted, and
the fact that 100 percent of the
cases they have tested

11:28.354 --> 11:30.990
so far showed up positive, it
suggests that at the minimum
there was a fundamental flaw

11:30.990 --> 11:33.793
in their prevention methods.

11:33.793 --> 11:38.698
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nancy Youssef
with The Daily Beast, thank you
for following this for us.

11:38.698 --> 11:44.871
NANCY YOUSSEF: Thank you.

11:44.871 --> 11:52.145
GWEN IFILL: If it feels like
you are spending more for health
care through higher deductibles

11:52.145 --> 11:57.150
or premiums, you may be right.
Under the Affordable Care Act,
insurers are required

11:57.150 --> 12:02.088
to post rate increases if they
exceed 10 percent, and, in many
cases, the price spikes for the

12:02.088 --> 12:06.092
coming year range from 20
percent to 85 percent.

12:06.092 --> 12:10.763
And another study shows people
who are covered by their
employers are also paying more
through

12:10.763 --> 12:16.769
higher out-of-pocket costs that
leave as many as 31 million
people underinsured.

12:16.769 --> 12:21.341
Larry Levitt studies this for
the Kaiser Family Foundation.
and Dr. David Blumenthal is

12:21.341 --> 12:24.243
the president of the
Commonwealth Fund, which
released a second survey on
out-of-pocket

12:24.243 --> 12:27.046
costs.

12:27.046 --> 12:31.084
Larry Levitt, could you explain
to me why these price hikes are
going up all of a sudden?

12:31.084 --> 12:33.853
Or is it not all of a sudden?

12:33.853 --> 12:35.521
LARRY LEVITT, Senior Vice
President, Kaiser Family
Foundation: Well, first, I
would

12:35.521 --> 12:39.492
say that it's hard to generalize
from what we have seen so far.

12:39.492 --> 12:44.697
I mean, as you said, insurers
are only required to report
right now increases of 10
percent

12:44.697 --> 12:48.868
or more. So, not surprisingly,
those are all in double digits.
But that said, reading

12:48.868 --> 12:53.706
the tea leaves, it does look
like premiums are heading
upwards.

12:53.706 --> 12:56.576
And it's for a combination of
factors. I mean, first of all,
health care costs, which

12:56.576 --> 13:01.981
have been growing very slowly
recently, are increasing faster,
particularly for prescription

13:01.981 --> 13:07.053
drugs. And insurers are for the
first time under Obamacare
setting premiums based on

13:07.053 --> 13:10.223
actual experience
with enrollees.

13:10.223 --> 13:14.360
Up until now, they were guessing
at how much health care people
were using. Now they

13:14.360 --> 13:17.430
have actually some experience
under their belts and in many
cases people are -- look

13:17.430 --> 13:20.433
to be sicker than
insurers expected.

13:20.433 --> 13:25.304
GWEN IFILL: Well, are sicker
people now drawn more to this
because of Obamacare? Is

13:25.304 --> 13:28.074
that part of the connection?

13:28.074 --> 13:31.878
LARRY LEVITT: Yes, one of the
things that the Affordable Care
Act did was eliminated

13:31.878 --> 13:34.914
discrimination against people
with preexisting conditions.

13:34.914 --> 13:40.953
So, for the first time, someone
who was sick and wanted
insurance can get it. So, the

13:40.953 --> 13:45.425
first people in the door tended
to be those people who knew they
needed insurance and

13:45.425 --> 13:51.197
they had pretty high health care
needs. The key now is to try
and get more healthy people

13:51.197 --> 13:55.201
in the door. And the big wild
card is, will more people enroll
and will those be healthier

13:55.201 --> 13:57.437
than the enrollees we have now?

13:57.437 --> 14:03.376
GWEN IFILL: Now, as you pointed
out, these numbers are only for
increases over 10 percent.

14:03.376 --> 14:07.513
What about state regulators?
Do they have a say in whether
these numbers can go up or

14:07.513 --> 14:09.282
not?

14:09.282 --> 14:13.853
LARRY LEVITT: They do. In most
states, the insurance
commissioner has the power to

14:13.853 --> 14:18.925
disapprove these increase if he
or she feels they're
unjustified.

14:18.925 --> 14:23.830
So, the actuaries and insurance
departments are sharpening their
pencils and reviewing

14:23.830 --> 14:27.967
these rates. And if history is
a judge, many of them will come
down, at least somewhat,

14:27.967 --> 14:30.336
and in some cases by a lot.

14:30.336 --> 14:34.340
GWEN IFILL: And which states
are right now the most affected
by this? And is it because

14:34.340 --> 14:37.610
of medical costs or because of
the region or because of whether
people have been insured

14:37.610 --> 14:39.979
at all before?

14:39.979 --> 14:43.750
LARRY LEVITT: Well, medical
costs, you know, affect all
states. I don't think that's

14:43.750 --> 14:47.587
a big factor in the
variation across states.

14:47.587 --> 14:52.024
Probably, one of the biggest
factors is how enrollment is
doing. Enrollment has varied

14:52.024 --> 14:57.830
tremendously across the country.
Florida signed up a lot of
people, a very high percentage

14:57.830 --> 15:01.267
of the eligible population
there. Other states like Iowa,
for example, have signed

15:01.267 --> 15:02.001
up very few people.

15:02.001 --> 15:04.270
GWEN IFILL: OK.

15:04.270 --> 15:08.775
Dr. David Blumenthal, I want to
turn to you now about your
report, which says that 31

15:08.775 --> 15:12.779
million people are underinsured
because of this increase in
deductibles. What does

15:12.779 --> 15:14.914
underinsured mean, first of all?

15:14.914 --> 15:17.250
DR. DAVID BLUMENTHAL, President,
Commonwealth Fund: Well, our
definition of underinsurance

15:17.250 --> 15:23.289
is that you're underinsured if
you spend more than 10 percent
of your income, excluding

15:23.289 --> 15:29.428
premiums, on health care, and
you're insured, or if your
deductible exceeds 5 percent of

15:29.428 --> 15:31.397
your income.

15:31.397 --> 15:35.501
Now, if you are poor, that is,
if you have an income of less
than 200 percent of the

15:35.501 --> 15:42.141
federal poverty level, we define
underinsurance as spending more
than 5 percent of your income

15:42.141 --> 15:44.744
on out-of-pocket expenditures.

15:44.744 --> 15:48.548
GWEN IFILL: Are these
out-of-pocket expenditures,
these deductibles, are they a
tradeoff for

15:48.548 --> 15:51.884
getting premiums lower? We were
just talking about premiums?

15:51.884 --> 15:55.822
DR. DAVID BLUMENTHAL: They can
be. One reason why premiums can
be kept lower is by

15:55.822 --> 16:01.460
asking people who are insured to
pay more of the cost of care.
That takes the insurance

16:01.460 --> 16:04.597
company off the hook for that
part of the cost of care.

16:04.597 --> 16:06.599
GWEN IFILL: Well, what happens?
Do people just seek less care?
Are they less likely

16:06.599 --> 16:08.935
to go to the doctor?

16:08.935 --> 16:12.738
DR. DAVID BLUMENTHAL: Yes.
About half of people who are
underinsured report that

16:12.738 --> 16:16.042
they are having trouble paying
medical bills or getting less
medical care than they think

16:16.042 --> 16:18.277
they need.

16:18.277 --> 16:21.881
GWEN IFILL: So, what's the
connection then to the
Affordable Care Act here? Some
would

16:21.881 --> 16:23.716
look at this and say, this was
one of the problems that the
Affordable Care Act was

16:23.716 --> 16:25.117
supposed to solve.

16:25.117 --> 16:30.189
DR. DAVID BLUMENTHAL: We have
been tracking this since 2003.

16:30.189 --> 16:34.227
Most of the increase that we
have observed in underinsurance
occurred before the Affordable

16:34.227 --> 16:37.263
Care Act became law,
between 2003 and 2010.

16:37.263 --> 16:39.932
GWEN IFILL: So the trend
had kicked in already?

16:39.932 --> 16:42.368
DR. DAVID BLUMENTHAL: The trend
had kicked in. Since 2010,
there really hasn't been

16:42.368 --> 16:45.705
much of a change.

16:45.705 --> 16:50.109
And another thing to keep in
mind is that for us to consider
you underinsured, you had

16:50.109 --> 16:56.382
to have insurance for a full
year. Many of the people who
responded to our survey

16:56.382 --> 17:04.257
had no insurance prior to 2014
or, if they had had insurance
through Obama -- through

17:04.257 --> 17:08.561
the Affordable Care Act, they
only had it for six months. So
we don't feel that this

17:08.561 --> 17:11.430
survey captures the effect
of the Affordable Care Act.

17:11.430 --> 17:16.602
GWEN IFILL: OK. Well, I want
to ask you both now to answer a
very basic question,

17:16.602 --> 17:21.440
which is, either way, no matter
what the cause of this is,
health care has grown more
expensive

17:21.440 --> 17:25.578
for people for whatever reason.
What do consumers do? Do they
shop for a better

17:25.578 --> 17:27.179
deal? Do they just go without?

17:27.179 --> 17:29.649
I will start with
you, Dr. Blumenthal.

17:29.649 --> 17:32.385
DR. DAVID BLUMENTHAL: Well, one
of the things that the
Affordable Care Act has done,
which

17:32.385 --> 17:36.555
is advantageous to consumers, is
created these marketplaces,
where people can go online and

17:36.555 --> 17:38.891
comparison-shop.

17:38.891 --> 17:44.297
That was very hard to do before
the Affordable Care Act,
especially for people who had
individual

17:44.297 --> 17:51.203
insurance policies. So, the
opportunity to see what a given
insurance company charges

17:51.203 --> 17:56.342
for a given type of coverage is
new and available to people.
And one of the reasons why these

17:56.342 --> 18:00.079
announced premium increases may
not be as serious as they are
regarded is that people

18:00.079 --> 18:02.615
will have choice.

18:02.615 --> 18:06.686
They will have a chance to move
out of a high-price insurance
into a lower-price insurance.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.821
GWEN IFILL: Will they have a
choice on out-of-pocket costs?

18:08.821 --> 18:12.458
DR. DAVID BLUMENTHAL:
Well, they will, yes.

18:12.458 --> 18:17.496
They -- the way the Affordable
Care Act works is, it creates
bands of insurance with --
according

18:17.496 --> 18:21.667
to generosity, and the level of
deductibles and co-pays is part
of the choice.

18:21.667 --> 18:25.771
GWEN IFILL: Let me ask you
Larry Levitt, what is your
prescription for what consumers

18:25.771 --> 18:28.841
should do when faced with these
new -- this sticker shock?

18:28.841 --> 18:33.112
LARRY LEVITT: Well, I
would agree with David.

18:33.112 --> 18:39.452
The -- what we have seen in the
first two years of Obamacare is
that insurers are jockeying

18:39.452 --> 18:42.521
for position in these new
marketplaces. So, while there
are some insurers that are
increasing

18:42.521 --> 18:46.192
premiums substantially, there
are others that are actually
decreasing premiums. So there

18:46.192 --> 18:48.594
are good deals to be had.

18:48.594 --> 18:54.333
But consumers really have to
look around. Many consumers did
shop after the first

18:54.333 --> 19:00.306
year of the ACA going into this
year, but many just let momentum
take hold and stuck

19:00.306 --> 19:03.843
with their old plan, potentially
paying much more. So, shopping
around is really the

19:03.843 --> 19:05.745
key here.

19:05.745 --> 19:08.514
GWEN IFILL: Well, the Supreme
Court may have a lot to say
about what happens to all

19:08.514 --> 19:11.717
of this by the end
of this month.

19:11.717 --> 19:14.520
Larry Levitt of the Kaiser
Family Foundation, and David
Blumenthal of the Commonwealth
Fund,

19:14.520 --> 19:16.355
thank you both very much.

19:16.355 --> 19:20.059
DR. DAVID BLUMENTHAL:
Thank you.

19:20.059 --> 19:24.397
LARRY LEVITT: Thank you.

19:24.397 --> 19:31.003
JUDY WOODRUFF: The American Red
Cross is under scrutiny once
again for the way it operates,

19:31.003 --> 19:36.342
and how it's using the money
that people donate to it, the
latest item, a joint
investigation

19:36.342 --> 19:41.247
by two news organizations
pointing to what they say is a
failure to deliver on promises

19:41.247 --> 19:45.151
of housing in Haiti after the
earthquake there five years ago.

19:45.151 --> 19:48.020
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

19:48.020 --> 19:56.729
JEFFREY BROWN: January 12,
2010, a catastrophic earthquake
ravaged Haiti's capital,
Port-au-Prince,

19:56.729 --> 20:03.602
shaking whole neighborhoods to
bits, and leaving 1.5 million
people homeless.

20:03.602 --> 20:09.175
The American Red Cross raised
nearly $500 million for Haiti's
relief, far more than

20:09.175 --> 20:14.680
any other charity. And a year
after the quake, Red Cross CEO
Gail McGovern announced

20:14.680 --> 20:17.249
plans to create -- quote --
"brand-new communities."

20:17.249 --> 20:20.753
GAIL MCGOVERN, CEO, American Red
Cross: We're working on a
planned partnership to build

20:20.753 --> 20:26.225
permanent housing for people
that were left homeless during
the earthquake. Under this

20:26.225 --> 20:32.698
partnership, USAID would
identify and pair at least two
locations in Haiti for permanent

20:32.698 --> 20:38.437
homes that would include roads,
drainage, and other
infrastructure. The plan is
that

20:38.437 --> 20:43.542
the American Red Cross would
build these homes, including
water and sanitation.

20:43.542 --> 20:49.582
JEFFREY BROWN: But an
investigation by ProPublica and
NPR has concluded the Red Cross
response

20:49.582 --> 20:55.054
was plagued by failures.
Despite the lofty goals,
documents obtained by the two
media

20:55.054 --> 21:00.593
organizations show that only six
permanent homes were built with
Red Cross funds.

21:00.593 --> 21:06.465
They also found inaccurate
numbers on how many people were
helped by various Red Cross

21:06.465 --> 21:12.938
programs. NPR and ProPublica
say many displaced Haitians were
given short-term rental
assistance

21:12.938 --> 21:17.176
or housed in temporary shelters
like these, prone to termite
attacks and unable to withstand

21:17.176 --> 21:20.713
tropical storms.

21:20.713 --> 21:24.350
Haitians themselves say they are
still struggling just to
survive.

21:24.350 --> 21:28.687
CARLINE PIERRE, Haiti (through
translator): The living
conditions are very hard for

21:28.687 --> 21:31.724
the poor. We are sitting here,
and people don't really come to
buy products like they

21:31.724 --> 21:34.793
used to. Things are difficult.

21:34.793 --> 21:39.899
JEFFREY BROWN: In a statement
today, the Red Cross criticized
the report and touted

21:39.899 --> 21:45.571
its accomplishments in Haiti,
building and operating eight
hospitals and clinics, providing

21:45.571 --> 21:51.710
clean water and sanitation, and
moving more than 100,000 people
out of makeshift tents.

21:51.710 --> 21:57.583
As for housing, the agency
argued that Haitian government
red tape blocked it from gaining

21:57.583 --> 22:02.621
crucial land rights for
building. For instance, an
agreement for the new
communities project

22:02.621 --> 22:06.992
was ultimately canceled
because of a land dispute.

22:06.992 --> 22:10.930
Laura Sullivan of NPR is one of
the two journalists on the team
who reported this story. We

22:10.930 --> 22:15.768
invited the American Red Cross
to join us, but officials there
declined our offer.

22:15.768 --> 22:18.671
So, Laura, let me ask you,
first, give us some background
on how this came about and

22:18.671 --> 22:21.073
how you reported it.

22:21.073 --> 22:24.777
LAURA SULLIVAN, National Public
Radio: This was a partnership
that NPR did with ProPublica,

22:24.777 --> 22:28.581
myself and Justin Elliott and
another reporter named Jesse
Eisinger, back in the fall,
where

22:28.581 --> 22:34.920
we looked into Hurricane Sandy
and Isaac and the Red Cross'
response to those storms.

22:34.920 --> 22:39.992
And we found that there was --
they spent too much time focused
on the public relations

22:39.992 --> 22:44.063
effort in those storms and
failed in a lot of aspects. And
then we also looked at in

22:44.063 --> 22:46.966
the fall some of the
questionable things that they
say about how they're spending
donors'

22:46.966 --> 22:48.033
money.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.568
JEFFREY BROWN: And so it was
looking at Haiti from there?

22:49.568 --> 22:51.570
LAURA SULLIVAN: Exactly.

22:51.570 --> 22:57.543
We ended up being able to see
hundreds of pages of internal
Red Cross records, e-mails

22:57.543 --> 23:03.249
and memos that senior managers
wrote to one another. And we
also talked to dozens of

23:03.249 --> 23:07.319
-- a dozen current and former
Red Cross employees about what
happened in Haiti and what
happened

23:07.319 --> 23:08.921
to the money.

23:08.921 --> 23:11.991
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so on the
specific issue of creating more
housing, the Red Cross

23:11.991 --> 23:17.129
cites a lack of land to build
on. They cite red tape that
made property rights impossible.

23:17.129 --> 23:20.065
They are saying that they --
they basically changed -- they
had to change course and,

23:20.065 --> 23:20.833
therefore, did.

23:20.833 --> 23:23.002
LAURA SULLIVAN:
And that is true.

23:23.002 --> 23:27.873
It is very difficult to build in
Haiti. And a lot of nonprofits
had a lot of trouble.

23:27.873 --> 23:33.712
But, still, it is possible to
do. And at this point now, five
years after the earthquake,

23:33.712 --> 23:38.817
other NGOs have been able to
build 9,000 homes. The Red
Cross has had half-a-billion
dollars

23:38.817 --> 23:42.988
and five years in Haiti, and
they have built six homes.

23:42.988 --> 23:46.091
JEFFREY BROWN: When you're
citing the reasons for this
failure, the prime one that
comes

23:46.091 --> 23:50.462
through is what you see as a
lack of experience by the Red
Cross in how to carry this kind

23:50.462 --> 23:52.398
of thing out.

23:52.398 --> 23:56.468
LAURA SULLIVAN: That's
something that we heard from a
number of Red Cross officials

23:56.468 --> 24:00.706
and through the Red Cross' own
documents, which just show that
this is not an area that

24:00.706 --> 24:03.242
they have a lot of
familiarity with.

24:03.242 --> 24:06.445
They have years of experience
doing immediate disaster relief.

24:06.445 --> 24:07.279
JEFFREY BROWN: So, how does...

24:07.279 --> 24:08.814
(CROSSTALK)

24:08.814 --> 24:10.082
LAURA SULLIVAN: ... providing
things like blankets and water.
And they did that in

24:10.082 --> 24:12.551
Haiti as well.

24:12.551 --> 24:16.555
But what they do not know very
well how to do and have very
little experience doing is

24:16.555 --> 24:22.294
rebuilding in a developing
country. And yet they outraised
other NGOs by hundreds

24:22.294 --> 24:25.197
of millions of dollars, even
after the immediate disaster
relief was over, so that they
could

24:25.197 --> 24:27.166
do just that.

24:27.166 --> 24:30.469
JEFFREY BROWN: So, how does it
play out? There's a certain
amount of money that goes

24:30.469 --> 24:32.438
to immediate emergency relief.
And I saw that a year after it
happened...

24:32.438 --> 24:33.639
LAURA SULLIVAN: Absolutely.

24:33.639 --> 24:36.875
JEFFREY BROWN: ... when they
were there providing all kinds
of things.

24:36.875 --> 24:39.211
But you're saying that, after
that, they didn't have the
knowledge or resources -- well,
they

24:39.211 --> 24:40.879
had the resources, but
not the knowledge?

24:40.879 --> 24:43.649
LAURA SULLIVAN: They had the
resources. They didn't have the
knowledge.

24:43.649 --> 24:47.219
And one of the senior officials
we talked to was in charge of
their Haiti program -- their

24:47.219 --> 24:51.824
Haiti shelter program, Lee
Malany. And he said they just
never had a plan for housing.

24:51.824 --> 24:56.061
Other people we talked to said,
this is not anything that they
knew how to do. And

24:56.061 --> 24:58.397
they were kind of flying blind
in some ways in terms of being
able to get these housing

24:58.397 --> 25:01.200
projects off the ground.

25:01.200 --> 25:05.771
And the housing projects that
they -- they weren't ever able
to build any homes. They

25:05.771 --> 25:09.975
say they provided homes for
130,000 Haitians. This is
another number that just did not

25:09.975 --> 25:12.878
add up when we actually
dug down into it.

25:12.878 --> 25:17.282
JEFFREY BROWN: The Red Cross
has pushed back pretty hard at
you today, saying in a

25:17.282 --> 25:21.620
statement: "The Red Cross is
disappointed by the lack of
balance, context, and accuracy

25:21.620 --> 25:26.158
in the most recent reporting by
ProPublica, NPR. It is
particularly disappointing to

25:26.158 --> 25:30.763
see our work misrepresented,
considering we answered more
than 100 questions in writing

25:30.763 --> 25:33.432
and provided an interview with
the head of our intentional
programs."

25:33.432 --> 25:38.604
LAURA SULLIVAN: And that -- it
is true the Red Cross has done
-- has provided a lot of

25:38.604 --> 25:44.076
disaster services in Haiti. And
they have certainly spent
millions of dollars providing

25:44.076 --> 25:47.846
shelter and providing, you know,
water and things like that.

25:47.846 --> 25:52.651
But, at the end of the day, they
didn't do what they promised
Haitians they were going

25:52.651 --> 25:57.589
to do. And they didn't also do
what they promised their own
donors they would do. They

25:57.589 --> 26:02.761
did answer a lot of our
questions. It went back and
forth for many months, and it is

26:02.761 --> 26:06.698
good to have that information
from them. But what that
information did show for us and

26:06.698 --> 26:11.036
what their own internal
documents show is that they were
not able to provide Haitians

26:11.036 --> 26:14.306
the kind of assistance that
they had promised them.

26:14.306 --> 26:16.542
JEFFREY BROWN: Let me ask just
you finally, we can stipulate
that it is hard to work in

26:16.542 --> 26:16.909
Haiti, right...

26:16.909 --> 26:17.543
LAURA SULLIVAN: Absolutely.

26:17.543 --> 26:19.711
JEFFREY BROWN: ... to get
these kinds of things.

26:19.711 --> 26:24.650
Did you see examples where
things were working, where
housing was...

26:24.650 --> 26:24.817
LAURA SULLIVAN: Absolutely.

26:24.817 --> 26:26.552
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes?

26:26.552 --> 26:28.921
LAURA SULLIVAN: So, that's what
-- was one of the most
interesting things about it, is

26:28.921 --> 26:36.595
that a number of NGOs have been
able to build 9,000 permanent
homes at this point.

26:36.595 --> 26:41.133
And we went to one project that
was done by Global Communities
and PCI, where we saw more

26:41.133 --> 26:46.171
than 300 homes being built. In
the project now, they're
building 75 homes that have
running

26:46.171 --> 26:49.842
water for people. And those --
and they say that a lot that is
because they hired

26:49.842 --> 26:53.779
Haitians to do the
bulk of the work.

26:53.779 --> 26:57.883
Some of the sources and
documents that we read show that
the Red Cross had a very
difficult

26:57.883 --> 27:02.754
problem not hiring enough
Haitians, and that they had a
number of expats that were
extremely

27:02.754 --> 27:07.526
expensive and also didn't even
speak either of Haiti's
languages. And one person said,

27:07.526 --> 27:09.828
how can you go to a meeting with
Haitian government officials
when you can't speak the
language?

27:09.828 --> 27:11.029
JEFFREY BROWN: All right.

27:11.029 --> 27:12.798
Laura Sullivan of NPR,
thank you so much.

27:12.798 --> 27:15.067
LAURA SULLIVAN: Thank
you for having me.

27:15.067 --> 27:22.508
GWEN IFILL: We have put a link
to the full ProPublica/NPR
report on our home page. That's

27:22.508 --> 27:26.144
PBS.org/NewsHour.

27:26.144 --> 27:36.121
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we take a
broader look at China and how
the U.S. should engage with

27:36.121 --> 27:40.025
the rapidly growing economic
and military power.

27:40.025 --> 27:45.597
Today, President Obama discussed
the possibility of China
eventually joining a major trade

27:45.597 --> 27:49.735
deal already in the works with
other Asian nations. He spoke
to public radio's Kai

27:49.735 --> 27:52.104
Ryssdal, host of "Marketplace."

27:52.104 --> 27:55.240
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: They have
already started putting out
feelers

27:55.240 --> 27:59.878
about the possibilities of them
participating at some point.

27:59.878 --> 28:01.280
KAI RYSSDAL,
"Marketplace": To you?

28:01.280 --> 28:05.884
BARACK OBAMA: To us, to Jack
Lew, the treasury secretary.

28:05.884 --> 28:12.491
The fact is that is that if we
have 11 of the leading economies
in the Asia-Pacific

28:12.491 --> 28:19.865
region who have agreed to
enforceable labor standards,
enforceable environmental
standards,

28:19.865 --> 28:26.872
strong I.P. protections,
nondiscrimination against
foreign firms that are
operating,

28:26.872 --> 28:33.211
access to those markets, reduced
tariffs, then China is going to
have to at least take

28:33.211 --> 28:37.249
those international
norms into account.

28:37.249 --> 28:42.754
JUDY WOODRUFF: I recently sat
down with two former treasury
secretaries, Democrat

28:42.754 --> 28:48.460
Robert Rubin and Republican
Henry Paulson. The two, good
friends and longtime colleagues,

28:48.460 --> 28:52.731
reached across the aisle to
co-author a piece about
U.S.-China relations and how to
get

28:52.731 --> 28:55.167
them right.

28:55.167 --> 28:59.104
It appears in this month's
"Atlantic" magazine, and is the
focus of tonight's installment

28:59.104 --> 29:03.342
of our partnership
with "The Atlantic."

29:03.342 --> 29:09.414
China's over 300 mile-an-hour
bullet trains set the world
standard. Chinese shoppers

29:09.414 --> 29:17.356
fill Shanghai streets, and the
skyscrapers continue to rise.
This ancient Asian power

29:17.356 --> 29:24.296
is not only on track to eclipse
the U.S. as the world's largest
economy by 2016. These

29:24.296 --> 29:30.268
days, they're not shy about
flexing their military might, as
they staged their first

29:30.268 --> 29:36.908
ever joint naval exercises in
the Mediterranean with the
Russian navy just last month,
even

29:36.908 --> 29:41.313
building up islands in the South
China Sea to press what it
considers its territorial

29:41.313 --> 29:44.316
claims against Asian neighbors.

29:44.316 --> 29:48.286
ASHTON CARTER, U.S. Defense
Secretary: With its actions in
the South China Sea, China

29:48.286 --> 29:54.660
is out of step with both
international norms that
underscore the Asia-Pacific
security

29:54.660 --> 30:00.265
architecture and the regional
consensus in favor of a
non-coercive approach to this
and

30:00.265 --> 30:03.135
other longstanding disputes.

30:03.135 --> 30:07.673
HENRY PAULSON, Former U.S.
Treasury Secretary: China has
emerged as really a formidable

30:07.673 --> 30:13.011
competitor, and as they are
asserting themselves on the
global stage, the longstanding
consensus

30:13.011 --> 30:16.481
that China's rise is good for
the U.S. is beginning to break
down.

30:16.481 --> 30:21.887
JUDY WOODRUFF: Henry Paulson
and Bob Rubin worked for
presidents from different
parties,

30:21.887 --> 30:27.225
George W. Bush and Bill Clinton,
but they agree on the need to
chart a midcourse correction

30:27.225 --> 30:33.065
in U.S.-China relations, and
say it needs to happen soon.

30:33.065 --> 30:36.401
What is it about this
U.S.-Chinese relationship that
you think it is so important for
the

30:36.401 --> 30:38.970
American people to
know right now?

30:38.970 --> 30:41.106
ROBERT RUBIN, Former U.S.
Treasury Secretary: That I
think that when you have the two

30:41.106 --> 30:44.142
largest economies in the world,
the United States and China, you
have the opportunity

30:44.142 --> 30:47.913
for a mutually beneficial
bilateral relationship.

30:47.913 --> 30:52.884
And, in addition, if we can get
that right and if we can get a
broad-based understanding

30:52.884 --> 30:56.555
and recognition in each country
that we benefit from the
relation with each other, then I

30:56.555 --> 31:00.959
think we improve the potential
for our working together on
these transnational issues that

31:00.959 --> 31:06.031
so enormously affect each of our
countries, terrorism, Middle
East instability, climate

31:06.031 --> 31:09.401
change, and so much else that
affects the whole of the global
community.

31:09.401 --> 31:14.272
HENRY PAULSON: They're all
going to be easier to solve it
or to deal with if we have got

31:14.272 --> 31:18.176
a good working relationship with
China, and much more difficult
if we don't.

31:18.176 --> 31:22.547
JUDY WOODRUFF: I recently met
with the two men at the Council
on Foreign Relations in

31:22.547 --> 31:28.620
New York, where Bob Rubin is now
the co-chairman. In their joint
article, they turn U.S.-China

31:28.620 --> 31:32.290
critiques of each
other on their heads.

31:32.290 --> 31:37.963
Rubin and Paulson argue that
both the United States and China
would be better off if they

31:37.963 --> 31:43.835
accepted, and acted on, the
criticisms leveled by the other
side, this in a relationship

31:43.835 --> 31:47.439
that is increasingly crucial
to global stability.

31:47.439 --> 31:52.010
ROBERT RUBIN: Instead of having
an exchange of grievances -- and
we refer to it as dialogue

31:52.010 --> 31:57.249
of the deaf -- what you will see
is that, if each of our
countries does simply what

31:57.249 --> 32:01.586
is its own self-interest, it
will address the critiques that
the other country is making.

32:01.586 --> 32:06.491
JUDY WOODRUFF: The two are on
board with Chinese claims that
the U.S. needs to ease

32:06.491 --> 32:12.264
its fiscal crisis. And both men
believe other Chinese critiques
are on the mark, like

32:12.264 --> 32:15.233
the need for the U.S. to
invest in infrastructure.

32:15.233 --> 32:20.472
HENRY PAULSON: I think the
biggest challenge is fixing our
own problems. We need a tax

32:20.472 --> 32:24.042
system that's going to let us
raise the revenues we need and
be competitive.

32:24.042 --> 32:27.479
ROBERT RUBIN: We have a paucity
of capital for infrastructure,
and we have a desperate

32:27.479 --> 32:30.315
need for infrastructure. We
should be doing a lot more at
the federal level, and I think

32:30.315 --> 32:34.019
there are ways we could do that
and pay for it that wouldn't
create a fiscal problem.

32:34.019 --> 32:38.723
JUDY WOODRUFF: In his new book,
Hank Paulson goes even further,
arguing that the U.S. should

32:38.723 --> 32:44.296
welcome Chinese investment more
broadly, holding up Japan as an
example.

32:44.296 --> 32:50.235
HENRY PAULSON: I argue all the
time that the greatest
compliment any country can pay

32:50.235 --> 32:55.273
to the United States of America
is make a direct investment here
that creates jobs.

32:55.273 --> 33:03.248
Back in the days when Bob was my
boss at Goldman Sachs, I
remember very well when the
Japanese

33:03.248 --> 33:09.054
came in and they bought the
Rockefeller Center, and my
mother was horrified, just
horrified.

33:09.054 --> 33:14.025
And I said to her, mom, what
are you concerned about? They
can't put the Rockefeller Center

33:14.025 --> 33:17.762
on an aircraft carrier and take
it back to Japan. We have got
the Rockefeller Center,

33:17.762 --> 33:20.665
and we have got their money.
This is a good thing.

33:20.665 --> 33:25.203
ROBERT RUBIN: Japanese
companies subsequently created a
lot of transplants in this
country,

33:25.203 --> 33:29.207
manufacturing in this country,
manufacturing companies that
hired American workers. And

33:29.207 --> 33:34.279
now there is a lot of enthusiasm
about the Japanese investment in
the United States.

33:34.279 --> 33:38.183
And I think the same thing could
happen with China. I think we
would benefit greatly

33:38.183 --> 33:41.586
from Chinese investment in this
country. And I think we should
be proactively seeking it.

33:41.586 --> 33:45.390
JUDY WOODRUFF: But they believe
both countries must make
changes.

33:45.390 --> 33:52.297
HENRY PAULSON: China has an
economic model that has ran out
of steam. It -- they need

33:52.297 --> 33:59.671
a new economic model. Now, it's
very easy to say that. It is
very difficult to reboot

33:59.671 --> 34:05.176
a $10 trillion economy, and
that's what they need to do.

34:05.176 --> 34:09.247
JUDY WOODRUFF: For a country
with a communist system and a
bureaucratic, state-run economy,

34:09.247 --> 34:11.683
none of the fixes would be easy.

34:11.683 --> 34:16.121
HENRY PAULSON: The most
important parts are opening up
to competition.

34:16.121 --> 34:20.759
JUDY WOODRUFF: They want the
Chinese to stop subsidizing
state-owned companies.

34:20.759 --> 34:26.798
HENRY PAULSON: What they need
to do is rein in the state-owned
sector, to wean them from

34:26.798 --> 34:32.337
their preferential regulatory
treatment, from their subsidies
or energy subsidies, their

34:32.337 --> 34:37.676
interest rate and financing
subsidies, and then open up to
competition.

34:37.676 --> 34:42.547
And that will create opportunity
for private sectors in China and
for U.S. companies to

34:42.547 --> 34:46.451
sell U.S. products and
provide services in China.

34:46.451 --> 34:52.958
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lower barriers
to entry for foreign firms, help
expand consumer spending,

34:52.958 --> 34:57.629
rein in cyber-attacks and, once
and for all, protect
intellectual property rights.

34:57.629 --> 35:01.333
ROBERT RUBIN: I heard this when
I was there a few weekends ago,
that they have got to

35:01.333 --> 35:05.537
protect intellectual property
rights effectively if they're
going to provide the incentive

35:05.537 --> 35:10.442
for their own people to pursue
the kind of technological and
life science developments

35:10.442 --> 35:13.345
that they think are so
central to their future.

35:13.345 --> 35:18.616
JUDY WOODRUFF: Recently, the
owners of Gucci and Yves Saint
Laurent filed suit against

35:18.616 --> 35:25.123
stock market darling Alibaba,
accusing the Internet retailer
of knowingly selling fake

35:25.123 --> 35:32.030
items. The company spent $160
million in 2014 trying to
prevent the sale of fakes.

35:32.030 --> 35:37.702
If the lawsuit succeeds,
Alibaba could lose far more.

35:37.702 --> 35:43.408
Will these legal actions prompt
the Chinese to stop the
production and sale of
counterfeits?

35:43.408 --> 35:46.978
HENRY PAULSON: I laugh at
people sometimes when they come
to me and say, you know, you

35:46.978 --> 35:52.317
see Chinese President Xi Jinping
frequently. Just tell him this
or that.

35:52.317 --> 35:57.122
It's sort of what I call the
"whisper in the emperor's ear"
phenomena, which, of course,

35:57.122 --> 36:04.262
is not the way China works.
China has a consensus-driven
system. And these changes

36:04.262 --> 36:07.732
are very, very
difficult to make.

36:07.732 --> 36:12.470
And let's think for a minute
what Xi Jinping has inherited.
He's got a broken economic

36:12.470 --> 36:16.641
model. He's got a broken
urbanization model. He's got an
environment that is killing

36:16.641 --> 36:19.811
people. He's got
corruption running rampant.

36:19.811 --> 36:24.449
JUDY WOODRUFF: But the
prescriptions Rubin and Paulson
are trying to sell now in the

36:24.449 --> 36:31.456
U.S. are no easier, because they
involve raising taxes, spending
billions on infrastructure,

36:31.456 --> 36:36.127
and encouraging foreign
investment. They're at least as
difficult as anything they did

36:36.127 --> 36:39.764
during their terms as
treasury secretaries.

36:39.764 --> 36:44.069
A lot of people would applaud
and say, that's a great idea,
but getting it done, have you

36:44.069 --> 36:46.237
talked to the congressional
leadership, to the leadership in
the administration about

36:46.237 --> 36:48.473
this?

36:48.473 --> 36:51.643
ROBERT RUBIN: I think it's
probably fair to say both of us
have had a fair bit of
interaction

36:51.643 --> 36:54.279
with the -- with people
in elected office.

36:54.279 --> 36:58.750
And I think we have got to get
to the point where the American
people begin to insist

36:58.750 --> 37:03.822
that those that they elect, no
matter what their views may be,
actually engage in the

37:03.822 --> 37:08.226
process of governance. If you
go back to 1997, Trent Lott and
President Clinton certainly

37:08.226 --> 37:10.728
had very different views on many
issues, but they were able to
come together and agree

37:10.728 --> 37:13.331
on a '97 balanced
budget agreement.

37:13.331 --> 37:17.335
Each of them accepted measures
they didn't like in order to get
an agreement that each

37:17.335 --> 37:20.872
of them felt was far better for
the country and far better from
the perspective that they

37:20.872 --> 37:23.007
looked at policy than no
agreement would have been. And
that is where we have to get
back

37:23.007 --> 37:24.909
to as a political system.

37:24.909 --> 37:28.680
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, on the
Republican side, Hank Paulson,
we are already in the middle

37:28.680 --> 37:35.820
of a presidential campaign where
the incentive in your party is,
if anything, to move to

37:35.820 --> 37:42.560
the right when it comes to
taxes, when it comes to,
frankly, just dealing with
China.

37:42.560 --> 37:45.797
The image of China has become
much more negative in both
parties, but I think it's fair
to

37:45.797 --> 37:49.634
say in the Republican
Party very strongly.

37:49.634 --> 37:55.073
HENRY PAULSON: All I will say
to those Americans who are
rooting against China, all I can
say

37:55.073 --> 37:59.744
to you is, be careful what you
wish for, because, let me tell
you, air and water knows no
boundaries.

37:59.744 --> 38:05.450
You know, a ton of carbon
emitted from China is every bit
as bad as one from the U.S.

38:05.450 --> 38:09.721
If their economy struggles, our
economic challenges are going to
be greater.

38:09.721 --> 38:16.427
JUDY WOODRUFF: Looking at who
you are, former chairman at
Goldman Sachs, some folks may

38:16.427 --> 38:21.232
look at this and say, wait a
minute, are these solutions
really all about Wall Street and

38:21.232 --> 38:25.703
the American elite, or are they
really about helping the
American working people?

38:25.703 --> 38:28.840
ROBERT RUBIN: I think what we
do have to do is to promote
strong growth that will create

38:28.840 --> 38:31.643
jobs, tighten labor markets,
and increase wages.

38:31.643 --> 38:36.114
Then I think people will have a
better feeling about our
economy, and they will be more
receptive

38:36.114 --> 38:40.151
to those kind of objectives in
terms of trade and technology
that are best for the American

38:40.151 --> 38:43.021
people, best for workers,
and best for consumers.

38:43.021 --> 38:49.427
HENRY PAULSON: I know the
reason that I wrote my book on
China was because it is
important

38:49.427 --> 38:57.535
for my grandchildren and
everyone's grandchildren to grow
up in a world that is prosperous
-- and

38:57.535 --> 39:04.342
I mean inclusively prosperous --
is safe, has got a sound,
healthy environment.

39:04.342 --> 39:08.947
And I think the odds of that are
much, much greater if we're not
in conflict with China,

39:08.947 --> 39:13.851
but if we're working -- working
in complementary ways with
China.

39:13.851 --> 39:22.961
GWEN IFILL: We will be back
with a look at the debate over
development in the Grand

39:22.961 --> 39:24.862
Canyon.

39:24.862 --> 39:29.901
But, first, it's pledge week on
PBS. This break allows your
public television station

39:29.901 --> 39:41.479
to ask for your support. And
that support helps keep programs
like ours on the air.

39:41.479 --> 39:43.281
(BREAK)

39:43.281 --> 39:46.784
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight:
a sacred spot in one of
America's most breathtaking

39:46.784 --> 39:51.022
landmarks. History, environment
and economics all collide, as a
divided Navajo community

39:51.022 --> 39:55.960
grapple with a billion-dollar
plan to develop a pristine spot
where two rivers meet.

39:55.960 --> 39:59.130
Ryan Hill, a reporter at Arizona
State University's Walter
Cronkite School of Journalism,
takes

39:59.130 --> 40:02.100
an in-depth look at
the controversy.

40:02.100 --> 40:04.502
RYAN HILL, Walter Cronkite
School of Journalism and Mass
Communication, Arizona State
University:

40:04.502 --> 40:07.538
The Grand Canyon is one of the
world's most protected places,
for a reason.

40:07.538 --> 40:11.576
WOMAN: It's my time with God.
As you're heading down and the
sun is just starting

40:11.576 --> 40:15.113
to peak out and the shadows are
across these beautiful
creations, it is -- it's
magnificent.

40:15.113 --> 40:21.386
RYAN HILL: Millions come every
year to marvel at one of the
seven Natural Wonders of the

40:21.386 --> 40:25.823
World, which remains unchanged
since the late 1800s, when it
first came under federal
protection.

40:25.823 --> 40:30.128
STEVE EMERICK, Hiker: This is a
pristine -- still, after all
these years, a pristine

40:30.128 --> 40:31.796
outdoors, backcountry
experience. National parks
really were America's best idea,
and

40:31.796 --> 40:34.999
this is a fine example of that.

40:34.999 --> 40:38.469
RYAN HILL: But deep in a remote
corner of the Navajo Nation in
Northern Arizona, there

40:38.469 --> 40:41.773
is a part of the canyon that few
people ever see, the Confluence,
where the Colorado and

40:41.773 --> 40:44.976
the Little Colorado Rivers meet,
a place considered sacred by the
Navajos, who have deep ties

40:44.976 --> 40:47.045
to the land.

40:47.045 --> 40:50.782
DELORES WILSON-AGUIRRE, Save the
Confluence: Two rivers, they
come together. They make

40:50.782 --> 40:54.986
life. That's where life
originated. The emergence,
that's where I people came from.

40:54.986 --> 40:58.990
RYAN HILL: The Confluence
Partners, a group of Arizona
based developers, see something

40:58.990 --> 41:04.896
else: a chance to build, make
money and bring tourists to this
secluded spot. This is

41:04.896 --> 41:06.964
an artist's rendering of the
proposed Escalade, a project
that would include hotels,
restaurants

41:06.964 --> 41:12.036
and an aerial tram that would
take tourists down the canyon to
the Confluence.

41:12.036 --> 41:22.080
The project would be constructed
here on hundreds of acres of
Navajo land on the canyon's
eastern

41:22.080 --> 41:28.052
rim and, with it, a spectacular
view. To Navajo shepherd Marie
Peyketewa and many others,

41:28.052 --> 41:29.620
the project is nothing short of
sacrilegious. She works the
land that has been in her

41:29.620 --> 41:31.689
family for generations.

41:31.689 --> 41:35.226
MARIE PEYKETEWA, Navajo
Shepherd: Look at those walls.
What's going to happen to the

41:35.226 --> 41:38.796
walls of the canyon? They're
going to destroy it. My
grandchildren's kids are not
going

41:38.796 --> 41:41.232
to see this beautiful area.

41:41.232 --> 41:44.802
RYAN HILL: The development
would consume more than land.
It also would consume water,

41:44.802 --> 41:47.905
water that would need to be
piped in for building, drinking
and sanitation. Some fear that

41:47.905 --> 41:50.608
water would come from the
Colorado River and the Grand
Canyon National Park, among
them,

41:50.608 --> 41:52.844
park superintendent
David Uberuaga.

41:52.844 --> 41:56.681
DAVID UBERUAGA, Superintendent,
Grand Canyon National Park: Two
hundred and seventy-seven

41:56.681 --> 42:02.253
miles of the Colorado River go
through Grand Canyon National
Park. It is the water source

42:02.253 --> 42:09.660
for over 30 million people.
Anything that you take away from
that, anything that detracts

42:09.660 --> 42:14.365
that, especially on a permanent
basis, is a degradation that
isn't what we can accept.

42:14.365 --> 42:17.935
RYAN HILL: Five million people
visit the Grand Canyon National
Park every year.

42:17.935 --> 42:22.206
One of them is Jill McCall, who
has been hiking the Grand Canyon
the Grand Canyon for 20 years.

42:22.206 --> 42:28.112
JILL MCCALL, Hiker: To put a
hotel and parking lots and a
tram coming down, it's -- it's

42:28.112 --> 42:30.081
an abomination.

42:30.081 --> 42:34.519
RYAN HILL: It's not only
developers and tourists who
disagree. So do those who live

42:34.519 --> 42:39.323
on tribal lands. But just miles
from the Confluence on the
weathered and impoverished

42:39.323 --> 42:41.526
Western fringes of the Navajo
Nation, Larry Hanks lives
without water, without
electricity.

42:41.526 --> 42:44.128
He supports the project.

42:44.128 --> 42:48.466
LARRY HANKS, Navajo Nation: We
want a better tomorrow for our
kids, because our kids' future

42:48.466 --> 42:50.735
is paramount to us.

42:50.735 --> 42:55.907
RYAN HILL: There are no grocery
stores or parks. Tribal
souvenir stands are as deserted

42:55.907 --> 43:19.730
as the land itself. But the
road to the Escalade project
would bring tourists right

43:19.730 --> 43:27.271
through this part of the
Navajo Reservation.

43:27.271 --> 43:35.680
At this tribal land use meeting,
talk of economic opportunity is
constant. Brian Kensley sees

43:35.680 --> 43:42.653
a tourist influx as a pivotal
moment for his people.

43:42.653 --> 43:50.228
BRIAN KENSLEY, Navajo Tribal
Member: This will give them
another choice for these
visitors

43:50.228 --> 44:02.373
coming worldwide or nationwide
to come in and have a choice to
say, OK, there's still

44:02.373 --> 44:09.780
a tribe that is living and
existing. They are not extinct.

44:09.780 --> 44:13.184
RYAN HILL: The Grand Canyon
National Park superintendent
says he's opposed, even if

44:13.184 --> 44:16.020
it is built on tribal land.

44:16.020 --> 44:19.624
DAVID UBERUAGA: The way the
tram landing is, as proposed,
lands on park lands. So

44:19.624 --> 44:24.295
it's a trespassing into
Grand Canyon National Park.

44:24.295 --> 44:34.472
RYAN HILL: And this land is
valued by everyone, those who
see it as a chance to thrive.

44:34.472 --> 44:42.813
LARRY HANKS: We're trying to
fight so we can have a little
bit slighter, higher quality

44:42.813 --> 44:48.019
of the life. My dream for my
daughter is, I want something
for her around here, because

44:48.019 --> 44:51.522
this is home to her.

44:51.522 --> 44:59.463
RYAN HILL: And those wanting to
protect it for future
generations.

44:59.463 --> 45:03.534
DELORES WILSON-AGUIRRE: When
you have a tie to the land,
especially here at our place

45:03.534 --> 45:07.238
of emergence, it's not worth
giving it up for money.

45:07.238 --> 45:10.141
MAN: My children and your
children, they wouldn't see
wilderness here in what is
really

45:10.141 --> 45:12.743
one of the most spectacular
places on earth.

45:12.743 --> 45:16.347
RYAN HILL: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm Ryan Hill in
Grand Canyon National Park.

45:16.347 --> 45:20.618
GWEN IFILL: The recently
inaugurated Navajo president,
Russell Begaye, at first signed

45:20.618 --> 45:27.158
a deal supporting the project,
but now he says he is opposed.

45:27.158 --> 45:32.163
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the
"NewsHour" online: Scientists
are trying to understand a
gigantic

45:32.163 --> 45:38.502
cloud of methane that hovers
over the Four Corners region of
the U.S. Southwest. It

45:38.502 --> 45:44.108
is believed to comprise nearly
10 percent of all methane
emissions derived from natural

45:44.108 --> 45:55.620
gas in the country, but its
origins remain a mystery. Our
data team has compiled a

45:55.620 --> 47:04.488
report, and you can find that on
our home page. That's at
PBS.org/NewsHour.

47:04.488 --> 47:44.462
GWEN IFILL: On Thursday, Miles
O'Brien kicks off a four-part
series, Cracking Ebola's Code.

47:44.462 --> 47:53.971
Hari Sreenivasan
gives us a preview.

47:53.971 --> 48:07.651
HARI SREENIVASAN: More than
26,000 dead, people still
falling sick. Miles O'Brien

48:07.651 --> 48:37.314
journeys through West Africa,
animals, disease trackers, virus
hunters looking to stop the

48:37.314 --> 48:53.697
next big outbreak, possibly with
a vaccine, fear and surprising
hope -- the next chapter

48:53.697 --> 49:00.871
in the fight against Ebola
Thursday on the "NewsHour."

49:00.871 --> 49:37.174
GWEN IFILL: And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

49:37.174 --> 49:52.756
I'm Gwen Ifill.

49:52.756 --> 50:41.772
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

50:41.772 --> 53:40.851
Join us online, and

53:40.851 --> 53:43.253
again here tomorrow evening.
For all of us here at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank you,

53:43.253 --> 53:43.620
and good night.
