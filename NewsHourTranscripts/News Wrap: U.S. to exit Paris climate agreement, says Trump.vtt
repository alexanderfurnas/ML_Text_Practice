00:02.066 --> 00:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We zero in now on
the big story of this day, the
president's decision to withdraw

00:07.466 --> 00:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from a global accord
aimed at slowing the
impact of climate change.

00:09.533 --> 00:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We explore the consequences of
all this, and how it may play
out in coming years in the

00:11.966 --> 00:13.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
United States and
around the world.

00:13.533 --> 00:16.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We begin with California
Governor Jerry
Brown, a Democrat.

00:16.066 --> 00:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His state is battling efforts
by the Trump administration
to roll back some emissions

00:20.133 --> 00:22.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
regulations.

00:22.166 --> 00:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's flying to China
tomorrow to discuss what more
can be done on climate change.

00:25.800 --> 00:28.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I spoke with him just
a short time ago.

00:28.766 --> 00:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Governor Jerry Brown,
thank you for joining us.

00:31.433 --> 00:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Your office put out a statement
a short time ago saying, this
is an insane course of action.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do you mean that?

00:38.200 --> 00:39.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

00:39.733 --> 00:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JERRY BROWN (D), California:
I certainly do mean that.

00:41.333 --> 00:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
If anything, it's understated.

00:43.300 --> 00:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Climate change is an existential
threat to all of humanity,
to the natural systems on

00:48.333 --> 00:49.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
which all life depends.

00:49.866 --> 00:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Not tomorrow, but starting very
quickly, we're seeing changes.

00:52.433 --> 00:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
California has lost 100
million trees from the drought.

00:55.533 --> 00:57.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Sea level is rising.

00:57.666 --> 01:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Antarctica is seeing ice
melting at an ever rapid rate,
some say in an irreversible

01:06.166 --> 01:07.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

01:07.366 --> 01:09.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is a profoundly
serious problem.

01:09.633 --> 01:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Paris agreement was an
agreement of nations saying
what they could do voluntarily.

01:13.633 --> 01:15.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's the commitment.

01:15.300 --> 01:19.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
President Obama made
something I thought was
doable, was reasonable.

01:21.900 --> 01:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, California is doing
that very thing now, and our
economy has grown in terms of

01:29.400 --> 01:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GDP 40 percent faster than
the nation as a whole.

01:33.733 --> 01:34.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have created over
two million jobs.

01:34.900 --> 01:35.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

01:35.900 --> 01:37.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

01:37.366 --> 01:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JERRY BROWN: So, climate
action and jobs go together.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that's why I say this move
by Trump makes no sense, and
it's going to hurt America,

01:44.633 --> 01:47.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and it's going to cost
jobs, not the reverse.

01:47.600 --> 01:52.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well,
as you know, he makes
a different argument.

01:54.633 --> 01:57.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says this -- he said, I'm
in favor of doing something to
help the environment, but he

02:00.433 --> 02:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said this accord is going to
cost millions of jobs and cost
the American people trillions

02:04.800 --> 02:05.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in lost economic output.

02:05.900 --> 02:07.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

02:07.133 --> 02:08.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JERRY BROWN: That's
just -- that's a lie.

02:08.100 --> 02:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's completely unwarranted.

02:10.100 --> 02:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, jobs are always declining
all the time, the creative
destruction of capitalism.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But jobs are being created.

02:14.866 --> 02:18.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
California has lost jobs, but,
net, we have added 2.4 million
jobs in the last eight years,

02:18.600 --> 02:20.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
since the recession.

02:20.900 --> 02:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is a remarkable
outcome, and it's consistent,
in fact, I would say
driven by the clean tech

02:24.233 --> 02:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investments and the climate
action strategies that
we have embarked upon.

02:25.500 --> 02:27.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, President Trump
is completely wrong.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's doing this for his own
base, highly ideological.

02:29.533 --> 02:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's wrong on the science.

02:30.966 --> 02:32.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's wrong on the facts.

02:32.666 --> 02:35.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

02:35.200 --> 02:37.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, he
also -- another argument he
makes, Governor, he says,
this puts restrictions

02:37.266 --> 02:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the United States, while the
United States is reducing its
emissions, while it lets other

02:40.566 --> 02:43.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
countries like China,
that continue to pollute
more and more, get away
with doing that for

02:43.700 --> 02:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
years to come with no penalties.

02:45.533 --> 02:46.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JERRY BROWN: He really
distorts the record.

02:48.200 --> 02:51.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He has a record of that,
and he's doing it again.

02:51.866 --> 02:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
China is exceeding its
commitment, and it's turning a
big machine around, to the point

02:53.400 --> 02:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where it's stopping the growth
of emissions in a few years.

02:56.233 --> 02:58.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it's the leader in
wind and solar power.

02:58.166 --> 02:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, yes, they're
building some coal pants.

02:59.166 --> 03:00.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They have to go faster.

03:00.233 --> 03:02.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're not perfect.

03:02.333 --> 03:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this is an agreement of
the willing that have said in
Paris, here's what we will do.

03:04.333 --> 03:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's reasonable, what
China is doing, reasonable,
what America is doing.

03:06.933 --> 03:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In fact, I would say both
have to do a lot more.

03:08.966 --> 03:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Trump is taking this in
the exact wrong direction,
which will cost us more money.

03:12.933 --> 03:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When the New York, the subway
is underwater, or New Orleans
or President Trump's hotel

03:16.933 --> 03:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down there in Florida are
devastated by rising sea
levels, that will cost
hundreds of billions.

03:21.466 --> 03:23.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Aggregate, over decades,
we're talking trillions.

03:23.533 --> 03:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the economics is all
to the opposite of what
President Trump is saying.

03:30.333 --> 03:31.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Governor, among
other things, as you know, the
president is talking to his

03:31.266 --> 03:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
base, people who voted for him.

03:32.766 --> 03:35.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's an indication they're
going to like what he did today.

03:35.166 --> 03:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Has your side of this argument
missed an opportunity to
explain to the American
people how protecting

03:36.433 --> 03:39.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the environment can also
be good for the economy?

03:39.100 --> 03:40.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

03:40.600 --> 03:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JERRY BROWN: Well, I don't think
that message is clear enough.

03:41.800 --> 03:42.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And certainly people
can be more articulate.

03:42.900 --> 03:44.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
California,
obviously, it's clear.

03:44.900 --> 03:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Orange County for the first
time in decades voted against
a Republican, Mr. Trump.

03:46.966 --> 03:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think part of that is our
environmental policies working,
as well as our job creation

03:49.266 --> 03:51.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
running at full speed.

03:51.300 --> 03:52.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, yes, this is a
message that has to be
made more persuasively,
more simply, and made

03:52.500 --> 03:55.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
more extensively
across the country.

03:55.100 --> 03:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You
mentioned California, and
I think you said in your
statement today California

03:57.600 --> 03:58.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can continue to cut its
own deals with other
countries, continue to move
forward with technology.

03:58.700 --> 04:00.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How does that work?

04:00.600 --> 04:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, the president
said he's willing to
renegotiate the Paris accord.

04:02.633 --> 04:04.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is that realistic at the same
time you're talking about
California and other states

04:04.100 --> 04:05.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going forward on their own?

04:05.100 --> 04:07.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

04:07.133 --> 04:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JERRY BROWN: Already,
European nations have said
Paris is not negotiable.

04:08.366 --> 04:09.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The president of France
said that and others.

04:09.300 --> 04:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's he going to renegotiate?

04:11.133 --> 04:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a modest commitment on
the part of President Obama.

04:14.633 --> 04:16.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we have to do
more, not less.

04:16.433 --> 04:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm going to China tomorrow.

04:17.533 --> 04:19.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I will meet with high officials.

04:19.600 --> 04:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will agree on standardizing
various clean technologies
that will make it possible to

04:20.766 --> 04:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
invest and produce even more.

04:22.033 --> 04:23.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're going to work,
California and China.

04:23.833 --> 04:25.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're working with New
York and Washington.

04:25.800 --> 04:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Canada and Mexico have joined
with over 170 states, provinces
and nations committed to

04:26.600 --> 04:28.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this Paris agreement.

04:28.033 --> 04:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, the world is not
waiting for Donald Trump.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has given a body blow to
the cause of environmental
sustainability, but
we will take it and we

04:32.700 --> 04:34.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
will respond.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're on the field of battle,
and we're going to overcome.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That, I can promise you.

04:38.400 --> 04:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Governor
Jerry Brown of California,
thank you very much.

04:38.933 --> 04:39.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

04:39.733 --> 04:41.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JERRY BROWN: Thank you.

04:41.866 --> 04:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now for an
opposing view, we turn to
Senator Mike Lee of Utah.

04:43.933 --> 04:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was one of 22 Republican
senators who signed a letter to
President Trump last week urging

04:45.200 --> 04:46.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
him to withdraw from
the Paris agreement.

04:46.400 --> 04:48.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Senator Lee, welcome
to the program.

04:48.933 --> 04:49.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I believe you just heard
the response of California
Governor Jerry Brown,
who argues this is a

04:49.866 --> 04:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fundamentally wrong decision.

04:51.533 --> 04:52.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He said it's going to
set back the cause of
fighting climate change.

04:52.066 --> 04:53.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:53.266 --> 04:55.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MIKE LEE (R), Utah:
Yes, I think he's wrong.

04:55.233 --> 04:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think I disagree with
every word, every syllable he
uttered, including the words but

04:55.766 --> 04:56.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
and the.

04:56.700 --> 04:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Look, this was a right decision.

04:57.633 --> 05:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This was the right thing to do.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When President Obama
entered into this agreement
a couple years ago,
he didn't submit it to

05:01.600 --> 05:03.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the United States Senate for
ratification as a treaty.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He didn't do that because he
knew there was absolutely no
way he could get the two-thirds

05:05.666 --> 05:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supermajority vote necessary
in order to get this ratified,
in order to make it the law

05:06.900 --> 05:07.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the land as a
governing treaty.

05:07.700 --> 05:10.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He didn't do that.

05:10.266 --> 05:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, consequently, it
was entirely foreseeable
that when a different
president from a different

05:12.233 --> 05:14.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
party with a different
point of view came along, he
wouldn't move forward with it.

05:14.266 --> 05:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump did that
today because he decided this
wasn't in the interest of the

05:15.200 --> 05:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
United States of America.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He did the right thing.

05:18.033 --> 05:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, one
of the arguments that we heard
Governor Brown and others making

05:20.100 --> 05:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today is that President Trump
and those who are pushing this
decision today don't understand

05:22.133 --> 05:24.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the way the climate and jobs,
the economy interact, that,
in fact, when you do less

05:24.166 --> 05:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to fight climate change, as this
-- as what the president, in
effect, is doing, he's missing

05:26.133 --> 05:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a chance for the United States
to move ahead with clean
energy technology, so, in other

05:28.200 --> 05:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
words, that what he's done
is going to cost jobs,
rather than increase them.

05:28.733 --> 05:30.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MIKE LEE: You know, I
would flip it on them.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would point out, quite to
the contrary, what has brought
down emissions both from

05:34.066 --> 05:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stationary sources like power
plants and from mobile sources
like automobiles is innovation,

05:36.133 --> 05:38.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
improvements in technology
that have occurred as a result
of free market forces, and in

05:38.066 --> 05:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the absence, I would add, of
anything like a treaty comparing
to the Paris agreement.

05:39.966 --> 05:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this has happened
through innovation,
through free market forces.

05:41.900 --> 05:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think quite the opposite
of what Governor Brown was
saying, that when the government

05:43.133 --> 05:44.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gets involved, it tends
to squelch innovation.

05:44.633 --> 05:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that innovation is needed
for us to control emissions.

05:46.666 --> 05:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me quote
something that your predecessor,
the former EPA administrator,

05:48.700 --> 05:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gina -- not your predecessor
-- I'm sorry - - the former EPA
administrator, Gina McCarthy,

05:49.366 --> 05:51.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
said today.

05:51.033 --> 05:52.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She said: "This is an
embarrassing day for
the United States."

05:52.266 --> 05:54.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She went on to say:
"Make no mistake.

05:54.300 --> 05:56.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because of this reckless
decision, our businesses will
lose investment opportunities.

05:56.866 --> 05:58.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will cede technology
breakthroughs to countries
that will take over our
leadership role, and

05:58.866 --> 05:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the rest of the world
will question whether
the U.S. can be trusted."

05:59.400 --> 06:00.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:00.700 --> 06:02.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MIKE LEE: Yes, that's
pretty apocalyptic.

06:02.333 --> 06:04.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I think that's
apocalyptic to the point
of straining credulity.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But, look, these are
smart people, but they
are not omniscient.

06:05.933 --> 06:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think their prophesies
of doom and gloom are
entirely unwarranted.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, in fact, I think
they're inappropriate.

06:09.300 --> 06:10.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, we have to get back to
the fact that this power, the
power to enter into binding

06:10.800 --> 06:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
international agreements,
this is a shared power.

06:13.333 --> 06:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is something that
was decided, should be
a shared power, at the
Constitutional Convention

06:14.133 --> 06:16.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some 230 years ago.

06:16.166 --> 06:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As I explain in my new book
that came out this week called
"Written Out Of History,"

06:18.200 --> 06:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these powers that are vested
in the federal government
have to be clearly enumerated.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They have to be limited.

06:21.066 --> 06:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we can't give excessive,
unfettered power to a president
to act alone, to bind an entire

06:23.533 --> 06:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country to a set of
principles, a set of
rules that the president,
him or herself, makes.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what we would be allowing
presidents to do if we said
any time a president, like

06:27.500 --> 06:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama, wants to
subject an entire country to a
new set of rules, that president

06:29.933 --> 06:31.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can do so without submitting
that international
agreement to the Senate
for treaty ratification.

06:31.966 --> 06:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Senator,
maybe this is alone those lines,
but I'm now reading comments

06:33.866 --> 06:36.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even from some Republicans
who have a problem
with this decision.

06:36.366 --> 06:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A Republican congressman
from Florida, Carlos
Curbelo, was interviewed,
I heard, just within

06:37.033 --> 06:37.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the hour.

06:37.966 --> 06:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He is saying this is a mistake.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said: I'm already seeing
the impact of climate change
on my part of the state.

06:41.533 --> 06:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we need to move forward
with technology to address it.

06:43.933 --> 06:44.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I want to quickly
quote the former Republican
Treasury Secretary
Henry Paulson, who said

06:44.866 --> 06:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he's dismayed and disappointed.

06:46.933 --> 06:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said: "By moving ourselves
to the sidelines of an evolving
global conversation," he said,

06:48.200 --> 06:50.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
"we have left a void
for others to fill.

06:50.233 --> 06:50.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Regrettably, this undermines
U.S. credibility, weakens our
ability to lead in other areas."

06:50.766 --> 06:52.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MIKE LEE: Yes, look,
I completely disagree.

06:53.966 --> 06:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fact that you can point to
some people who call themselves
Republicans who disagree

06:55.433 --> 06:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with this decision doesn't
change this analysis.

06:57.533 --> 06:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I notice there wasn't
a corresponding pushback to
the person who preceded me.

06:59.033 --> 07:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You didn't push back like
this to Governor Brown.

07:01.100 --> 07:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I understand that you might
disagree personally with
what the president did today.

07:02.233 --> 07:02.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
Senator -- Senator...

07:02.766 --> 07:04.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

07:04.233 --> 07:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE LEE: But that doesn't
make it -- I'm sorry.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I would like to
answer your question.

07:06.633 --> 07:07.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That doesn't mean
that this was wrong.

07:07.566 --> 07:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This was the right thing to do.

07:09.033 --> 07:09.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president put people
before this Paris agreement.

07:09.966 --> 07:10.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He put Pittsburgh before Paris.

07:10.766 --> 07:12.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He did the right thing.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, just
to set the record straight, I
quoted President Trump several

07:15.000 --> 07:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
times back to Governor Brown in
my interview with him, just as I
have quoted some who criticized

07:16.500 --> 07:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the president's decision
in my interview with you.

07:17.433 --> 07:17.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Finally, Senator, let me...

07:17.966 --> 07:18.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

07:18.633 --> 07:19.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MIKE LEE: Yes.

07:19.433 --> 07:21.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But I want to be clear.

07:21.533 --> 07:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The reason I made that point
is, you didn't try to identify
some Democrats who might have

07:22.200 --> 07:23.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
supported this.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You quoted the
president himself.

07:25.400 --> 07:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what I'm saying is, you
are pushing back on me in a way
you didn't push back on him.

07:26.066 --> 07:27.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's fine.

07:27.300 --> 07:29.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's your right to
do that as a reporter.

07:29.833 --> 07:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me
finally ask you, Senator,
the president said he's
open to renegotiation.

07:31.866 --> 07:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're already hearing from
European officials that it's --
that this is an accord not open

07:32.666 --> 07:34.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for renegotiation.

07:34.100 --> 07:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, how do you foresee moving
ahead in that direction?

07:34.633 --> 07:37.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

07:37.100 --> 07:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE LEE: Well, if
they're saying this is not
open for renegotiation,
and this negotiation

07:39.700 --> 07:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was itself something that
couldn't get through the
United States Senate,
and that's why President

07:41.733 --> 07:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama never submitted it to the
Senate for treaty ratification,
then we're at an impasse,

07:42.533 --> 07:44.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and we will proceed.

07:44.633 --> 07:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will proceed, by the way, I
should add, as a global leader
in environmental regulation.

07:45.866 --> 07:48.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We are a global leader
in the rule of law.

07:48.466 --> 07:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have brought down
emissions in this country
through our legal system
and through technological

07:49.133 --> 07:50.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
innovation.

07:50.066 --> 07:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We can do this on our own.

07:52.133 --> 07:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't have to have the
permission of countries all
over the world to do that.

07:53.066 --> 07:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have done it pretty well.

07:55.166 --> 07:57.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have done it much better
than a lot of our would-be
partners in this agreement.

07:57.266 --> 07:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Mike
Lee of Utah, thank you very
much for talking with us.

07:57.800 --> 07:58.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

07:58.600 --> 07:58.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MIKE LEE: Thank you.
