JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.706 --> 00:06.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.707 --> 00:08.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.575 --> 00:10.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
We will be doing something very
rapidly having

00:10.911 --> 00:13.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to do with the security of our
country.

00:13.513 --> 00:18.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Blocked by the
courts, President
Trump considers next steps for
his controversial

00:18.852 --> 00:20.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
immigration policy.

00:20.387 --> 00:23.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then: taking on U.S.-Asian
relations.

00:23.757 --> 00:28.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president welcomes Japan's
prime minister
to the White House, while
dodging a potential

00:28.862 --> 00:30.864 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
rift with China.

00:30.898 --> 00:32.132 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it's Friday.

00:32.165 --> 00:35.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks
take on the
week's news.

00:35.502 --> 00:41.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus: From his beginnings in
Motown, to receiving
the prestigious Gershwin Award,
hit-maker

00:41.775 --> 00:46.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Smokey Robinson sits down with
Jeffrey Brown
to talk about a lifetime of
music.

00:46.580 --> 00:52.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SMOKEY ROBINSON, Musician: We
were not just
some artists who recorded for
the same label.

00:52.219 --> 00:53.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We were actually friends.

00:53.687 --> 00:54.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We were like brothers and
sisters.

00:54.821 --> 00:56.189 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We hung out.

00:56.223 --> 00:59.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have what we call the Motown
family, and
we have always had that.

00:59.993 --> 01:07.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:07.935 --> 01:10.771 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:10.804 --> 01:20.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
now says that
he may sign, in his words, a
brand-new order

01:20.514 --> 01:24.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on immigration as early as
Monday or Tuesday.

01:24.217 --> 01:29.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he also says he still
figures to win the
court battle over his initial
attempt to bar

01:29.890 --> 01:33.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
travelers from seven mostly
Muslim nations.

01:33.060 --> 01:38.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The federal court of appeals in
the Ninth
Circuit upheld a freeze on that
ban in a Thursday

01:38.632 --> 01:40.434 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ruling.

01:40.467 --> 01:44.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Yang reports that all of
this unfolded
as the prime minister of Japan
visited the

01:44.371 --> 01:46.306 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
White House.

01:46.340 --> 01:51.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: President Trump made
clear today
he's ready for the court fight
about his immigration

01:51.645 --> 01:54.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
order to be over, but he's not
waiting for
the final ruling.

01:54.815 --> 01:58.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
It shouldn't have taken this
much time, because

01:58.485 --> 02:01.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
safety is a primary reason.

02:01.254 --> 02:04.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the reasons I'm standing
here today
is the security of our country.

02:04.791 --> 02:09.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we will be doing something
very rapidly,
having to do with additional
security for

02:09.629 --> 02:10.597 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our country.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You will be seeing that some
time next week.

02:12.632 --> 02:17.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition, we will continue to
go through
the court process, and
ultimately I have no

02:17.404 --> 02:19.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doubt that we will win that
particular case.

02:19.539 --> 02:24.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Trump gave no
details of just
what that additional security
will be, but

02:24.444 --> 02:28.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said the dangers are clear,
though he wouldn't
give specifics about them
either.

02:28.915 --> 02:33.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: While I have been
president,
which is just for a very short
period of time,

02:33.387 --> 02:37.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have learned tremendous things
that you
could only learn, frankly, if
you were in

02:37.691 --> 02:41.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a certain position, namely
president.

02:41.228 --> 02:44.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there are tremendous threats
to our country.

02:44.765 --> 02:47.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will not allow that to
happen, I can tell
you that right now.

02:47.567 --> 02:49.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will not allow that to
happen.

02:49.436 --> 02:53.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: This morning, the
president took
to Twitter to call the appeals
court decision

02:53.373 --> 02:56.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not to reinstate his travel ban
disgraceful.

02:56.243 --> 03:02.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Three judges, two of them
nominated by Democrats,
one by a Republican, upheld a
restraining

03:02.482 --> 03:07.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
order put in place by a federal
judge in Seattle
one week ago today.

03:07.654 --> 03:13.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The appeals court said the
government didn't
provide adequate due process to
affected travelers,

03:13.093 --> 03:17.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and provided no evidence that
anyone from
the seven countries in the order
has been

03:17.297 --> 03:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
responsible for U.S. terror
attacks.

03:20.133 --> 03:25.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The judges also concluded the
administration
is unlikely to prevail in a
trial on the merits

03:25.372 --> 03:27.174 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the case.

03:27.207 --> 03:31.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Within minutes of the decision,
the president
told reporters it was political
and tweeted,

03:31.278 --> 03:33.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
"See you in court."

03:33.480 --> 03:36.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Washington state's attorney
general, who filed
the suit, said, bring it on.

03:36.983 --> 03:39.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB FERGUSON, Washington State
Attorney General:
We have seen the president in
court twice.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we're two for two.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's number one.

03:43.190 --> 03:48.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in my view, the future of
the Constitution
is at stake.

03:48.095 --> 03:52.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Senate Minority
Leader Chuck Schumer
tweeted that the president
should see the

03:52.099 --> 03:54.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
writing on the wall and abandon
the order.

03:54.935 --> 04:00.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton tweeted simply
"3-0," a reference
to the unanimous decision.

04:00.173 --> 04:04.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraqi Prime Minister Haider
al-Abadi said
he asked Mr. Trump in a phone
call to lift

04:04.978 --> 04:07.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the travel ban for Iraqis.

04:07.347 --> 04:11.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some have worked as translators
for the U.S.
military and their lives might
be in danger

04:11.551 --> 04:13.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
if they stay in Iraq.

04:13.353 --> 04:19.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For now, with the ban on hold,
refugees and
others from all of the seven
affected nations

04:19.693 --> 04:22.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are free to enter the United
States.

04:22.195 --> 04:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in addition to the appeals
court ruling,
the administration faces dozens
of other legal

04:27.033 --> 04:29.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
challenges from around the
country.

04:29.569 --> 04:32.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang at the
White House.

04:32.739 --> 04:36.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Late today, there
was word
that the Trump administration
may be leaning

04:36.843 --> 04:41.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
against appealing the
restraining order to
the U.S. Supreme Court.

04:41.281 --> 04:46.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the White House chief of
staff said that
it may still be possible.

04:46.153 --> 04:50.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: Ohio
Governor John
Kasich delayed eight executions
in the face

04:51.024 --> 04:54.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a court fight over the
state's lethal injection
process.

04:54.494 --> 04:59.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A federal judge found that
process unconstitutional,
but the state is appealing.

04:59.432 --> 05:04.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The governor's decision pushes
back the executions
to May, or later.

05:04.571 --> 05:09.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From Syria's President Bashar
al-Assad, an
apparent gesture to President
Trump.

05:09.442 --> 05:15.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has told Yahoo News the U.S.
is welcome
to send troops to Syria to
battle those that

05:15.515 --> 05:17.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he called terrorists.

05:17.417 --> 05:22.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But he also said in the
interview that his
permission is contingent on
Washington respecting

05:22.422 --> 05:24.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his government's sovereignty.

05:24.291 --> 05:27.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BASHAR AL-ASSAD, President of
Syria: If you
want to start genuinely as the
United States,

05:27.827 --> 05:31.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to do so, it must be through the
Syrian government.

05:31.731 --> 05:36.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are here, we are the Syrians,
we own this
country as Syrians, nobody else.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nobody would understand it like
us.

05:38.371 --> 05:44.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So you cannot defeat the
terrorism without
cooperation with the people and
the government

05:44.644 --> 05:46.646 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of any country.

05:46.680 --> 05:51.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Assad said he
shares the priority
that President Trump places on
fighting terrorism,

05:51.685 --> 05:57.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but he rejected the idea of
establishing safe
zones for refugees inside Syria.

05:57.490 --> 06:04.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Australia, temperatures
soared to 117 degrees
in and around Sydney today, as
an extreme

06:04.397 --> 06:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
heat wave grips the country.

06:06.566 --> 06:11.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Major industrial energy users
shut down in
order to help prevent blackouts.

06:11.271 --> 06:15.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Beaches were packed with people
looking for
relief, while zoo animals cooled
off with

06:15.775 --> 06:18.245 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a hose-down and frozen treats.

06:18.278 --> 06:25.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Forecasters expect Saturday
could be the hottest
February day ever recorded in
Australia.

06:25.252 --> 06:29.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, Education
Secretary
Betsy DeVos faced protesters in
her first

06:29.789 --> 06:34.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
visit to a public school since a
bruising
confirmation fight.

06:34.060 --> 06:38.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Several dozen people tried to
block her from
entering a school in Washington.

06:38.098 --> 06:43.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She said later that she respects
peaceful
protest, but -- quote -- "will
not be deterred"

06:44.004 --> 06:45.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from doing her job.

06:45.472 --> 06:50.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DeVos has drawn fire for her
support of alternatives
to public schools.

06:50.076 --> 06:53.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wall Street finished this Friday
on a high
note.

06:53.313 --> 06:58.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mining and energy stocks led the
way, as prices
for oil and copper jumped.

06:58.418 --> 07:04.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained nearly
97 points to close at 20269.

The Nasdaq rose almost 19, and
the S&amp;P 500
added eight.

07:09.095 --> 07:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the week, all three indexes
gained about
1 percent.

07:13.099 --> 07:18.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
President
Trump shifts his approach to
China; new revelations

07:18.805 --> 07:24.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in National Security Adviser
Michael Flynn's
relationship with Russia;
changes the newly

07:24.678 --> 07:34.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
confirmed health secretary could
make immediately;
and much more.

07:34.721 --> 07:41.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
confirmed health secretary could
make immediately;
and much more.

07:41.294 --> 07:45.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we mentioned earlier, the
prime minister
of Japan was at the White House
today, the

07:45.432 --> 07:48.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
beginning of several days of
talks with the
president.

07:48.535 --> 07:54.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The visit comes amid growing
concerns in Asia
over trade, over North Korea's
missile and

07:54.607 --> 07:58.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nuclear programs, and over China
flexing its
military muscle.

07:58.678 --> 08:04.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
The bond between our two nations
and the friendship

08:04.551 --> 08:07.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
between our two peoples runs
very, very deep.

08:07.821 --> 08:12.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The two leaders
presented a
united front, despite
differences that have

08:12.959 --> 08:16.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
emerged in the early days of the
Trump presidency.

08:16.529 --> 08:22.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had
pushed hard
for the 12-nation Trans-Pacific
Partnership,

08:22.335 --> 08:25.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
but President Trump has
officially abandoned
it.

08:25.472 --> 08:32.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: On the economy, we
will seek
a trading relationship that is
free, fair,

08:32.178 --> 08:35.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and reciprocal, benefiting both
of our countries.

08:35.882 --> 08:40.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHINZO ABE, Japanese Prime
Minister (through
translator): I am quite
optimistic that good

08:40.854 --> 08:43.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
results will be seen from the
dialogue.

08:43.323 --> 08:47.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now the free and fair common set
of rules
will be created for free trade
in the region.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.529 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That was the purpose of TPP.

08:49.562 --> 08:51.264 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That importance has not changed.

08:51.297 --> 08:53.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I, myself, believe that.

08:53.133 --> 08:59.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Abe also talked
up Japanese
industry's contributions to the
U.S. economy,

08:59.172 --> 09:06.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after Mr. Trump blasted Toyota
last month
for planning a new plant in
Mexico.

09:06.312 --> 09:08.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Defense is another potential
flash point.

09:08.848 --> 09:14.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During the campaign, candidate
Trump suggested
Japan and South Korea could pay
more for their

09:14.821 --> 09:18.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
own defense, up to and including
nuclear weapons.

09:18.525 --> 09:19.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: North Korea has
nukes.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.761 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Japan has a problem with that.

09:21.795 --> 09:23.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, they have a big problem
with that.

09:23.563 --> 09:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe they would in fact be
better off if
they defend themselves from
North Korea.

09:27.033 --> 09:28.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUESTION: With nukes?

09:28.401 --> 09:31.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Including with
nukes, yes, including
with nukes.

09:31.471 --> 09:34.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Today, however,
the president
appeared to step back.

09:34.474 --> 09:40.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: It is important
that both Japan
and the United States continue
to invest very

09:40.280 --> 09:43.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
heavily in the alliance to build
up our defense.

09:43.817 --> 09:50.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Some 50,000 U.S.
troops are
stationed in Japan, the largest
American outpost

09:50.390 --> 09:52.025 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in Asia.

09:52.058 --> 09:57.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, Secretary of Defense
James Mattis
made Asia his first overseas
visit.

09:57.897 --> 10:03.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Japan, he reassured Abe that
the U.S. will
maintain its presence there.

10:03.803 --> 10:09.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. military also serves as
the main
counterweight to China's
increasing aggressiveness

10:09.876 --> 10:11.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the South China Sea.

10:11.744 --> 10:15.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, Abe said that must
continue.

10:15.248 --> 10:19.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHINZO ABE (through translator):
We need to
maintain the freedom of
navigation and rule

10:19.819 --> 10:20.887 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of law.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Such international order there
must be maintained.

10:23.356 --> 10:29.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hours earlier,
President Trump
spoke by phone for the first
time with China's

10:29.128 --> 10:31.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
President Xi Jinping.

10:31.698 --> 10:38.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During the call, Trump retreated
from earlier
talk of disregarding the one
China policy,

10:38.438 --> 10:41.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which officially treats Taiwan
as part of
China.

10:41.808 --> 10:46.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: It was a very,
very warm conversation.

10:46.479 --> 10:53.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we are on the process of
getting along
very well, and I think that will
also be very

10:53.920 --> 10:55.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
much of a benefit to Japan.

10:55.889 --> 10:59.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Abe didn't
comment on the Trump-Xi
phone call.

11:00.026 --> 11:05.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later, the leaders flew to the
president's
Mar-a-Lago club in Florida,
where they will

11:05.465 --> 11:08.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
spend the weekend and play golf.

11:08.668 --> 11:13.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We take a closer look now at the
United States'
relationship with Asia under the
Trump presidency

11:13.907 --> 11:15.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with Evan Medeiros.

11:15.742 --> 11:19.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He served as senior director for
Asian affairs
on the National Security Council
staff during

11:19.913 --> 11:20.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Obama administration.

11:20.914 --> 11:24.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is now a managing director at
Eurasia Group.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a business consulting
company.

11:26.185 --> 11:27.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Evan Medeiros, welcome back to
the program.

11:27.921 --> 11:28.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EVAN MEDEIROS, Eurasia Group:
Thanks.

11:28.922 --> 11:29.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Great to be here.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, let's start
with China.

11:31.758 --> 11:38.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president telling President
Xi Jinping,
at President Xi's request, that
the U.S. does

11:38.531 --> 11:43.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go along now with the -- want
the continue
the one China policy.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why is that so important to the
Chinese?

11:44.971 --> 11:49.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVAN MEDEIROS: Well, it's
important because
the one China policy is at the
heart of the

11:49.042 --> 11:50.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
U.S.-China relationship.

11:50.843 --> 11:56.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the issue that Kissinger
first negotiated
with Zhou Enlai about in the
early 1970s.

11:56.482 --> 12:02.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It goes to the status of Taiwan
and the U.S.
position that it acknowledges
China's view

12:02.722 --> 12:04.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that Taiwan is part of China.

12:05.024 --> 12:08.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's sort of a foundational
leg of the
U.S.-China relationship.

12:08.895 --> 12:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And absent recognition of the
one China policy,
it would have been very
difficult, if not

12:14.233 --> 12:18.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
impossible, for Xi Jinping or
any Chinese
leader to do anything else in
the U.S.-China

12:18.871 --> 12:20.640 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
relationship.

12:20.673 --> 12:24.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How much of a
concern was it
to the Chinese that President
Trump state

12:24.444 --> 12:30.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this, given what he had said
during the campaign,
a lot of anti-China language,
rhetoric coming

12:30.283 --> 12:36.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from candidate Donald Trump,
then that phone
call that he had early on after
the election

12:36.155 --> 12:38.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with the president of Taiwan?

12:38.424 --> 12:40.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
How worried were -- how
concerned were the
Chinese?

12:40.193 --> 12:43.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EVAN MEDEIROS: Well, the Chinese
were very
concerned.

12:43.229 --> 12:49.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Recognizing, acknowledging the
one China policy
was essential for Xi Jinping.

12:49.802 --> 12:55.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was the primary concern of
the Chinese
leadership, and they didn't want
to talk about

12:55.141 --> 12:59.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
anything else, trade and
investment, North
Korea, the South China Sea,
until the Trump

12:59.379 --> 13:01.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
administration reaffirmed the
one China policy.

13:01.948 --> 13:07.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in many ways, the phone call
last night
removed the source of an
immediate crisis

13:07.520 --> 13:08.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the relationship.

13:09.022 --> 13:12.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now they can move on to
talking about
and working on other issues.

13:12.291 --> 13:16.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And one of those
issues, of
course, is China's increasingly
aggressive

13:16.229 --> 13:22.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stance -- we referred to in the
report just
now -- in that region,
especially the South

13:22.035 --> 13:23.903 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
China Sea.

13:23.936 --> 13:27.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Other countries in the region,
and Japan,
which I'm going to ask you about
in just a

13:27.206 --> 13:31.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
moment, have been increasingly
concerned about
what they're seeing China do.

13:31.678 --> 13:37.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is also concern about
whether China's
role if the North Koreans should
try to do

13:37.083 --> 13:40.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something else in a nuclear
direction.

13:40.086 --> 13:45.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, how worried should the U.S.
and other
countries in the region be about
China?

13:45.658 --> 13:49.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVAN MEDEIROS: Well, we should
be worried
because the Chinese have been
increasingly

13:49.162 --> 13:51.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
active in the maritime area.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have been more assertive in
the economic
area.

13:53.933 --> 13:55.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have been nationalists and
mercantilists.

13:55.735 --> 14:00.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there is a variety of
Chinese behaviors
that we should be concerned
about.

14:00.640 --> 14:05.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the question for the Trump
administration
is, what are the policies that
they're going

14:05.044 --> 14:07.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to adopt to address these
challenges?

14:07.513 --> 14:12.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're not new challenges for
the United
States, but they are very
difficult to figure

14:12.585 --> 14:17.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
out how to shape China's
behavior, because
China's a big economy, its
leverage and influence

14:17.657 --> 14:19.425 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is growing.

14:19.459 --> 14:24.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need Chinese cooperation, but
that certainly
shouldn't be a barrier to
pushing them on

14:24.197 --> 14:29.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
areas where we think they need
to change their
behavior and recognize U.S.
interests.

14:29.268 --> 14:31.504 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, let's
turn to Japan.

14:31.537 --> 14:35.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, the president met
today with the
Japanese prime minister.

14:35.975 --> 14:42.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're going to be spending the
weekend at
President Trump's place in South
Florida.

14:42.648 --> 14:46.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How would you describe, Evan
Medeiros, the
state of U.S.-Japanese relations
right now?

14:46.686 --> 14:51.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVAN MEDEIROS: Well, the state
of U.S.-Japanese
relations right now is great,
because Trump

14:51.491 --> 14:58.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is giving Abe a very robust, you
could say
even lavish, visit to the United
States so

14:58.264 --> 15:03.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
early on in Trump's foreign
policy evolution.

15:03.302 --> 15:08.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, he's essentially putting
Japan at
the center of his Asia policy
and putting

15:08.674 --> 15:10.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
alliances at the center of his
Asia policy.

15:10.710 --> 15:16.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's doing it in such a
robust way, I
mean, not just the Oval Office
meeting, the

15:16.916 --> 15:19.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lunch, but this weekend in
Florida.

15:19.285 --> 15:23.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's normally something that
you would do
after several years of
developing a relationship

15:23.756 --> 15:28.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
after another leader has
demonstrated their
willingness to work with you,
bring economic

15:28.594 --> 15:29.562 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
deliverables.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, this is a big deal.

15:31.430 --> 15:35.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it also comes
after President
Trump has pulled out of the
Trans-Pacific

15:35.935 --> 15:37.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
trade deal, the TPP.

15:37.703 --> 15:43.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is something the Japanese,
that Prime
Minister Abe had put a lot of
effort into.

15:43.075 --> 15:45.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, how much of a complication
is that going
to be?

15:45.511 --> 15:47.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
EVAN MEDEIROS: It's a
complication.

15:47.246 --> 15:52.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Prime Minister Abe and
many Asian
leaders are concerned about the
withdrawal

15:52.151 --> 15:54.253 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from TPP.

15:54.287 --> 16:00.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're concerned about Trump's
support for
protectionism and the impact
that might have

16:00.459 --> 16:03.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on a lot of export-dependent
economies.

16:03.629 --> 16:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're worried about Trump's
broader approach
to Asia.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How engaged is he going to be in
Asia?

16:08.601 --> 16:10.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is ISIS going to get the
priority?

16:10.736 --> 16:16.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the engagement with Japan
early on addresses
some of those issues, but not
all of them.

16:16.509 --> 16:20.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, of course, the big
issue on the
table is whether or not Abe and
Trump are

16:20.880 --> 16:25.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to agree to eventually
negotiate a bilateral
free trade agreement.

16:25.351 --> 16:27.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what Trump says is going
to replace
TPP.

16:27.553 --> 16:31.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And is that
something the Japanese
are likely to find to their
liking?

16:31.924 --> 16:33.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EVAN MEDEIROS: I think it is
going to be hard.

16:33.893 --> 16:37.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. and Japan have tried
this in the
past, and it hasn't worked.

16:37.964 --> 16:45.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think now it's too politically
sensitive
for Abe, since he just got his
legislature

16:45.805 --> 16:48.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to ratify TPP last fall.

16:48.107 --> 16:53.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's probably too early for him
to initiate
bilateral negotiations now, but
I could see

16:53.679 --> 16:56.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a year or so willing to go
down that road.

16:56.649 --> 17:01.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the challenge is, is that a
series of
bilateral trade agreements
doesn't replace

17:01.220 --> 17:05.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the region-wide effect and the
positive strategic
effect of TPP.

17:06.025 --> 17:11.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's sort of because TPP was
meant to change
the rules of the game,
potentially influence

17:11.530 --> 17:12.632 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
China as well.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now it's not
happening.

17:14.166 --> 17:15.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EVAN MEDEIROS: And now it's not,
that's right.

17:15.234 --> 17:17.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Not from the U.S.
standpoint.

17:17.169 --> 17:22.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, there is so much more to
talk about,
big, big part of the world,
huge, hugely important

17:22.875 --> 17:23.843 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
relationship.

17:23.876 --> 17:24.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Evan Medeiros, thank you very
much.

17:24.877 --> 17:25.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EVAN MEDEIROS: Thank you very
much.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Great to be here.

17:28.247 --> 17:42.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: new
revelations about
contacts between a top aide to
President Trump

17:42.395 --> 17:45.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Russia during the transition
between administrations.

17:45.665 --> 17:49.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Earlier this evening, Hari
Sreenivasan recorded
this conversation.

17:49.502 --> 17:53.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Just after
Christmas, the
Obama administration levied new
sanctions

17:54.006 --> 17:58.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against Russia for its alleged
role in meddling
with the 2016 election.

17:58.911 --> 18:03.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the days surrounding that
move, Michael
Flynn, the incoming Trump White
House's national

18:03.683 --> 18:09.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
security adviser, spoke several
times by phone
with Russia's ambassador to the
U.S.

18:09.221 --> 18:14.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trump team claimed, after
this was first
reported in January, that Flynn
was trying

18:14.126 --> 18:18.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to arrange a phone call between
Mr. Trump
and Russian President Putin.

18:18.197 --> 18:22.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now The Washington Post reports
there may
have been other motives for the
calls.

18:22.268 --> 18:27.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on all of this, we turn
to Greg Miller,
national security reporter at
The Post.

18:27.173 --> 18:29.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, first of all, what was said
in these calls?

18:29.375 --> 18:32.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG MILLER, National Security
Correspondent,
The Washington Post: So, we know
now that

18:32.044 --> 18:35.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these calls covered the subject
of sanctions.

18:35.281 --> 18:40.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have multiple sources telling
us that Flynn
actually conveyed a signal to
the Russian

18:40.386 --> 18:48.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ambassador that the sanctions
that the Obama
administration was imposing,
that the Russian

18:48.327 --> 18:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government shouldn't overreact
to them, didn't
need to worry about them, that
there would

18:53.599 --> 18:56.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be time soon when they would be
able to revisit
these policies.

18:56.769 --> 18:59.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, you have
nine different
sources in your story.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do we know this is what took
place on
those phone calls?

19:02.808 --> 19:07.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG MILLER: Well, these are
phone calls which
involved the Russian ambassador
to the United

19:07.580 --> 19:09.348 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

19:09.382 --> 19:13.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. intelligence agencies
monitor a lot of
the communications of Russian
officials who

19:13.753 --> 19:16.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are here in Washington and in
New York.

19:16.288 --> 19:20.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So these are calls that were all
picked up,
collected.

19:20.559 --> 19:22.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are transcripts of these
calls.

19:22.094 --> 19:25.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were recorded, and there
are intelligence
reports on these calls.

19:25.831 --> 19:30.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But the White
House has
said repeatedly that this is not
what took

19:30.403 --> 19:32.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
place, that sanctions were not
discussed.

19:32.938 --> 19:38.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The vice president even went out
on TV and
said that, per his conversations
with Mr.

19:38.577 --> 19:39.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Flynn, that this wasn't
discussed.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.680 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREG MILLER: That's right.

19:41.714 --> 19:45.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you had several senior White
House officials,
starting with Vice President
Pence, who went

19:45.718 --> 19:51.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out on a very big limb for Mike
Flynn on this,
and that limb has been cut off
now.

19:51.390 --> 19:56.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They insisted categorically that
the subject
of sanctions had not been raised
in these

19:56.462 --> 19:58.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conversations, and that's not
the case.

19:58.364 --> 20:02.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But let's
assume for a second
Mike Flynn doesn't know that
this phone call

20:03.002 --> 20:07.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is being listened to by anybody
else than
the person he's talking to.

20:07.039 --> 20:10.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there anything illegal that
he did in the
phone call itself?

20:10.776 --> 20:14.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREG MILLER: Yes, possibly.

20:14.213 --> 20:20.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The difficulty here is that the
statute that
applies in these cases dates to
1799 and,

20:20.553 --> 20:23.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in over 200 years, has never
been prosecuted.

20:23.989 --> 20:29.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's something that the FBI just
doesn't really
want to investigate or
prosecute.

20:29.628 --> 20:33.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nevertheless, that statute
exists.

20:33.099 --> 20:38.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it bans unauthorized U.S.
citizens from
negotiating with foreign
governments when

20:38.804 --> 20:44.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're not in power, when
they're not yet
in a position to do so in the
United States.

20:44.276 --> 20:48.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And every indication to us is
that Flynn did
just that in this conversation.

20:48.881 --> 20:52.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is that the
reason that
Vladimir Putin didn't retaliate
once those

20:52.918 --> 20:54.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sanctions came out?

20:54.153 --> 20:56.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It seemed that there was about a
24-hour gap
or so there.

20:56.555 --> 21:02.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG MILLER: Yes, I mean, that
was this huge
source of concern and surprise
and mystery.

21:02.394 --> 21:09.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, in the history of
U.S.-Russia relationships,
there have been lots of
retaliatory measures,

21:09.168 --> 21:14.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
diplomatic sanctions, economic
sanctions,
expulsions of spies and so
forth.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's almost always reciprocal.

21:16.008 --> 21:19.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But in this case, Putin
surprised everybody
by saying, you know what, we're
not going

21:19.445 --> 21:23.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do anything this time, we're
not going
to respond, we're just going to
wait and see

21:23.149 --> 21:24.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
how this plays out.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that led to a lot of
suspicion in the
government.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Was there a signal sent?

21:28.888 --> 21:33.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That led to further
investigation and scrutiny
of these calls between Flynn and
the ambassador.

21:33.826 --> 21:39.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: If now
Congress or anyone
decides to take actions against
Mike Flynn,

21:39.265 --> 21:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is there the possibility of a
chilling effect?

21:41.367 --> 21:43.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Diplomats talk to each other all
the time.

21:43.369 --> 21:45.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have relationships that
span beyond administrations.

21:45.971 --> 21:48.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They meet each other in
different conferences
and so forth.

21:48.908 --> 21:49.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GREG MILLER: Absolutely.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, that is an issue.

21:51.377 --> 21:55.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that probably helps explain
why this law
has never been prosecuted.

21:55.314 --> 22:02.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Authorities, U.S. authorities,
do not really
want to discourage people who
are supposed

22:02.154 --> 22:05.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to be communicating with
officials overseas
from doing so.

22:05.357 --> 22:10.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, you're not supposed to
send signals
like this that undermine the
existing government,

22:10.696 --> 22:13.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that are contrary to the U.S.
policy.

22:13.432 --> 22:19.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And in this case, it was
particularly egregious,
because this was at a moment
when the United

22:19.104 --> 22:23.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States was just coming to the
grips with the
fact that Russia had waged a
cyber-campaign

22:23.209 --> 22:28.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to upend the 2016 election and
try to help
elect Trump.

22:28.047 --> 22:32.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And here his top national
security adviser
is communicating with the
Russian ambassador

22:32.551 --> 22:36.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in that very moment in time and
apparently
sending a signal, don't worry
about this.

22:36.956 --> 22:40.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Greg Miller of
The Washington Post, thanks so
much.

22:40.392 --> 22:42.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GREG MILLER: Thank you.

22:42.261 --> 22:45.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, after Hari
recorded that
conversation, President Trump
was asked about

22:46.031 --> 22:48.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the story while flying to
Florida.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump said -- quote -- "I
don't know about
it.

22:51.003 --> 22:52.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I haven't seen it.

22:52.238 --> 22:54.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What report is that?"

22:54.240 --> 23:04.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
National Security Adviser
Michael Flynn was
among the passengers on Air
Force One.

23:04.350 --> 23:10.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
National Security Adviser
Michael Flynn was
among the passengers on Air
Force One.

23:10.489 --> 23:12.224 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Stay with us.

23:12.258 --> 23:15.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Mark Shields
and David Brooks' take on the
week's news;

23:15.628 --> 23:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plus, Smokey Robinson reflects
on his lifelong
contribution to music.

23:20.766 --> 23:26.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: The president gets a
key member
of his Cabinet confirmed, a
right-hand man

23:26.705 --> 23:31.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who will take aim at the
Affordable Care Act,
and will serve as the country's
top health

23:31.910 --> 23:32.878 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
official.

23:32.911 --> 23:34.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins has the story.

23:34.747 --> 23:41.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: He is, after
his swearing-in
today, the nation's 23rd
secretary of health

23:41.353 --> 23:44.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and human services.

23:44.556 --> 23:49.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. Senate confirmed
Georgia Congressman
Tom Price in the wee hours this
morning on

23:49.762 --> 23:53.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a party-line vote of 52-47.

23:53.565 --> 23:57.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Price is a longtime
opponent of
the Affordable Care Act.

23:57.236 --> 24:01.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To Democrats like Maria Cantwell
of Washington
State, that is the problem.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.775 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

24:02.808 --> 24:05.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIA CANTWELL (D), Washington:
My view is,
this vote is the first vote in
the repeal

24:05.077 --> 24:06.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the Affordable Care Act.

24:06.845 --> 24:10.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: But to
Republicans like Tom
Cotton of Arkansas, that's
Price's appeal.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.584 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM COTTON (R), Arkansas: You
could say his
chief qualification for the job
of replacing

24:14.620 --> 24:18.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obamacare is, he had the good
sense to oppose
it in the first place.

24:18.390 --> 24:23.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Price is also a
retired doctor,
the first physician to lead HHS
in nearly

24:23.729 --> 24:26.165 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
25 years.

24:26.198 --> 24:30.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in confirmation hearings, he
faced tough
questions over his relationship
with health

24:30.536 --> 24:36.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
care companies, and his
investment in some
which were affected by his
actions in Congress.

24:36.442 --> 24:41.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now Price is responsible for a
more than a
trillion-dollar health agency
budget, for

24:41.647 --> 24:46.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a department that oversees food
and drugs,
biomedical research, public
health threats,

24:46.385 --> 24:50.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, of course, a large portion
of U.S. health
care.

24:50.589 --> 24:55.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That includes Medicaid, which
covers more
than 74 million people, and
Medicare, over

24:55.527 --> 24:57.429 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
55 million.

24:57.463 --> 24:58.430 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
His theme?

24:58.464 --> 25:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A smaller role for the federal
government.

25:00.799 --> 25:05.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Congress, Price backed a
proposed cap on
Medicare spending per person.

25:05.704 --> 25:10.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Price also supported giving
states fixed amounts,
in block grants, to cover
low-income people

25:10.809 --> 25:12.478 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on Medicaid.

25:12.511 --> 25:16.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But his new boss, Donald Trump,
said on the
campaign trail he wouldn't touch
Medicare

25:16.949 --> 25:18.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or Medicaid.

25:18.784 --> 25:22.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Save Medicare, Medicaid, and
Social Security

25:22.721 --> 25:24.089 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
without cuts.

25:24.123 --> 25:25.924 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Have to do it.

25:25.958 --> 25:29.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Mr. Trump has
not commented
since becoming president, but he
has stressed

25:29.094 --> 25:33.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an area of agreement with Price:
repeal of
the Affordable Care Act.

25:33.465 --> 25:37.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was today at a joint press
conference
with Japanese Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe.

25:37.369 --> 25:40.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Obamacare, as you
know, is a
total and complete disaster.

25:40.773 --> 25:48.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we're going to end up with
tremendous
health care at a lower price,
and I think

25:48.313 --> 25:50.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people are going to be extremely
happy.

25:50.082 --> 25:54.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Meantime, the
Associated
Press estimates some 12 million
Americans

25:54.286 --> 25:58.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have signed up for the
Affordable Care Act
for the next year, and
Republicans are feeling

25:58.824 --> 26:01.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the pressure from many concerned
about a replacement.

26:01.794 --> 26:08.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night at a town hall
advertised as focused
as health care, Utah Congressman
Jason Chaffetz

26:08.734 --> 26:12.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
was bombarded by angry
constituents on a variety
of issues.

26:12.371 --> 26:18.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in Tennessee, a similar
scene for Representative
Diane Black, as health care
policy and politics

26:18.844 --> 26:20.913 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
collide.

26:20.946 --> 26:24.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now that Secretary Price has
been sworn in,
let's take a closer look at what
he may try

26:25.017 --> 26:28.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to do, more quickly, and over
the long term.

26:28.454 --> 26:30.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Julie Rovner covers this for
Kaiser Health
News.

26:30.789 --> 26:31.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She's a friend of the
"NewsHour."

26:31.857 --> 26:32.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And she joins me now.

26:32.858 --> 26:33.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you, Julie.

26:33.859 --> 26:35.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER, Kaiser Health
News: Thank you.

26:35.627 --> 26:36.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Let's talk with
Republican
agenda item number one, the
Affordable Care

26:36.962 --> 26:38.564 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Act.

26:38.597 --> 26:41.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Secretary Price, we have a
man who literally
authored a bill to repeal it.

26:41.867 --> 26:46.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have both reported that
Republicans see
him as a major part of their
repeal effort.

26:46.371 --> 26:47.840 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But what can he actually do?

26:47.873 --> 26:50.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is he likely to do on the
Affordable
Care Act?

26:50.476 --> 26:54.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: Well, what he can
actually do
and what he will likely do are
two different

26:54.480 --> 26:55.447 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
things.

26:55.481 --> 26:57.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What he can actually do is quite
a lot.

26:57.349 --> 27:00.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For as long as the Affordable
Care Act was,
there are a whole lot of places
where it says

27:00.352 --> 27:02.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the secretary shall or the
secretary may.

27:02.588 --> 27:07.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So he has a lot of power to
determine the
details around what happens to
the law.

27:07.259 --> 27:11.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he can take apart a lot of
the details
that the Obama administration
added to it.

27:11.797 --> 27:13.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now, what will he do?

27:13.599 --> 27:16.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's an issue here with
whether or not
the Republicans want to make
sure that there

27:16.935 --> 27:22.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is still an individual insurance
market next
year in 2018, while they're
figuring out what

27:22.040 --> 27:23.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to replace it with.

27:23.642 --> 27:26.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Insurers need to know that
really by later
this spring.

27:26.512 --> 27:30.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so some are expecting him
to, on the one
hand, try to take some things
apart, on the

27:30.849 --> 27:35.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other hand, try to make sure
that the insurance
industry stays in, and so to
give them some

27:35.754 --> 27:37.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
security about what might be
coming.

27:37.523 --> 27:41.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And as he has
to deal with
the insurance market, which is
one issue,

27:41.527 --> 27:44.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he has to deal with, of course,
all of us
and our health care.

27:44.596 --> 27:47.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And Obamacare has some
preventative services
in it.

27:47.699 --> 27:50.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Included in that, contraception,
screenings.

27:50.769 --> 27:54.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What kind of say does he have
over whether
those will continue to be
cost-free?

27:54.706 --> 27:57.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: Well, he can
change that if
he wants to.

27:57.943 --> 28:00.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, some of it was done by
regulation.

28:00.212 --> 28:05.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And in order to change
regulations, there
is a process that even
departments have to

28:05.217 --> 28:07.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
go through of notice and public
comment.

28:07.853 --> 28:10.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it can take several, many
months sometimes.

28:10.422 --> 28:14.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is also something that's a
little less
formal called guidance, and
guidance, he can

28:14.626 --> 28:16.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
undo pretty much whenever he
wants.

28:16.962 --> 28:18.864 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, he has the power both ways.

28:18.897 --> 28:20.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just whether some things
will be faster
or slower.

28:20.933 --> 28:23.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: On
contraception, a lot of
people paying attention to that.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is one that could take a
few months,
but he could still do it?

28:25.837 --> 28:27.673 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is that right?

28:27.706 --> 28:29.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: Yes, well, he can
make it easier
probably for religious
organizations, employers

28:29.841 --> 28:32.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to opt out of providing
contraception.

28:32.811 --> 28:34.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's been a huge issue.

28:34.613 --> 28:37.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In terms of keeping it
cost-free, that would
have to be changed through a
regulation.

28:37.849 --> 28:39.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That would take a little bit
longer.

28:39.284 --> 28:42.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Another one,
Medicaid.

28:42.120 --> 28:45.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans on the Hill, I know,
tell both
of us that that is one of the
biggest puzzles

28:45.190 --> 28:46.658 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for them.

28:46.692 --> 28:49.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have to deal with how to
expand it or
not expand it, what they do.

28:49.928 --> 28:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Secretary Price, you report
that he can
change requirements for the poor
who receive

28:54.399 --> 28:55.367 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Medicaid?

28:55.400 --> 28:57.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: That's right.

28:57.169 --> 28:59.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, he can't change the law,
but he can
change some of the regulations
that have to

28:59.571 --> 29:02.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do with who gets it, with who
gets much.

29:02.808 --> 29:07.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, Congress is talking
about turning
Medicaid into a block grant,
which would limit

29:07.245 --> 29:10.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how much money states could get,
although
they would have much more
flexibility.

29:10.716 --> 29:15.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He could through his own power
give states
a lot more flexibility than they
have now,

29:15.654 --> 29:17.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which is what many are expecting
him to do.

29:17.789 --> 29:22.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So things like requiring people
on Medicaid
to meet a work requirement,
that's something

29:22.427 --> 29:26.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the Obama administration
resisted, but
that new Secretary Price might
not.

29:26.632 --> 29:29.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's an old
debate over
welfare and work.

29:29.735 --> 29:33.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans have long been on
one side and
Democrats on the other.

29:33.305 --> 29:37.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are just -- these are
major things we
have touched on, but they just
barely describe

29:37.776 --> 29:40.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the reach of this agency.

29:40.579 --> 29:45.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can you talk about sort of the
profound abilities
or the profound areas that now
Secretary Price

29:45.384 --> 29:47.152 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
oversees?

29:47.185 --> 29:49.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: People forget just
how big the
Department of Health and Human
Services is.

29:49.655 --> 29:52.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Its budget is more than $1
trillion a year.

29:52.724 --> 29:56.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It oversees not just Medicare
and Medicaid
and the Affordable Care Act, but
the Food

29:56.428 --> 30:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Drug Administration, the
Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, the
National Institutes

30:01.166 --> 30:04.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Health, the Indian Health
Service.

30:04.369 --> 30:07.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It touches, it's said, almost
one out of every
two Americans.

30:07.673 --> 30:11.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it is a wide, sprawling
agency.

30:11.443 --> 30:16.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the secretary, as I
mentioned, has significant
power to interpret how laws are
implemented.

30:16.882 --> 30:20.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Quickly, you
have been covering
health care for 30 years.

30:20.419 --> 30:24.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How pivotal, how historic could
this moment
be in terms of American health
care?

30:24.523 --> 30:26.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: Well, we will see.

30:26.558 --> 30:30.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not clear, as I said,
exactly which way
the secretary is going to go.

30:30.062 --> 30:34.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We know that, from his
congressional career,
he's been very conservative,
would like to

30:34.066 --> 30:37.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
remake Medicare, remake
Medicaid, repeal the
Affordable Care Act.

30:37.936 --> 30:40.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That's not exactly what
President Trump ran
on.

30:40.839 --> 30:44.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said in his confirmation
hearings he will
do what the president wants.

30:44.509 --> 30:46.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will have to see how that
goes.

30:46.278 --> 30:48.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: All right,
Julie Rovner,
chief Washington correspondent
for Kaiser

30:48.613 --> 30:51.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Health News, thank you so much
for joining
us.

30:51.650 --> 30:58.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JULIE ROVNER: Thank you.

30:58.090 --> 31:03.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the
analysis of Shields
and Brooks.

31:03.762 --> 31:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and
New York Times columnist David
Brooks, who

31:08.533 --> 31:10.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
joins us tonight from Chicago.

31:10.068 --> 31:11.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we welcome both of you.

31:11.937 --> 31:17.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, before we talk about the
immigration -- the
president's immigration order,
Mark, which

31:17.375 --> 31:23.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the court, appeals court,
rejected the administration
argument on last night, we have
a short clip

31:23.248 --> 31:28.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of what President Trump has just
said a little
while ago on Air Force One as he
was flying

31:28.787 --> 31:33.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from Washington down to South
Florida to Mar-a-Lago.

31:33.291 --> 31:35.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reporters were asking him what
he plans to
do now.

31:35.327 --> 31:36.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's that clip.

31:36.762 --> 31:38.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
We will win that battle.

31:38.396 --> 31:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we also have a lot of other
options, including
just filing a brand-new order.

31:42.434 --> 31:43.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)

31:43.435 --> 31:45.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Could very well
be.

31:45.337 --> 31:47.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I like to keep you -- I
would like to
surprise you.

31:47.906 --> 31:51.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need speed for reasons of
security.

31:51.777 --> 31:53.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it could very well be that
we do.

31:53.845 --> 31:57.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Mark, he
says, "I like
to surprise you."

31:57.249 --> 31:59.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How big a setback is this for
the president?

31:59.284 --> 32:06.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It's a significant
setback,
Judy, in large part because it
was self-inflicted.

32:06.892 --> 32:13.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They made mistakes, including
green card holders,
which weakened their argument
completely,

32:14.032 --> 32:18.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and made them vulnerable to the
court's decision.

32:18.603 --> 32:23.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it reflected, more than
anything else,
a sense of chaos and a sense of
incompleteness

32:24.009 --> 32:30.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and a sense of lack of
thoughtfulness in the
administration on an enormously
serious issue.

32:30.682 --> 32:32.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, how do you
see it?

32:32.517 --> 32:37.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, first, on
that last clip
of Trump on the plane, his staff
is briefing

32:37.389 --> 32:41.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reporters in somewhat of a
chaotic manner
in just the last few minutes.

32:41.359 --> 32:43.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People are saying, oh, they are
going to just
take it to the Supreme Court,
they're going

32:43.528 --> 32:44.830 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to rewrite it.

32:44.863 --> 32:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the two different briefings
are contradicting
each other.

32:48.433 --> 32:53.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's something The Times
reporters have
been talking and tweeting about
publicly,

32:53.104 --> 32:57.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is some of the White House
staff is
in a high state of misery
because of the general

32:57.475 --> 32:59.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lack of -- chaos.

32:59.277 --> 33:02.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the larger issue of the
travel ban, our
friend Charles Krauthammer of
The Washington

33:02.848 --> 33:04.249 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Post I think put it pretty well.

33:04.282 --> 33:06.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not sure it's illegal, but
it's extremely
stupid.

33:06.852 --> 33:10.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm a little uncomfortable with
the idea of
judges overruling presidents on
national security

33:10.689 --> 33:12.123 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
matters.

33:12.157 --> 33:15.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nonetheless, so whether it's
unconstitutional
or not, I leave to others.

33:15.460 --> 33:20.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it certainly has sucked the
wind out of
two or three weeks of this
administration

33:20.065 --> 33:21.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for no good reason.

33:21.833 --> 33:26.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There has never been evidence
that people
from these countries are
disproportionately

33:26.204 --> 33:27.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
likely to commit terrorist acts.

33:27.772 --> 33:29.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have sent chaos to the
airports.

33:29.574 --> 33:30.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have offended the world.

33:30.642 --> 33:32.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have derailed the
administration.

33:32.544 --> 33:37.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have done it in such an
incompetent way,
the administration has, that
people with perfectly

33:37.382 --> 33:40.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
legal residence have been widely
inconvenienced.

33:40.685 --> 33:47.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it's just been a screw-up
from beginning
to end, and so it's just been a
running derailment.

33:47.425 --> 33:51.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Mark, it's
only three
weeks in, and it's already this
way.

33:51.930 --> 33:56.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And David referred to the,
frankly, mixed
signals coming from the White
House today

33:56.668 --> 33:59.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about whether they were going to
appeal or
not and how they're going to --
what they're

33:59.738 --> 34:01.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to do going forward.

34:01.473 --> 34:05.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I want to ask you both about
what the
president has been saying about
the judiciary,

34:05.610 --> 34:10.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
calling judges disgraceful, the
arguments
before the appellate court
disgraceful, saying

34:10.515 --> 34:14.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the country has been put at risk
by the decision.

34:14.319 --> 34:18.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much should -- what should
we think about
that?

34:18.123 --> 34:20.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It's a real
surprise, Judy.

34:20.525 --> 34:25.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, Judge Gorsuch, the
nominee for the
Supreme Court, said it was
disheartening and

34:25.797 --> 34:30.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
discouraging to have judges
attacked for their
independence and their
integrity.

34:30.635 --> 34:36.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know if Judge Gorsuch
was living in
a bubble in Boulder during 2016.

34:36.041 --> 34:38.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is not an aberration on the
part of Donald
Trump.

34:38.443 --> 34:39.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He did it to Judge Curiel.

34:39.978 --> 34:42.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said Judge Curiel was a total
disgrace.

34:42.247 --> 34:43.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is the
judge...

34:43.248 --> 34:45.083 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

34:45.116 --> 34:48.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: The federal judge
in the Trump
University charge -- case,
because his parents

34:48.920 --> 34:51.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had been born in Mexico and
because I'm going
to build a wall.

34:51.823 --> 34:54.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He manages to personalize
everything.

34:54.693 --> 34:56.861 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He brings chaos.

34:56.895 --> 35:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He will not admit that he's ever
made a mistake,
that he's ever been wrong.

35:01.299 --> 35:04.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what this whole thing is
about whether
they're going to have a new
order.

35:04.402 --> 35:09.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A new order, a new executive
order would be
an admission that the first
order had been

35:09.107 --> 35:13.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
flawed, imperfect, illegal,
unconstitutional
and rejected.

35:13.211 --> 35:15.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So he can't have that.

35:15.213 --> 35:23.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So you're going to kind of do a
double -- to
me, it is reflective of this
administration.

35:23.388 --> 35:24.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's three weeks in.

35:24.756 --> 35:28.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People in the White House work
hard, whatever
administration.

35:28.460 --> 35:32.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They get rewarded in psychic
income, a sense
that they are involved in
something bigger

35:32.797 --> 35:34.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than themselves, that it's
important.

35:34.733 --> 35:40.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the people in the Trump
White House right
now are just fighting, fighting
basically

35:40.405 --> 35:42.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to stay above water.

35:42.140 --> 35:47.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And there is a
sense of conflict,
David, virtually every day.

35:47.545 --> 35:53.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what about -- is there a
strategy to criticizing
the judiciary, the judges, the
courts over

35:53.818 --> 35:54.953 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this?

35:54.986 --> 35:56.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: No, I don't think
there is a
strategy.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There is world view.

35:58.123 --> 36:01.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Donald Trump's world view is
that it's
a dangerous, miserable place,
people are out

36:01.359 --> 36:04.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to get him, and he needs to
strike them first.

36:04.929 --> 36:06.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's been the world view from
the beginning.

36:06.331 --> 36:08.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's the world view.

36:08.233 --> 36:11.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To me, the big event of the week
is not one
thing.

36:11.036 --> 36:13.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the whole agglomeration of
things.

36:13.371 --> 36:18.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the rising tide of enmity
in the country,
Donald Trump attacking judges,
Donald Trump

36:18.743 --> 36:25.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attacking John McCain, Senator
Blumenthal,
the town halls, the riots in
Berkeley.

36:25.717 --> 36:29.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have got the incivility on
the floor of
the United States Senate.

36:29.721 --> 36:32.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have got just a rising tide,
every single
story.

36:32.791 --> 36:36.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every time Kellyanne Conway goes
on TV, there's
another fight with whoever's
interviewing

36:36.161 --> 36:38.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her that particular day.

36:38.496 --> 36:44.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what you have is this
just succession
and a rising tide of conflict
and incivility

36:44.803 --> 36:48.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the breakdown in the moral
norms that
usually govern how we talk to
each other.

36:48.273 --> 36:53.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marco Rubio gave a pretty good
speech on the
floor of the Senate this week
sort of acknowledging

36:53.211 --> 36:54.813 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this fact.

36:54.846 --> 36:56.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so it's not one thing.

36:56.181 --> 36:57.949 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's every day.

36:57.982 --> 37:02.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the barrage of hostility
that seems to
mark our politics emanating from
the White

37:02.654 --> 37:05.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House, but not only in the White
House, from
his opponents as well.

37:05.356 --> 37:07.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which raises a
question, Mark,
in my mind.

37:07.826 --> 37:11.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Is there any historical
precedent for something
like this?

37:11.396 --> 37:13.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And what do the Democrats do?

37:13.398 --> 37:18.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because they are getting -- a
lot of Republicans
are saying the Democrats are
holding up President

37:18.970 --> 37:22.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trump's nominees for the
Cabinet.

37:22.474 --> 37:27.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A number of them have been
confirmed, but
a number are still waiting to be
confirmed,

37:27.946 --> 37:31.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they are accusing the
Democrats of creating
a logjam.

37:31.616 --> 37:38.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, conflict at the White
House, conflict
on the Hill, who comes out on
top of all this?

37:38.289 --> 37:42.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy, I mean, it's
a Cabinet
that wasn't vetted, that wasn't
prepared,

37:42.727 --> 37:45.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the papers weren't prepared
for.

37:45.497 --> 37:47.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats have to make the
fight.

37:47.465 --> 37:51.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you only make fights that
you're going
to win, there would be no
women's vote in

37:51.069 --> 37:53.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the country, there would be no
civil rights
laws in the country.

37:53.805 --> 38:00.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they came within one vote of
denying the
confirmation to Betsy DeVos as
secretary of

38:00.245 --> 38:01.346 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
education.

38:01.379 --> 38:03.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She was unprepared.

38:03.648 --> 38:09.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so unprepared was she that
Lamar Alexander,
the chairman of the committee,
the former

38:09.220 --> 38:13.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president of the University of
Tennessee,
the former secretary of
education, limited

38:13.591 --> 38:20.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
questioning of her to five
minutes, so to
deny exposure to what she didn't
know.

38:20.565 --> 38:23.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you vote -- are you going to
vote for
her, you're going to vote
against her?

38:23.868 --> 38:29.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two Republicans crossed ranks,
Lisa Murkowski
and Susan Collins, to join the
Democrat.

38:29.107 --> 38:37.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Andrew Puzder, the secretary of
labor, a multimillionaire,
who eight weeks after he was
nominated discovers

38:37.815 --> 38:44.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we, my wife and I, had for
years somebody
working on -- undocumented in
our home who

38:44.088 --> 38:46.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we didn't pay taxes for.

38:46.124 --> 38:50.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Zoe Baird, the nominee for
attorney general,
her career foundered on this.

38:50.962 --> 38:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kimba Wood withdrew nomination
on a far less
serious charge.

38:54.899 --> 38:56.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And so did Linda Chavez.

38:56.234 --> 38:59.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there one standard for women
and another
for men?

38:59.304 --> 39:04.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Men aren't responsible, multiple
millionaire
men who deal in minimum wage
jobs, who deal

39:04.509 --> 39:08.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in undocumented immigrants
working for them
at reduced wages?

39:08.780 --> 39:11.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I think these are fights
worth making.

39:11.382 --> 39:13.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what about
that, David?

39:13.651 --> 39:17.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because some people are looking
at Washington
and saying, oh, it's just more
of the same,

39:17.322 --> 39:21.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the wheels are not turning in
the nation's
capital.

39:21.159 --> 39:24.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, that's
patently true.

39:24.395 --> 39:30.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the various nominees, I
generally think
the president should get his
Cabinet picks,

39:30.568 --> 39:34.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unless they're egregiously out
of the range,
either ethically or
intellectually out of

39:34.706 --> 39:36.808 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the range of what's acceptable.

39:36.841 --> 39:40.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have to say a lot of these
nominees
are not necessarily my cup of
tea, but I think

39:41.012 --> 39:42.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're clearly within the
range.

39:42.847 --> 39:48.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Jeff Sessions has some
problematic spots on
his history, but he has been a
pretty normal,

39:48.119 --> 39:51.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
respectable senator, more
conservative than
a lot of us, but a respectable
senator for

39:51.789 --> 39:53.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a long period of time.

39:53.625 --> 39:56.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, one could -- I think the
Democrats are
right to protest, but I don't
think he's so

39:57.028 --> 39:59.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
far out of the range of normalcy
that he shouldn't
be confirmed.

39:59.797 --> 40:03.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Betsy DeVos is not the most
informed person
on education policy, but I have
seen her present

40:03.901 --> 40:09.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a few times, and she presents as
a pretty
respectable, intelligent person
who has cared

40:09.507 --> 40:12.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
passionately about education and
cares about
charter schools.

40:12.477 --> 40:17.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The teachers union may not like
her, but she's
clearly within the range of
Republican policy-makers.

40:17.282 --> 40:20.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As for multimillionaires, a lot
of us hope
to be a multimillionaire some
day.

40:21.019 --> 40:24.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, spotty records, but it
seems to be
not without the range.

40:24.689 --> 40:26.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't blame the Democrats for
fighting.

40:26.190 --> 40:29.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have got a very energized
base.

40:29.093 --> 40:31.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there is a lot to complain
about a lot
of these nominees.

40:31.929 --> 40:36.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think, if you are actually
going to
turn someone down from a
president's own Cabinet,

40:36.334 --> 40:39.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
it better be a lot more
egregious than the
cases we have seen.

40:39.404 --> 40:41.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, that's my
question, Mark.

40:41.172 --> 40:42.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where draw the line?

40:42.307 --> 40:43.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where should Democrats say no?

40:43.474 --> 40:45.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, they have
drawn the line,
Judy.

40:46.010 --> 40:48.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have confirmed -- Tillerson
is confirmed.

40:48.680 --> 40:49.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They backed Mattis.

40:49.847 --> 40:51.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're not going to fight Ben
Carson.

40:51.683 --> 40:53.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think these -- I disagree with
David.

40:53.751 --> 40:58.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I agree with his assumption and
his premise
that a president is entitled to
a Cabinet,

40:58.589 --> 41:00.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
obviously, but it's not a rubber
stamp.

41:00.792 --> 41:05.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't think anybody could
watch the
confirmation hearings of Betsy
DeVos and say

41:05.963 --> 41:09.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that this is somebody qualified
to be secretary
of education.

41:09.367 --> 41:12.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ninety percent of children in
America go to
public schools.

41:12.603 --> 41:16.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She knows nothing about public
schools and
apparently cares less.

41:16.607 --> 41:21.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And her position on guns in
schools, got to
-- for potential grizzlies, we
should have

41:21.946 --> 41:23.848 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
guns available in schools?

41:23.881 --> 41:31.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Andrew Puzder, this is
somebody who basically
has just broken the law, and
he's going to

41:31.489 --> 41:35.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be held to no standard at all,
whereas women
nominees have been rejected in
the past.

41:35.827 --> 41:40.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I think even
Republicans are
saying Puzder may have a
problem.

41:41.032 --> 41:43.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
David, what about the point that
Mark is making?

41:43.401 --> 41:44.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, in some
cases, I agree.

41:44.769 --> 41:47.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the Puzder point, I do agree
there has
been a double standard.

41:47.105 --> 41:52.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the DeVos case, I agree that
the gun -- her
gun position is kind of weird,
kind of crazy,

41:52.844 --> 41:54.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but I do think she does know
about public
schools.

41:54.912 --> 42:00.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reason the Betsy DeVos case
was the centerpiece
case for the Democrats wasn't
about her weakness

42:00.118 --> 42:03.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as a knowledgeable person on
education policy.

42:03.154 --> 42:05.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She does care about charter
schools, which
are public schools.

42:05.223 --> 42:08.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She does care about choice,
which is a perfectly
legitimate thing to care about.

42:08.926 --> 42:12.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's because it's the one issue
where the
Democratic donor base was really
energized,

42:12.296 --> 42:14.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which was the teacher unions.

42:14.265 --> 42:17.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People ask, quite legitimately,
why DeVos
and why not a lot of the others?

42:17.735 --> 42:21.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's because it has to do
with the special
interest groups that run a lot
of Washington.

42:21.272 --> 42:23.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Would she be my first pick?

42:23.174 --> 42:24.409 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

42:24.442 --> 42:27.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is she someone who has dedicated
her life
to education policy?

42:27.779 --> 42:29.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Yes, actually, she has.

42:29.714 --> 42:31.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have seen her present a few
times.

42:31.315 --> 42:32.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't really know her.

42:32.950 --> 42:36.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I have seen her present on
education policy,
and she's not a stupid person.

42:36.988 --> 42:40.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's quite a smart person,
capable, pretty
sophisticated in subtle thought.

42:40.224 --> 42:43.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so to me, that puts her in
the realm of
policy.

42:43.094 --> 42:46.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we're in a climate where, as
today, she
tries to visit a school, and she
can't even

42:46.097 --> 42:49.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do that because protesters are
blocking that.

42:49.300 --> 42:54.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's what I mean about the
rising tide
of incivility that's sweeping
over politics.

42:54.705 --> 42:56.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That was wrong.

42:56.274 --> 42:58.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She should have been allowed to
go in a public
school.

42:58.342 --> 43:00.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would have been a novel
experience for
her.

43:00.311 --> 43:01.646 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

43:01.679 --> 43:03.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And this is not
about the teachers
unions alone.

43:03.481 --> 43:08.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's a very convenient
punching bag, to
say that Democrats are just
jumping at strings.

43:08.719 --> 43:13.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, the teachers unions opposed
her, and
for good reason.

43:13.057 --> 43:17.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't think that her
commitment to public
education exists.

43:17.361 --> 43:19.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So -- you know, but they're not
simply responding.

43:19.964 --> 43:26.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have confirmed all sorts of
Republican
secretaries of education in the
past who favored

43:26.204 --> 43:28.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
choice, including Lamar
Alexander.

43:28.506 --> 43:31.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, you want a
final 20
seconds here?

43:31.876 --> 43:33.144 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

43:33.177 --> 43:37.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: No, I'm willing to
respect Mark's
disagreement.

43:37.081 --> 43:38.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're not going to be like the
rest of the
country.

43:38.883 --> 43:42.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, well,
we have a
little bit of comity in the
United States

43:42.720 --> 43:44.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tonight right here, right here
on the "NewsHour."

43:44.722 --> 43:49.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: What is Donald
Trump going to
give President Putin for
Valentine's Day?

43:49.660 --> 43:50.628 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm interested.

43:50.661 --> 43:51.629 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

43:51.662 --> 43:53.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Maybe David's got
an idea.

43:53.431 --> 43:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will know by
next Friday,
because Valentine's Day is
Tuesday, in case

43:55.833 --> 43:57.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the two of you have forgotten.

43:57.735 --> 44:11.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mark Shields, David Brooks,
thank you.

44:11.582 --> 44:16.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Finally tonight: Motown legend
Smokey Robinson
and the music he's made popular
for decades.

44:16.854 --> 44:20.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is the focus of a special
tonight on PBS.

44:20.758 --> 44:25.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown sat down with him
on the eve
of getting a major honor to see
how he continues

44:25.696 --> 44:31.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to make what is old new again.

44:31.669 --> 44:44.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He was a huge
hit-maker, 26
top 40 songs in the 1960s, at
one of the great

44:45.016 --> 44:51.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hit machines in pop music
history, Smokey
Robinson, his group, the
Miracles, Motown,

44:51.622 --> 45:04.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a string of classics, like
"You Really
Got a Hold on Me."

45:04.402 --> 45:09.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Decades later, the 76-year-old
Robinson was
feted at a concert of his music
at Washington's

45:09.941 --> 45:17.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAR Constitution Hall, as the
winner of the
Library of Congress prestigious
Gershwin Award

45:17.281 --> 45:20.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for lifetime contributions to
popular song.

45:20.184 --> 45:24.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been, Robinson told me, a
long and amazing
journey.

45:24.388 --> 45:27.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SMOKEY ROBINSON, Musician: From
the time I
was probably 6 or so, I wanted
to be a singer.

45:27.992 --> 45:30.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: From the age of
6, huh?

45:30.094 --> 45:31.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SMOKEY ROBINSON: Yes, I always
imagined myself.

45:31.896 --> 45:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would stand in the mirror,
sing with the
hairbrush and all, because I
always wanted

45:35.833 --> 45:37.201 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do that.

45:37.234 --> 45:39.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I always watched all the
variety shows
that had entertainment.

45:39.737 --> 45:41.839 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it was always there for me.

45:41.872 --> 45:43.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just didn't think it would be
possible.

45:43.608 --> 45:49.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I never dared to -- from where I
grew up,
I just didn't think that this
life, for me,

45:50.014 --> 45:51.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would be possible.

45:51.782 --> 45:56.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: At the Library of
Congress,
he toured an exhibit of Motown
memorabilia

45:56.420 --> 46:02.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the place where he'd come
from, Detroit's
North End, where, quite
literally, the stars

46:02.460 --> 46:04.295 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
aligned.

46:04.328 --> 46:06.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SMOKEY ROBINSON: Diana Ross grew
up four doors
down the street from me, Aretha
Franklin right

46:06.597 --> 46:11.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around the corner, you know, and
the Temptations
right across the area, I mean,
right across

46:11.669 --> 46:13.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the avenue, and the Four Tops.

46:13.771 --> 46:14.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We had Berry Gordy.

46:14.772 --> 46:15.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

46:15.906 --> 46:18.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SMOKEY ROBINSON: We had a guy
who had the
dream.

46:18.576 --> 46:23.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Gordy, still a
friend all these
years later, founded Motown,
where Robinson

46:23.080 --> 46:29.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
served as singer and leader of
the Miracles,
songwriter and producer for
other top acts,

46:29.086 --> 46:33.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
including the Temptations and
Marvin Gaye,
and as a record executive.

46:33.124 --> 46:39.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I read about how you were a
precocious songwriter,
and you brought 100 or more
songs to Berry

46:39.363 --> 46:42.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gordy, and he rejected almost
all of them,
right?

46:42.700 --> 46:43.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SMOKEY ROBINSON: Yes.

46:43.868 --> 46:46.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Somehow, that
didn't discourage
you.

46:46.237 --> 46:50.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SMOKEY ROBINSON: No, it didn't
discourage
me whatsoever, because Jackie
Wilson was my

46:50.474 --> 46:52.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
number one singing idol as a kid
growing up
in Detroit.

46:52.810 --> 46:54.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jackie Wilson was from Detroit.

46:54.078 --> 46:55.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

46:55.079 --> 46:56.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SMOKEY ROBINSON: And I had all
of his records.

46:56.247 --> 46:59.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all of his songs were
written by Berry
Gordy.

46:59.650 --> 47:04.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he listened to my music and
critiqued
it for me, and started to mentor
me on how

47:04.188 --> 47:06.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to write songs and make them
songs.

47:06.123 --> 47:08.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And what was that
like in those
early days of Motown?

47:08.959 --> 47:12.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SMOKEY ROBINSON: It was highly
energetic.

47:12.363 --> 47:21.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It was so energetic and
competitive and loving
and wonderful at the same time.

47:21.739 --> 47:25.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was all that, because we were
not just
stablemates.

47:25.042 --> 47:29.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were not just some artists
who recorded
for the same label.

47:29.747 --> 47:30.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We were actually friends.

47:30.781 --> 47:32.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We were like brothers and
sisters.

47:32.383 --> 47:33.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We hung out.

47:33.784 --> 47:37.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have what we call the Motown
family, and
we have always had that.

47:37.888 --> 47:43.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Some songs come
quickly, Robinson
says, written at the piano in 25
minutes.

47:44.028 --> 47:55.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Others, like the 1979 hit
"Cruisin'" have
to simmer.

47:55.039 --> 48:00.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SMOKEY ROBINSON: Took five
years.

48:00.211 --> 48:01.345 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm not exaggerating that.

48:01.378 --> 48:03.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It took five years.

48:03.147 --> 48:07.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, if I say the
difference
between 25 minutes and five
years, I mean,

48:07.284 --> 48:11.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what does a song have to have,
what does a
Smokey Robinson song have to
have for you

48:11.455 --> 48:12.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to feel you have got it?

48:12.690 --> 48:13.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SMOKEY ROBINSON: It has to be a
song.

48:13.791 --> 48:14.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Which means?

48:14.792 --> 48:16.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SMOKEY ROBINSON: It has to be a
song.

48:16.594 --> 48:20.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, if I just gave you a
piece of paper
with the lyrics written down on
it, it would

48:20.865 --> 48:22.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
mean something to you.

48:22.133 --> 48:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It would tell you a story.

48:23.134 --> 48:24.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

48:24.935 --> 48:26.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SMOKEY ROBINSON: Without you
hearing a melody
or music or anything like that,
it would say

48:26.837 --> 48:27.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
something to you.

48:27.972 --> 48:30.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, that's what a song is to me.

48:30.574 --> 48:34.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, you have a lot of songs
that come out,
and the beat carries them over
there, because

48:34.845 --> 48:38.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the beat, and because of some
other factors
and so on and so forth.

48:39.016 --> 48:43.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I want mine to be a song, if
you read
it, it's going to mean something
to you.

48:43.254 --> 48:47.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: At one point in
the late '70s,
Robinson took a break from
singing, even thinking

48:47.992 --> 48:49.326 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he might retire.

48:49.360 --> 48:51.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But it didn't last.

48:51.262 --> 48:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And through the years, he's
continued to record
and collaborate with a variety
of artists.

48:56.267 --> 48:59.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the music business he was
such a part
of has changed dramatically.

48:59.970 --> 49:02.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I asked if he looked back with a
certain nostalgia.

49:02.573 --> 49:04.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SMOKEY ROBINSON: Yes, I look
back on it all
the time.

49:05.009 --> 49:06.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I looked back on it a few
minutes ago.

49:06.610 --> 49:08.078 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:08.112 --> 49:10.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SMOKEY ROBINSON: I look back on
it because
it's a whole 'nother game now.

49:10.614 --> 49:13.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The music business has made a
360.

49:13.450 --> 49:14.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a whole 'nother game.

49:14.451 --> 49:17.288 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not nearly what it was.

49:17.321 --> 49:22.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I fear for it, because, you
know, with
the advent of the computer and
online and

49:22.092 --> 49:27.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
downloading and all these
things, they have
destroyed -- that stuff has
destroyed the

49:27.064 --> 49:30.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
record business, not the music
business, but
the record business.

49:30.634 --> 49:34.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The music business is well, and
it's alive
and thriving.

49:34.371 --> 49:36.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And the
songwriting business,
I guess, still...

49:36.407 --> 49:38.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SMOKEY ROBINSON: The songwriting
business
is alive and thriving, man.

49:38.676 --> 49:41.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have got some wonderful
young kids out
there writing some great songs.

49:41.912 --> 49:43.848 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it's alive and thriving.

49:43.881 --> 49:51.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, I hope something happens to
turn it back
around to the point whereas it's
-- you're

49:51.522 --> 49:57.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
earning a living from writing
your songs,
from your work, you know,
because it's not

49:57.061 --> 49:58.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like that anymore.

49:58.362 --> 50:00.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And you just told
me that you're
going from here.

50:00.331 --> 50:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're going back out on the
road to perform
tomorrow night.

50:03.067 --> 50:04.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You're still doing this.

50:04.635 --> 50:07.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And people want to hear those
classic songs,
right?

50:07.438 --> 50:08.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Does it ever get old for you?

50:08.939 --> 50:13.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SMOKEY ROBINSON: I still perform
because it's
a necessity for my innards.

50:13.210 --> 50:15.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You know what I mean?

50:16.013 --> 50:24.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those songs, some of those
songs, I have
sung, I don't know how many
thousands of times.

50:24.221 --> 50:29.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I promise you, every single
solitary night,
they're new to me.

50:29.827 --> 50:33.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are brand-new to me that
night.

50:33.464 --> 50:39.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it kills me to see people
think that,
you know, show business is sex,
drugs and

50:39.970 --> 50:40.938 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
rock and roll.

50:40.971 --> 50:42.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I have what you call a meet
and greet.

50:42.039 --> 50:43.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I do it before the show.

50:43.941 --> 50:47.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when I was doing it after
the show especially,
there would be people who would
come back

50:47.544 --> 50:49.046 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and said, OK, Smoke, where's the
party?

50:49.079 --> 50:50.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

50:50.080 --> 50:52.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SMOKEY ROBINSON: I just had the
party, man.

50:52.216 --> 50:55.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I just had the party for
two-and-a-half-hours
or however long.

50:55.185 --> 50:56.854 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I was partying.

50:56.887 --> 51:00.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I said, now my party is, I'm
going back to
my hotel room, and watch me some
TV until

51:00.891 --> 51:03.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I fall asleep, because I just
had the party.

51:03.227 --> 51:06.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it is every single solitary
night.

51:06.730 --> 51:11.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And for the happy
crowd at
the Gershwin Award concert,
Smokey Robinson

51:11.602 --> 51:21.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
performed several of his
greatest hits.

51:21.645 --> 51:29.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
performed several of his
greatest hits.

51:30.020 --> 51:36.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From Washington, D.C., I'm
Jeffrey Brown for
the "PBS NewsHour."

51:36.627 --> 51:44.301 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Great music.

51:44.335 --> 51:49.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And "Smokey Robinson: The
Library of Congress
Gershwin Prize for Popular
Song," it airs

51:49.640 --> 52:00.284 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tonight on most PBS stations.

52:00.317 --> 52:04.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on the "NewsHour" online
right now: a
look at a different major music
event this

52:04.989 --> 52:06.824 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
weekend: the Grammy awards.

52:06.857 --> 52:11.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Each year, the awards ceremony
remembers legendary
musicians who have died.

52:11.895 --> 52:14.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do they pick which artists
to honor?

52:14.465 --> 52:16.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We take a closer look.

52:16.367 --> 52:21.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus: One way of measuring
advances in artificial
intelligence is through games,
like when a

52:21.939 --> 52:25.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
computer beat a world champion
at chess.

52:25.209 --> 52:27.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You can read a short history.

52:27.111 --> 52:31.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's on our Web site,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:31.148 --> 52:36.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

On "PBS NewsHour" Saturday: the
battle between

create jobs.

52:48.298 --> 52:50.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's a preview.

52:50.200 --> 52:54.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: In a June 2015 e-mail
to staff,
GE CEO Jeff Immelt had
complained about Connecticut

52:54.772 --> 52:58.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
raising its taxes five times
since 2011.

52:58.275 --> 53:02.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Immelt told employees, the
company had formed
an exploratory team to look into
the company's

53:02.613 --> 53:06.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
options to relocate corporate
headquarters
to another state with a more
pro-business

53:06.917 --> 53:08.185 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
environment.

53:08.218 --> 53:11.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Massachusetts offered GE $145

CHARLIE BAKER (R),

a competition, and we know that,
with lots

53:14.892 --> 53:16.827 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of other folks.

53:16.860 --> 53:20.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, we have had governors
come up to Massachusetts
to make a pitch to companies
here about why

53:20.998 --> 53:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they should be in their states.

53:22.566 --> 53:26.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's tomorrow
night on "PBS
NewsHour Weekend."

53:26.970 --> 53:28.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for

53:28.372 --> 53:29.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
