WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And now for
a view from across the aisle,
I'm joined by Congressman

00:03.366 --> 00:05.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Adam Schiff of California.

00:05.166 --> 00:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's the top Democrat on the
House Intelligence Committee.

00:07.400 --> 00:10.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Congressman, so, you had chance
to talk to Jared Kushner today.

00:10.800 --> 00:12.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What were your
questions going in?

00:12.500 --> 00:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And do you feel like he
answered them satisfactorily?

00:14.333 --> 00:16.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

00:16.733 --> 00:19.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF (D), California:
We had a variety of
questions certainly
about the four meetings

00:19.266 --> 00:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he disclosed in his public
statement the other day, but
about a lot of other areas

00:24.733 --> 00:26.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as well.

00:26.866 --> 00:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're looking at any of the
Russian active measures that
may have been employed here

00:29.233 --> 00:32.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that we know they
employ in other places.

00:32.166 --> 00:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're looking at allegations
concerning the social media
campaign, whether there was any

00:37.133 --> 00:42.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
kind of cooperation or
coordination through
Cambridge Analytica.

00:44.133 --> 00:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're looking at some of the
financial issues, because one
of the things that the Russians

00:46.733 --> 00:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do is, they use financial
leverage, or sometimes
they develop what the
Russians call kompromat

00:52.400 --> 00:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by engaging in a list of
transactions with people as a
way of being able to hold that

00:55.933 --> 00:57.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
over their head.

00:57.966 --> 01:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we went, with this witness,
as we do with all, over the
whole range of our concerns

01:04.000 --> 01:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to do the best we can to get to
the bottom of these allegations.

01:06.966 --> 01:09.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let's
talk about some of those
particular allegations.

01:09.800 --> 01:14.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of them was this issue of
this federal disclosure form,
where he failed initially

01:14.700 --> 01:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to reveal that he had these
meetings with dozens of foreign
nationals, including these

01:20.566 --> 01:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
meetings with the Russians.

01:22.533 --> 01:25.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jared Kushner yesterday said
that this was an innocent
mistake, that this was basically

01:25.466 --> 01:26.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a rookie error.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you buy that as an excuse?

01:28.733 --> 01:30.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:30.133 --> 01:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: Well, he doesn't
strike me as a rookie.

01:31.733 --> 01:33.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think he's quite
sophisticated.

01:33.700 --> 01:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't want to
characterize his testimony.

01:35.600 --> 01:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We actually don't really go
into the details of testimony.

01:38.533 --> 01:41.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I was surprised that
my colleague was
willing to do that.

01:41.933 --> 01:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will say this, that the holder
of that clearance, I do believe,
needs to investigate this to

01:49.000 --> 01:53.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
find out whether Mr. Kushner's
explanations are satisfactory,
what the circumstances are,

01:54.833 --> 01:57.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what was disclosed,
what wasn't disclosed.

01:57.333 --> 02:00.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have not yet
obtained the SF-86s.

02:00.200 --> 02:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we're really not in a
position to evaluate what
and when he disclosed
different things.

02:07.100 --> 02:10.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I do believe that other
individuals, not the son-in-law
of the president, if they were

02:12.466 --> 02:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to fail to disclose a meeting
that they attended that was with
people acting on behalf of the

02:18.233 --> 02:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian government, promising
dirt on a political opponent, or
a meeting that wasn't disclosed

02:22.433 --> 02:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that involved setting up a
secret back channel at a Russian
diplomatic facility, it is very

02:29.400 --> 02:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unlikely that an ordinary
individual would be allowed
to keep their clearance.

02:31.500 --> 02:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let's touch
on a few other issues that are
swirling in Washington right

02:35.400 --> 02:37.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

02:37.500 --> 02:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obviously, as you have been
hearing in our broadcast, the
president has been very tough

02:40.066 --> 02:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on Attorney General Sessions.

02:42.133 --> 02:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many people believe that the
president would like him to
either leave or would like to

02:45.566 --> 02:47.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fire him.

02:47.600 --> 02:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If that were to happen,
what would that do to these
ongoing investigations?

02:50.700 --> 02:52.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I
think you're right.

02:54.133 --> 02:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In this case, the president
is being very transparent, at
least as far as his intentions

02:57.800 --> 02:59.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are concerned.

02:59.933 --> 03:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wants to force Jeff Sessions
to resign, and, therefore, he
would less have his fingerprints

03:03.100 --> 03:06.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on hit than if he
fired Jeff Sessions.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think the motivation
is quite simple.

03:08.800 --> 03:13.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He wants to appoint a
more malleable attorney
general when it comes to
the Russia investigation

03:13.466 --> 03:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who is not recused, who can
tell Bob Mueller, you will look
at this, but you won't look

03:17.633 --> 03:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at these other areas that are
evidently so concerning to the
president, including whether

03:22.333 --> 03:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there was any money-laundering
going on with the
Trump Organization.

03:26.366 --> 03:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What should we do about it?

03:28.466 --> 03:33.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If there is any effort
to interfere with Bob
Mueller's investigation,
we may need to reenact

03:35.000 --> 03:38.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the independent counsel law,
and make sure that Bob Mueller
has a completely free hand

03:40.366 --> 03:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to look at anything relevant
to the Russia investigation
or that arises from it, which

03:46.400 --> 03:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is his charter now, but
something clearly the president
is uncomfortable with.

03:52.300 --> 03:56.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The president needs
to understand this is
not his prerogative
to determine what the

03:58.166 --> 04:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investigators are
investigating when it
involves his own organization.

04:00.133 --> 04:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I'm curious
what you think, though.

04:02.733 --> 04:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president has said --
what's really relevant here is
probably what the GOP would do.

04:09.700 --> 04:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If Sessions were fired, we heard
today many, many senators and
congressmen supporting Jeff

04:16.366 --> 04:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sessions, but we also
heard Speaker Ryan saying
that, in essence, it
is the president's job

04:19.666 --> 04:22.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to determine who
is in his Cabinet.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think if this -- if
Sessions were to be let go, that
the GOP would -- there would

04:27.866 --> 04:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be a revolt in his own party?

04:28.733 --> 04:30.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

04:30.833 --> 04:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: I would certainly
hope that that would be the
case, if he either pushes Jeff

04:33.366 --> 04:38.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sessions out or he were to
fire Bob Mueller, that both
Democrats and Republicans would

04:40.300 --> 04:45.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rise to their institutional
responsibility of insisting that
an independent investigation

04:45.066 --> 04:46.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
go forth.

04:46.333 --> 04:48.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think it would be a
constitutional crisis.

04:48.366 --> 04:51.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have to say, I'm deeply
disappointed once again to
hear the speaker so downplay

04:51.766 --> 04:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the significance of this,
because that only encourages the
president to engage in conduct

04:56.700 --> 05:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is, I think, very
seriously at odds with our
system of checks and balances.

05:03.700 --> 05:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When we meet with emerging
democracies, we always
emphasize a couple things.

05:06.566 --> 05:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We emphasize, when you
win an election, you don't
jail the losing party.

05:11.100 --> 05:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, here, one of the gripes
apparently the president has
is that Jeff Sessions is not

05:15.866 --> 05:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
acting to try to
investigate and prosecute
his political opponent.

05:20.100 --> 05:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is something you see
in a banana republic, not in
the United States of America.

05:26.466 --> 05:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, members of both
parties need to speak out.

05:28.100 --> 05:31.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We shouldn't wait until
there is a crisis to do so.

05:31.466 --> 05:33.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I hope the speaker
will think better of
what he just said.

05:33.966 --> 05:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Lastly,
quickly, Congressman,
the president clearly
still chafes at this

05:38.633 --> 05:41.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Russia investigation.

05:41.033 --> 05:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his new communications
director today seemed
to indicate that
the president still

05:47.333 --> 05:51.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't believe that Russia
was actually involved in trying
to meddle in our election.

05:53.666 --> 05:56.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Given that huge chasm
between what our intelligence
agencies believe and what
the president believes,

05:57.233 --> 05:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
how can this really go forward?

05:58.833 --> 06:00.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

06:00.966 --> 06:03.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: Well, look, there
is only really one person in
America that doesn't believe

06:03.266 --> 06:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Russians were involved
in hacking our election.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's, unfortunately,
the president.

06:07.766 --> 06:12.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even Vladimir Putin, of course,
knows exactly what he's done,
so Russia is under no illusion

06:12.166 --> 06:13.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about this.

06:13.733 --> 06:16.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What does this
mean going forward?

06:16.133 --> 06:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It means, of greater
significance to the
country, that we are not
taking the steps to prepare

06:21.600 --> 06:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ourselves when the
Russians intervene again.

06:23.533 --> 06:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is very serious,
because there is no
software patch here.

06:28.033 --> 06:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're not going to be able
to make the DNC or the RNC
immune from Russian hacking.

06:32.133 --> 06:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're too good, and it's
too difficult to defend.

06:35.433 --> 06:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only real defense the
country has is to bring
the country together
to forge a consensus

06:42.433 --> 06:45.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, no matter who it helps
or who it hurts, we will
reject foreign interference.

06:45.033 --> 06:49.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And our president is simply
not doing that, and this is
exposing us to further harm.

06:49.866 --> 06:52.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Congressman Adam Schiff of
California, thanks very much.

06:52.933 --> 06:53.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

06:53.933 --> 06:54.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ADAM SCHIFF: Thank you.
