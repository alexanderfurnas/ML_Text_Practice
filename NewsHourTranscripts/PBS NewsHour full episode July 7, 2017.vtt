JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.733 --> 00:06.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.733 --> 00:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.800 --> 00:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES: We look forward
to a lot of very positive

00:10.833 --> 00:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things happening for Russia,
for the United States, and
for everybody concerned.

00:16.133 --> 00:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Face-to-face.

00:18.200 --> 00:22.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Conflicting reports on
what President Trump
said to President Putin
about Russian meddling

00:22.433 --> 00:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the U.S. election, a
day after again questioning
their role, as protests
rage outside the meeting

00:29.233 --> 00:31.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of global leaders in Germany.

00:31.766 --> 00:36.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then: rethinking public housing
-- how one Denver community
is building health into the

00:38.233 --> 00:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
structure of their neighborhood
to foster a better lifestyle.

00:41.300 --> 00:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISMAEL GUERRERO, Director,
Denver Housing Authority:
What we learned in
early conversations

00:44.533 --> 00:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with residents in particular
was, they didn't just want
a new unit to move into.

00:50.700 --> 00:52.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They wanted a better
quality of life.

00:52.733 --> 00:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we really started expanding
our perspective on what we
were trying to accomplish here.

00:57.166 --> 00:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.

00:59.800 --> 01:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Brooks and Ruth
Marcus take on a week
full of foreign tests for
the Trump administration.

01:05.100 --> 01:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:11.766 --> 01:14.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:14.533 --> 01:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It was the most
highly anticipated meeting
yet of the Trump presidency.

01:24.500 --> 01:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the first time since
he took office, Mr. Trump
was face-to-face with
his Russian counterpart,

01:30.100 --> 01:31.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Vladimir Putin.

01:31.533 --> 01:33.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
On the agenda?

01:33.566 --> 01:37.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syria, North Korea, and
Moscow's meddling in the 2016
election, about which there is

01:39.333 --> 01:41.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
still disagreement.

01:41.300 --> 01:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From the G20 summit in Hamburg,
Germany, special correspondent
Ryan Chilcote reports.

01:48.133 --> 01:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: What was planned
to last just over half-an-hour
turned into an unexpected

01:52.733 --> 01:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
two hours and 15 minutes.

01:55.766 --> 02:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump and
Russian President Vladimir
Putin began their much
anticipated face-to-face

02:02.700 --> 02:05.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by exchanging visibly friendly
greetings, given the state
of U.S.-Russia relations.

02:05.100 --> 02:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: We're going to
have a talk now, and obviously

02:07.066 --> 02:09.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that will continue.

02:09.066 --> 02:13.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we look forward to a lot of
very positive things happening
for Russia, for the United

02:14.933 --> 02:17.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
States and for
everybody concerned.

02:17.100 --> 02:19.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it's an honor
to be with you.

02:19.766 --> 02:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through
translator): I'm delighted
to be able to meet

02:22.233 --> 02:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you personally, Mr. President,
and I hope, as you said, our
meeting will yield positive

02:26.833 --> 02:28.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
results.

02:28.900 --> 02:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: News of what was
discussed came afterward from
the countries' top diplomats,

02:34.833 --> 02:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson
and Foreign Minister Sergei
Lavrov, among them, allegations

02:39.566 --> 02:41.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that Russia meddled
in the U.S. election.

02:41.533 --> 02:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In an audio-only briefing,
Tillerson said Mr. Trump brought
up the issue at the outset,

02:46.266 --> 02:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and said the pair had a
robust and lengthy discussion.

02:48.933 --> 02:53.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary
of State: The president opened
the meeting with President

02:53.466 --> 02:58.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Putin by raising the concerns
of the American people regarding
Russian interference in the

02:59.266 --> 03:01.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
2016 election.

03:01.366 --> 03:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The two leaders agreed, though,
that this is a substantial
hindrance in the ability

03:08.300 --> 03:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of us to move the Russian-U.S.
relationship forward, and
agreed to exchange further work

03:14.900 --> 03:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regarding commitments of
noninterference in the
affairs of the United
States and our democratic

03:21.066 --> 03:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
process, as well as
those of other countries.

03:23.166 --> 03:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: Tillerson added,
Putin denied any involvement.

03:26.433 --> 03:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Russian foreign minister
offered his own account.

03:28.666 --> 03:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SERGEI LAVROV, Russian Foreign
Minister (through translator):
President Trump said that the

03:31.933 --> 03:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaign is already taking on
a rather strange character,
because during the many months

03:36.233 --> 03:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that these accusations
have been aired, there
hasn't been a single fact.

03:40.666 --> 03:44.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
President Trump has said
he's heard President
Putin's definitive
statements that is not

03:44.300 --> 03:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
true, and that the
Russian leadership didn't
intervene in the election,
and that he accepts

03:48.100 --> 03:50.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
those statements.

03:50.133 --> 03:53.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: Yesterday, Mr.
Trump conceded Russia likely
played a role, but stopped short

03:53.466 --> 03:56.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of blaming them solely
for the election hack.

03:56.133 --> 04:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tillerson today said the
Russians asked for proof of
interference, but stressed, both

04:00.833 --> 04:02.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
leaders agreed it's
best to move on.

04:02.966 --> 04:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REX TILLERSON: The president's
rightly focused on, how do we
move forward from what may be

04:08.966 --> 04:11.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
simply an intractable
disagreement at this point?

04:11.700 --> 04:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the relationship
-- and the president
made this clear as well
-- it's too important.

04:16.466 --> 04:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's too important to not
find a way to move forward,
not dismissing the issue in

04:21.933 --> 04:24.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
any way.

04:24.033 --> 04:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: The two leaders
also discussed a cease-fire
plan in place for southwestern

04:27.600 --> 04:29.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Syria.

04:29.666 --> 04:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REX TILLERSON: I think this is
our first indication of the U.S.
and Russia being able to work

04:35.600 --> 04:38.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
together in Syria, and as a
result of that, we had a very
lengthy discussion regarding

04:40.766 --> 04:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other areas in Syria that we
can continue to work together
on to de-escalate the areas.

04:46.766 --> 04:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: Tillerson,
though, reiterated
the U.S. position that
Syrian President Bashar

04:49.233 --> 04:53.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
al-Assad must eventually
go, something Russia
has publicly opposed.

04:53.466 --> 04:58.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All the while, outside today's
summit, there was no letup
in massive demonstrations.

05:00.366 --> 05:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clashes between protesters
and police engulfed Germany's
second largest city.

05:04.533 --> 05:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police again resorted to
water cannons and tear gas to
disperse crowds, and scores were

05:08.933 --> 05:10.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
arrested.

05:10.900 --> 05:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
German officials say more
than 100 police officers
have been injured.

05:17.400 --> 05:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile everyone here
inside the G20 conference
center, and, by that I
mean, not just journalists,

05:23.733 --> 05:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but a lot of the G20 delegations
as well, are focused on
trying to find out as much

05:29.433 --> 05:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as they possibly can what
actually was discussed
behind closed doors
between the presidents

05:31.900 --> 05:33.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the United States
and Russia -- Judy.

05:33.966 --> 05:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're right,
a lot of questions, Ryan,
two hours and 20 minutes.

05:37.733 --> 05:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, this
contradiction that is
apparently there, you have
the Russian foreign minister

05:44.633 --> 05:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying that President Trump
accent President Putin's denial
about Russian metaling and

05:50.266 --> 05:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then, as we heard, Secretary
of State Rex Tillerson is
saying they just -- they are

05:55.000 --> 05:57.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
intractably in disagreement.

05:57.166 --> 05:59.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, how do we read this?

05:59.300 --> 06:03.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RYAN CHILCOTE: Yes,
it's an interesting one.

06:03.233 --> 06:06.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The straight answer is,
we really don't know
exactly what was said.

06:06.833 --> 06:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Russian foreign minister,
as you pointed out, did indeed
say that President Trump had

06:11.633 --> 06:14.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
accepted President
Putin's denial.

06:14.433 --> 06:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now, I thought about this.

06:16.466 --> 06:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You could have theoretically
accept something without
concurring with the view.

06:22.566 --> 06:24.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But that's not
what happened here.

06:24.033 --> 06:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I listened to all of the Russian
foreign minister's comments.

06:26.333 --> 06:28.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have been speaking
Russian for 28 years.

06:28.800 --> 06:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And together with a group of six
native speakers, we went through
the entire statement on the

06:34.433 --> 06:35.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issue.

06:35.433 --> 06:37.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He went much further.

06:37.466 --> 06:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said, right, that President
Trump has also asserted in this
meeting that he hadn't heard

06:40.700 --> 06:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a single fact in the
month of allegations of
meddling in the election.

06:47.700 --> 06:52.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, how does that meddle
-- sort of fit in with what
Rex Tillerson was saying?

06:52.066 --> 06:56.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, interesting, the U.S.
secretary of state kind of gave
us some mixed signals, didn't

06:56.366 --> 06:58.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
he?

06:58.366 --> 07:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On one the hand, he began the
press conference by saying
that President Trump had really

07:00.600 --> 07:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pressed President Putin and
pushed him on this issue, but
he also said -- and I quote

07:07.600 --> 07:11.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - "The two presidents didn't
relitigate the past, that
they were committed to working

07:11.700 --> 07:13.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
towards the future."

07:13.766 --> 07:17.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was the U.S.' position
that the best way to do that
was to try in the future to

07:17.133 --> 07:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
win some kind of guarantee,
some kind of commitment
in writing from the
Russians that they wouldn't

07:21.500 --> 07:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interfere in the future in U.S.
domestic policy or elections.

07:24.933 --> 07:27.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let
me turn you to Syria.

07:27.633 --> 07:32.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After the meeting, it was
announced that the two countries
have agreed on a cease-fire

07:32.166 --> 07:36.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for a part of Syria and
that ongoing civil war.

07:36.566 --> 07:39.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What do we know about
the details of that?

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: So, what we know
is that both the United States
and Russia have been discussing

07:45.933 --> 07:48.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this for some time.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It looks like most
of the agreement was
worked out in advance.

07:50.933 --> 07:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They signed a memorandum of
understanding between Russia,
the United States and Jordan

07:55.233 --> 08:00.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that they would have
a cease-fire that will
begin shortly in the
south in Syria, and that

08:00.200 --> 08:05.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there would be a plan to
de-escalate or lower, reduce the
violence in the southwest of the

08:05.633 --> 08:07.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

08:07.633 --> 08:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The secretary of state did
say that there was still a
couple more meetings that were

08:10.833 --> 08:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
necessary, maybe another week
to work out the details of who
would actually be providing

08:14.633 --> 08:16.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
security on the ground.

08:16.666 --> 08:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would point out that,
remember, it's not just Russia
and the United States that

08:19.433 --> 08:20.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have forces in Syria.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Iran does as well.

08:22.366 --> 08:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it would be interesting
to see how they fit
into this agreement.

08:24.900 --> 08:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would also point out that
we have had four cease-fire
agreements before this.

08:30.633 --> 08:32.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: True.

08:32.800 --> 08:36.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Ryan, finally, so many
journalists there and
others watching this
meeting today between

08:37.533 --> 08:39.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Russian and
the U.S. president.

08:39.166 --> 08:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are people taking away?

08:41.200 --> 08:44.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What did you take away from
this, I mean, in terms of how
they addressed -- how they

08:44.466 --> 08:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
looked when they were
together, what they said?

08:47.133 --> 08:52.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RYAN CHILCOTE: Well, the
body language was warm.

08:52.866 --> 08:53.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's no doubt.

08:53.800 --> 08:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no questioning that.

08:54.833 --> 08:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You could really see that.

08:56.900 --> 09:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Putin, for his part,
when he was speaking Russian,
he was very differential.

09:01.933 --> 09:04.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He was very polite.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was very -- went out of
his way to be respectful,
calling President Trump
"Mr. President" as

09:09.033 --> 09:11.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he addressed him.

09:11.566 --> 09:15.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then we heard from
Rex Tillerson say that
their chemistry was
very positive, that they

09:15.266 --> 09:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
immediately, almost immediately
took to one another.

09:17.833 --> 09:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, interestingly, I thought
he also added that no one could
stop the meeting, that several

09:24.300 --> 09:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
aides peaked in through the door
to try and break up the meeting.

09:27.400 --> 09:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at one point, they even sent
Melania Trump into the meeting
to try and break it up, and

09:31.566 --> 09:36.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that she too failed, and
that the two presidents,
despite everyone else's
wishes, went on talking

09:36.000 --> 09:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for another hour because they
so enjoyed the conversation.

09:39.466 --> 09:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fascinating that
they ignored the first lady's
efforts to get it to stop.

09:44.233 --> 09:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All right, Ryan Chilcote,
reporting for us from
Hamburg, Germany, thank you.

09:51.633 --> 09:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will hear from
Britain's defense secretary,
Michael Fallon, on Syria,
on Russia and other

09:54.533 --> 09:57.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
issues right after
the news summary.

09:57.633 --> 10:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
U.S., Japan and South Korea
have agreed to apply -- quote

10:01.933 --> 10:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - "maximum pressure" after
North Korea's intercontinental
ballistic missile test.

10:06.566 --> 10:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a joint statement, they
said they will push for a U.N.
Security Council resolution

10:11.200 --> 10:14.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to apply new sanctions
on Pyongyang.

10:14.333 --> 10:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if the North -- quote
-- "chooses the right path,"
the countries stand ready to

10:18.833 --> 10:20.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
offer a brighter future.

10:20.766 --> 10:24.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Experts believe the
missile launched Tuesday
could reach Alaska.

10:24.700 --> 10:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, today, North Korean
state TV broadcast a
message aimed at the U.S.

10:31.666 --> 10:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
North Korea makes it clear once
again that its development of

10:37.333 --> 10:40.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an intercontinental
ballistic rocket is an option
taken to defend itself.

10:40.866 --> 10:45.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The test is a gift
package addressed to
none other than the U.S.

10:45.400 --> 10:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. will receive more gift
packages as it tries harder to
destroy, by means of sanctions

10:52.400 --> 10:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and pressure, the overall
national power and strategic
position of North Korea.

10:55.366 --> 11:00.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The
U.S./Japan/South Korea
statement also called
on nations that border

11:00.000 --> 11:03.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
North Korea to help
reduce the threat.

11:03.166 --> 11:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is an unmistakable
reference to Pyongyang's
closest ally, China, whose
leader meets tomorrow

11:08.900 --> 11:11.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with President Trump.

11:11.533 --> 11:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump also met today
with Mexico's President
Enrique Pena Nieto, and
emphasized the importance

11:16.700 --> 11:19.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of renegotiating the
NAFTA trade agreement.

11:19.166 --> 11:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was the first face-to-face
meeting between the pair since
President Trump took office.

11:24.066 --> 11:29.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He hailed Pena Nieto
as his friend, but said
that he absolutely still
wants Mexico to pay

11:30.533 --> 11:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for a proposed border wall
between the two countries.

11:34.533 --> 11:39.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Egypt, a suicide car bombing
left at least 23 soldiers dead
on the Sinai Peninsula, the

11:40.966 --> 11:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
worst attack there in years.

11:43.100 --> 11:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Islamic State group claimed
responsibility for the incident
at a checkpoint south of

11:47.733 --> 11:49.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Rafah.

11:49.733 --> 11:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, in Iraq, ISIS
fighters are still clinging to
a shrinking pocket of territory

11:54.366 --> 11:55.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Mosul.

11:55.666 --> 11:57.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Iraqi government forces
laid out the difficulty.

11:57.833 --> 12:00.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ABDUL WAHAB AL-SAADI,
Iraqi Lieutenant General
(through translator):
We are facing challenges

12:00.900 --> 12:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that slow down our operations.

12:03.133 --> 12:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's because the Islamic
State group is using civilians
as human shields, especially

12:08.866 --> 12:10.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
children and women.

12:10.900 --> 12:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why we advance
very slowly, because we
have to protect their lives.

12:12.966 --> 12:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also today, the
Pentagon said that airstrikes
by the U.S.-led coalition

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in Iraq and Syria have
killed a total of more
than 600 civilians.

12:23.433 --> 12:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is since the start of the
anti-ISIS campaign in 2014.

12:29.333 --> 12:31.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Back in this country,
hiring surged more
than expected in June.

12:31.966 --> 12:36.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Labor Department says
U.S. employers added 222,000
jobs, the most in four months.

12:39.033 --> 12:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the unemployment rate ticked
up slightly, from 4.3 percent
to 4.4 percent, as more people

12:45.833 --> 12:47.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
looked for work.

12:47.900 --> 12:52.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Analysts say the positive report
is likely to lead to another
hike in the Federal Reserve's

12:53.133 --> 12:54.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
key interest rate.

12:54.800 --> 12:58.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For now, that news drove
stock prices higher
on Wall Street today.

12:58.433 --> 13:03.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Dow Jones industrial
average gained 94 points
today to close at 21414.

13:03.366 --> 13:08.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Nasdaq rose 63, and
the S&amp;P 500 added 15.

13:09.900 --> 13:14.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For the week, all three
indexes edged up a
fraction of a percent.

13:14.133 --> 13:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. Attorney General Jeff
Sessions visited the military
prison at Guantanamo Bay today.

13:21.033 --> 13:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was joined by Deputy Attorney
General Rod Rosenstein, and
by Dan Coats, the director

13:25.866 --> 13:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of national intelligence.

13:27.866 --> 13:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sessions has called Guantanamo
a -- quote - - "perfectly
acceptable place" for detaining

13:33.100 --> 13:35.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
terror suspects.

13:35.200 --> 13:38.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A Justice Department spokesman
said that the visit was meant to
get an up-to-date understanding

13:39.700 --> 13:41.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of current operations.

13:41.733 --> 13:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And an influential press
freedom group is criticizing a
report by Republican senators

13:47.533 --> 13:50.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about leaks of
government information.

13:50.166 --> 13:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The document released yesterday
which was sent to the attorney
general says that leaks

13:54.700 --> 13:57.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are harming national security.

13:57.066 --> 14:01.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Committee to Protect
Journalists said it
seems intended to have
a chilling effect,

14:01.666 --> 14:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and resembles measures seen
-- quote -- "more often in
authoritarian countries."

14:08.566 --> 14:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
I sit down with the United
Kingdom's defense secretary;

14:14.533 --> 14:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans considering
alternatives in their fight to
replace the Affordable Care Act;

14:20.400 --> 14:24.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
low-income housing
with a focus on healthy
living; and much more.

14:33.400 --> 14:38.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As part of the G20 summit this
weekend, President Trump will
meet with the United Kingdom's

14:38.300 --> 14:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
prime minister, Theresa May.

14:40.766 --> 14:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will have much to discuss,
from the fight against ISIS,
to the role of NATO, and how

14:45.533 --> 14:49.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their broader agendas differ
from those of European allies.

14:49.166 --> 14:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A short time ago, I spoke
with the U.K.'s defense
secretary, Sir Michael Fallon.

14:56.166 --> 14:59.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I began by asking him about
the differing accounts of what
Mr. Trump said to President

14:59.266 --> 15:02.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Putin about Russian meddling
in last year's U.S. election.

15:02.966 --> 15:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON, U.K.
Defense Secretary: It
was an important meeting.

15:05.433 --> 15:08.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was right that they should
meet reasonably early on.

15:08.566 --> 15:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's right that they should get
along, because there's quite a
bit to talk to Russia about.

15:12.433 --> 15:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You had said
earlier that the U.S. should
go into that meeting warily.

15:16.733 --> 15:19.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Does it sound to you as
if that's what happened?

15:19.166 --> 15:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well, we
have to engage with Russia.

15:21.533 --> 15:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That can't be business as usual
with Russia while the Crimea
remains annexed, while Ukraine

15:28.466 --> 15:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is being interfered with.

15:30.133 --> 15:32.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It can't be business as usual.

15:32.200 --> 15:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we think it important to
have a dialogue with Russia to
try and de-escalate any tensions

15:39.233 --> 15:42.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that there are and to
ensure that where Russia
does have influence in
the world -- and Syria

15:43.800 --> 15:47.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
is one example -- that
we can bring Russia's
influence to bear.

15:47.766 --> 15:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you work
very closely obviously with
the intelligence community.

15:51.500 --> 15:56.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We know that President
Trump has challenged the
intelligence community
-- the U.S. intelligence

15:57.933 --> 16:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
community's reporting on Russian
interference in the election.

16:02.433 --> 16:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What effect might that have
on Russia and its continuing
efforts to interfere here in

16:07.133 --> 16:09.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the U.S. and in Europe?

16:09.233 --> 16:12.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well, we
know Russia intervened in
some elections in Europe.

16:12.366 --> 16:16.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That, we do know, in
the Dutch referendum,
in the French elections.

16:16.700 --> 16:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's been an attempted coup
in Montenegro that Russia was
suspected of being involved

16:21.700 --> 16:23.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

16:23.766 --> 16:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we know there's been
this pattern of behavior
by Russia in recent years.

16:29.266 --> 16:31.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But I'm not able to
comment on what happened
here in your election.

16:31.600 --> 16:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But to the
extent President Trump is
challenging the work of the U.S.

16:38.933 --> 16:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community, does that
have an effect on
intelligence work abroad,
internationally, cooperation

16:44.633 --> 16:47.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
between the U.S. and
allies like the U.K.?

16:47.500 --> 16:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well,
there's no closer cooperation
on intelligence than
between us and the United

16:52.200 --> 16:54.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

16:54.533 --> 16:58.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our services work extremely
closely together, both
in monitoring what
Russia is doing, but

16:58.933 --> 17:00.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
also against terrorism.

17:00.266 --> 17:01.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So it's a very close
relationship to us.

17:01.833 --> 17:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's very important to us.

17:03.100 --> 17:05.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let
me turn to Syria.

17:05.866 --> 17:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're told the two
presidents did discuss Syria.

17:08.500 --> 17:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in fact, after their
meeting, it was reported that
they have agreed on a cease-fire

17:12.333 --> 17:15.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for a section of
southwestern Syria.

17:15.833 --> 17:18.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you know about that?

17:18.000 --> 17:21.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well
any cease-fire has got
to be good news in the
civil war that's gone

17:21.800 --> 17:23.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on are for so long now.

17:23.900 --> 17:28.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But there's been many
cease-fires before that
have turned out not to
be cease-fires at all.

17:28.166 --> 17:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have seen up in Aleppo
in the north of Syria, we have
seen Russia allowing Syria

17:35.433 --> 17:38.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to go on bombing its
own civilians, bombing
hospitals after a cease-fire
has been declared.

17:40.233 --> 17:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, this one is welcome, but
it has got to be enforced, it's
got to be an actual cease-fire.

17:45.366 --> 17:46.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
what do you look for?

17:46.466 --> 17:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's the evidence of that?

17:49.300 --> 17:53.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You want to see when it
takes effect and what
the ground rules are?

17:53.233 --> 17:55.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL FALLON: Yes.

17:55.366 --> 17:57.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want to see it applied to
those on the ground, so that
we can get humanitarian aid

17:57.666 --> 18:01.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
into those towns and
villages that have been
cut off in the fighting.

18:01.633 --> 18:03.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We can get aid through.

18:03.266 --> 18:06.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And we need to be
absolutely sure that it
really is a cease-fire.

18:06.533 --> 18:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But let's hope this one sticks
and brings some peace to that
part of Syria down in the

18:12.300 --> 18:14.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
southwestern corner.

18:14.366 --> 18:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Can a cease-fire
make a difference, though, when
the two sides disagree about

18:17.233 --> 18:19.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whether President Assad
should stay in power?

18:19.533 --> 18:22.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The U.S. has said that
it wants him removed.

18:22.266 --> 18:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Russians are still
saying they want him to stay.

18:24.333 --> 18:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well, we
don't see any long-term
future for Assad in Syria.

18:28.333 --> 18:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a man who has attacked
his own people, who has
barrel-bombed his own people.

18:32.800 --> 18:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's used chemical weapons
against his own people.

18:34.933 --> 18:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't think he can be part of
the long-term future of Syria.

18:41.833 --> 18:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what we do want to see
happening is the - - is all
those parties that are prepared

18:43.933 --> 18:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to work to a more democratic
Syria working together now to
bring about a new settlement.

18:51.033 --> 18:54.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we're encouraging
the Russia-sponsored
process in Astana and
the other negotiations

18:54.800 --> 18:59.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that are going in Geneva
to bring those together
and see if everybody
can get around the table

19:00.966 --> 19:02.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
now and plot a different
future for Syria.

19:02.966 --> 19:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But can there be
progress of any kind, whether
it's a cease-fire or some

19:07.466 --> 19:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other sort of step forward
together, when the two sides
still disagree over Mr. Assad

19:14.566 --> 19:16.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and his future?

19:16.000 --> 19:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well,
there is disagreement, yes.

19:17.500 --> 19:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't think he can be part of
the long-term future of Syria.

19:21.366 --> 19:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we do want to see the
political process get under way
that will lead Syria to a more

19:28.400 --> 19:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plural kind of government that
is genuinely representative
of all the different groupings

19:32.133 --> 19:34.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Syria.

19:34.233 --> 19:37.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask you
about another troubled part of
the world, and that is North

19:37.066 --> 19:39.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Korea.

19:39.100 --> 19:43.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know that you and U.S.
Defense Secretary James
Mattis discussed that.

19:43.800 --> 19:45.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What can you tell us?

19:45.466 --> 19:47.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well,
it's a problem not just
for the United States.

19:47.166 --> 19:51.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Obviously, the United
States is coming within
range of these missiles.

19:51.666 --> 19:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But what the North Koreans
have done is something illegal.

19:54.966 --> 19:56.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's something provocative.

19:56.766 --> 19:58.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's unacceptable.

19:58.866 --> 20:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have now got to respond
as an international community,
not just the United States.

20:03.333 --> 20:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not right the United
States has to bear this
problem on its own.

20:07.066 --> 20:12.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have got to work much harder
now through the United Nations
to see whether the sanctions

20:14.033 --> 20:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that have already been applied
are working properly, to
consider additional sanctions,

20:19.233 --> 20:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, thirdly, to bring more
pressure to bear on China to
get the kind of changes that we

20:23.666 --> 20:25.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
need in that regime.

20:25.700 --> 20:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, as you
know, President Trump has been
tweeting a lot about this.

20:28.833 --> 20:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said the other day words to
the effect it looks like that
what the Chinese did hasn't

20:35.266 --> 20:38.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had any effect, they're still
trading with North Korea.

20:38.866 --> 20:40.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Are these kinds of
comments helpful?

20:40.966 --> 20:45.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well, we all
have to, I think, step back now
and see and look very carefully

20:46.833 --> 20:48.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at what has worked and
what has not worked.

20:48.066 --> 20:50.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have had seven United
Nations resolution.

20:50.733 --> 20:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clearly, a nuclear program of
this kind can't have been put
together without access to the

20:58.200 --> 21:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
raw materials, the
components involved, and
indeed to the finance
that you need to construct

21:03.100 --> 21:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them, to put it all together.

21:05.200 --> 21:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, clearly, the sanctions may
have been breached, and we need
to look at them, see where those

21:08.766 --> 21:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gaps are in the sanctions,
and whether a new resolution
can impose a tougher regime on

21:15.666 --> 21:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
North Korea or indeed on any
other companies and individuals,
Chinese or otherwise, who

21:21.466 --> 21:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
may have been helping them.

21:23.400 --> 21:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there
agreement between the U.S.,
U.K. and other nations with the

21:28.266 --> 21:30.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
same interests on what
should come next with
regard to North Korea?

21:30.966 --> 21:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Well, there is
agreement that, first of all, we
have to work this diplomatically

21:37.833 --> 21:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and economically through
sanctions, that we have to raise
the price of what the North

21:43.533 --> 21:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Koreans are doing to deter
them from carrying out
further tests in future.

21:49.033 --> 21:51.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's agreement
amongst us on that.

21:51.133 --> 21:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're all working hard on
that at the United Nations in
New York to move that agreement

21:55.466 --> 21:57.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forward.

21:57.566 --> 21:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: With all due
respect, though, there have
been sanctions in place.

21:59.600 --> 22:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: There has been
sanctions, and some clearly
have not been enforced.

22:01.300 --> 22:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we need to look at that.

22:03.333 --> 22:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then we need to look and
see whether a new, tougher
resolution is required.

22:07.233 --> 22:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will be looking at that
in the European Union framework
as well over in Europe to

22:13.666 --> 22:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see who may have been trading
with North Korea and so on.

22:15.766 --> 22:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Russians
and the Chinese have proposed
that the North Koreans freeze

22:22.566 --> 22:25.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their missile program, their
nuclear program, in exchange
for which the South Koreans and

22:27.666 --> 22:32.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the United States would stop
or pull back on these joint
military exercises and remove

22:34.466 --> 22:37.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the THAAD missile
defense system.

22:37.533 --> 22:39.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is that any sort of
a realistic proposal?

22:39.933 --> 22:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: No, because
it's a false comparison.

22:42.700 --> 22:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Military exercises or missile
defense, these are legitimate
things for nations to have

22:48.600 --> 22:49.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and to do.

22:49.866 --> 22:52.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What North Korea is
doing is illegal.

22:52.800 --> 22:57.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's completely illegal
under the treaties,
under international law.

22:57.400 --> 22:59.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a breach of United
Nations resolutions.

22:59.600 --> 23:03.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you can't compare it with
military exercises in the South.

23:03.366 --> 23:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One other thing
I do want to ask you about,
that is, President Trump's

23:06.533 --> 23:07.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
theme yesterday.

23:07.733 --> 23:11.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He spoke to the Polish
people in Warsaw.

23:11.966 --> 23:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he spoke about the threat
to Western civilization.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He talked about it being
at a risk of decline.

23:18.233 --> 23:21.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And he asked if the West
has the will to survive.

23:21.266 --> 23:26.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this the sort of language
that you think is going to bring
the Western allies together

23:27.400 --> 23:29.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in their fight
against extremism?

23:29.666 --> 23:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: We do have
values in common in the West.

23:33.533 --> 23:37.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And we do need to speak
up for those values
and to remember them.

23:37.400 --> 23:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're being attacked in the
West, not because those values
have failed, but because we have

23:42.400 --> 23:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been successful and we
have spread some of those
values around the world.

23:45.866 --> 23:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, that was an important
message yesterday.

23:47.900 --> 23:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was coupled, of course,
with a reminder that the United
States stands behind Article

23:54.733 --> 23:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
5 of the NATO treaty
that believes in the
collective defense of NATO.

23:57.800 --> 24:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If one of us is attacked,
then the others must
come to its help.

24:01.500 --> 24:05.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sir Michael
Fallon, Britain's defense
secretary, thank you very much.

24:05.700 --> 24:10.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON: Thank you.

24:12.700 --> 24:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Aside from the
many international issues before
President Trump this week, his

24:26.133 --> 24:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first major push on domestic
policy is facing an uphill
climb in the Senate.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang has this checkup.

24:34.066 --> 24:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: When last we left
the saga of the Republicans'
attempt to repeal and replace

24:40.300 --> 24:43.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the Affordable Care Act,
Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell didn't have
the votes for the Senate

24:43.433 --> 24:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bill, so lawmakers headed home
for the Fourth of July recess.

24:47.300 --> 24:49.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Where do things stand
as the recess ends?

24:49.566 --> 24:51.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let's turn to our
own Lisa Desjardins.

24:51.533 --> 24:56.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Lisa, has this week off
helped or hurt McConnell's
efforts to get this bill passed?

24:58.000 --> 25:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It has not
helped, and that has hurt.

25:00.300 --> 25:04.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We see some Republicans who
are not usually in the middle
of these situations, like John

25:04.066 --> 25:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hoeven of North Dakota, for
example, meeting not just with
constituents, but with hospital

25:08.733 --> 25:10.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
administrators, those
kinds of people.

25:10.766 --> 25:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he came away with those
meetings having, stressing
problems with the bill.

25:14.300 --> 25:19.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Then, yesterday, Mitch
McConnell, the majority
leader, spoke to a
rotary club in Kentucky.

25:19.166 --> 25:24.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said this quote that
got a lot of attention:
"If my side is unable
to agree on an adequate

25:26.100 --> 25:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
replacement, then some kind
of action with regard to the
private health insurance market

25:28.900 --> 25:30.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
must occur.

25:30.533 --> 25:32.933 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
No action is not
an alternative."

25:32.933 --> 25:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His office insists he said
things like this before,
but the timing is key.

25:37.633 --> 25:39.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This was a bill that was
supposed to be voted on already.

25:39.766 --> 25:43.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John, leadership sources tell
me they would still like a new
revised bill next week, maybe

25:43.766 --> 25:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a vote the following week.

25:45.300 --> 25:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that seems unclear now
if it will really happen.

25:48.133 --> 25:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Seems like Mitch
McConnell was sending a message.

25:50.166 --> 25:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, who are the key players that
he was sending that message to?

25:54.333 --> 25:55.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: You
got it exactly right.

25:55.500 --> 25:57.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We talked so much
about moderates before.

25:57.233 --> 25:59.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now it's all about
the conservatives.

25:59.200 --> 26:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was saying to conservatives,
we have to revise these bills,
or we have lost our shot

26:03.000 --> 26:05.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of having anything
as Republicans.

26:05.133 --> 26:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's compare two conservatives
who spoke in town halls
yesterday's sound bites, first

26:11.000 --> 26:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from Texas Senator Ted Cruz.

26:11.533 --> 26:13.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

26:13.466 --> 26:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TED CRUZ (R), Texas: 2010,
2014, and 2016, repealing
Obamacare was front and center.

26:20.500 --> 26:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, I recognize that some folks
may not agree with that, but
the voters, repealing Obamacare

26:27.466 --> 26:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was the single biggest factor
producing a Republican House,
a Republican Senate, and

26:31.400 --> 26:33.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think ultimately a
Republican president.

26:33.400 --> 26:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: So, that's
an animated Ted Cruz.

26:35.500 --> 26:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is trying to change this
revised bill to try and get
it across the finish line.

26:39.700 --> 26:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But compare that with
Kansas Senator Jerry Moran.

26:42.233 --> 26:44.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

26:44.266 --> 26:48.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JERRY MORAN (R),
Kansas: I believe in the
legislative process that
allows public debate,

26:50.166 --> 26:55.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
public discussions,
testimony, amendments
offered by all senators.

26:57.133 --> 27:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The bill comes to the Senate
floor, amendments offered by all
senators, and figure out where

27:02.133 --> 27:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there are 60 votes to pass
something that is so important
to so many Americans.

27:08.066 --> 27:11.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: How about
that key number, 60 votes?

27:11.033 --> 27:12.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That means Democrats would
need to be to be involved.

27:12.900 --> 27:14.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's coming
from a conservative.

27:14.100 --> 27:16.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: So, what
are the options?

27:16.133 --> 27:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What can Mitch McConnell try
to do to get the votes he needs
to pass a bill in the Senate?

27:22.966 --> 27:24.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: There are no
easy options left, but there
are three options that seem

27:24.566 --> 27:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to define the possible paths
right now for Mr. McConnell.

27:28.066 --> 27:29.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The first is to revise the bill.

27:29.966 --> 27:31.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's what we have
been talking about.

27:31.200 --> 27:33.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They do hope to offer
a revised bill soon.

27:33.666 --> 27:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But can it get enough votes?

27:35.233 --> 27:36.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Unclear.

27:36.233 --> 27:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The second is a full repeal.

27:37.633 --> 27:40.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's something Rand
Paul and Ted Cruz want.

27:40.766 --> 27:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
However, with that full repeal
would come a replacement later.

27:44.233 --> 27:46.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And many of my sources
in the Republican Party
say that is too risky.

27:46.933 --> 27:49.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It's also an
option that the president
raised last week.

27:49.466 --> 27:51.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's correct.

27:51.066 --> 27:53.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But this doesn't seem
to have the votes right
now in the Senate.

27:53.033 --> 27:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then the third option would be
smaller fixes to the Affordable
Care Act, something that

27:56.333 --> 27:59.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
stabilizes the market
and fixes what people
think are problems now.

27:59.900 --> 28:02.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That would involve
the Democrats as well.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That would keep ACA
essentially as it this, just
make little nicks and cuts

28:05.533 --> 28:06.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
around the edges.

28:06.533 --> 28:07.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Potentially.

28:07.966 --> 28:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It would be a much smaller
bill at that point.

28:09.200 --> 28:10.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: That's what
the Democrats want.

28:10.133 --> 28:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

28:12.233 --> 28:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: So, as we sit here,
with the Senate about to come
back next week, what are the

28:15.400 --> 28:16.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
odds?

28:16.400 --> 28:18.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are the chances?

28:18.400 --> 28:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What does your gut tell you
about the chances of, A, the
Senate passing something and, if

28:21.933 --> 28:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that happens, B, getting
something to the president's
desk for his signature?

28:25.000 --> 28:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, I have
the sense that almost no one
knows exactly what's going to

28:27.733 --> 28:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happen now, but I would say,
given that and given the way
the Senate works, the odds are

28:31.633 --> 28:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
long, both on a bill passing
the Senate and even longer on
it getting to the president's

28:35.000 --> 28:37.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
desk, as things stand right now.

28:37.066 --> 28:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But the odds are
good you're going to have a busy
week next week, when the Senate

28:39.433 --> 28:40.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
comes back.

28:40.433 --> 28:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think so.

28:42.600 --> 28:47.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Thanks, Lisa.

28:48.466 --> 28:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

28:55.633 --> 28:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
David Brooks and Ruth
Marcus give their take
on the president's

28:59.700 --> 29:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
meeting with Vladimir Putin;
and a linguistic professor's
defense of social media.

29:07.566 --> 29:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But first: an experiment in
rethinking public housing that
encourages healthier living by

29:13.933 --> 29:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
changing the larger
environment for residents.

29:16.600 --> 29:18.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown
reports from Denver.

29:18.700 --> 29:23.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: At age 71, Noel
Taylor says she's become more
active and health-conscious

29:25.733 --> 29:27.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than ever before.

29:27.766 --> 29:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NOEL TAYLOR, Denver: Every
year, I improve my diet,
I improve my exercise.

29:33.566 --> 29:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Her
change in behavior didn't
happen by accident.

29:35.733 --> 29:40.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Four years ago, here in
downtown Denver, Taylor
joined an experiment in
making healthy living

29:41.933 --> 29:46.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
part of the design
and daily life of a
public housing project.

29:46.033 --> 29:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Among the amenities here,
access to a garden plot.

29:48.900 --> 29:52.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NOEL TAYLOR: I noticed,
all summer long, I
was getting healthier.

29:52.800 --> 29:57.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The more of my own
vegetables I was eating,
the more energy I had.

29:58.666 --> 30:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's made a huge difference.

30:00.100 --> 30:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, this sounds
all too good to be true.

30:01.633 --> 30:02.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NOEL TAYLOR: I know.

30:02.866 --> 30:03.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

30:03.866 --> 30:05.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And there's more.

30:05.866 --> 30:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Denver Botanic Gardens
hosts a farmers market giving
away free produce to residents.

30:11.866 --> 30:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: We're going to talk about
how to shop healthy on a budget.

30:13.866 --> 30:17.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Another group
offers classes on healthy
recipes and shopping.

30:17.066 --> 30:19.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: Now we will take
your blood pressure.

30:19.100 --> 30:22.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: In a
clinic on the ground
floor of one building,
public health physicians

30:22.866 --> 30:27.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
schedule regular visits
to do routine checkups.

30:27.300 --> 30:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a light rail stop, both
for easy transportation and to
get residents out of their cars.

30:33.166 --> 30:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Do the other side now.

30:35.733 --> 30:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Plus,
bike rentals and a nearby
shop to teach kids how
to maintain their bikes.

30:41.333 --> 30:45.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even the architecture and public
art was designed to encourage
residents to get outside and

30:46.600 --> 30:48.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
take a walk.

30:48.600 --> 30:49.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISMAEL GUERRERO, Director,
Denver Housing Authority: We
really wanted this to look like

30:49.866 --> 30:51.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a neighborhood,
not a development.

30:51.866 --> 30:55.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Ismael Guerrero,
director of the Denver Housing
Authority, says that, 10

30:57.600 --> 31:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years ago, this was a high-crime
neighborhood, with 250 units
of rundown public housing.

31:02.666 --> 31:04.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Something had to be done.

31:04.666 --> 31:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISMAEL GUERRERO: What we
learned in early conversations
with residents in particular

31:07.466 --> 31:11.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was, they didn't just want
a new unit to move into.

31:11.166 --> 31:13.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They wanted a better
quality of life.

31:13.166 --> 31:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we really started expanding
our perspective on what we
were trying to accomplish here.

31:17.600 --> 31:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The result
completed earlier this summer
is the Mariposa development, a

31:24.600 --> 31:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mixture of 800 apartments and
town homes, one-third public
housing, a third subsidized,

31:28.900 --> 31:31.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and a third rented
at market value.

31:31.600 --> 31:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The overall cost was
$150 million; $60 million
came from federal, state
and local government

31:38.266 --> 31:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
programs, with the rest coming
through private investment.

31:41.800 --> 31:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Already, Mariposa is
becoming a model for
rethinking public housing.

31:46.166 --> 31:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISMAEL GUERRERO: Part of it is
physical health, and part of
it is what we call neighborhood

31:50.900 --> 31:51.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
health.

31:51.900 --> 31:52.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

31:52.900 --> 31:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How healthy is the place?

31:53.900 --> 31:55.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is it safe?

31:55.333 --> 31:57.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are there healthy
activities for you to do?

31:57.166 --> 32:00.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Is there healthy food
in the neighborhood
for you to go and eat?

32:00.633 --> 32:03.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there a healthy economy
where people can get jobs
and start a business?

32:03.900 --> 32:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The Osage
Cafe, located in one of the
apartment buildings, is designed

32:08.600 --> 32:10.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to meet some of those needs.

32:10.666 --> 32:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In addition to the food, it
provides culinary training and
internships for young people

32:16.866 --> 32:18.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the neighborhood, like
20-year-old Israel Trejo.

32:18.966 --> 32:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISRAEL TREJO, Denver: And I
think that's where I discovered
I had a passion for cooking.

32:22.233 --> 32:24.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: What
did it give you?

32:24.166 --> 32:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISRAEL TREJO: It gave me
the entire world, basically.

32:26.733 --> 32:30.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Like, with the skills
that I have learned now,
I could go anywhere.

32:30.033 --> 32:32.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I could go be anything.

32:32.133 --> 32:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Trejo now has
a job at one of Denver's top
restaurants, and plans to

32:35.833 --> 32:37.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
operate his own food truck soon.

32:37.866 --> 32:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGELA RODRIGUEZ, Denver:
Are you looking forward to
helping me grow some fruits and

32:41.433 --> 32:43.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
vegetables?

32:43.400 --> 32:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Angela Rodriguez,
a single mother of two teens,
dreams of one day buying

32:48.033 --> 32:50.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
her own home.

32:50.100 --> 32:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She has a full-time job at a
nearby community college, but
Denver's booming housing market

32:55.033 --> 32:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
makes ownership difficult.

32:57.100 --> 33:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She lives in a subsidized town
home at Mariposa, which she
says is very different from the

33:01.933 --> 33:04.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
old-style projects
she grew up in nearby.

33:04.366 --> 33:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGELA RODRIGUEZ: As a new
style of public housing, it did
take me a little bit of time

33:08.800 --> 33:11.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the adjustment.

33:11.200 --> 33:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When new tenants are
mingling with other tenants
that come from different
walks of life, it's

33:16.766 --> 33:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
helping us to develop into new
perspectives of modern living.

33:19.966 --> 33:24.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Rodriguez
uses public transportation,
has taken up gardening,
and has fully embraced

33:26.166 --> 33:29.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the culture of health
that is promoted here.

33:29.300 --> 33:31.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But is Mariposa working?

33:31.366 --> 33:33.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's too early for
definitive answers.

33:33.933 --> 33:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
According to a 2015 study by the
Denver Public Health Department,
about half the residents

33:40.766 --> 33:44.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had participated in
health-related activities
over the previous three years.

33:46.566 --> 33:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the study also showed the
amount of exercise residents
pursued had changed little.

33:51.600 --> 33:54.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Just over a third said they
exercised five times a week.

33:54.300 --> 33:59.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
About the same amount said they
exercised one to four times
a week, and 26 percent said

34:00.233 --> 34:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they rarely or never exercised.

34:02.266 --> 34:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Smoking rates decreased, but
only slightly, from 30 percent
of residents down to 24 percent.

34:08.866 --> 34:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And these so-called active
staircases, designed
with a bit of whimsy...

34:12.733 --> 34:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISMAEL GUERRERO: It's a way
to engage kids, and actually
now the adults enjoy it.

34:15.966 --> 34:19.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: ... to
lure residents away
from using the elevator.

34:19.200 --> 34:21.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Well, so far, they're
not having a big impact.

34:21.866 --> 34:25.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THERESA MICKIEWICZ, Denver
Public Health: We actually did
observational counts, where

34:25.400 --> 34:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we sat there and we counted
people who used the stairs vs.
people who used the elevator,

34:30.366 --> 34:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and we compared it
against a control
staircase in the Mariposa
redevelopment, and we found

34:37.800 --> 34:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
absolutely no difference.

34:40.100 --> 34:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Theresa
Mickiewicz, an epidemiologist
with Denver Public
Health, is overseeing a

34:43.900 --> 34:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
study of the development.

34:45.933 --> 34:50.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And while major improvements in
health remain to be seen, she
believes something important

34:50.333 --> 34:54.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
is happening here, and
she expects the numbers
to reflect that soon.

34:54.333 --> 34:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THERESA MICKIEWICZ: While
maintaining my objectivity
as an evaluator, do
I think that there is

35:00.266 --> 35:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
value in this type of project?

35:02.733 --> 35:04.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I would say yes.

35:04.733 --> 35:09.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Individually, these components
have been shown in the evidence,
in literature, to improve

35:10.166 --> 35:12.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
health outcomes.

35:12.700 --> 35:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The city
of Denver is so confident
in this new model,
it's about to embark on

35:15.733 --> 35:20.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a similar development
that will be three times
larger than Mariposa.

35:22.133 --> 35:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That construction is expected
to begin later next year.

35:24.033 --> 35:29.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Jeffrey Brown,
reporting from Denver.

35:31.000 --> 35:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, another
look at the major news of this
week, both foreign and domestic,

35:43.666 --> 35:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from today's pivotal meeting
between two presidents,
to new developments
with the Senate GOP's

35:49.400 --> 35:51.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
health care plan.

35:51.033 --> 35:53.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Here to provide analysis
of all that and more
is Brooks and Marcus.

35:53.933 --> 35:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's New York Times columnist
David Brooks and Ruth Marcus,
deputy editorial page editor

35:58.766 --> 36:00.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for The Washington Post.

36:00.933 --> 36:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mark Shields is away this week.

36:02.166 --> 36:04.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you on both.

36:04.233 --> 36:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the lead story today,
of course, President Trump
meets President Putin.

36:08.600 --> 36:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David, all eyes on this
meeting, the body language,
what did they say.

36:13.333 --> 36:15.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And then we have these
conflicting reports
coming out afterwards.

36:15.900 --> 36:17.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do we make of it?

36:17.866 --> 36:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, it
was sort of normal for a
Trump administration event.

36:20.966 --> 36:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He did raise the meddling
issue, which is a good thing.

36:24.700 --> 36:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it seemed a little
like, from the talking
points, they hit Syria,
they hit all the prints

36:28.700 --> 36:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a U.S. president would talk
to with a Russian president.

36:30.966 --> 36:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It seemed a bit like a normal
meeting, which is a good thing.

36:34.733 --> 36:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The abnormal part to me is how
small it was, that there are
only four people and then the

36:39.366 --> 36:43.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two translators in the room,
no H.R. McMaster, no national
security adviser, which is an

36:43.400 --> 36:45.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
oddity.

36:45.466 --> 36:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that gives them maximum
flexibility to say whatever
they want in the room and not

36:48.166 --> 36:50.200 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
have it reported
out of the room.

36:50.200 --> 36:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's what makes the point
about what they were saying
about the meddling or anything

36:53.666 --> 36:55.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
else totally mysterious.

36:55.233 --> 36:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Apparently, there were no
note-takers in the room.

36:58.033 --> 37:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it leaves a big
void in what they actually
said and whether Trump
really accepted the

37:04.166 --> 37:06.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
fact that Putin claims
he didn't meddle.

37:06.400 --> 37:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it's just a big void
that wouldn't exist if you
had the normal complement of

37:10.833 --> 37:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people in the room and the
normal note-takers in the room,
and you had some actual look

37:15.766 --> 37:17.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
into what sort of what
was happening in there.

37:17.833 --> 37:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A long meeting,
Ruth, but a lot of questions.

37:19.933 --> 37:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: Long meeting,
a lot of questions.

37:22.133 --> 37:25.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And normal is not the
way I would describe it.

37:25.333 --> 37:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think I should start by
the way President Trump started
with Vladimir Putin, which is,

37:31.500 --> 37:32.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's an honor to be
here with both of you.

37:32.966 --> 37:35.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is a true honor.

37:35.100 --> 37:38.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I thought for President Trump
to say -- and I understand we
have diplomatic niceties -- it

37:38.900 --> 37:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wasn't an honor to be with
someone who has attacked and
jailed dissidents and killed

37:45.933 --> 37:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dissidents in his country, who
has invaded other countries,
and who has tried to interfere

37:50.866 --> 37:52.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in an American election.

37:52.833 --> 37:57.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that simply to
accept that, oh, it's great,
at least he raised the question

37:59.500 --> 38:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Russian interference, but
we don't know - - and never
will probably -- precisely what

38:02.100 --> 38:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he said, is really defining
the presidency down.

38:08.533 --> 38:10.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That should have been a given
that he was going to raise that.

38:10.600 --> 38:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that it wasn't a given,
they left but on tenterhooks,
and that the day before, he

38:17.366 --> 38:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was still saying, well, nobody
really knows for sure what
happened, and seemed more eager

38:22.966 --> 38:26.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to blame President Obama
for not doing enough,
to question whether the
intelligence community

38:26.866 --> 38:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gets it right, to tweet
today about John Podesta,
Hillary Clinton's campaign
chairman, and say,

38:34.200 --> 38:38.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why didn't he turn over
the server, just really
underscores to me the
abnormality of the situation.

38:39.900 --> 38:42.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: I have
successfully defined
deviancy so far down...

38:42.566 --> 38:43.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

38:43.566 --> 38:45.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

38:45.066 --> 38:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: Well, that's the
point of normalizing, right?

38:47.066 --> 38:48.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

38:48.066 --> 38:50.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Well, that's fair.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But,
David, was using the
term honor going too far?

38:52.733 --> 38:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I think no
normal person would say that.

38:54.866 --> 38:56.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

38:56.833 --> 39:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But, on the
other hand, I'm willing to give
diplomatic latitude to that.

39:00.366 --> 39:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are a lot of people in a
lot of diplomatic circumstances.

39:02.666 --> 39:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm sure, if we went
back and looked at how other
presidents speak, you're trying

39:06.466 --> 39:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to establish a relationship
with a bad guy.

39:09.433 --> 39:11.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now, and you say things.

39:11.366 --> 39:13.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so I give
latitude toward that.

39:13.433 --> 39:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The question is whether
Donald Trump recognizes that
Vladimir Putin is a bad guy.

39:16.600 --> 39:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the larger question
here than whether he
used the word honor.

39:19.700 --> 39:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I guess there's no
indication that he regards
Putin as in any way a bad guy.

39:22.733 --> 39:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does it matter,
Ruth, whether the president
accepted Putin's denials?

39:29.800 --> 39:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or are we just -- we're
going to be left wondering
about this forever.

39:33.666 --> 39:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: Well, Secretary
of State Tillerson said that
they basically agreed it didn't

39:40.200 --> 39:44.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
make sense to relitigate
this, actually one
of my favorite words.

39:44.900 --> 39:47.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And maybe that's true.

39:47.166 --> 39:52.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The important point is that,
since before the election,
Donald Trump has been denying

39:53.933 --> 39:56.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that this happened.

39:56.466 --> 40:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has seemed entirely
unconcerned with figuring
out whether it happened
and with expressing

40:02.166 --> 40:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the outrage that any
American president should be
expressing that it did happen.

40:08.800 --> 40:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now I think we're supposed
to be satisfied that there is
this joint working group on

40:12.833 --> 40:13.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cyber-security.

40:13.766 --> 40:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I have a modest proposal.

40:14.800 --> 40:16.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

40:16.933 --> 40:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: If we're going to
have a joint working group on
cyber-security, let's combine

40:19.100 --> 40:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that with the election fraud
commission, and we can really
get to the bottom of everything.

40:23.166 --> 40:25.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Say we
had a normal president.

40:25.100 --> 40:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's actually an interesting
political problem.

40:27.066 --> 40:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you do with Russia?

40:29.566 --> 40:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you say, you interfered
with our elections,
you're interfering with
all these elections

40:32.400 --> 40:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
across Europe, we're not dealing
with you until you behave by
some standards of normalcy?

40:36.700 --> 40:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's a morally
satisfying position that, as
a columnist, would be fun.

40:40.100 --> 40:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there are actually a
lot of issues you have got
to deal with Russia on.

40:42.766 --> 40:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so this is perpetually the
problem with rogue regimes.

40:44.833 --> 40:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have got to -- you
deal with them and then
you don't deal with them.

40:47.766 --> 40:51.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even if we had a
normal administration,
it would be tough to know
how to treat Vladimir

40:51.466 --> 40:53.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Putin.

40:53.233 --> 40:57.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
RUTH MARCUS: And this is
my time to now say that
David has a fair point.

40:57.300 --> 41:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, sure, whenever you're
dealing with somebody who is
an adversary -- and Russia

41:01.133 --> 41:05.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is an adversary -- you are
going to have to calibrate,
because there are things that we

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
need their help on.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We need their help on Syria.

41:07.233 --> 41:09.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We need their help
on North Korea.

41:09.233 --> 41:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so you don't want to let one
little attack on your democracy
and your election system

41:13.700 --> 41:14.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
blow everything up.

41:14.966 --> 41:17.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:17.066 --> 41:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: But you do need to
assert yourself in a way that
we haven't seen him do publicly

41:20.433 --> 41:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that we're going to
still have questions about
whether he did privately.

41:23.200 --> 41:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking
of our democracy, yesterday,
in Poland, David, the president

41:27.500 --> 41:29.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
made a speech to
the Polish people.

41:29.500 --> 41:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he talked about Western
civilization and how it's under
siege, and how it's going to

41:36.866 --> 41:41.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
matter right now whether
we have the will to survive
the siege that we are under.

41:45.133 --> 41:46.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Does this ring true?

41:46.766 --> 41:49.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Does it feel like
Western civilization is
under siege right now?

41:49.533 --> 41:52.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, I think --
I 80 percent liked the speech.

41:52.800 --> 41:57.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was this famous clash
of civilization thesis from
Samuel Huntington, a political

41:57.166 --> 41:59.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
theorist.

41:59.266 --> 42:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the idea was that Western
civilization is at war with
Islam and maybe some of the

42:01.666 --> 42:03.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
other civilizations
around the world.

42:03.133 --> 42:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I don't agree with that.

42:04.733 --> 42:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I do think there is such a
thing as Western civilization.

42:06.500 --> 42:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it starts with
the Greeks and the Romans.

42:09.133 --> 42:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then it goes through the
Enlightenment -- or the
Reformation, the Enlightenment.

42:12.133 --> 42:14.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It goes through
the scientific age.

42:14.666 --> 42:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it somewhat defines some
of the cultures and mores of
Europe and North America and

42:20.400 --> 42:22.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some other countries.

42:22.866 --> 42:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's obviously absorbed
a lot of immigrants and
it's absorbed a lot of
ideas and had exchange

42:25.433 --> 42:27.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with Asia and other
civilizations.

42:27.600 --> 42:30.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But it's a thing.

42:30.100 --> 42:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I like the fact that
he appealed to that,
especially when he's
trying to, I hope, reunify

42:36.300 --> 42:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Western alliance, which
has been a powerful force for
good in the world over the last

42:40.500 --> 42:42.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
70 years.

42:42.966 --> 42:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, to his credit, he
appealed to some of the
things that are finest
about Western civilization,

42:47.933 --> 42:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
artistic creativity, rights of
minorities, equality for woman.

42:50.533 --> 42:52.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He ran down the list.

42:52.633 --> 42:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whether the guy actually lives
by those standards is another
matter, but at least he appealed

42:55.900 --> 42:57.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to them.

42:57.933 --> 43:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it's a big mistake
any time anybody makes an appeal
to the West or to America,

43:03.033 --> 43:05.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to patriotism to think,
oh, he's excluding.

43:05.466 --> 43:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's an identity formation.

43:07.500 --> 43:09.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we need our
identity formations.

43:09.633 --> 43:11.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I think he did
it, in the speech at
least, reasonably well.

43:11.933 --> 43:13.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How
do you read that?

43:13.133 --> 43:15.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RUTH MARCUS: Well,
I'm not at 80 percent.

43:15.366 --> 43:16.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Surprise.

43:16.600 --> 43:18.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But there are things to
like about the speech.

43:18.633 --> 43:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One thing to like about the
speech is that, unlike the
last time he was in Europe, he

43:22.766 --> 43:27.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was -- and cut the words out
of the speech, we learned
later, he was able to at least

43:29.700 --> 43:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
read from the teleprompter
that he supports Article 5, the
fundamental provision of NATO

43:34.333 --> 43:36.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for common self-defense.

43:36.366 --> 43:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the other hand, last time,
when he was in Saudi Arabia,
he was able to not say the

43:40.700 --> 43:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
words radical Islamic terrorism.

43:42.733 --> 43:47.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I will give you Article
5, but I need my radical
Islamic terrorism.

43:47.500 --> 43:52.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think it was very nice
to hear the summoning
of the importance of
a free press and all

43:54.466 --> 43:56.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those things.

43:56.566 --> 44:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A little hard to take from
somebody who had just tweeted
out that CNN beat-up wrestling

44:01.333 --> 44:03.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
video.

44:03.433 --> 44:07.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so that brings me to
my fundamental concern,
which is, which are we
paying attention to,

44:07.500 --> 44:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
teleprompter Trump or
off-the-cuff tweeter Trump?

44:11.233 --> 44:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Both matter, right, his
willingness to say things.

44:14.333 --> 44:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was a little more put off
by the Western part of the
invocation of common values and

44:21.000 --> 44:23.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
democratic values that
we should all live by.

44:23.500 --> 44:26.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But teleprompter
Trump is one thing.

44:26.000 --> 44:30.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I think, when we see
the real Trump, it's a
lot more nervous-making,
to say the least.

44:30.833 --> 44:32.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do we know
which one is the real Trump?

44:32.600 --> 44:33.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: No.

44:33.600 --> 44:35.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I take Ruth's point.

44:35.700 --> 44:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you remember Angela Merkel
had given this - - made this
comment about Europe has to go

44:41.300 --> 44:42.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it alone, because we
don't about this guy.

44:42.966 --> 44:46.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so this appeal to a
Western cohesion to me
was a valuable thing.

44:46.566 --> 44:50.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The second thing is -- and
this is something Trump does
better than a lot of his critics

44:50.300 --> 44:53.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
- - he understands
sense of belonging.

44:53.466 --> 44:58.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a lot of people think
globalization, any time you make
any particularity, you're sort

44:59.333 --> 45:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of offending some other group.

45:01.500 --> 45:04.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a lot of people in this
country think they belong to
America anymore, and he at

45:04.466 --> 45:06.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
least appeals to some
sense of belonging.

45:06.533 --> 45:10.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I like the idea that we belong
to Western traditions, so
I'm glad he appeals to that

45:10.566 --> 45:11.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sort of thing.

45:11.566 --> 45:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

45:13.033 --> 45:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to -- we could talk
about this for a long time.

45:15.366 --> 45:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I do want to bring us back
to something that we heard
Lisa Desjardins reporting on,

45:19.300 --> 45:23.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Ruth, and that is the
health care, Republican
health care plan.

45:23.466 --> 45:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She -- by her reporting, it
sounds like that Republicans
are having a tougher time than

45:27.400 --> 45:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ever now getting the votes they
need to get something through.

45:30.733 --> 45:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: Well, Senate
Majority Mitch McConnell
has been talking about
this as a Rubik's Cube.

45:35.466 --> 45:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But with the Rubik's Cube,
you know there's a solution.

45:37.500 --> 45:38.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

45:38.700 --> 45:40.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RUTH MARCUS: With this
one, not so clear.

45:40.833 --> 45:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what I loved this week was
that McConnell, who is I think
absolutely dedicated to trying

45:47.333 --> 45:50.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to find the votes, and --
which wasn't totally clear.

45:50.466 --> 45:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maybe he just wanted to get
this put aside, so we can move
on to tax cuts, which they

45:54.800 --> 45:56.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
really care about.

45:56.233 --> 45:58.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And no one discounts
his ability.

45:58.100 --> 46:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
If anybody could do it, he can.

46:00.700 --> 46:03.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he brought out the
big guns this week,
threatening the ultimate
sanction, bipartisanship.

46:03.600 --> 46:05.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:05.666 --> 46:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: If you guys don't
go along, I'm going to have
to work with Democrats, and

46:09.266 --> 46:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then you will see how unhappy
you will be with the result.

46:11.433 --> 46:12.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

46:12.700 --> 46:13.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What's the opposite
of a nuclear option?

46:13.666 --> 46:14.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:14.900 --> 46:16.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RUTH MARCUS: It's
the talking option.

46:16.400 --> 46:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Like, we will
do something good, right?

46:17.333 --> 46:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will do something good.

46:18.800 --> 46:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Oh, my God,
we may have to work together.

46:19.900 --> 46:21.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What does it look like?

46:21.100 --> 46:21.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: I agree
with Ruth on this.

46:21.900 --> 46:23.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It looks dead.

46:23.966 --> 46:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It just like -- not only have
you begun to see the burbling
concerns, and then out in

46:27.300 --> 46:31.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of the few town halls
that have been out there,
you have seen those concerns.

46:31.066 --> 46:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you're beginning to see all
these members come freelancing
off in different elections.

46:35.666 --> 46:37.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Ted Cruz is freelancing
from that direction.

46:37.700 --> 46:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mike Lee is staking out a
position that will be completely
unacceptable to a lot of people.

46:41.466 --> 46:43.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then the moderates are
staking out their position.

46:43.866 --> 46:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, not only is it hard to
piece together this together.

46:46.800 --> 46:48.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're all going further apart.

46:48.766 --> 46:50.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so they're all
defending themselves.

46:50.833 --> 46:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's just -- the party
is not cohesive enough, so
I think there's no solution.

46:54.533 --> 46:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's super hard to take away a
benefit that is pretty deeply
embedded now, no matter what

47:00.400 --> 47:02.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
your ideology is.

47:02.400 --> 47:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And to me -- and it's a genuine
question -- what do we do?

47:05.333 --> 47:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
McConnell made the correct
point that you can't just do
nothing, because the markets,

47:09.933 --> 47:12.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the insurance markets
are struggling.

47:12.166 --> 47:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so something has to be
done, some normal repair
at least has to be done.

47:16.033 --> 47:17.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do we do that?

47:17.300 --> 47:18.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Can we really imagine
a bipartisan solution?

47:18.400 --> 47:20.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Frankly, I cannot.

47:20.400 --> 47:22.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the
conservatives can't imagine it
would go along with shoring up

47:22.933 --> 47:24.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the current system.

47:24.933 --> 47:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: Well, it's going
to take a long time to get
to a bipartisan solution.

47:28.366 --> 47:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I want to kind of lay out
the possibility that there are
ways in which you could cobble

47:32.300 --> 47:34.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this together.

47:34.000 --> 47:38.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You say, OK, some of
these tax cuts for the
rich don't have to go.

47:38.633 --> 47:40.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's all sorts
of other things.

47:40.800 --> 47:43.266 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
But that's going
to have to fail.

47:43.266 --> 47:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are people working,
Lamar Alexander, Susan Collins.

47:47.866 --> 47:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats are working with them
on this that - - and there are
ways to shore up the markets.

47:52.466 --> 47:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have had a learning curve on
the Affordable Care Act, which
kind of suggests two things.

47:59.533 --> 48:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People like it, and it needs
some tinkering that are most
-- that's mostly around the

48:02.133 --> 48:04.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
edges.

48:04.266 --> 48:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we want
to leave this on a positive
note, so we're going to stop

48:05.733 --> 48:06.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right there.

48:06.966 --> 48:08.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And by next Friday,
we will know more.

48:08.866 --> 48:13.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Ruth Marcus, David
Brooks, thank you both.

48:15.233 --> 48:18.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RUTH MARCUS: Thanks.

48:18.433 --> 48:22.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Thank you.

48:22.666 --> 48:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally
tonight: Linguist Deborah
Tannen has written a new
book on women's friendships,

48:29.733 --> 48:32.100 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
"You're the Only
One I Can Tell."

48:32.100 --> 48:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, tonight, she offers
her Humble Opinion on the
new language of liking.

48:35.966 --> 48:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEBORAH TANNEN, Author, "You're
the Only One I Can Tell:
Inside the Language of Women's

48:39.733 --> 48:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Friendships": For a book about
friendship, I interviewed
over 80 women, ages 9 to 97,

48:43.900 --> 48:48.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and heard a lot of worry
that people are getting
more self-absorbed,
constantly texting and

48:48.533 --> 48:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
posting pictures of trivial
things, like plates of food.

48:52.766 --> 48:57.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One woman complained: "I
don't care what somebody
had for dinner, all this
stuff out there that

48:57.333 --> 48:59.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nobody needs to know."

48:59.433 --> 49:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm a linguistics professor,
so you might think I would
lament the effects of social

49:03.700 --> 49:07.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
media, especially how
it corrupts language.

49:07.100 --> 49:09.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But I don't.

49:09.066 --> 49:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have spent my career studying
the language of everyday
conversation, and I know that

49:13.400 --> 49:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
most everyday talk isn't about
information we need to know.

49:17.500 --> 49:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's about staying connected
to the people we care about.

49:20.666 --> 49:24.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's a need
that social media is
extremely well-suited to.

49:24.566 --> 49:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My students at Georgetown
University have helped me
understand how this works.

49:31.533 --> 49:34.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They like each other's
pictures to show they're
paying attention, like
nodding and saying

49:34.366 --> 49:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
uh-huh when a friend is talking.

49:37.300 --> 49:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they use tagging to link
their pictures to their friends'
accounts, drawing friends

49:41.366 --> 49:43.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into their circle.

49:43.366 --> 49:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A student in my class explained
that a photo of bowls of food
and glasses of wine might

49:48.966 --> 49:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seem to scream, look at me
and this cool party I had.

49:51.800 --> 49:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But tagging the friends who
brought the food and drink to
the party was a way to thank

49:55.133 --> 49:59.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them for helping make the party
a success, and to remind them
of the time they all spent

49:59.666 --> 50:01.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
together.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Surely, selfies are
self-indulgent, you might think.

50:03.733 --> 50:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the way my students
use them, they aren't,
at least not if they
observe selfie etiquette.

50:10.700 --> 50:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For example, a selfie usually
includes at least one other
person, so the one taking

50:14.966 --> 50:16.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it isn't really
focusing on herself.

50:16.966 --> 50:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she shows she doesn't
take herself too seriously by
mugging and adding captions that

50:21.200 --> 50:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are funny or self-deprecating,
or, preferably, both.

50:25.800 --> 50:30.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think of social media
as an extension of
the how-was-your-day
conversations that let

50:30.533 --> 50:34.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you know someone cares
about you, so you feel
less alone in the world.

50:34.500 --> 50:39.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's not that I don't
see downsides, but those
are also extensions of
liabilities that have

50:40.266 --> 50:42.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
always been with us.

50:42.333 --> 50:45.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For example, seeing what your
friends and family are doing
when you're not there can

50:45.066 --> 50:49.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
make you feel
included or left out.

50:49.800 --> 50:52.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Social media haven't
transformed human relations.

50:52.266 --> 50:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have intensified them.

50:54.366 --> 50:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
While that means ramping up some
of the stresses and frailties
of friendships, it also gives

51:01.166 --> 51:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
us new, more immediate, more
creative ways to stay connected
to the people we care about,

51:05.166 --> 51:10.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who care about us.

51:11.333 --> 51:15.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And thank
you to Deborah Tannen.

51:22.900 --> 51:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online right
now: With more than 31,000
miles of new and planned energy

51:30.300 --> 51:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pipelines in the U.S.,
landowners are increasingly
facing off against
developers who are claiming

51:34.833 --> 51:37.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
land through eminent domain.

51:37.166 --> 51:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We visit Pennsylvania, where
a family and other activists
have parked themselves in

51:41.700 --> 51:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tree houses to stop construction
of a pipeline on their land.

51:46.433 --> 51:51.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That and more is on our
Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

51:51.400 --> 51:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And coming up this evening
on PBS is "Washington Week."

51:54.433 --> 51:55.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Robert Costa is
preparing right now.

51:55.933 --> 51:58.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Bob, what's on tap?

51:58.033 --> 52:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: Well, tonight:
President Trump tries to thaw
U.S. relations with Russia,

52:02.800 --> 52:04.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
despite political heat at home.

52:04.466 --> 52:06.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Did it work?

52:06.433 --> 52:10.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plus, how Trump's America-first
approach is disrupting the
so-called world order -- all

52:11.800 --> 52:13.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
tonight on "Washington
Week," Judy.

52:13.366 --> 52:16.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
we will be watching.

52:16.100 --> 52:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tomorrow on "PBS NewsHour
Weekend," a report from Seattle,
where police are working to

52:20.800 --> 52:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reduce their use of force and
to rebuild community trust.

52:25.533 --> 52:30.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On the "NewsHour" all of
next week, correspondent
Nick Schifrin brings us
an in-depth look inside

52:31.366 --> 52:33.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Vladimir Putin's Russia.

52:33.400 --> 52:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NARRATOR: In Russia today,
resurgent nationalism.

52:36.633 --> 52:38.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: And authoritarianism
is organic.

52:38.966 --> 52:40.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not artificial.

52:40.566 --> 52:44.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NARRATOR: Built by
and around one man.

52:44.266 --> 52:48.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Russians told
pollsters that suddenly they
felt like a superpower again.

52:48.566 --> 52:50.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NARRATOR: But for
Putin's opponents:

52:50.666 --> 52:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: People who have tried
to leave the Putin family
voluntarily have not fared very

52:54.866 --> 52:56.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
well.

52:56.966 --> 53:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: A rare look inside
Putin's Russia all next
week on the "PBS NewsHour."

53:03.266 --> 53:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's
the "NewsHour" for tonight.

53:06.400 --> 53:07.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:07.400 --> 53:08.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Have a great weekend.

53:08.666 --> 53:13.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Thank you, and we
will see you soon.
