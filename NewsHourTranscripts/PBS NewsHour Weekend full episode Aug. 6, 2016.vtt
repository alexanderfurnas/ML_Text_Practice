04:17.624 --> 04:18.725 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOINING ME NOW VIA SKYPE FROM

RIO IS DOM PHILLIPS OF THE

04:22.762 --> 04:23.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I KNOW THE "WASHINGTON POST" HAS

04:23.730 --> 04:25.198 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A BIG TEAM COVERING THAT, BUT

04:25.198 --> 04:26.032 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

04:26.032 --> 04:27.601 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING OUTSIDE.

04:27.601 --> 04:28.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM THE LOOKS OF IT, THE

04:28.702 --> 04:29.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPENING CEREMONIES WENT OFF

04:29.936 --> 04:31.972 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITHOUT ANY MAJOR CALAMITIES, SO

04:31.972 --> 04:33.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S A GOOD START.

04:33.340 --> 04:36.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT IS AND I WONDER IF THE

04:36.243 --> 04:38.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPENING CEREMONY MIGHT MARK A

04:38.812 --> 04:41.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGE IN THE MOOD IN RIO.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.749 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MOOD BEFORE THE GAMES, AS

04:42.749 --> 04:43.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU'LL KNOW, HAS BEEN

04:43.717 --> 04:45.552 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUITE NEGATIVE FOR A LOT OF

04:45.552 --> 04:46.920 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REASONS-- THE FINANCIAL PROBLEMS

04:46.920 --> 04:48.054 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE STATE GOVERNMENT, THE

04:48.054 --> 04:49.389 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPEACHMENT PROCESS, CONCERNS

04:49.389 --> 04:51.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT ZIKA AND CONCERNS THAT

04:51.158 --> 04:52.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROMISES ON CLEANING UP POLLUTED

04:52.859 --> 04:55.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WATERS HAVEN'T BEEN MET.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.530 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RESPONSE TO THE OPENING

04:56.530 --> 04:58.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CEREMONY WAS HUGELY POSITIVE BY

04:58.565 --> 05:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANY, MANY BRAZILIANS.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT MAY HAVE EVEN RESTORED A

05:01.735 --> 05:02.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LITTLE BIT OF THEIR BRUISED

05:02.702 --> 05:04.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATIONAL PRIDE.

05:04.070 --> 05:05.005 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: LET'S TALK A

05:05.005 --> 05:05.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THOSE

05:05.872 --> 05:06.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBLEMS.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBVIOUSLY, SEVERAL OF THE

05:08.542 --> 05:09.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATHLETES THAT ARE

05:09.442 --> 05:10.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPETING, ESPECIALLY IN THE

05:10.443 --> 05:12.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WATER-RELATED EVENTS, ARE

05:12.012 --> 05:13.613 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCERNED FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY.

05:13.613 --> 05:14.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE CONCERNED FOR THEIR OWN

05:14.648 --> 05:16.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEALTH, AS THEY HAVE TO SWIM OR

05:16.316 --> 05:17.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAIL ON THESE WATERS.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT IS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT

05:19.753 --> 05:20.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE GOING TO BE ANY

05:20.720 --> 05:22.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEASURES TAKEN BETWEEN NOW AND

05:22.155 --> 05:23.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE END OF THE GAMES THAT COULD

05:23.423 --> 05:24.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPROVE THAT SITUATION?

05:24.958 --> 05:25.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THERE'S VERY LITTLE THEY CAN

05:25.859 --> 05:27.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR INSTANCE, WHEN WE'RE TALKING

05:29.296 --> 05:30.830 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THE SAILING, THE SAILING

05:30.830 --> 05:32.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVENTS, WHICH HAPPEN-- FOUR OF

05:32.465 --> 05:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SEVEN RACES ARE IN THE

05:34.100 --> 05:35.902 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GUANABARA BAY, THE BEST THEY CAN

05:35.902 --> 05:38.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO IS CLEAR UP THE FLOATING

05:38.305 --> 05:39.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUBBISH THAT THEY HAVE IN THE

05:39.439 --> 05:40.974 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BAY, THE PROBLEM WITH FLOATING

05:40.974 --> 05:42.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GARBAGE, IT FLOATS IN THE BAY,

05:42.475 --> 05:43.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY HAVE A SQUAD OF

05:43.910 --> 05:45.445 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ECO-BOATS DOING THAT.

05:45.445 --> 05:46.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY OF THE

05:46.546 --> 05:48.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WATER, THE BIG PROBLEM THERE IS

05:48.014 --> 05:49.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE AMOUNT OF RAW SEWAGE THAT

05:49.216 --> 05:50.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FLOWS INTO IT, AND THAT RAW

05:50.884 --> 05:52.118 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEWAGE IS COMING FROM A WHOLE

05:52.118 --> 05:53.620 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUNCH OF TOWNS IN THE

05:53.620 --> 05:55.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
METROPOLITAN AREA OF RIO AND

05:55.422 --> 05:57.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUTSIDE, THAT DON'T HAVE

05:57.123 --> 05:58.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SANITATION.

05:58.091 --> 05:58.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO

05:58.892 --> 06:00.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUT SEWAGE NETWORKS IN, IN THE

06:00.060 --> 06:00.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEXT FEW DAYS.

06:00.927 --> 06:03.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO REALLY, THEY'RE CLEANING 50%

06:03.396 --> 06:04.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE RAW SEWAGE.

06:04.197 --> 06:04.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO GET TO

06:04.998 --> 06:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
80%, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT.

06:06.933 --> 06:07.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: TELL US A

06:07.667 --> 06:08.602 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SECURITY

06:08.602 --> 06:09.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFRASTRUCTURE.

06:09.536 --> 06:10.804 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'VE SEEN PHOTOS AND VIDEO.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT SEEMS THERE ARE ARMED GUARDS

06:12.339 --> 06:13.373 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POSTED IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT

06:13.373 --> 06:14.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACES THROUGHOUT THE CITY.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.209 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'M ASSUMING THERE IS SOME

06:16.209 --> 06:19.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEIGHTENED ALERTNESS, JUST FOR

06:19.246 --> 06:20.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE POSSIBILITIES OF A TERROR

06:20.146 --> 06:21.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTACK, POSSIBILITIES OF

06:21.214 --> 06:22.249 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYTHING GOING WRONG.

06:22.249 --> 06:23.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT YOU SEE IS A VERY, VERY

06:25.852 --> 06:28.288 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBVIOUS, LARGE MILITARY PRESENCE

06:28.288 --> 06:30.857 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGHOUT RIO ON STREETS, ON

06:30.857 --> 06:33.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAIN HIGHWAYS, METRO STATIONS.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU'LL SEE ARMED SOLDIERS

06:35.195 --> 06:36.529 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STANDING AROUND OUTSIDE THE

06:36.529 --> 06:38.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATHLETES' VILLAGE, ALONG THE

06:38.064 --> 06:38.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEACH.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU'LL SEE SOLDIERS EVERYWHERE.

06:40.533 --> 06:42.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE REASON BEING THERE'S BEEN

06:42.168 --> 06:43.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RISING VIOLENT CRIME IN RIO IN

06:43.970 --> 06:45.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LAST FEW MONTHS, AND ANOTHER

06:45.739 --> 06:47.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEING THAT A GOVERNMENT POLICY

06:47.674 --> 06:50.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO PACIFY FAVELLAS-- LOW-INCOME

06:50.310 --> 06:51.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMUNITIES-- WHICH FOR YEARS

06:51.745 --> 06:52.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE BEEN DOMINATED BY DRUG

GANGS, HAS BEEN SORT OF

06:54.180 --> 06:55.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRUMBLING.

06:55.548 --> 06:57.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO AT THE ENTRANCE OF THESE

06:57.450 --> 06:58.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FAVELLAS YOU WILL SEE THERE ARE

06:58.818 --> 07:00.186 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOLDIERS STATIONED.

BEEN STRUGGLING FOR A LONG TIME,

07:13.400 --> 07:14.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE LOST

THEIR JOBS.

07:15.568 --> 07:17.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

07:22.642 --> 07:24.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME IN RIO, AND WHAT WE ARE

HEARING RECENTLY FROM ECONOMISTS

07:25.845 --> 07:27.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

07:29.649 --> 07:30.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

07:30.850 --> 07:32.419 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A COUNTER-BALANCE TO THAT WHICH

07:32.419 --> 07:33.219 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS GOING TO BE, AS SOON AS THE

WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE

19:02.141 --> 19:03.576 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVERDOSES?

>> WELL, IT'S SIGNIFICANT

19:04.777 --> 19:06.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE-- TWO MAIN REASONS.

19:06.912 --> 19:08.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE IS ITS POTENCY.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.783 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FENTANYL IS ANYWHERE FROM 50 TO

19:10.783 --> 19:12.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
100 TIMES MORE POWERFUL, MORE

19:12.852 --> 19:15.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POTENT THAN HEROIN, WHICH IS

19:15.221 --> 19:16.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALREADY MORE POTENT AND POWERFUL

19:16.655 --> 19:18.190 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAN OTHER OPIODS PEOPLE HAVE

19:18.190 --> 19:19.425 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN ABUSING.

19:19.425 --> 19:20.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE OTHER THING THAT'S

19:20.693 --> 19:22.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRIGHTENING ABOUT FENTANYL IS

19:22.561 --> 19:24.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IT IS BEING MISLABELED OR

19:24.764 --> 19:26.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

OTHER OPIODS.

19:28.634 --> 19:30.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

HEROIN.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE ACTUALLY TAKING

FENTANYL.

19:33.305 --> 19:35.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

BIG INCREASE IN FENTANYL BEING

19:38.878 --> 19:41.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LABELED AS PAIN KILLERS, YOU

19:41.414 --> 19:42.848 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

IN, THOSE TWO THINGS-- THE

19:48.988 --> 19:50.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POTENCY AND THE FACT THAT A

19:50.923 --> 19:52.224 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE UNAWARE

IT'S MADE IN A WAY THAT IS SO

20:09.942 --> 20:12.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
