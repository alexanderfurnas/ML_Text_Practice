GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill. Judy Woodruff is on
assignment.

00:09.643 --> 00:14.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: Los
Angeles shuts down the nation's
second largest school district

00:14.181 --> 00:18.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
after an e-mail threat
targeting students.

00:18.085 --> 00:22.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also ahead: Baltimore is on high
alert, as the jury is sent back
after declaring a deadlock

00:22.155 --> 00:25.425 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the Freddie Gray case.

00:25.425 --> 00:29.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus: Terrorism and safety
concerns take center stage at
tonight's Republican
presidential

00:29.129 --> 00:31.031 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
debate.

00:31.031 --> 00:35.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Miles O'Brien gets a reality
check on solar and wind energy.

00:35.802 --> 00:39.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD SADOWAY, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology: The
issue is that we don't have

00:39.740 --> 00:46.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a battery technology that can
meet the rigorous performance
requirements of the grid,
namely,

00:46.513 --> 00:49.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
super low-cost and super
long service lifetime.

00:49.950 --> 00:52.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:52.019 --> 00:57.724 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:57.724 --> 01:09.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Public schools
across Los Angeles went dark
today, shuttered by the fear of

01:09.903 --> 01:16.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a terror strike. It came in the
form of an e-mail that warned of
mass violence.

01:16.276 --> 01:21.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The threat brought the Los
Angeles Unified School District,
covering 600 square miles,

01:21.515 --> 01:27.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to a halt. All 1,200 schools
were shut down before classes
started for the day. Many of

01:27.587 --> 01:32.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the 640,000 students were forced
to turn around and head home.

01:32.359 --> 01:36.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And Superintendent Ramon
Cortines hastily convened a news
conference.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMON CORTINES, Superintendent,
Los Angeles Unified School
District: I think it is
important

01:38.732 --> 01:47.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that I take the precaution based
on what has happened recently
and what has happened in

01:47.774 --> 01:49.843 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the past.

01:49.843 --> 01:55.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Cortines was
referring to the rampage two
weeks ago in nearby San
Bernardino,

01:55.716 --> 02:02.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where a married couple, Syed
Farook and Tashfeen Malik,
killed 14 people at a holiday
party.

02:02.189 --> 02:06.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As L.A. police fanned out and
began checking schools today,
officials said the e-mailed

02:06.660 --> 02:11.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
threat came from Germany and
mentioned everything from guns
to bombs to nerve gas.

02:11.398 --> 02:14.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For many parents,
it was unnerving.

02:14.167 --> 02:20.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MAN: Well, if it's real,
watching from what happened in
San Bernardino, that's pretty

02:20.240 --> 02:25.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
close to home. And now this one
here, even closer, that's kind
of scary.

02:25.779 --> 02:29.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Confusion, chaos,
nervousness. You're not certain
of what's going on, what's
entailed

02:29.916 --> 02:33.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
behind it. So, there's a lot of
different emotions behind that.

02:33.653 --> 02:38.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Meanwhile, officials
in New York City said they
received a similar, if not

02:38.158 --> 02:43.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the same, message. They
discounted it as a hoax,
possibly based on a television
show.

02:43.930 --> 02:47.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRATTON, New York City
Police Commissioner: The
language in the e-mail would
lead us to

02:47.267 --> 02:55.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
believe that this is not a
jihadist initiative, for
example, that Allah wasn't
spelled with

02:55.776 --> 03:00.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a capital A. That would be
incredible to think that any
jihadist wouldn't spell Allah
with

03:00.914 --> 03:03.583 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a capital A.

03:03.583 --> 03:09.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the initiator, the
instigator of the threat may be
a "Homeland" fan, basically

03:09.322 --> 03:14.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
watching "Homeland" episodes,
that it mirrors a lot of recent
episodes on "Homeland."

03:14.795 --> 03:18.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Moreover, Mayor Bill
de Blasio argued it's vital to
keep schools open and

03:18.198 --> 03:20.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not overreact.

03:20.067 --> 03:23.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BILL DE BLASIO (D), Mayor of New
York: It's very important to
realize there are people

03:23.603 --> 03:27.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who want us to fundamentally
change our lifestyle and our
values, and we will never give
in

03:27.107 --> 03:29.476 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to that.

03:29.476 --> 03:33.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: As the hours ticked
by, Los Angeles Mayor Eric
Garcetti pushed back at
criticism

03:33.580 --> 03:36.216 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
it was wrong to
close L.A. schools.

03:36.216 --> 03:40.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC GARCETTI (D), Mayor of Los
Angeles: We will continue to
hope that this is nothing

03:40.454 --> 03:45.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that our children can be
back at school tomorrow. But, as
a parent and as a mayor,

03:45.358 --> 03:51.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
certainly, I am here to support
this school district as it seeks
our help to ensure that

03:51.231 --> 03:53.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we can look at each one of these
campuses and make sure that they
are safe for all of

03:53.967 --> 03:55.702 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our children.

03:55.702 --> 03:59.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The search and the
investigation continued into the
evening, assisted by the

03:59.239 --> 04:00.874 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
FBI.

04:00.874 --> 04:07.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House said it wouldn't
second guess the decision in Los
Angeles, but a congressman

04:07.147 --> 04:12.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the area, Adam Schiff, said
it now appears the threat was
indeed a hoax.

04:12.552 --> 04:17.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the day's other news, the
United Nations' nuclear agency
formally ended a decade-long

04:17.991 --> 04:29.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
probe into Iran's nuclear
program. But, in Vienna, the
head of the International Atomic
Energy Agency

04:29.703 --> 04:33.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
said there's no sign the
work has continued.

04:33.773 --> 04:36.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YUKIYA AMANO, Director General,
International Atomic Energy
Agency: The agency has no
credible

04:36.743 --> 04:44.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
indications of activities in
Iran relevant to the development
of nuclear explosive devices

04:44.284 --> 04:55.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after 2009, nor has the agency
found any credible indications
of the diversion of nuclear
material

04:55.228 --> 05:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in connection with the possible
military dimensions to Iran's
nuclear program.

05:00.700 --> 05:05.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The end of the
investigation clears the way for
implementing a July deal that

05:05.872 --> 05:10.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the U.S. and other powers
reached with Iran. It calls for
curbing the nuclear program in

05:10.443 --> 05:14.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
exchange for relief from
economic sanctions.

05:14.714 --> 05:19.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Human rights activists in
Nigeria are accusing the
country's military of carrying
out a massacre

05:19.653 --> 05:25.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of hundreds of Shiite Muslims.
They say it happened over the
weekend in the city of Zaria.

05:25.091 --> 05:29.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The army says the Shiites
attacked a military convoy.
Protests over the incident broke
out

05:29.930 --> 05:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today in another city. A Shiite
spokesman says police fired on
the crowd and killed

05:33.533 --> 05:36.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at least three people.

05:36.870 --> 05:41.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Defense Secretary Ash Carter
called for the rest of the world
today to ramp up military

05:41.608 --> 05:46.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
efforts against the Islamic
State group. Carter spoke to
U.S. and other troops stationed
in

05:46.780 --> 05:50.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Southern Turkey. They're taking
part in the air campaign against
ISIS targets in Iraq

05:50.550 --> 05:52.819 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Syria.

05:52.819 --> 05:56.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ASHTON CARTER, U.S. Defense
Secretary: We really are looking
for the rest of the world

05:56.289 --> 06:03.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to step up. America is stepping
up. We need our allies and
partners around the world to

06:03.897 --> 06:09.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
step up and do more. And that's
true in Europe. It's true in the
Gulf. It's true -- by Europe,

06:09.603 --> 06:13.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, all of NATO,
including Turkey.

06:13.840 --> 06:18.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Carter also called
for Turkey to seal off the rest
of its border against

06:18.912 --> 06:25.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISIS smuggling. And Turkey today
joined a new 34-nation Islamic
military alliance battling

06:25.619 --> 06:30.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terrorism. It's led by Saudi
Arabia, but doesn't include
Iran, Iraq or Syria.

06:30.991 --> 06:35.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Yemen, a week-long cease-fire
took effect today between Shiite
rebels and government

06:35.929 --> 06:42.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forces backed by the Saudis and
other Arab states. Even so,
security officials said shelling

06:42.402 --> 06:47.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and ground clashes continued in
places. The truce was timed to
coincide with U.N.-brokered

06:47.474 --> 06:52.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
peace talks in Geneva. A special
U.N. envoy urged both sides to
end the war.

06:52.812 --> 06:56.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISMAIL OULD CHEIKH AHMED, U.N.
Special Envoy for Yemen (through
translator): Today, you

06:56.116 --> 07:00.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are the decision makers, and
before you lies a historic
responsibility. Are you going to

07:00.553 --> 07:04.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
abandon Yemen and its people and
lead the country into further
violence and slaughter?

07:04.591 --> 07:09.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or are you going to put Yemen
first and ensure the people of
Yemen can live the dignified

07:09.129 --> 07:11.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
life they deserve? You are
writing the history of modern
Yemen, and you alone have the
power

07:11.898 --> 07:14.701 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to overturn the situation.

07:14.701 --> 07:18.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The World Health
Organization says the warring
factions have promised to

07:18.772 --> 07:24.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
allow unconditional movement of
supplies and medical teams
during the cease-fire.

07:24.778 --> 07:29.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary of State John Kerry
reports progress on plans for
Syrian peace talks this week.

07:29.549 --> 07:33.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kerry met with Russian President
Vladimir Putin in Moscow today
and said they found

07:33.887 --> 07:38.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
common ground on which Syrian
opposition groups to include in
the talks. Russia backs the

07:38.591 --> 07:43.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Syrian government, while the
U.S. supports moderate rebels.

07:43.129 --> 07:47.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Back in this country,
congressional negotiators worked
to finish sweeping tax and
spending

07:47.600 --> 07:52.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bills to fund the government for
the rest of the fiscal year. If
they agree, the trillion-dollar

07:52.539 --> 07:58.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
package would also lift a
40-year-old ban on U.S. oil
exports, as Republicans want.

07:58.778 --> 08:01.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it would renew tax credits
for producers of renewable
energy, something Democrats have

08:01.715 --> 08:04.784 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
asked for.

08:04.784 --> 08:09.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Republican governor of Texas
has ordered National Guard
troops to remain at the state's

08:09.656 --> 08:14.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
border with Mexico. Their
mission was supposed to end this
month, but Governor Greg Abbott

08:14.194 --> 08:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says more than 10,000 children
crossed into the U.S. in October
and November without parents.

08:19.966 --> 08:23.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's double the
number from a year ago.

08:23.570 --> 08:28.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Wall Street gained ground
for a second day. The Dow Jones
industrial average was

08:28.141 --> 08:37.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up 156 points to close near
17525. The Nasdaq rose 43
points, and the S&amp;P 500 added
21.

08:37.951 --> 08:43.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a new focus on terrorism as the
GOP debates; Baltimore's

08:43.790 --> 08:48.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Freddie Gray case in the hands
of the jury; a congressional
crackdown on financial advisers;

08:48.661 --> 09:01.875 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and much more.

09:01.875 --> 09:05.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight marks the fifth time
Republican candidates will face
off on the debate stage, but it

09:05.879 --> 09:09.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will be the first time they have
met since the attacks in Paris
and San Bernardino.

the press.

09:41.114 --> 09:47.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
priority of all voters; 40
percent chose it. But the number
was even greater for Republican

09:47.587 --> 09:53.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voters; 58 percent said fighting
terror should be government's
top priority.

09:53.026 --> 09:58.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The candidates have been quick
to react, and a campaign that
was focused on outsiders is

09:58.832 --> 10:03.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now highlighting the experience
of some establishment
candidates, putting those with
less foreign

10:03.036 --> 10:07.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
policy background
on their heels.

10:07.106 --> 10:11.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Former front-runner Ben Carson
starting losing support after
one of his advisers told The

10:11.744 --> 10:17.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
New York Times that the
neurosurgeon has a weak grasp on
foreign policy. Then today,

10:17.717 --> 10:23.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Carson, trying to regain
momentum, released a plan to
protect America. But look at
point

10:23.556 --> 10:29.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
number seven: a call to
investigate the Council on
American-Islamic Relations,
known as CAIR,

10:29.028 --> 10:32.866 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
as a -- quote --
"supporter of terrorism."

10:32.866 --> 10:36.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The group, a leading advocate
for American Muslims, fired back
in a statement, calling

10:36.636 --> 10:40.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Carson's remarks Islamophobia.

10:40.640 --> 10:45.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With Carson struggling, Senators
Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, more
steeped in security

10:45.945 --> 10:51.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
policy, are gaining with
conservatives. One sits on the
Senate's Judiciary and Armed
Services

10:51.851 --> 10:55.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Committees, the other on the
Foreign Relations and
Intelligence panels. Now the two
are turning

10:55.622 --> 10:58.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their fire on each other.

10:58.625 --> 11:02.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cruz, who's surging in the
polls, has tried to cast Rubio
as authoritarian.

11:02.829 --> 11:08.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: When it comes to
foreign policy, he wants as much
power in Washington as possible.

11:08.301 --> 11:12.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he has agreed with John
McCain, and Lindsey Graham, and,
for that matter, Hillary Clinton

11:12.739 --> 11:16.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Barack Obama, that we should
keep sticking our nose in
foreign entanglements where the

11:16.442 --> 11:21.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
results of their policies
has made America less safe.

11:21.514 --> 11:25.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Rubio, in turn,
has cast Cruz as bad for the
military.

11:25.051 --> 11:29.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: Given the
choice between neo-isolationism
or the defense of our country,

11:29.389 --> 11:34.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's chosen neo-isolationism,
whether it's weakening our
intelligence-gathering
capabilities,

11:34.093 --> 11:37.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or voting against the defense
bills, or voting against for a
budget that substantially
reduces

11:37.397 --> 11:40.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
our defense spending.
Now, these are facts.

11:40.300 --> 11:43.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: While they duke
it out, New Jersey Governor
Chris Christie is also on

11:43.703 --> 11:48.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the rise, stressing his time
as a federal prosecutor.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R-NJ),
Presidential Candidate: I was,
you know, in charge of having to
make

11:50.209 --> 11:53.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many of those decisions in my
office for seven years as U.S.
attorney.

11:53.913 --> 11:58.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: The new
security focus, of course, also
sparked Donald Trump's call to

11:58.217 --> 12:02.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
block Muslims from entering the
country, and that prompted new
criticism from some of his

12:02.589 --> 12:05.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
opponents, like Ohio
Governor John Kasich.

12:05.658 --> 12:08.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate: Look,
people don't buy this.

12:08.461 --> 12:11.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And former
Florida Governor Jeb Bush.

12:11.497 --> 12:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEB BUSH (R), Presidential
Candidate: There's no evidence
that he's serious about any
policy

12:13.866 --> 12:16.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
proposal he's laid out.

12:16.703 --> 12:20.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: So far, though,
the national security debate has
seemed to boost, not bruise,

12:20.206 --> 12:22.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Republican front-runner.

12:22.475 --> 12:27.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We have to get
smart. We have to get tough. We
have to be vigilant. We have

12:27.246 --> 12:30.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to be vigilant. We
have no choice.

12:30.416 --> 12:35.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Meanwhile,
Democrats are trying not to let
Republicans take ownership

12:35.288 --> 12:39.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the issue. In Minneapolis
today, Hillary Clinton outlined
her plan for fighting terrorism

12:39.392 --> 12:41.394 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the U.S.

12:41.394 --> 12:45.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: The
threat we face is daunting, but
America

12:45.465 --> 12:52.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has overcome big challenges many
times before. Throughout our
history, we have stared into

12:52.438 --> 12:55.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the face of evil and
refused to blink.

12:55.842 --> 12:59.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And, tellingly,
all of the candidates running
for president now stress

12:59.679 --> 13:02.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they're running to be
commander in chief as well.

13:02.649 --> 13:14.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Lisa Desjardins.

13:14.327 --> 13:22.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In Baltimore,
residents and officials are
anxiously awaiting a verdict in
the first

13:22.735 --> 13:27.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trial in the death of Freddie
Gray. It has exposed deep cracks
in the city's criminal

13:27.373 --> 13:35.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
justice system, race relations
and economic divide. The case
has its roots in the April

13:35.715 --> 13:41.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
arrest of 25-year-old Freddie
Gray and his death a week later.

13:41.287 --> 13:45.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After police detained him on a
North Baltimore street, Gray was
handcuffed and loaded into

13:45.958 --> 13:51.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a police van. Either then, or
during the subsequent
multiple-stop 45-minute ride, he
suffered

13:51.531 --> 13:53.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what would become a
fatal spinal injury.

13:53.766 --> 13:55.535 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTESTER: Every day, every day!

13:55.535 --> 13:58.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PROTESTERS: We will
fight for Freddie Gray!

13:58.471 --> 14:02.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Gray's death
galvanized large protests and
neighborhood unrest, despite

14:02.742 --> 14:06.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
appeals for calm by his
mother and community leaders.

14:06.245 --> 14:10.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GLORIA DARDEN, Mother of Freddie
Gray: I want you all to get
justice for my son, but don't

14:10.149 --> 14:16.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do it like this here. Don't tear
up the whole city, man. Just for
him? It's wrong.

14:16.656 --> 14:21.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Eventually,
thousands of National Guard
troops were called in to
stabilize the

14:21.327 --> 14:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
city and enforce a week-long
curfew. State's attorney Marilyn
Mosby charged six police

14:27.066 --> 14:31.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
officers in May, accusing them
of failing to do anything to
prevent Gray's death.

14:31.738 --> 14:35.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARILYN MOSBY, Baltimore State's
Attorney: At no point was he
secured by a seat belt

14:35.108 --> 14:42.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
while in the wagon, contrary to
a BPD general order. Despite Mr.
Gray's seriously deteriorating

14:42.048 --> 14:47.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
medical condition, no medical
assistance was rendered or
summoned for Mr. Gray at that

14:47.920 --> 14:51.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
time by any officer.

14:51.057 --> 14:55.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Officer William
Porter, the first of the six to
go to court, stands accused

14:55.027 --> 15:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of manslaughter, assault,
reckless endangerment and
misconduct.

15:00.600 --> 15:04.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During his two-week trial,
prosecutors blamed him for
failing to buckle Gray into a
seat

15:04.437 --> 15:09.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
belt, and for not calling for an
ambulance. They told the jury of
seven women and five

15:09.876 --> 15:16.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
men that Porter's inaction
effectively turned the police
van into a casket on wheels.

15:16.482 --> 15:21.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In his own defense, Porter said,
when he checked, Gray didn't
seem injured, and his lawyers

15:21.554 --> 15:27.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
argued the vehicle's driver, not
Porter, was supposed to ensure
Gray was belted in. Now

15:27.293 --> 15:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
police are braced for potential
trouble after a verdict, and the
head of the city's public

15:33.166 --> 15:37.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
schools has issued a letter to
the community warning students
that, "Walkouts, vandalism,

15:37.837 --> 15:42.742 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
civil disorder and any form of
violence are not acceptable."

15:42.742 --> 15:48.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, the larger issue is
the potential for a mistrial.
This afternoon, jurors sent

15:48.614 --> 15:55.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out a note saying they are
deadlocked. Judge Barry Williams
ordered them to continue
deliberating.

15:55.588 --> 16:00.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That jury has gone home now
after a second day of
deliberations without reaching a
verdict.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Juliet Linderman covers
Baltimore for the Associated
Press. She has been at the
trial,

16:02.995 --> 16:05.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and she joins me now.

16:05.131 --> 16:10.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, we have to talk first
about this deadlock. What do we
know about it, Juliet?

16:10.102 --> 16:15.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIET LINDERMAN, Associated
Press: So, the jury went home
for the day around 5:30, and

16:15.374 --> 16:19.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they had been deliberating for
two days. This was the second
day. They had been deliberating

16:19.946 --> 16:24.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for about nine hours when they
sent the judge a note saying
that they were deadlocked.

16:24.617 --> 16:30.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's unclear on what charges
they are deadlocked or how many
jurors are disagreeing, but the

16:30.790 --> 16:34.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
judge did send them back into
the jury room and said they
should continue deliberations.

16:34.794 --> 16:38.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, they will continue
tomorrow morning.

16:38.164 --> 16:43.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Has the jury
signaled in any other way, sent
out any other queries about what

16:43.402 --> 16:46.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it is that they're curious
about, what -- that they could
reach a deadlock kind of quickly

16:46.739 --> 16:48.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
after only two days
of deliberation?

16:48.574 --> 16:51.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIET LINDERMAN: Sure. Sure.

16:51.911 --> 16:58.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Well, they did request
transcripts of William Porter's
testimony that he gave to
investigators

16:58.050 --> 17:03.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on April 17. They also wanted
the police transmission tapes.
The judge denied their request
for

17:03.956 --> 17:09.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
transcripts, but the jurors will
be able to view those tapes.

17:09.095 --> 17:14.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The jurors have also asked for
clarification on certain terms,
particularly in regards

17:14.967 --> 17:21.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the misconduct in office
charge. They wanted
clarification on, you know, what
an evil motive

17:21.874 --> 17:26.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
might mean, so there's a chance
that they are mulling over that
charge, but beyond that

17:26.379 --> 17:28.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would be speculative. We really
don't know what they're doing so
far.

17:28.814 --> 17:32.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: What does an evil
motive mean in this legal case?

17:32.018 --> 17:34.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JULIET LINDERMAN: Sure.

17:34.620 --> 17:40.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, there are four charges
that William Porter faces. And
that's reckless endangerment,

17:40.393 --> 17:46.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is basically a wanton
disregard for human life, that
William Porter's inaction

17:46.432 --> 17:50.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
caused the risk of injury and
death. So the manslaughter
charge stems from Freddie Gray's

17:50.069 --> 17:55.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
death and the assault charge
stems from his injuries.

17:55.708 --> 17:58.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Misconduct in office is a little
bit more complicated, because
jurors are going to have

17:58.511 --> 18:06.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to determine whether William
Porter acted in a corrupt manner
and whether he, you know,

18:06.385 --> 18:11.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
failed in his duty as an
officer, knowingly failed in
that duty. So it's a bit more
complicated,

18:11.991 --> 18:16.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and jurors are probably really
considering that charge very
carefully.

18:16.429 --> 18:20.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I gather there
has been no lack of drama in the
courtroom, including

18:20.232 --> 18:24.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the putting down of a seat belt
on the table to demonstrate to
the jurors.

18:24.136 --> 18:24.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JULIET LINDERMAN: Sure.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tell me about that.

18:26.272 --> 18:29.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIET LINDERMAN: Absolutely.

18:29.508 --> 18:34.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Prosecutors -- the prosecutor,
Jan Bledsoe, she did dangle the
bloody set belt in front

18:34.447 --> 18:41.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of jurors. They say that William
Porter was criminally negligent
when he failed to seat

18:41.287 --> 18:47.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
belt Freddie Gray in the back of
the van, and they wanted to
convey to jurors that that

18:47.126 --> 18:51.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was an intentional decision that
he made, and that he ignored
Freddie Gray when he was

18:51.230 --> 18:54.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
asking for medical attention.

18:54.667 --> 18:59.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, William Porter told
jurors that he didn't think that
Freddie Gray was injured,

18:59.505 --> 19:02.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he was showing no signs of
distress at all, and that he
told his supervisor that

19:02.608 --> 19:06.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he needed to go to the hospital.

19:06.412 --> 19:11.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So that's basically how it's
playing out right now. And
jurors are going to have to
decide

19:11.684 --> 19:16.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what to believe. William Porter
did take the stand in his own
defense for more than four

19:16.722 --> 19:23.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hours. And during closing
arguments, prosecutors portrayed
William Porter as perhaps not
telling

19:23.796 --> 19:26.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the truth. And so jurors are
going to have to decide whether
they believed his testimony.

19:26.332 --> 19:28.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Whether he
was credible or not.

19:28.801 --> 19:33.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But remind us. Since there are
six people charged, what exact
role was William Porter?

19:33.005 --> 19:35.207 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He wasn't the driver of the van.

19:35.207 --> 19:39.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIET LINDERMAN: He wasn't
the driver of the van.

19:39.145 --> 19:44.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, William Porter basically
responded to a call for help. He
was present at five of

19:44.417 --> 19:49.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the six stops that the transport
vehicle carrying Freddie Gray
made on its almost 45-minute

19:49.955 --> 19:53.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trip from the site of the arrest
at the Gilmor Homes in West
Baltimore to the Western
District

19:53.826 --> 19:58.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
police station, where Freddie
Gray arrived unresponsive.

19:58.230 --> 20:04.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Basically, the stop that is
really at the center of this
trial is the van's fourth stop

20:04.403 --> 20:11.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at Druid Hill and Dolphin, when
William Porter checked on Gray,
and he picked Gray up from

20:11.844 --> 20:16.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the floor of the transport van,
where he was lying on his
stomach with his legs shackled

20:16.449 --> 20:21.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and his wrists restrained in
flexi-cuffs, and he put him on a
bench, upright onto a

20:21.120 --> 20:24.523 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bench.

20:24.523 --> 20:31.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in Porter's words, he told
the van driver, Caesar Goodson,
whose trial is coming up early

20:31.397 --> 20:37.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
next year, that Mr. Gray needed
to go to a hospital. But
prosecutors say that Porter

20:37.236 --> 20:40.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should have called for a medic
immediately after Gray indicated
that he was in any sort

20:40.372 --> 20:42.641 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of distress.

20:42.641 --> 20:47.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, OK, let's talk
about what effect this has had
on the city of Baltimore.

20:47.746 --> 20:52.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know what the immediate
impact was right after -- just
before the charges were brought,

20:52.818 --> 20:57.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right after the charges were
brought. But what kind of --
where is the city tonight,

20:57.123 --> 20:58.090 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I guess?

20:58.090 --> 21:00.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JULIET LINDERMAN: Sure.

21:00.292 --> 21:05.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, the city is absolutely
bracing for a verdict. Police --
there is a police presence

21:05.831 --> 21:10.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Baltimore. There was a
presence in Baltimore today.
Police officers from Baltimore
and

21:10.069 --> 21:15.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from surrounding jurisdictions
were seen staging around the
city.

21:15.574 --> 21:20.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is a crowd of protesters
that had gathered outside of the
courthouse this evening. There

21:20.980 --> 21:25.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are demonstrations planned for
whenever the verdict does come
down and also for the following

21:25.718 --> 21:27.853 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
day.

21:27.853 --> 21:33.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So I think the city can
absolutely expect
demonstrations. And the police
department

21:33.826 --> 21:38.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is preparing for any sort of
civil unrest that we might see
in the coming days.

21:38.330 --> 21:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Are any of the
people who are organizing these
protests are counseling peaceful

21:40.833 --> 21:43.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
protests over violent protests?

21:43.636 --> 21:47.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIET LINDERMAN: Absolutely.

21:47.306 --> 21:54.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As we -- you discussed before,
the public school CEO sent a
letter to all families,

21:54.213 --> 21:58.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
public school families,
basically saying that civil
disobedience was not going to be
tolerated,

21:58.551 --> 22:04.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that there would be
consequences. And that included
student walkouts.

22:04.957 --> 22:09.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There have been peaceful
protests. And students have
played a large role in those
protests.

22:09.195 --> 22:15.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In October, students -- students
staged a sit-in, in city hall
that went late into the

22:15.834 --> 22:20.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night. Some were arrested.
Several students were arrested,
but it was a peaceful
demonstration.

22:20.573 --> 22:25.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the students are urging
for that kind of peaceful civil
disobedience, I think, in

22:25.911 --> 22:31.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the coming days. And the mayor
has also been outspoken, urging
residents to remain peaceful

22:31.050 --> 22:34.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as we come into the verdict
whenever it comes down.

22:34.420 --> 22:35.921 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: OK.

22:35.921 --> 22:39.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, I know that you will be in
the courtroom watching for that.

22:39.091 --> 22:44.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Juliet Linderman of the
Associated Press, thank you.

22:44.363 --> 22:50.402 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIET LINDERMAN: Thank you.

22:50.402 --> 22:55.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

22:55.641 --> 23:00.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": how
the media covers racial issues;
a reality check of renewable

23:00.546 --> 23:05.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
energy; and actor Bill
Murray's love of poetry.

23:05.050 --> 23:11.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, a battle is brewing
over proposed rules about the
advice that financial advisers

23:11.523 --> 23:14.560 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
can give their customers.

23:14.560 --> 23:19.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fight is one of several big
dividing lines this week on
Capitol Hill, and it's spilled

23:19.665 --> 23:25.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into the spending standoff as
well. The deadline to pass a new
spending bill is tomorrow.

23:25.070 --> 23:27.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
William Brangham has been
speaking with several of the key
players as we get closer to the

23:27.840 --> 23:30.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
deadline, and he joins me now.

23:30.776 --> 23:33.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this has finally percolated
its way to Congress, but what is
at the root of this

23:33.445 --> 23:35.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
dispute, William?

23:35.981 --> 23:37.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The root of
this dispute is that the
Department of Labor wants to
change

23:37.916 --> 23:41.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the rules governing
retirement advisers.

23:41.587 --> 23:45.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And these are people you go to
if you need help with your
401(k) or rolling over your

23:45.624 --> 23:49.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IRA, things like that. And the
Department of Labor wants to
change it so that all these

23:49.528 --> 23:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
advisers have to have what is
called the best interests of
their client at heart.

23:54.566 --> 23:58.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, many of us might think,
well, doesn't my adviser already
have my best interest at

23:58.137 --> 24:01.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
heart? And most of them do, but
not all of them, and not all of
them are legally required

24:01.106 --> 24:03.509 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do so.

24:03.509 --> 24:08.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that can sometimes mean that
you might get sold a plan that
has a lot of higher fees

24:08.714 --> 24:12.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that is maybe not the best plan
for your retirement future. And
so the Department of Labor wants

24:12.685 --> 24:18.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to say, OK, put your clients'
interests ahead of you, ahead of
your own across the board.

24:18.590 --> 24:20.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, yesterday, I talked to the
labor secretary, Thomas Perez,
and here's what he had to say

24:20.626 --> 24:22.661 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about this.

24:22.661 --> 24:27.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ, U.S. Secretary of
Labor: This is not a case of
people with malice in their

24:27.499 --> 24:33.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
heart who are trying to screw
people. This is a case about a
system that's structurally

24:33.038 --> 24:35.240 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
flawed.

24:35.240 --> 24:41.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The incentives are misaligned.
Under the current standard,
which is a so-called suitability

24:41.947 --> 24:48.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
standard, I can have four or
five different products that are
so-called suitable for you.

24:48.354 --> 24:55.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what happens? Well, the
product that generates the most
commission for the salesperson
is

24:55.094 --> 24:58.030 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the product that
invariably gets sold.

24:58.030 --> 25:02.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so the consumer loses,
and the salesperson wins.

25:02.701 --> 25:06.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, William, the
consumer loses and the
salesperson wins, as Secretary
Perez

25:06.004 --> 25:09.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
says. How much money are
we talking about here?

25:09.007 --> 25:12.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The White
House estimates that $17 billion
is lost every single year

25:12.945 --> 25:18.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by advisers who are getting what
they call this conflicted
advice, where you're sold

25:18.117 --> 25:20.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something where the fees are
higher than they should be or
that is just not the optimal

25:20.319 --> 25:23.222 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
plan for you.

25:23.222 --> 25:28.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the complicated issue here
is that there is a dizzying
array of retirement options

25:28.227 --> 25:30.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
out there. And it's very
difficult for people to know
where to turn, so naturally they
seek

25:30.229 --> 25:32.498 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
advice.

25:32.498 --> 25:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the advocates that I
spoke with likened this to when
you're driving down the road

25:35.200 --> 25:37.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in your car, and, all of a
sudden, you hear a big bang
coming out of your engine. You

25:37.936 --> 25:40.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take it to one mechanic and he
says, that's $1,500 because you
have got to replace your

25:40.606 --> 25:41.907 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
transmission.

25:41.907 --> 25:46.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Take it to another mechanic, he
says, oh, it's $1.99 for a spark
plug.

25:46.512 --> 25:51.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Unless you're an auto mechanic,
you just don't know, well, who's
right and who's wrong. And

25:51.183 --> 25:54.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of the advocates argue that
financial advice is the same
way.

25:54.953 --> 25:58.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dennis Kelleher, the CEO of an
advocacy group called Better
Markets, put this way.

25:58.690 --> 26:01.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENNIS KELLEHER, President,
Better Markets: So, it's
perfectly reasonable to get
advice

26:01.193 --> 26:05.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for such complex matters. The
problem is that it's not
transparent.

26:05.964 --> 26:10.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You -- the person doesn't know,
what are the 20 or 30 different
types of products available?

26:10.269 --> 26:15.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are the fees? How do they
perform over time? And am I
getting a high-cost product

26:15.941 --> 26:20.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's going to perform poorly
or a low-cost product that will
perform better? And you

26:20.112 --> 26:22.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are never going to know because
you never see the alternative.

26:22.781 --> 26:26.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: The industry
obviously is not taking this
lying down. They are going to

26:26.785 --> 26:29.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
continue to fight this, and
they're spending a lot of money
on it.

26:29.855 --> 26:32.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The industry
has spent already millions of
dollars trying to torpedo these

26:32.391 --> 26:34.827 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rules.

26:34.827 --> 26:39.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They put a rider in the current
omnibus spending bill that is
going to try to eliminate the

26:39.298 --> 26:44.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ability of the Department of
Labor to introduce this, and
they are arguing that these
rules

26:44.937 --> 26:47.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are unnecessary, that they're
going to overly burden the
industry, people will not get
the

26:47.840 --> 26:51.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
advice that they need, and that
this is just an unnecessary set
of rules.

26:51.743 --> 26:55.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You talked to Kevin
Mayeux, the National Association
of Insurance and Financial

26:55.047 --> 26:57.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Advisers spokesmen. Let's
hear what he said.

26:57.716 --> 26:59.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KEVIN MAYEUX, National
Association of Insurance and
Financial Advisers: Financial
advisers

26:59.751 --> 27:02.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that are successful are
constantly acting in the best
interests of their clients,
because,

27:02.888 --> 27:06.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if they weren't, they wouldn't
be in business anymore.

27:06.024 --> 27:10.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There is already ample
opportunity to discipline bad
actors. And the cost of the
complying

27:10.262 --> 27:15.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
with a complex federal
regulation that is 1,000 pages
in length is just going to make

27:15.033 --> 27:19.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it prohibitive for companies to
put their advisers on the street
to help clients and

27:19.805 --> 27:22.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for advisers to be able to
access clients to give them an
array of options from which

27:22.241 --> 27:24.209 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they can choose.

27:24.209 --> 27:27.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: When the industry
talks about the cost of
compliance, how burdensome are

27:27.079 --> 27:29.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they saying these
regulations would be?

27:29.748 --> 27:33.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: They say that
they are very burdensome. They
say this is 1,000 pages of

27:33.585 --> 27:37.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regulations, and maybe big firms
can handle the compliance costs
of that, but smaller

27:37.256 --> 27:39.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
advisers can't, and that some of
those advisers might look at
this and say, I'm getting out

27:39.291 --> 27:41.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of this business.

27:41.260 --> 27:44.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, what do you if
you're something who is just
depending on your financial
adviser

27:44.997 --> 27:48.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to handle your nest egg?
What do you do now?

27:48.267 --> 27:49.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Well, if you
really want to know whether or
not they're looking out

27:49.868 --> 27:52.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for you, you can ask.

27:52.671 --> 27:56.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's an awkward conversation,
but you can literally say to
your adviser, do you have

27:56.642 --> 28:00.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the legal obligation to look out
for my best interests? Now, if
they say, I don't have

28:00.879 --> 28:04.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the legal obligation, it doesn't
mean they are going to try
swindle you necessarily.

28:04.816 --> 28:07.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if they say they do have
that obligation, then chances
are you can be more comfortable

28:07.953 --> 28:12.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with that. But if you already
have a plan, and you're
wondering, was this a good plan,

28:12.691 --> 28:16.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did I get sold a bill of goods,
you can take it to someone like
a certified financial planner

28:16.995 --> 28:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or a registered financial
adviser, people who do have that
legal obligation, and say,

28:21.800 --> 28:24.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
review this for me. Tell me, is
this a good plan for me or not?

28:24.303 --> 28:25.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: William Brangham,
thank you very much.

28:25.604 --> 28:31.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Thank you.

28:31.276 --> 28:43.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Newsrooms across the
country have long been accused
of failing to represent

28:43.155 --> 28:47.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the communities they cover. And
as racial concerns continue to
rise to the surface across

28:47.559 --> 28:51.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the country, who is
telling those stories?

28:51.697 --> 28:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the question being raised
by one group of journalists, and
the topic of the latest

28:55.400 --> 28:58.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
installment of special
correspondent Charlayne
Hunter-Gault's solutions-based
series "Race

28:58.971 --> 29:00.839 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Matters."

29:00.839 --> 29:07.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Race
nowadays is all over the news
media, not at least coverage

29:07.846 --> 29:12.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of protests in places like
Ferguson, Baltimore and New
York.

29:12.117 --> 29:17.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the media are also taking
hits from critics, especially
those who complain of a lack of

29:17.422 --> 29:23.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fairness or consistency, again,
when it comes to issues
involving race.

29:23.929 --> 29:29.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Richard Prince is a journalist
focusing on race and diversity
in his thrice-weekly online

29:29.334 --> 29:35.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
column "Journalism." It runs on
the Web site of the Maynard
Institute, the sponsoring
organization

29:35.340 --> 29:40.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
started in the wake of the
mid-'60s riots and aimed at
trying to correct the lack of

29:40.379 --> 29:44.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stories relating to
race and diversity.

29:44.583 --> 29:50.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We met Prince at the Newseum, a
Washington, D.C.-based
institution that's home to
examples

29:50.722 --> 29:56.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of media committed to fairness
and balance in their coverage of
race and diversity.

29:56.194 --> 29:57.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Richard Prince, thank
you for joining us.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RICHARD PRINCE, The Maynard
Institute: So glad to be here.

29:59.431 --> 30:03.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Your
column carries a lot of articles
about journalists who are

30:03.969 --> 30:09.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
themselves complaining about
fairness in media. What's your
take on the criticisms of media

30:09.408 --> 30:12.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and their issues?

30:12.010 --> 30:15.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD PRINCE: I don't think
there is any more criticism of
the media than there has

30:15.113 --> 30:18.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ever been. It's just that we get
to hear it now and see it
instantaneously.

30:18.717 --> 30:23.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Well,
you're a little younger than I
am, but I remember the
presidential

30:23.188 --> 30:30.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
commission that reported on the
riots in the mid-'60s. And it
blamed the media for not

30:30.595 --> 30:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
having enough people or any
people at all in the
neighborhoods where people were
simmering

30:35.600 --> 30:44.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over few -- lack of jobs, poor
education, no opportunities.

30:44.076 --> 30:47.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it said that you have got to
get more African-Americans or
people from those neighborhoods

30:47.779 --> 30:48.747 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the media.

30:48.747 --> 30:50.482 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What happened?

30:50.482 --> 30:53.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD PRINCE: Well, since that
time, there was a great push, as
you say, after the Kerner

30:53.018 --> 30:55.854 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Commission report of 1968.

30:55.854 --> 31:02.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All through the '70s, diversity
was a great buzzword. And then
in the '80s, you started

31:02.027 --> 31:08.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
getting a backlash to
affirmative action and that kind
of thing. Then you had the
recession,

31:08.133 --> 31:12.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which meant that newsrooms had
to sort of tighten up and not
hire as many people, start

31:12.270 --> 31:15.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
laying people off, and the
Internet, which made things
worse, because it took away a

31:15.474 --> 31:19.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lot of the revenue base of
newspapers particularly.

31:19.911 --> 31:27.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so diversity sort of went
off the table. And so now we are
sort of in a stagnant situation,

31:27.419 --> 31:32.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
where the -- I think of
newspapers, for example, and
online outlets. We have 13
percent of

31:32.624 --> 31:37.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the newsrooms now are people of
color, whereas the population
has a third people of color.

31:37.229 --> 31:39.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So there's a big gap there.

31:39.898 --> 31:45.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So there
continues to be this black-white
divide in racial discourse.

31:45.103 --> 31:48.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How much of that is the
fault of the media?

31:48.240 --> 31:52.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD PRINCE: Well, of course,
one of the purposes of the news
media, and particularly

31:52.844 --> 31:55.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of newspapers and local
television stations, is to have
different parts of the community

31:55.747 --> 31:58.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
talking with each other.

31:58.283 --> 32:03.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there are a lot of news
organizations that do take that
role very seriously, less

32:03.288 --> 32:09.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so with others. It also depends
on the staff you have and how
aggressive they are in demanding

32:09.294 --> 32:13.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of their editors that
certain things be covered.

32:13.165 --> 32:19.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, logically, the more people
you have of color there, or
good-thinking people who are

32:19.271 --> 32:22.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not of color, the better
the coverage will be.

32:22.808 --> 32:25.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But are
we losing people of color as the
-- as you have the

32:25.777 --> 32:27.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
consolidation of media?

32:27.212 --> 32:29.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RICHARD PRINCE: Yes.

32:29.314 --> 32:32.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And
what's going to be the result of
that?

32:32.050 --> 32:35.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD PRINCE: Well, because of
all the layoffs and buyouts and
everything, that
African-American

32:35.654 --> 32:39.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
journalists particularly have
been harder-hit than others.

32:39.958 --> 32:46.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, covering people
of color and communities of
color is not just the
responsibility

32:46.498 --> 32:50.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the journalists of color on
the staff. It's everyone's
responsibility. So, if you

32:50.836 --> 32:57.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have people, white people, white
journalists who care about this
issue, then it will get

32:57.709 --> 32:59.878 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
done.

32:59.878 --> 33:03.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have -- saw a good
example of that, and when a
crisis happens such as in
Charleston,

33:03.715 --> 33:08.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
South Carolina, with the church
shooting, where that newspaper
there had actually decreased

33:08.053 --> 33:12.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in diversity, but they still did
a good job, according to most
estimates, because they

33:12.224 --> 33:15.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cared and they put their
nose to the grindstone.

33:15.327 --> 33:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But do
you think there should be a
specific race beat? And, if so,

33:22.133 --> 33:23.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who should -- who
should have it?

33:23.201 --> 33:25.036 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

33:25.036 --> 33:27.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD PRINCE: You can have a
specific race beat, but you can
also make it everyone's

33:27.205 --> 33:30.175 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
responsibility.

33:30.175 --> 33:36.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at another conference, Paul
Cheung, who is the head of the
Asian American Journalists

33:36.281 --> 33:41.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Association, he recommended
that, when you do these race
projects, you have -- you make

33:41.119 --> 33:46.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them integrated, so that the
white journalists learn a lot
about what's going on in the
communities

33:46.992 --> 33:51.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of color, and they can learn
also from their colleagues of
color.

33:51.630 --> 33:57.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So, when
you look at the landscape of
media today, how hopeful

33:57.002 --> 34:02.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are you that the media are going
to live up to your hopes and the
hopes of those journalists

34:02.774 --> 34:06.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of color and others who are
writing to you and complaining
that the media are not doing

34:06.244 --> 34:07.145 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their job?

34:07.145 --> 34:09.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RICHARD PRINCE: Right.

34:09.247 --> 34:15.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, I think that there is just
too much indifference to the
whole idea of diversity.

34:15.220 --> 34:20.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, we will do it if we get to
it. I mean, the number of
newsrooms in this country that

34:20.659 --> 34:24.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have no people of color at all
in them is appalling. And the
fact that it's allowed

34:24.462 --> 34:29.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to remain, I think
is scandalous.

34:29.567 --> 34:36.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we're fighting apathy,
indifference and competing
interests. And people are
saying,

34:36.775 --> 34:41.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
look, I have to worry about the
bottom line. And they don't
realize that the bottom line

34:41.246 --> 34:45.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is tied to the changing -- our
changing country that's becoming
browner and browner. And that's

34:45.650 --> 34:49.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
where your potential
customers are.

34:49.187 --> 34:51.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so you better learn how to
relate to them if you want to
stay in business.

34:51.957 --> 34:53.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But
after the Kerner Commission
report...

34:53.325 --> 34:55.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RICHARD PRINCE: Yes.

34:55.593 --> 35:00.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: ...
newspapers, and then there were
only three networks, invested

35:00.865 --> 35:06.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in educating African-Americans
to live up to what the Kerner
Commission said. You need

35:06.204 --> 35:07.305 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
more people from
those communities.

35:07.305 --> 35:07.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RICHARD PRINCE: Yes. Yes.

35:07.872 --> 35:09.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT:
Anybody doing that today?

35:09.708 --> 35:16.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD PRINCE: There are
internship programs at a lot of
the networks. Even FOX News has

35:16.915 --> 35:22.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an apprenticeship program for
people of color, something that
might surprise folks who think

35:22.354 --> 35:23.922 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of FOX News in a different way.

35:23.922 --> 35:25.991 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

35:25.991 --> 35:31.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD PRINCE: And FOX News
also has a separate Web site,
FOX News Latino, to reach
Hispanics,

35:31.563 --> 35:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
English-speaking Hispanics. And
that was just praised and got an
award from the National

35:35.633 --> 35:39.371 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Association of
Hispanic Journalists.

35:39.371 --> 35:42.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, when -- when people see that
-- the business imperative, as
well as everything else, I

35:42.741 --> 35:45.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mean, I think that's
when you get action.

35:45.243 --> 35:48.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Well,
you're not as pessimistic as
some of the people you report

35:48.246 --> 35:50.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on, but, still, you say there
are things that need to be done.

35:50.181 --> 35:52.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So what are the solutions?

35:52.517 --> 35:56.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RICHARD PRINCE: There are a
lot of other answers, too.

35:56.454 --> 36:02.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, the American Society of
News Editors has a program where
they go out into communities

36:02.594 --> 36:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they interact with community
folks and they give them a
chance to talk to the media.

36:08.633 --> 36:14.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And there's a lot of
exchanges of ideas there.

36:14.806 --> 36:20.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The University of Missouri,
Mizzou, just said they were
going to have diversity -- a
diversity

36:20.345 --> 36:26.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
initiative required for all
students, faculty members and
staff members. This creates a

36:26.384 --> 36:32.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
climate so that, when people
actually do enter the work
force, they will be more aware
of

36:32.057 --> 36:38.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the need for inclusiveness and
the need for covering what needs
to be covered.

36:38.396 --> 36:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are a lot of solutions
that people are trying. And, as
people say, if one thing doesn't

36:42.033 --> 36:43.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
work, then you just
try something else.

36:43.802 --> 36:46.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Well,
Richard Prince, thank you.

36:46.671 --> 36:56.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RICHARD PRINCE: Thank you.

36:56.314 --> 37:05.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The historic climate
change accord in Paris is
expected to give a further boost

37:05.690 --> 37:09.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to wind, solar and other forms
of energy that are less
dependent on fossil fuels that
cause

37:09.227 --> 37:12.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
greenhouse gases.

37:12.530 --> 37:17.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some observers think it will
change the business model for
energy in the decades to come.

37:17.435 --> 37:21.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when it comes to renewable
energy, there's a crucial
technological gap that is no
small

37:21.039 --> 37:22.674 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hurdle.

37:22.674 --> 37:26.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Science correspondent Miles
O'Brien has our report.

37:26.611 --> 37:32.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: A hundred miles
north of Los Angeles, in
Tehachapi, California, the wind

37:32.851 --> 37:39.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can be a bountiful resource,
but, unfortunately, not at the
right time. It blows hardest at

37:39.524 --> 37:43.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
night, spooling up these wind
turbines to their peak output,
when the demand for electricity

37:43.428 --> 37:45.864 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is at it lowest.

37:45.864 --> 37:51.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOUG KIM, Southern California
Edison: So, matching the output
of wind to when customers

37:51.870 --> 37:55.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really need it, that's certainly
one of the things that we're
looking at with this system

37:55.073 --> 37:57.742 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that you see here, because
you can store energy.

37:57.742 --> 38:02.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Doug Kim is the
director of advanced technology
for Southern California

38:02.747 --> 38:07.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Edison. The utility built this
eight megawatt lithium-ion
battery facility, designed to

38:07.719 --> 38:11.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
store electricity generated
by the turbines.

38:11.055 --> 38:17.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOUG KIM: We can certainly use
this for an example, when the
wind blows during the nighttime,

38:17.028 --> 38:20.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
capture that energy during the
nighttime and then use it during
the daytime, when the demand

38:20.198 --> 38:22.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is high.

38:22.200 --> 38:27.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The batteries,
stacked in racks here, are
equivalent to about 2,000
electric

38:27.572 --> 38:33.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
cars. It is the start of
Edison's effort to meet a
state-mandated requirement to
add 580

38:33.311 --> 38:37.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
megawatts of energy storage
into the grid by 2020.

38:37.582 --> 38:43.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of a big push to
invent ways to practically store
huge amounts of electricity,

38:43.054 --> 38:47.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so that renewables so can become
a more than fringe players on
the grid.

38:47.091 --> 38:49.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD SADOWAY, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology: If we
don't treat the intermittency

38:49.460 --> 38:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of renewables, they're --
they're not really a solution.

38:55.533 --> 39:02.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Electrochemist
Donald Sadoway is a professor at
MIT. He says lithium-ion

39:02.473 --> 39:07.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
batteries are not the answer;
they pose a serious fire risk,
and, as any laptop and

39:07.946 --> 39:13.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cell phone user knows, their
performance degrades fast as a
speeding Tesla. In short, they
are

39:13.551 --> 39:17.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
way too expensive and
impractical for widespread usage
on the grid.

39:17.755 --> 39:19.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But what are the alternatives?

39:19.958 --> 39:27.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD SADOWAY: The issue is
that we don't have a battery
technology that can meet the

39:27.799 --> 39:32.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
rigorous performance
requirements of the grid,
namely, super low-cost and super
long service

39:32.437 --> 39:34.872 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lifetime.

39:34.872 --> 39:41.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Dr. Sadoway has
spent 30 years working in
electrometallurgy. So, no
surprise

39:41.746 --> 39:47.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that is where he found his
inspiration, specifically in the
aluminum smelting process.

39:47.151 --> 39:56.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD SADOWAY: So, an aluminum
smelter makes metal from dirt
for less than 50 cents a pound

39:56.961 --> 40:03.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and consumes huge quantities of
electricity. And I looked at
that and thought, man, if

40:03.201 --> 40:11.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I could take that thing and
teach it not to consume
electricity, but to store
electricity

40:11.075 --> 40:15.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then to give it back on
demand, I know, at the end of
the day, it's going to be cheap.

40:15.880 --> 40:21.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: That was 10 years
ago. Today, Dr. Sadoway is on
the cusp of bringing a novel

40:21.219 --> 40:24.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
liquid battery to market through
a startup he founded called
Ambri.

40:24.956 --> 40:28.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DONALD SADOWAY: OK. So,
let's draw the battery.

40:28.660 --> 40:33.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Dr. Sadoway gave
me a chalk talk on how his
battery works. It is layered

40:33.865 --> 40:38.736 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
like a parfait, with a
low-density liquid metal at the
top, a high-density liquid metal

40:38.736 --> 40:42.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at the bottom, and
molten salt in between.

40:42.774 --> 40:50.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD SADOWAY: And the way the
battery works is the metal on
the top wants to form a solution

40:50.948 --> 40:53.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with the metal on the
bottom. We call it alloy.

40:53.851 --> 40:59.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: That interaction
creates a flow of ions,
electrical current. As it
discharges,

40:59.857 --> 41:04.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the top layer gets thinner and
thinner. When the sun is shining
on solar photovoltaic panels

41:04.929 --> 41:09.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
or the wind is spinning
turbines, the process is
reversed.

41:09.033 --> 41:15.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD SADOWAY: It reconstitutes
itself every time that it
recharges, which means that,

41:15.707 --> 41:23.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unlike other batteries, which
will reduce their run time with
use, our battery just

41:23.815 --> 41:29.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
keeps on running. Show me
another battery that can do
that.

41:29.053 --> 41:32.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Actually, it
might be just few miles down
Massachusetts Avenue in a lab

41:32.557 --> 41:34.492 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at Harvard.

41:34.492 --> 41:38.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MICHAEL AZIZ, Harvard
University: We took one of these
and we charged and discharged

41:38.129 --> 41:43.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it 700 times -- and if you think
about doing that once a day,
that's two years -- without

41:43.735 --> 41:46.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
any real sign of degradation
of the molecules.

41:46.738 --> 41:52.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Engineering
professor Michael Aziz is
developing a so-called flow
battery.

41:52.810 --> 41:58.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Flow batteries consist of two
separate tanks filled with
chemicals, one negative, one
positive.

41:58.416 --> 42:03.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The chemicals are pumped past
each other into the battery.

42:03.187 --> 42:08.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When wind turbines or solar
panels are generating power,
they charge the battery, pulling
electrons

42:08.693 --> 42:14.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the positive, and pushing
them into the negative. When the
battery is turned on, the

42:14.232 --> 42:18.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
flow of electrons reverses,
generating electricity.

42:18.002 --> 42:23.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL AZIZ: The advantage of a
flow battery is, if you want
more energy, you just have

42:23.775 --> 42:30.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bigger tanks of chemicals. And
that's possibly a much cheaper
way of getting the high amounts

42:30.481 --> 42:34.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of energy than stacking up
banks and banks of batteries.

42:34.519 --> 42:39.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Flow batteries
powered by a rare, expensive
metal called vanadium have

42:39.023 --> 42:43.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been around for a while. But
Aziz is building his battery
with benign chemicals that are

42:43.428 --> 42:46.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cheap and plentiful.

42:46.330 --> 42:50.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL AZIZ: They're organic
molecules. They're made of
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,
earth-abundant

42:50.568 --> 42:53.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
elements like that, and they're
really very inexpensive.

42:53.604 --> 42:57.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Rhubarb.

42:57.008 --> 43:03.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL AZIZ: So, we noted in
our publication that the
molecule we're using is very,
very,

43:03.247 --> 43:06.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
very close to one
that's in rhubarb.

43:06.717 --> 43:10.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So what on earth
could be cheaper than a rhubarb
battery? Maybe one that runs

43:10.955 --> 43:12.957 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on air.

43:12.957 --> 43:16.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DANIELLE FONG, Founder,
LightSail: This is version one.
Version -- this is it. This is

43:16.127 --> 43:21.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
version one. We -- the
technology, we're calling it,
regenerative air energy storage.

43:21.132 --> 43:26.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Danielle Fong was
all of 20 when she is co-founded
a Berkeley, California,

43:26.604 --> 43:32.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
startup called LightSail. Eight
years, and $70 million later,
the company has developed

43:32.844 --> 43:37.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a half-megawatt prototype system
that pumps air into a tank when
an intermittent power

43:37.348 --> 43:40.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
source is in operation.

43:40.051 --> 43:45.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIELLE FONG: By the time it
gets to the end, it's at 200
atmospheres. So that's, in

43:45.156 --> 43:51.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
units of pressure, 3,000 pounds
per square inch. It's really a
lot. When you want to

43:51.729 --> 43:57.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get the energy back, you have a
valve open. As the piston is
drawing back, the valve closes,

43:57.635 --> 44:01.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then the air expands, and it
drives the piston, which drives
the crankshaft, which

44:01.472 --> 44:06.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
drives a generator, which
produces AC power.

44:06.210 --> 44:11.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: LightSail is
developing lighter, cheaper
tanks made of composites to hold
the

44:11.349 --> 44:16.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
highly compressed air. Up until
now, the stumbling block for
this idea has been managing the

44:16.254 --> 44:22.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
heat. Air at high pressure
gets extremely hot.

44:22.460 --> 44:27.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LightSail's breakthrough idea?
Inject water droplets at the
perfect size into the
compression

44:27.331 --> 44:33.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cylinder to cool the air.
LightSail says it's possible to
store all the power required to

44:33.838 --> 44:38.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
run an average American home for
a day, 30 kilowatt hours, in a
tank of compressed air

44:38.175 --> 44:41.078 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the size of a refrigerator.

44:41.078 --> 44:43.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIELLE FONG: There's more than
enough wind and more than enough
solar to handle everything

44:43.648 --> 44:46.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that we need. That's for sure.

44:46.651 --> 44:52.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the important question is,
how do we, in parallel, build
wind and solar resources

44:52.323 --> 44:56.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
along with energy storage, so
that there is the right amount
at every time? Right now,

44:56.727 --> 45:00.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would argue there is sort of
like too much wind and solar,
and not enough storage.

45:00.898 --> 45:06.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Not even close.
And the task is large. Bill
Gates estimates all the
batteries

45:06.804 --> 45:12.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that currently exist in the
world could power global
electrical consumption for 10
minutes.

45:12.677 --> 45:18.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD SADOWAY: People know that
the battery is the missing
piece. Without a battery,
renewables

45:18.416 --> 45:20.818 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are incomplete.

45:20.818 --> 45:26.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But rising global
demand for electricity, along
with rising concern about

45:26.257 --> 45:31.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
climate change, may soon lead
researchers to the missing
puzzle piece, giving electricity

45:31.295 --> 45:34.765 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
some shelf life.

45:34.765 --> 45:47.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%

GWEN IFILL: Actor Bill Murray is
enjoying a renaissance. He has a
new Netflix comedy

45:57.888 --> 46:01.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
special, and The New York Times
recently declared him a pop
culture icon.

46:01.392 --> 46:05.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It turns out Murray
is also a poet.

46:05.129 --> 46:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as special correspondent
Francesca Maxime reports, he's
found a home at New York City's

46:09.033 --> 46:12.203 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Poets House.

46:12.203 --> 46:17.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAN AYKROYD, Actor: I
think we better split up.

46:17.908 --> 46:19.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAROLD RAMIS, Actor: Good idea.

46:19.310 --> 46:21.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BILL MURRAY, Actor: Yes. We
can do more damage that way.

46:21.746 --> 46:24.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANCESCA MAXIME: This is the
Bill Murray we know, the actor,
the comedian, the one

46:24.815 --> 46:25.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who makes us laugh.

46:25.850 --> 46:28.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BILL MURRAY: He slimed me.

46:28.352 --> 46:31.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANCESCA MAXIME: But there's
also the Bill Murray we aren't
as familiar with, one who

46:31.922 --> 46:35.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trades comedic lines for lines
of poetry at a yearly benefit
for Poets House.

46:35.826 --> 46:39.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BILL MURRAY: "What the Mirror
Said" by Lucille Clifton.

46:39.263 --> 46:52.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Listen, you a wonder. You a
city of a woman. You got a
geography of your own. Listen,
somebody

46:52.076 --> 46:58.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need a map to understand you.
Somebody need directions to move
around you."

46:58.349 --> 47:07.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I used to be able to look in the
mirror and see who's there. You
know, who's there? And,

47:07.024 --> 47:11.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sometimes, it's a reminder that
there's no one there at all.
There's not very much there.

47:11.796 --> 47:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, sometimes, there's someone
that gives me confidence.

47:16.600 --> 47:22.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I feel that that poem is
about someone who has an inner
-- you know, a self-confidence

47:22.440 --> 47:29.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's bigger than -- that can't
be contained in the frame of a
mirror.

47:29.380 --> 47:33.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANCESCA MAXIME: Murray loves
poetry so much, he wants to
share some of that confidence

47:33.350 --> 47:39.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with poets, writers, and
readers. His support of Poets
House, a nonprofit library and
cultural

47:39.123 --> 47:43.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
center in New York City, has
helped make classes and writing
workshops like this one
possible.

47:43.894 --> 47:48.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: What we should be doing in
the poem is, like, thinking
about the way information is

47:48.432 --> 47:53.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
released at every step of the
way throughout the poem. Now,
how do we do that?

47:53.571 --> 47:57.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANCESCA MAXIME: One way to do
that, according to Poets House
executive director Lee
Briccetti,

47:57.641 --> 48:02.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is having all kinds of poetry
available to read, for free,
under one roof.

48:02.379 --> 48:06.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LEE BRICCETTI, Executive
Director, Poets House: It is
really the national poetry
collection.

48:06.350 --> 48:12.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have collected, for the last
25 years, absolutely
comprehensively. You can walk in

48:12.957 --> 48:16.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and have an experience that
almost doesn't exist anymore,
especially doesn't exist for

48:16.861 --> 48:18.629 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
poetry.

48:18.629 --> 48:22.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANCESCA MAXIME: Poets House
sits along the waterfront in
Lower Manhattan, boasting a

48:22.099 --> 48:28.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
60,000-volume public library,
exhibition space, reading room,
and children's room. Every year,

48:28.105 --> 48:32.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
it collects and displays
hundreds of books from
publishers in its annual
showcase, which

48:32.543 --> 48:36.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
assembles all American poetry
published in one year in one
place.

48:36.781 --> 48:40.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still, some critics argue that
the location isn't gritty
enough.

48:40.417 --> 48:48.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEE BRICCETTI: I have to say, we
were worried ourselves. And it's
more diverse. Our audiences

48:48.392 --> 48:54.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have tripled. This is an
affluent community. And so we
really worked hard at making
sure

48:54.098 --> 49:00.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that our doors are open to
everyone, that we really make
sure that there are free class

49:00.171 --> 49:06.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trips, and that we program in an
incredibly diverse way that
invites everyone in.

49:06.310 --> 49:10.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANCESCA MAXIME: While Poets
House offers many in-house
programs, others take place

49:10.314 --> 49:14.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out in the community. We went to
their Poetry Walk across
Brooklyn Bridge this summer,
which

49:14.151 --> 49:17.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
is how Bill Murray first
encountered Poets House years
ago.

49:17.922 --> 49:22.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
While the Poetry Walk has been
going on for 20 years, it keeps
getting bigger and bigger

49:22.526 --> 49:27.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
every single year. This year,
hundreds of people came out in
order to hear Richard Blanco

49:27.464 --> 49:30.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
recite Walt Whitman's
"Crossing Brooklyn Ferry."

49:30.367 --> 49:36.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD BLANCO, Poet: "We love
you. There is perfection in you
also. You furnish your

49:36.173 --> 49:45.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
parts toward eternity. Great or
small, you furnish your parts
toward the soul."

49:45.816 --> 49:49.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANCESCA MAXIME: At Poets
House, Oscar-nominated and
Pulitzer Prize-winning
screenwriters and

49:49.620 --> 49:54.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
poets rub elbows with everyday
visitors and fresh creative
writers like Aziza Barnes,

49:54.258 --> 49:56.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who learned about Poets
House from a friend.

49:56.760 --> 50:00.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AZIZA BARNES, Poet: I would
start coming here, and I would
always run into somebody I loved

50:00.497 --> 50:05.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here, like, no matter what. And
I was like, OK, I think this is
a rich place.

50:05.102 --> 50:10.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANCESCA MAXIME: Barnes became
a Poets House emerging fellow in
2015. The fellowship included

50:10.207 --> 50:13.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a stipend and writing workshops,
with some of the country's
leading poets serving as

50:13.911 --> 50:17.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mentors. There, she wrote the
poem entitled "Self-Portrait."

50:17.281 --> 50:24.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AZIZA BARNES: "Only the turn of
cement can arc black. I am blue
damage, mother-gut and

50:24.288 --> 50:33.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tower. Truth, we are all for
rent, red, lined systems. The
door out is green and full."

50:33.464 --> 50:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANCESCA MAXIME: What was it
like being an emerging fellow
with a bunch of other young

50:36.133 --> 50:38.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
poets here at Poets House?

50:38.502 --> 50:44.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AZIZA BARNES: I think -- I think
that, especially in the class I
was in, there's, like, not

50:44.375 --> 50:48.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really that much of an interest
in ego, in like I'm a good poet
because I wrote the thing

50:48.579 --> 50:51.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that was published in the thing.

50:51.248 --> 50:56.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was more like, I'm here to be
a student of this for the rest
of my life.

50:56.720 --> 50:59.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANCESCA MAXIME: Cultivating
that lifelong learning is just
what the Poets House co-founders

50:59.590 --> 51:01.759 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sought.

51:01.759 --> 51:04.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Stanley Kunitz, who was twice
poet laureate of the United
States, and arts administrator

51:04.428 --> 51:07.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Elizabeth Kray, had a vision.

51:07.564 --> 51:11.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEE BRICCETTI: They felt that
poets were lonely in this
culture and needed a place to
gather,

51:11.001 --> 51:13.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to meet, to be nurtured.

51:13.570 --> 51:16.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANCESCA MAXIME: Like other
nonprofits, Poets House requires
public and private financial

51:16.440 --> 51:19.343 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
support to keep its doors open.

51:19.343 --> 51:23.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AZIZA BARNES: A lot of the world
would like to make you believe
that the work you're doing

51:23.414 --> 51:29.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is not important, will not
change anything, particularly
the arts. But I think it's like

51:29.620 --> 51:35.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the only thing that survives
about culture for real. And,
like, people do need it.

51:35.693 --> 51:39.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANCESCA MAXIME: Including
Cornelius Eady, a poet,
professor, and co-founder of
Cave

51:39.530 --> 51:45.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Canem, a national organization
for African-American poets which
rented space from Poets House

51:45.202 --> 51:50.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years ago to provide those
writers with a safe place to
create art and build community.

51:50.407 --> 51:54.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CORNELIUS EADY, Co-Founder, Cave
Canem: Validation is really one
of things that's so incredibly

51:54.678 --> 52:01.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
important and that Poets House
continuously sends out into the
world as a message, a great

52:01.118 --> 52:02.853 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
big yes.

52:02.853 --> 52:05.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRANCESCA MAXIME: What is
poetry to you, in a word?

52:05.956 --> 52:14.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL MURRAY: I think it just
gives me an opportunity to, you
know, hear some sort of voice of
the

52:14.164 --> 52:18.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
soul. Sort of the soul of a
poet, it's all of our soul.

52:18.669 --> 52:22.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This one's by Billy Collins.
It's called "The Moon."

52:22.773 --> 52:28.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you wanted to follow this
example, tonight would be the
night to carry some tiny

52:28.746 --> 52:34.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
creature outside and
introduce him to the moon.

52:34.051 --> 52:43.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANCESCA MAXIME: In New York,
I'm Francesca Maxime for the
"PBS NewsHour."

52:43.394 --> 52:54.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And updating our top
story: The superintendent of
schools in Los Angeles has

52:54.671 --> 52:59.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
announced that the city's 1,200
public schools will reopen
tomorrow. They were closed today

52:59.543 --> 53:04.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after officials reported an
e-mail threat of a terror attack
that triggered a daylong

53:04.548 --> 53:11.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
search of all buildings, forcing
more than 640,000 students to
stay home. New York City

53:11.388 --> 53:15.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
schools received the same
threat, but dismissed it as a
hoax.

53:15.993 --> 53:22.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online:
Imagine being surrounded on all
sides by a 40-part chorus.
That's the

53:22.332 --> 53:27.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
experience that Canadian artist
Janet Cardiff designed for an
audio installation at the

53:27.438 --> 53:33.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
San Francisco Museum of Modern
Art. You can hear the piece

53:35.345 --> 53:37.915 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

53:37.915 --> 53:42.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Wednesday, all eyes are on
Janet Yellen, as the Fed
considers the first interest

53:42.052 --> 53:44.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hike in nearly a decade.

53:44.054 --> 53:46.523 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm Gwen Ifill.

53:46.523 --> 53:50.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening. For all of us
here at the "PBS NewsHour,"

53:50.394 --> 54:27.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.
