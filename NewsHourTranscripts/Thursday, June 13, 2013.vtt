THERE WILL ALSO BE MORE SECOND

THERE WILL ALSO BE MORE SECOND
OPINION TESTING, AND THAT HAS

28:42.714 --> 28:44.959
THERE WILL ALSO BE MORE SECOND

DRIVEN DOWN BECAUSE OF
MARKETPLACE PRESSURES.

28:50.365 --> 28:51.243

29:00.297 --> 29:01.955
NOT REALLY A FUNCTION OF THE
PATENT SYSTEM.
THE BASIC QUESTION IS NOT

29:01.958 --> 29:04.236
PATENT SYSTEM.
THE BASIC QUESTION IS NOT
WHETHER MYRIAD DESERVED THE

29:04.238 --> 29:05.081
THE BASIC QUESTION IS NOT
WHETHER MYRIAD DESERVED THE
PATENT OR NOT.

29:05.084 --> 29:06.678
WHETHER MYRIAD DESERVED THE
PATENT OR NOT.
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER IT WAS

29:06.680 --> 29:07.330
PATENT OR NOT.
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER IT WAS
PATENT ELIGIBLE.

29:07.332 --> 29:08.403
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER IT WAS
PATENT ELIGIBLE.
I THINK MANY PEOPLE WOULD
