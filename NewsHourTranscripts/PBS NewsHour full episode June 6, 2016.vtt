Gwen Ifill.

00:05.606 --> 00:07.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

00:07.074 --> 00:07.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome back.

00:07.975 --> 00:09.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Happy to be back.

00:09.843 --> 00:14.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: Ahead
of Tuesday's
primaries, Hillary Clinton is on
the verge

00:14.414 --> 00:20.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of becoming the Democrats'
presumptive nominee,
Bernie Sanders vows to contest
the convention,

00:20.487 --> 00:24.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Donald Trump stirs up a new
hornets nest
within his party.

00:24.524 --> 00:30.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Monday, we
remember boxing champion
Muhammad Ali. His

00:30.364 --> 00:34.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
life in and out of the ring
inspired generations.

00:34.368 --> 00:40.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: And how a
revitalized Route 66
is renewing once abandoned towns
from East

00:40.474 --> 00:42.209 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to West.

00:42.242 --> 00:46.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON FEY, Berwyn Preservation
Committee: It's
not going to be 1926 again. But
if there's

00:46.179 --> 00:54.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
enough gems that we can
recognize and preserve,
I think we will have a real
valuable commodity

00:54.054 --> 00:55.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the community.

00:55.322 --> 00:58.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:58.325 --> 01:02.729 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:02.763 --> 01:16.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The end of the
Democratic presidential
primaries is almost at hand, and
Hillary Clinton

01:16.710 --> 01:22.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is just 23 delegates away from
the number
she needs to secure her party's
nomination.

01:22.983 --> 01:28.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She kept campaigning today in
California,
hoping for a big finish, as
Republican Donald

01:28.956 --> 01:33.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump faced down critics in his
own ranks.
We will have a full report after
the news

01:33.694 --> 01:35.629 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
summary.

01:35.662 --> 01:39.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the day's other
news: An early-season
tropical storm, Colin, raised
the alarm on

01:39.566 --> 01:45.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Florida's Panhandle coast.
Governor Rick Scott
declared emergencies in 34
counties as the

01:45.472 --> 01:50.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
storm brought winds of 50 miles
an hour and
several inches of rain. Colin is
expected

01:50.978 --> 01:55.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to cross to the Atlantic, then
move along
the South Carolina coastline.

01:55.215 --> 02:01.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: U.S.-backed
fighters in Syria
closed in today on the Islamic
State's last

02:01.121 --> 02:07.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stronghold along the Turkish
border. Kurdish
fighters advanced on Manbij,
which sits on

02:07.127 --> 02:11.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a major supply route to Raqqa,
the militants'
de facto capital.

02:11.531 --> 02:17.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, aid groups said ISIS
forces in
Iraq are shooting civilians
trying to flee

02:17.170 --> 02:22.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fallujah by boat and other
means. A government
offensive there has stalled.

02:22.242 --> 02:27.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The U.S. Navy has
banned alcohol
for American sailors in Japan
over a string

02:27.981 --> 02:33.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of incidents. The latest was
Sunday's arrest
of a sailor who drove the wrong
way and hit

02:33.787 --> 02:35.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
two other vehicles on Okinawa.

02:35.822 --> 02:41.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Washington today, the
Pentagon's Peter
Cook said banning drinking and
confining sailors

02:41.461 --> 02:43.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to base are essential steps.

02:43.363 --> 02:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER COOK, Pentagon Press
Secretary: These
restrictions will help prevent
future incidents

02:46.299 --> 02:52.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by ensuring that each service
member understands
how their actions affect the
U.S.-Japan alliance,

02:52.205 --> 02:57.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is essential to the
security and stability
in the region. The department
remains committed

02:57.310 --> 03:01.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to working with the government
of Japan and
the people of Japan to prevent
such incidents

03:01.748 --> 03:03.383 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the future.

03:03.417 --> 03:06.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All this comes amid
a renewed
effort on Okinawa to remove U.S.
bases.

03:07.020 --> 03:12.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There will be no
criminal charges
filed against the family of a
3-year-old boy

03:12.526 --> 03:17.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who fell into a gorilla's
enclosure at the
Cincinnati Zoo. The zoo staffers
shot and

03:17.764 --> 03:22.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
killed the animal after it
grabbed the boy.
A prosecutor said today that the
mother was

03:22.335 --> 03:26.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
watching other children, and the
boy -- quote
-- "just scampered off."

03:26.406 --> 03:31.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Wall Street moved
higher this
Monday, as Federal Reserve Chair
Janet Yellen

03:31.144 --> 03:36.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said it's not clear when the
next interest
rate hike will come. The Dow
Jones industrial

03:36.550 --> 03:44.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average gained 113 points to
close at 17920.
The Nasdaq rose 26 points, and
the S&amp;P 500

03:44.524 --> 03:46.393 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
added 10.

03:46.426 --> 03:50.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the holy
month of Ramadan
began today in much of the
Muslim world. Millions

03:50.697 --> 03:54.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will take part in prayers and
dawn-to-dusk
fasting.

03:54.201 --> 03:58.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Meanwhile,
renovations began at
the site of Jesus' tomb in
Jerusalem for the

03:58.371 --> 04:03.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first time in more than 200
years. The work
is under way at the chamber
housing the tomb

04:03.577 --> 04:05.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre.

04:05.579 --> 04:09.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
it's Politics Monday, a look at
the week ahead

04:09.916 --> 04:16.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the campaign trail, including
what's at
stake in California; a sit-down
with the Libertarian

04:16.623 --> 04:31.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Party's candidate for president,
Gary Johnson,
and much more.

04:31.171 --> 04:32.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And now to politics.

04:32.939 --> 04:37.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we heard earlier, we have
just one day
until the last big primary day
of the 2016

04:38.011 --> 04:43.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election cycle. Hillary Clinton
won weekend
primaries in the Virgin Islands
and Puerto

04:43.316 --> 04:47.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rico, pushing her closer to the
Democratic
Party nomination.

04:47.187 --> 04:53.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she and rival Bernie Sanders
are all in
in California, the biggest
delegate prize

04:53.226 --> 04:54.594 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the line.

04:54.628 --> 04:58.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our John Yang is in the Golden
State and he
brings us this report.

04:58.965 --> 05:06.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: One final day, one
final chance
to make the sale in California.
Hillary Clinton

05:06.673 --> 05:12.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Bernie Sanders fanned out
across the state
today. Clinton's just a handful
of delegates

05:12.045 --> 05:15.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shy of clinching the Democratic
nomination,
counting both pledged and
superdelegates.

05:15.849 --> 05:19.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Tomorrow is a really big day,
everybody.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Yes, well, let's hope it is.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

05:24.624 --> 05:29.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I would
be deeply
honored and humbled for it to be
Hillary day.

05:29.095 --> 05:34.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: She will likely claim
the delegates
she needs before polls close on
the West Coast,

05:34.801 --> 05:39.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but she's working to avoid
losing a potentially
embarrassing loss in the biggest
state of

05:39.306 --> 05:41.074 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
all.

05:41.107 --> 05:45.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton has had a
laser-like focus
on California, cutting short a
campaign trip

05:45.378 --> 05:51.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to New Jersey to add events
here. And it's
been a family affair. Her
husband, the former

05:51.785 --> 05:56.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president, has a number of
events here in
the Bay Area today, while she's
focusing on

05:56.289 --> 05:58.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Southern California.

05:58.225 --> 06:04.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her statewide, full-court press
aims to solidify
her support among voters like
these in Oakland.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHERINE HAYNES SANSTAD,
Clinton Supporter:
What's needed is a pragmatic
approach to working

06:07.467 --> 06:14.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with others who can make things
happen. And
I think that Hillary does. Do I
love her?

06:14.241 --> 06:17.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Eh. Do I think she can get the
job done? Absolutely.

06:17.277 --> 06:21.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EZRA BRODER, Clinton Supporter:
I have a child
that's due next month, and I
think it'd be

06:21.181 --> 06:26.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
great for the first two
presidents in my child's
life to be an African-American
man and a female.

06:26.987 --> 06:32.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: At a news conference
today, Sanders
said that the nomination contest
isn't over

06:32.692 --> 06:34.628 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
yet.

06:34.661 --> 06:39.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
We have 475 pledged delegates
coming up. And

06:39.266 --> 06:46.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my job in the next 24 hours is
to do everything
that I can to win those
delegates.

06:46.706 --> 06:50.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The delegate math may
be against
him, but the Vermont senator
still has plenty

06:50.944 --> 06:53.813 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of supporters who say they feel
the Bern.

06:53.847 --> 06:59.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: He seems like a genuine
guy. And, you
know, I'm in all my student loan
debt. So

06:59.853 --> 07:03.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that is one of the main reasons,
is the student
loan thing.

07:03.390 --> 07:08.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CESAR CASTILLO, Sanders
Supporter: I think
his domestic policy of wealth
redistribution,

07:08.295 --> 07:12.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
focus on education, health care
and making
those things a priority are the
best option

07:12.766 --> 07:14.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that we have right now.

07:14.567 --> 07:19.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: While the two
Democrats mount one
last battle, Republican
nominee-to-be Donald

07:19.906 --> 07:25.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump was off the campaign trail
today. But
he still defended his latest
attack on a Latino

07:25.312 --> 07:28.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
judge presiding over one of the
Trump University
lawsuits.

07:28.415 --> 07:30.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Let me just tell you. It's very
simple. I

07:30.784 --> 07:35.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have had horrible rulings. I
have been treated
very unfairly by this judge.
Now, this judge

07:35.188 --> 07:37.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is of Mexican heritage. I'm
building a wall.

07:37.390 --> 07:39.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That's drawing fire
from top Republicans.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHUCK TODD, Moderator, "Meet The
Press": Is
it a racist statement?

07:41.461 --> 07:43.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader:
I couldn't disagree more with
what he had

07:43.663 --> 07:44.798 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to say.

07:44.831 --> 07:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHUCK TODD: Do you think it's a
racist statement
to say?

07:46.766 --> 07:51.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: I don't
agree with what
he had to say. This is a man who
was born

07:51.404 --> 07:55.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Indiana. All of us came here
from somewhere
else.

07:55.909 --> 08:01.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Trump told FOX News:
"All I want
to do is figure out why I'm
being treated

08:01.081 --> 08:03.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
unfairly by a judge."

08:03.717 --> 08:08.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Criticism aside, Trump doesn't
have to worry
about the results in California
tomorrow.

08:08.521 --> 08:14.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All the focus will be on the
contest between
Clinton and Sanders.

08:14.227 --> 08:18.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here in the shadow of the
fog-enshrouded Golden
Gate Bridge -- trust me, it
really is there

08:18.665 --> 08:24.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
-- they're preparing for
Sanders' final pre-primary
event. It's going to be as much
a concert

08:24.504 --> 08:30.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as it is a rally. His opening
acts include
Dave Matthews, the band
Fishbone, Danny Glover

08:30.877 --> 08:33.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the scholar Cornel West --
Judy.

08:33.413 --> 08:35.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you, John.

08:35.482 --> 08:40.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, but tell us, how has Bernie
Sanders been
able to keep it so close? We
know it wasn't

08:40.086 --> 08:41.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
always like this.

08:41.921 --> 08:45.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That's right. They
really decided
that they were going to focus on
California.

08:45.091 --> 08:48.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They felt they could do well
here if they
spent a lot of time here.

08:48.228 --> 08:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he has spent a majority of
his time here
since the end of May. And it
appears to be

08:53.366 --> 08:59.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
paying off. He's showing in the
pre-primary
polls for the first time this
season that

08:59.672 --> 09:04.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's making inroads among
minority voters,
who have tended to support
Clinton in the

09:04.944 --> 09:12.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
past. The polls show him
splitting Latinos
with Hillary Clinton, and
actually beating

09:12.118 --> 09:13.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
her among Asian-Americans.

09:14.020 --> 09:19.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John, we also
know that tomorrow
night other states are voting.
Hillary Clinton

09:19.192 --> 09:24.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could go over the top when these
other state'
results come in, in places like
New Jersey.

09:24.998 --> 09:28.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How will California even matter
for Bernie
Sanders if that happens?

09:28.435 --> 09:33.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, according to
the Sanders
camp, California being so big,
so diverse,

09:33.840 --> 09:37.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they think that, if she loses
here, if they
were to beat her here, they
could make the

09:37.777 --> 09:41.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
argument to superdelegates that
he's more
electable.

09:41.247 --> 09:46.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But their big fear is that,
indeed, Hillary
Clinton goes over the top while
voters are

09:46.953 --> 09:52.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still going to polls here in
California, and
that the Sanders supporters who
haven't gone

09:52.892 --> 09:56.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the polls yet get discouraged
and don't
go to the polls.

09:56.429 --> 10:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What are some of
the Sanders
supporters saying about what
they'd do if

10:00.400 --> 10:02.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he doesn't win the nomination?

10:02.202 --> 10:06.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: A couple of them said
that they
could not vote for Hillary
Clinton under any

10:06.473 --> 10:10.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
circumstances, that they were
going to vote
for the Green Party. But they
are also savvy

10:10.977 --> 10:17.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enough to know that, here in
California, very
unlikely that it would go
Republican under

10:17.684 --> 10:22.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any circumstances, so that they
would be able
to make a statement by not
voting for Hillary

10:22.856 --> 10:28.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Clinton, while they were
confident or felt
assured that they weren't going
to help Donald

10:28.194 --> 10:29.729 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

10:29.762 --> 10:32.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Yang
reporting for us
from California, thank you,
John.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.334 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thanks, Judy.

10:34.367 --> 10:37.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And that brings us
to Politics
Monday with Amy Walter of The
Cook Political

10:37.737 --> 10:43.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Report and Stuart Rothenberg of
The Rothenberg
&amp; Gonzales Political Report, and
now columnist

10:43.476 --> 10:45.645 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for The Washington Post's Power
Post.

10:45.678 --> 10:47.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

10:47.514 --> 10:50.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Stu, we seem to be going
through a series
of turning points. WE just --
let's talk about

10:50.884 --> 10:54.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Democratic turning points
first. Hillary
Clinton could be making history
tomorrow night.

10:54.687 --> 10:56.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG, Editor and
Publisher, The
Rothenberg &amp; Gonzales Political
Report: Right.

10:56.556 --> 11:01.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Well, she -- I'm quite
confident, Gwen, that
she's going to get at least 23
more delegates.

11:01.060 --> 11:06.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Probably New Jersey will put her
over the
top. That will be a historic
event, remarkable.

11:06.199 --> 11:09.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She will continue to build up
delegates throughout
the rest of the evening.

11:09.702 --> 11:14.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is going to be the de facto
nominee. The
only question is when Bernie
Sanders and his

11:14.073 --> 11:18.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supporters accept that, and then
how she pivots
to the general election. She's
actually already

11:18.244 --> 11:19.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
started to pivot.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Amy, do you begin to
see Bernie
Sanders pivoting in any way? We
heard today

11:22.782 --> 11:26.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he took a phone call
yesterday on the
side of the road from the
president of these

11:26.753 --> 11:29.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
United States. Who knows what
they talked
about, but we can guess.

11:29.355 --> 11:31.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Yes,
we can.

11:31.291 --> 11:38.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we also saw today
that the president
is eager to get involved into
this campaign,

11:38.064 --> 11:41.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reports today in The New York
Times saying
that he may be making an
endorsement by the

11:41.501 --> 11:43.269 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
end of the week.

11:43.303 --> 11:46.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's been very clear for
some time that
Bernie Sanders' decisions are
going to be

11:46.906 --> 11:51.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
important in this race, but the
next most
important person is President
Obama, when

11:51.644 --> 11:57.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he decides to come out and
basically hug Hillary
Clinton and say, this is the
nominee, everybody

11:57.550 --> 11:59.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
needs to move on.

11:59.319 --> 12:02.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm also going to be watching
very closely
for what other progressive
leaders in the

12:02.655 --> 12:07.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
party, like Elizabeth Warren, do
after Tuesday.
Maybe they give Bernie Sanders a
couple of

12:08.027 --> 12:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
days, but then I think the
wagons start to
circle around Hillary Clinton.

12:13.633 --> 12:17.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Well, Gwen, I
think that
Bernie Sanders has to get on
board. It's all

12:17.737 --> 12:18.271 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
well and good...

12:18.304 --> 12:19.372 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

12:19.405 --> 12:20.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: How much time does
he have to
do that?

12:20.173 --> 12:21.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Yes.

12:22.008 --> 12:26.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Well, look, running for
president is a grueling
job. And he's been doing it for
months, and

12:26.312 --> 12:31.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's exceeded expectations. And
he deserves
some sort of victory lap, even
if he loses.

12:31.884 --> 12:39.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think everybody would give
him a few
days to recover and lick his
wounds.

12:39.158 --> 12:44.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the reality is, he doesn't
merely need
to stop the campaign against
Hillary Clinton.

12:44.764 --> 12:49.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He doesn't merely need to
acknowledge that
she's going to be the nominee.
He needs to

12:49.335 --> 12:55.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
embrace her. He needs to bring
his supporters
along, particularly those
18-to-29-year-olds

12:55.375 --> 12:57.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who are not enthusiastic about
her.

12:57.143 --> 13:01.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk about the
party which
already has a putative nominee,
and that's

13:01.848 --> 13:06.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Republican Party. Donald
Trump is undergoing
some backlash because of his
comments that

13:06.619 --> 13:11.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Yang was talking about,
about the judge
from Indiana who happens to be
of Mexican

13:11.591 --> 13:16.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
descent and whether he's fair
and whether
he thinks a judge who is Muslim
would be fair.

13:16.396 --> 13:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There seems to be real pushback
this time
from Republicans.

13:20.466 --> 13:26.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, I mean, I
guess the question
is there really pushback, Gwen,
or is it really

13:26.439 --> 13:28.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just playing defense?

13:28.274 --> 13:32.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think that's where
Republicans are stuck
here. We have this balancing act
for so many

13:32.378 --> 13:36.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican officeholders, folks
who have come
out and endorsed him, those who
are on the

13:36.349 --> 13:41.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ticket with him, who say I'm
going to support
him, but I'm going to try to
keep my distance

13:41.087 --> 13:42.955 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from him.

13:42.989 --> 13:48.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as this week exposed, it is
a very difficult
thing to do. No matter what
Donald Trump says,

13:48.294 --> 13:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
especially the more incendiary
things he says,
you as a candidate or an
officeholder on the

13:53.399 --> 13:56.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican side are going to
have to answer
for those things, for as much as
you would

13:56.602 --> 13:58.237 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like to distance yourself.

13:58.271 --> 14:01.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think this is what they're
going to
have to deal with day after day
after day

14:01.374 --> 14:05.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on this campaign. I think it's
quite remarkable
that we're on day -- I don't
know what we

14:05.945 --> 14:12.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are, day four or five of this
story, and Donald
Trump continues to put -- to
stoke the flames

14:12.819 --> 14:19.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this, rather than trying to
pivot himself
under the other issues that we
know he would

14:19.459 --> 14:22.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a much easier time going
and focusing
on.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Meantime, if you're
Mitch McConnell,
if you're Paul Ryan, if you're
any other number

14:25.865 --> 14:31.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of -- or any of the number of
other Republicans
who have already endorsed and
kind of embraced

14:31.304 --> 14:35.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump as the nominee,
you're going
to be asked every time you show
up somewhere,

14:35.341 --> 14:36.142 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is he a racist?

14:36.175 --> 14:37.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Exactly.

14:37.944 --> 14:42.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, Gwen, I don't know why
we're surprised
by this. This is Donald Trump's
M.O. This

14:42.348 --> 14:48.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the way he's behaved for
months. And there
is no reason that he's going to
change. So,

14:48.421 --> 14:53.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I expect similar incidents
between now and
the first week in November,
where Donald Trump

14:53.926 --> 14:56.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
says things that are
controversial and explosive.

14:56.829 --> 15:01.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And you're right, and
microphones are put
in Kelly Ayotte's face and Mitch
McConnell's

15:01.100 --> 15:06.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Paul Ryan's each and every
day. He said
this. Do you agree or disagree?
And that's

15:06.038 --> 15:10.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a problem with a campaign like
this. It's,
the campaign isn't set the
agenda -- well,

15:10.376 --> 15:11.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
actually, Donald Trump is
setting the agenda.

15:11.711 --> 15:13.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: I was going to
say...

15:13.546 --> 15:16.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: But that's
not the normal
campaign agenda. He just refuses
to act like

15:16.849 --> 15:18.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
any other politician.

15:18.151 --> 15:20.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, that's where I
wanted to go,
actually, Amy.

15:20.653 --> 15:26.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this a campaign, or is it a
reality show
with Donald Trump in the
driver's seat and

15:26.492 --> 15:31.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everybody else, including
surrogates, including
endorses, including anybody else
who might

15:31.197 --> 15:36.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
-- may be a future vice
presidential running
mate, they all have to kind of
go to sleep

15:36.669 --> 15:39.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
every night not knowing what
they're going
to wake up to?

15:39.138 --> 15:40.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Absolutely.

15:41.007 --> 15:45.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, what you saw in the
Republican primary
was a candidate who upended the
traditional

15:45.745 --> 15:52.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
norms of campaigning. And I
think a lot of
folks assumed that that was the
way that he

15:52.118 --> 15:56.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could win a general election as
well, except
for the fact that people forgot
a couple of

15:56.522 --> 15:58.457 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
things.

15:58.491 --> 16:02.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One, a Republican primary
electorate is not
a general electorate. This is
especially important

16:02.328 --> 16:06.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when you realize how much more
diverse a general
electorate is than the
Republican primary,

16:06.933 --> 16:10.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is overwhelmingly, like
90-plus percent,
white.

16:10.036 --> 16:15.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second thing is that Donald
Trump is now
under a greater amount of
scrutiny and press

16:15.675 --> 16:20.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coverage even than he was in the
primary.
And, as we see, he doesn't do
very well when

16:20.913 --> 16:27.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he is forced to answer for his
positions,
when he's put on the defensive.
He lashes

16:27.153 --> 16:28.921 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
back.

16:28.955 --> 16:32.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so for all the folks who
said, isn't this
so fun, he's changing the rules
of the game,

16:32.091 --> 16:37.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the reality is, the rules are
there for a
reason. And he can try to change
the rules

16:37.196 --> 16:42.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the game, but it's going to
cost him with
the folks who didn't vote in the
Republican

16:42.568 --> 16:44.303 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
primary.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Which party is in a
tougher spot
right now, the Democrats trying
to figure

16:46.439 --> 16:50.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out what to do with Bernie
Sanders or the
Republicans trying to figure out
what to do

16:50.076 --> 16:51.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with their own nominee?

16:51.911 --> 16:54.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Well, I
suppose today the
Democrats have the immediate
problem. They

16:54.247 --> 16:57.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have two candidates running for
their party's
presidential nomination.

16:57.717 --> 17:01.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in the long run, I think
it's very clear
the Republicans have the bigger
problem, because

17:01.954 --> 17:08.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have a deeply flawed
nominee, or de facto
nominee. They have a divided
party. The Democrats

17:08.194 --> 17:11.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are divided now, but they will
get together.
Sure, Hillary Clinton has some
work to do

17:11.931 --> 17:16.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
among younger voters and the
most progressives,
but, no, I think the Democrats
are more likely

17:16.769 --> 17:20.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to coalesce, have a tighter bond
than the
Republicans.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that division is going
to continue
all the way to November.

17:23.209 --> 17:27.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stu Rothenberg of
The Rothenberg
&amp; Gonzales Political Report, Amy
Cook of The

17:27.380 --> 17:31.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cook Political Report -- Amy
Walter, that
is -- whatever your name is --
thank you both

17:31.384 --> 17:32.818 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very much.

17:32.852 --> 17:36.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Whatever.

17:36.155 --> 17:37.256 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

17:37.290 --> 17:41.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Thanks, Gwen.

17:41.694 --> 17:44.830 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

17:44.864 --> 17:51.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
long-lasting
influence of Muhammad Ali;
revitalizing the

17:51.070 --> 17:58.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
historic Route 66; plus,
remembering the NPR
journalist who died in a Taliban
ambush.

17:58.778 --> 18:02.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But, first, back to politics.

18:02.348 --> 18:06.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This year's presidential
election will likely
feature, as we just heard, two
major-party

18:06.886 --> 18:12.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nominees who currently have some
of the highest
unfavorability ratings of any
such candidates

18:12.825 --> 18:14.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in recent decades.

18:14.660 --> 18:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a result, some voters may
take a look at
the nominee chosen last week by
the Libertarian

18:20.700 --> 18:23.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Party, the former Governor of
New Mexico Gary
Johnson.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I spoke with him a short time
ago.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Governor Gary Johnson, welcome.

18:28.674 --> 18:31.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON, Libertarian
Presidential Candidate:
Judy, such an honor to be here.
Watching you

18:31.944 --> 18:33.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on television forever, and here
I am.

18:33.679 --> 18:34.814 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

18:34.847 --> 18:35.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we thank
you for being
here.

18:35.481 --> 18:36.649 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

18:36.682 --> 18:37.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to talk to
you about
Libertarian.

18:37.249 --> 18:38.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GARY JOHNSON: Yes. Yes.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What you believe,
smaller government.

18:40.519 --> 18:45.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You said you believe in a 20
percent cut across
the board in government
spending.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON: That would be a
target, yes.

18:47.126 --> 18:50.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The target. And
you would phase
out Social Security.

18:50.329 --> 18:52.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What else would you eliminate?

18:52.264 --> 18:55.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON: You know, no, I
wouldn't phase
out Social Security. I think
that Social Security

18:55.668 --> 18:57.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is absolutely fixable.

18:57.870 --> 19:02.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are some reforms, though,
to Social
Security, raising the retirement
age. You

19:02.041 --> 19:07.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
could have a very fair
means-testing. You
could also be able to
self-direct funds. By

19:07.113 --> 19:12.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being able to do that, people,
lower-income,
middle-income, they could
actually pass on

19:12.918 --> 19:15.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the asset of Social Security to
their heirs
by doing that.

19:15.988 --> 19:21.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you also
would clearly
leave some government functions.
You would

19:21.127 --> 19:23.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have a -- you would defend the
country.

19:23.529 --> 19:25.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GARY JOHNSON: Well, yes.

19:25.331 --> 19:31.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you have
talked about law
enforcement. You have talked
about some other

19:31.637 --> 19:33.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
safety functions of government.

19:33.205 --> 19:34.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So let's -- let me try to get
specific.

19:34.874 --> 19:35.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON: Sure. Sure.

19:35.975 --> 19:37.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Air traffic
control.

19:37.476 --> 19:39.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GARY JOHNSON: Yes.

19:39.378 --> 19:45.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Seat belts. Would
you require
seat belts? Would people be
banned from texting

19:45.284 --> 19:48.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
while driving? I mean, what
kinds of things...

19:48.421 --> 19:52.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON: Well, as president
of the United
States, that's what I would get
elected, I

19:52.858 --> 19:57.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would just like people to
believe that I am
going to sign on to any
legislation that's

19:57.063 --> 20:01.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to make things better and
that I'm going
to veto any legislation that at
the end of

20:01.500 --> 20:05.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the day would just add time and
money to our
lives and wouldn't really
accomplish anything.

20:05.938 --> 20:10.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But when you say
less government
is better, today, government
requires things

20:10.176 --> 20:12.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like seat belts, like...

20:12.511 --> 20:17.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON: And, of course,
that's all local.
That's all state initiative.
And, you know,

20:17.616 --> 20:19.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I buckle up, myself.

20:19.418 --> 20:22.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Food. What about
food safety
requirements? Those come from
the Food and

20:22.922 --> 20:24.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Drug Administration.

20:24.757 --> 20:28.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON: Well, so, food
safety -- 20
percent reduction in federal
spending, I don't

20:28.394 --> 20:32.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think, is the end of the world.
I think that
that is very accomplishable, and
that's a

20:32.198 --> 20:33.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
target, Judy.

20:33.966 --> 20:38.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So count on me when it comes to
legislation
from Congress to actually make
government

20:38.571 --> 20:45.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
more efficient, but not
neglecting the fundamental
role of safety. Government
exists to protect

20:45.077 --> 20:50.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us against individuals, groups,
corporations,
foreign governments that would
do us harm.

20:50.549 --> 20:52.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
In the context of food safety...

20:52.351 --> 20:56.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you have also
talked about
eliminating the federal income
tax, so how

20:56.388 --> 20:59.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would you pay for the services
that you kept?

20:59.091 --> 21:03.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON: Well, in the case
of what I'm
advocating is -- and, by the
way, I'm going

21:03.429 --> 21:09.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to sign on to anything that
reduces taxes,
simplifies taxes. So, flat tax,
hey, count

21:09.301 --> 21:11.036 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on my support.

21:11.070 --> 21:16.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, ideally, we would eliminate
income tax,
we would eliminate corporate
tax. Because

21:16.375 --> 21:22.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we would do that, we could
abolish the IRS,
and replace it all with one
federal consumption

21:22.481 --> 21:24.316 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tax.

21:24.350 --> 21:30.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, I suggest that people look
at the FairTax
as a template for how to dot the
I's and cross

21:30.356 --> 21:37.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the T's on accomplishing one
federal consumption
tax. If we abolish corporate tax
in this country,

21:37.630 --> 21:43.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I believe tens of millions of
jobs would get
created. Imagine life without
having to comply

21:43.335 --> 21:44.470 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with the IRS.

21:44.503 --> 21:46.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me turn you
now to foreign
policy.

21:46.705 --> 21:51.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's so much to ask you
about. But you
are noninterventionist, but you
are not isolationist.

21:51.744 --> 21:57.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I guess the question is, if the
U.S. -- if,
say, Vladimir Putin were to go
into a country

21:57.783 --> 22:05.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Eastern Europe, should the
U.S. join NATO
and stand up for at the country
that the Russians

22:05.224 --> 22:06.926 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
went into?

22:06.959 --> 22:10.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON: Well, first of
all, we have
many treaties, many treaties
with foreign

22:11.030 --> 22:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
countries where we are obligated
to defend
their borders. And these were
treaties...

22:14.934 --> 22:16.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you would
honor those?

22:16.502 --> 22:20.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON: Well, these are
treaties that
were not ratified by Congress.

22:20.339 --> 22:26.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These have been presidential
treaties, military
treaties. We need to involve
Congress in all

22:26.979 --> 22:33.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of these decisions, which they
have abdicated
really to the executive, to the
military.

22:33.219 --> 22:39.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, Russia is stretched
economically.
Do we really want to go in and
defend Baltic

22:39.425 --> 22:43.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
states against Russian
aggression?

22:43.162 --> 22:47.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do we really want to go to war
over that?
I think it's wrong to project
what you would

22:48.000 --> 22:53.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
or wouldn't do given any
situation, because
that's kind of drawing a line in
the sand.

22:53.772 --> 22:58.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's one of the problems
with President
Obama has had, is he draws lines
in the sand

22:58.544 --> 23:00.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that get crossed and then no
action.

23:00.412 --> 23:03.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Governor Johnson,
when you
have been asked whether you
would take more

23:03.282 --> 23:08.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
votes away as a Libertarian
Party nominee
from Donald Trump or Hillary
Clinton, you

23:08.420 --> 23:09.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have said you believe it would
be equal.

23:09.855 --> 23:11.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GARY JOHNSON: Yes.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you have been
more critical
with Donald Trump.

23:13.092 --> 23:17.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You concurred when your vice
presidential
running mate, Bill Weld,
compared what Trump

23:18.030 --> 23:23.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has said about Mexicans and
Muslims. He's
compared it to Hitler and Nazi
Germany. Is

23:23.669 --> 23:27.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there anything that Hillary
Clinton has done
that you would put in that
category?

23:27.139 --> 23:28.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Not in that
category.

23:28.941 --> 23:33.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the end of the day, I
believe that
Hillary Clinton is going to grow
government,

23:33.279 --> 23:39.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that government is all about
giving out things.
Bill Clinton was in New Mexico
talking about

23:39.351 --> 23:45.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
free electricity to the Native
Americans.
Well, nothing is free. Somebody
pays for that.

23:45.958 --> 23:49.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I believe Hillary is going
to grow government.
And I don't believe...

23:49.795 --> 23:52.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You think that's
as bad as
the kinds of things Donald
Trump...

23:52.064 --> 23:53.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON: Well, it's going
to raise taxes.

23:53.966 --> 23:59.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think Hillary has also
been the architect,
one of the premier, primary
architects of

23:59.838 --> 24:03.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our foreign policy that has made
the world
less safe, not more safe.

24:03.642 --> 24:07.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you think
that's as bad
as what you have heard from Mr.
Trump during...

24:07.246 --> 24:12.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON: Well, I really
take exception
with what Donald Trump says with
regard to

24:12.117 --> 24:18.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immigration, with regard to
killing the families
of Muslim terrorists.

He's going to bring back
water-boarding or
worse. He's for free trade, but
he's going

24:23.062 --> 24:27.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to implement tariffs, on and on
and on.

24:27.633 --> 24:31.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Governor Gary
Johnson, we're
going to leave it there, the
presidential

24:31.270 --> 24:32.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nominee of the Libertarian
Party.

24:32.905 --> 24:33.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

24:33.872 --> 24:35.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON: Judy, so nice to
be with you.

24:35.541 --> 24:39.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I'm the only third-party
candidate that's
going to be on the ballot in all
50 states.

24:39.345 --> 24:45.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thanks for
pointing that out.

24:45.184 --> 24:58.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: This will be a week
of remembrance
of the great heavyweight champ
and humanitarian

24:58.063 --> 24:59.932 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Muhammad Ali.

24:59.965 --> 25:04.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His hometown of Louisville,
Kentucky, is preparing
for a funeral and a public
memorial service

25:04.069 --> 25:09.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to be held Friday, as
generations across the
country assess the enormous
scope and reach

25:09.708 --> 25:15.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Ali's life, a sports icon,
but also a social
activist and powerful political
voice during

25:15.714 --> 25:17.149 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
turbulent times.

25:17.182 --> 25:21.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, we focus on one of
Ali's boldest
decisions.

25:21.286 --> 25:23.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
William Brangham has our
conversation.

25:23.088 --> 25:27.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That moment
was the pivotal
time in the late 1960s when Ali
was still

25:27.693 --> 25:31.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the heavyweight champion of the
world, when
he resisted the draft to
Vietnam, a court

25:31.964 --> 25:36.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fight he ultimately won after
more than three
years. But he was stripped of
his heavyweight

25:36.402 --> 25:38.137 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
title.

25:38.170 --> 25:42.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here's Ali in 1968, talking
about his Muslim
faith, and the loss of his
boxing title.

25:42.775 --> 25:48.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MUHAMMAD ALI, Boxing Heavyweight
Champion:
Boxing was only for self-gain,
just beating

25:48.714 --> 25:51.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
up one of my brothers or
somebody else's brother
for money.

25:51.617 --> 25:56.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If I would only deny my faith,
if I would
only join up against my
religion, I could

25:56.588 --> 26:02.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
easily go back to making
millions. So, I could
always say that I turned this
down. I didn't

26:02.694 --> 26:06.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lose it. I turned it down. And I
go out still
with my head high.

26:06.365 --> 26:10.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For some
perspective on
that time in Ali's life, and our
evolving

26:10.102 --> 26:15.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
perceptions of the man, we're
joined by Gerald
Early, who edited "The Muhammad
Ali Reader."

26:15.073 --> 26:18.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a professor of English and
African-American
studies at Washington
University.

26:18.844 --> 26:24.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Gerald Early, I wonder if
you could just
remind our viewers that this was
a time -- Ali

26:24.550 --> 26:28.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was at the peak of his powers.
He was the
heavyweight champion when he
took the stance

26:28.754 --> 26:30.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that cost him a great deal.

26:30.489 --> 26:33.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GERALD EARLY, Washington
University: Yes,
he was at the peak of his powers
as an athlete,

26:33.892 --> 26:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a fighter, but he was also
sort of at this
time at the peak of his
consciousness as a

26:41.266 --> 26:43.035 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
black man.

26:43.068 --> 26:47.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This stance that he takes
coincides with the
rise of the black power
movement. And Ali

26:47.873 --> 26:52.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has now become, really, in his
own way, an
icon of that movement. So here
was a man who

26:52.845 --> 26:57.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was standing up against the
government and
here was a man who was saying
that he was

26:57.349 --> 27:02.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
willing to sacrifice his career
and everything
to stand up for what he believed
in.

27:02.788 --> 27:07.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this was a great moment for
inspiration
for a particular generation.

27:07.459 --> 27:11.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You have
written, though,
that some of us have
misinterpreted Ali's

27:11.997 --> 27:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stance against the war. I wonder
how so.

27:14.266 --> 27:19.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERALD EARLY: Well, I think
people misinterpreted
the stance against the war
because they saw

27:19.037 --> 27:24.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ali, basically, as if his stance
was coming
from the left.

27:24.243 --> 27:30.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ali was really not a leftist,
nor was he ever
a civil rights activist. All was
-- all of

27:30.616 --> 27:35.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this was generated by his faith,
and particularly
his love of Elijah Muhammad.
Elijah Muhammad

27:35.187 --> 27:42.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
had gone to jail for not
conforming to the
draft laws back during World War
II. He felt

27:42.160 --> 27:46.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he could do no less than
what his leader
was doing in standing up against
the draft.

27:46.465 --> 27:52.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so all of this was coming
out of a religions
consciousness, not purely out of
a political

27:52.237 --> 27:54.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
consciousness, which I think
sometimes people
misunderstand.

27:54.306 --> 27:58.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You said there
that you
don't think that he was also a
civil rights

27:58.577 --> 28:02.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
activist, but certainly that has
been much
of the commentary in the last
few days, lionizing

28:02.381 --> 28:03.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his civil rights stance.

28:03.849 --> 28:06.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GERALD EARLY: Well, that's
unfortunate, because
those people are wrong.

28:06.718 --> 28:12.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He belonged to the Nation of
Islam. The Nation
of Islam wasn't a civil rights
organization.

28:12.090 --> 28:18.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, the Nation of Islam
disliked the
civil rights movement, disliked
racial integration,

28:18.397 --> 28:20.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because they were a separatist
movement.

28:20.465 --> 28:25.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Ali, really, if you go back
and you read
interviews with Ali during this
time and so

28:25.037 --> 28:30.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forth, he criticizes the civil
rights movement
and he criticizes integration.
He just so

28:30.142 --> 28:35.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happens that, at this point in
history, he
collides with this black
activism that is

28:35.547 --> 28:40.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going on at the time, but he is
not really
part of it.

28:40.285 --> 28:43.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Being in the Nation of Islam,
he's really
quite separate from it.

28:43.488 --> 28:46.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, during
those three years
when Ali has been kicked out of
boxing, what

28:46.959 --> 28:48.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was he doing during that time?

28:48.827 --> 28:53.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERALD EARLY: For most of the
time, when Ali
was not in boxing, during the
three-and-a-half

28:53.298 --> 28:56.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years of his exile, he was
touring on campuses,
giving lectures.

28:56.969 --> 29:01.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was very popular on college
campuses giving
lectures, mostly about his
beliefs and his

29:01.773 --> 29:07.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stance against the war. It
turned out to be
in many ways a very good and
broadening experience

29:07.779 --> 29:12.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for him, because he got to meet
an entire
cohort of his generation that he
had not been

29:12.451 --> 29:16.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exposed to, because, one, he
hadn't gone to
college. He barely had gotten
out of high

29:16.989 --> 29:18.724 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
school.

29:18.757 --> 29:22.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, two, he was a professional
athlete and
had really not been exposed to a
great deal

29:22.928 --> 29:27.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outside of his training to be a
fighter. And
it really was part of what you
might call

29:27.799 --> 29:32.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the education of Muhammad Ali,
or the continuing
education of Muhammad Ali in
this way.

29:32.704 --> 29:36.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it greatly affected
him in a positive
way.

29:36.074 --> 29:39.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This Friday,
obviously,
we're going to see a very big
memorial to

29:39.411 --> 29:42.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the man. All the luminaries will
come out
and speak.

29:42.247 --> 29:46.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wonder what you think would be
the best
tribute for us to hear this
coming Friday

29:46.351 --> 29:48.020 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about Ali.

29:48.053 --> 29:51.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERALD EARLY: I know there are
going to be
a lot of dignitaries and
celebrity people

29:51.456 --> 29:53.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who will speak about him.

29:53.291 --> 30:00.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think the best tribute
would actually
come from the everyday people
who were part

30:00.065 --> 30:07.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of his following back when he
was at the height
of his popularity as an athlete
and as a figure

30:07.139 --> 30:12.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the United States, those
people who were
inspired by him, who felt that,
when they

30:12.310 --> 30:17.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saw what he was doing and was
willing to sacrifice
because of what he believed in,
were inspired

30:17.482 --> 30:22.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by him to believe a little bit
more in what
they were about, who felt that
I, too, could

30:22.187 --> 30:26.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do something for myself because
I see what
he's doing, it would actually be
a tremendous

30:26.692 --> 30:32.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tribute to hear the voices of
those people,
because, in many ways, Muhammad
Ali wasn't

30:32.531 --> 30:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just a great athlete or even a
great dissident.

30:35.267 --> 30:39.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the end, he turned out, in
many ways, in
how he inspired people to be a
great humanitarian.

30:39.504 --> 30:44.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Gerald Early,
thank you very much.

30:44.109 --> 30:53.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GERALD EARLY: Thank you.

30:53.719 --> 31:03.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now another in
our series of
stories about Culture at Risk,
and, in this

31:03.295 --> 31:07.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
case, what's been lost along one
of the more
storied highways across the
country.

31:07.833 --> 31:12.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown took a recent road
trip along
U.S. Route 66.

31:12.571 --> 31:19.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It was neither
the country's
oldest nor longest road. For
Hollywood and

31:19.778 --> 31:27.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everyone else, Route 66 came to
symbolize
America, a people on the move, a
lifestyle

31:27.552 --> 31:33.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that characterized it.

31:33.558 --> 31:38.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some 2,400 miles of asphalt
winding through
eight states from Illinois,
south through

31:39.030 --> 31:44.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the heartland, then through the
Southwest
to California, it's a journey
that millions

31:44.569 --> 31:49.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
once took, before the nation's
economy and
culture underwent vast changes.

31:49.741 --> 31:55.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It begins here in downtown
Chicago, an older
American story about the open
road and connecting

31:55.781 --> 32:00.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
small rural communities to big
cities, and
a newer story about preserving
some of that

32:00.986 --> 32:04.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cultural past for economic gain
today.

32:04.523 --> 32:10.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Route 66 got its official
designation as a
national highway in 1926. For
John Steinbeck

32:10.495 --> 32:15.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in "The Grapes of Wrath," it was
the mother
road, a major artery for
migration during

32:15.700 --> 32:22.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, and
later for
travel and tourism. But by the
'70s, the federal

32:22.140 --> 32:28.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interstate highway system had
begun to take
over, bypassing towns, and
devastating communities

32:28.513 --> 32:30.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
along the original route, in
favor of speed.

32:30.916 --> 32:33.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB RUSSELL, Mayor of Pontiac,
Illinois: That
was it. The stores started
closing one by

32:33.585 --> 32:36.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one. The gas stations went out
of business.
The restaurants went out of
business. And,

32:36.454 --> 32:38.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
boy, your town starts to look
really bad in
a hurry.

32:38.523 --> 32:43.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, says Mayor
Bob Russell,
Pontiac, Illinois, an
agricultural community

32:43.662 --> 32:48.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of 12,000 two hours southwest of
Chicago,
looks pretty good.

32:48.700 --> 32:54.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's a prime example of a
rebirth of Route
66 that's occurring in various
parts of the

32:54.105 --> 32:59.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country. Town leaders here
decided to use
the history of the famous road
to their advantage,

32:59.411 --> 33:06.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
20 large murals, a museum of
Route 66 collectibles,
and much more, all bringing in
tourists from

33:06.484 --> 33:08.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
around the world.

33:08.253 --> 33:13.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have renovated historic
buildings and
encouraged new mom-and-pop
stores to come

33:13.258 --> 33:14.960 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB RUSSELL: This building in a
couple of
months will be ready for sale or
lease, and

33:17.829 --> 33:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we will have another business
move in here.
Then that generates tax revenue
and it keeps

33:21.700 --> 33:23.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
us from raising our real estate
taxes.

33:23.602 --> 33:27.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And when a
collector of vintage
Pontiac cars was looking for a
place to build

33:27.873 --> 33:34.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a museum, Pontiac, Illinois, not
Michigan,
provided just the right
incentives.

33:34.212 --> 33:39.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB RUSSELL: And if you watch
the old 66 movies,
there's always a girl involved
and there's

33:39.317 --> 33:41.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
always a fast car, the Corvette
or Mustang.

33:41.219 --> 33:44.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There's a car.
There's a -- that's
part of the culture and part of
the whole

33:44.089 --> 33:44.789 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
history.

33:44.823 --> 33:46.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BOB RUSSELL: That is the
culture.

33:46.591 --> 33:48.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a lot of people from the
other countries
coming here, they want to
experience that

33:48.793 --> 33:50.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
freedom that they saw in that
movie.

33:50.662 --> 33:53.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But Pontiac is
still an exception.

33:53.598 --> 33:59.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Berwyn, Illinois, a suburb of
Chicago,
some 26 stylish auto showrooms
once lined

33:59.771 --> 34:04.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Route 66. Most have been
bulldozed to make
way for fast-food franchises.

34:04.276 --> 34:08.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON FEY, Berwyn Preservation
Committee: This
was a Chevy dealer when it was
built in the

34:08.947 --> 34:10.849 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
'30s.

34:10.882 --> 34:14.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Not everyone
might agree that
'50s era showrooms are worth
saving. But businessman

34:14.452 --> 34:17.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Jon Fey of the Berwyn
Preservation Committee
does.

34:17.155 --> 34:21.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON FEY: This is the kind of
business that
is just perfect for...

34:21.860 --> 34:23.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This is what you
want?

34:23.595 --> 34:30.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON FEY: This would -- yes, this
is a great
example of using the building in
a way that

34:30.669 --> 34:36.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
enhances what they are doing and
helps the
community.

34:36.107 --> 34:39.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But Fey says
Berwyn hasn't
provided enough incentives for
businesses

34:39.945 --> 34:41.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to preserve much of downtown.

34:41.680 --> 34:48.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON FEY: I'm realistic enough to
understand
we can't bring it all back. It's
not going

34:48.453 --> 34:49.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be 1926 again.

34:49.321 --> 34:51.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

34:51.156 --> 34:58.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON FEY: But if there's enough
gems that we
can recognize and preserve, I
think we will

34:58.563 --> 35:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have a real valuable commodity
for the community.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But it's tough
going?

35:04.369 --> 35:06.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JON FEY: It's very tough going.

35:06.304 --> 35:11.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Far across the
country, Glen
Duncan tells a similar story
about the struggles

35:11.242 --> 35:15.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to preserve landmarks along what
for many
is the most famous part of old
Route 66.

35:16.014 --> 35:18.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GLEN DUNCAN, Author, "Route 66
in California":
This is a former hotel.

35:18.516 --> 35:24.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He took me to the
town of Barstow,
California two hours east of Los
Angeles,

35:24.456 --> 35:29.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where motels and restaurants of
another era
still line the route. Many have
shut down,

35:29.728 --> 35:31.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but some are thriving.

35:31.296 --> 35:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GLEN DUNCAN: This is the Casa
del Desierto,
which is a Fred Harvey house.

35:35.567 --> 35:40.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The town has
refurbished this
former hotel and train station,
which now

35:40.038 --> 35:43.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
houses two museums, a ballroom
and conference
space.

35:43.475 --> 35:48.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GLEN DUNCAN: In the summer, they
say that
50 percent of the travelers on
Route 66 are

35:48.279 --> 35:49.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from Europe or Asia.

35:49.547 --> 35:50.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

35:50.582 --> 35:52.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GLEN DUNCAN: And...

35:52.050 --> 35:55.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Because they're
fascinated
with some idea of Americana?

35:55.520 --> 35:59.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GLEN DUNCAN: Well, Route 66 is
somewhat -- one
of the things that they know
about America.

35:59.958 --> 36:06.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's because it sort of
represents
America back when everybody
loved us.

36:06.598 --> 36:10.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But 15 minutes
from Barstow
is the crumbling town of
Daggett.

36:10.035 --> 36:17.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GLEN DUNCAN: Daggett was where
they had an
inspection station back in the
Depression.

36:17.776 --> 36:27.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you didn't have more than $20
in your pockets
and didn't have evidence that
you had a job

36:27.152 --> 36:29.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in California, they turned you
back.

36:29.320 --> 36:34.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Those inspection
stations were
designed to keep unemployed
workers from pouring

36:34.759 --> 36:41.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into California. And Duncan says
it's important
to preserve the entire history
of Route 66,

36:41.166 --> 36:43.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
even the less savory parts.

36:43.768 --> 36:48.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's also the mission of
self-described
cultural documentarian Candacy
Taylor, who's

36:48.840 --> 36:54.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
photographing properties along
Route 66 once
listed in what was known as the
Green Book.

36:54.145 --> 36:56.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CANDACY TAYLOR, Cultural
Documentarian: There
would be opportunities for some
businesses

36:56.948 --> 36:58.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to actually have their photos.

36:58.983 --> 37:04.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A travel guide of
hotels, restaurants
and other businesses that served
African-Americans

37:04.756 --> 37:07.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in an era when many
establishments wouldn't.

37:07.225 --> 37:12.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CANDACY TAYLOR: This was a time
when it was
dangerous to travel for black
people. So if

37:12.730 --> 37:20.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you got stranded or you got a
flat tire in
the wrong place at the wrong
time, there was

37:20.338 --> 37:22.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
-- your life could be
threatened.

37:22.140 --> 37:26.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: More than
three-quarters of
the Green Book buildings on 66
have been torn

37:26.177 --> 37:32.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down. Others are at risk of
demolition or
decay, as here on L.A.'s Skid
Row, where the

37:32.484 --> 37:36.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Regal and Norbo hotels were once
fashionable
gathering spots.

37:36.554 --> 37:41.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CANDACY TAYLOR: Now it's Skid
Row. But back
in the day, this was a vibrant
community.

37:41.459 --> 37:43.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it was a place to eat, see
some entertainment
and spend the night.

37:43.561 --> 37:50.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Just five minutes
away, one
of the more famous listings in
the Green Book

37:50.668 --> 37:56.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been renovated. Clifton's
Cafeteria, with
its murals, redwood trees and
wild animal

37:56.441 --> 38:01.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
displays, was renowned for
serving whites
and blacks, and those who were
too poor to

38:01.346 --> 38:03.014 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pay.

38:03.047 --> 38:06.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CANDACY TAYLOR: This is really a
piece of
American history, of living
history. These

38:06.584 --> 38:13.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sites are physical evidence of
racial segregation
and integration. So there were a
lot of people

38:13.525 --> 38:19.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the sidelines really trying
to make some
kind of change happen. So I
think this is

38:19.497 --> 38:21.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a part of history that hasn't
been documented.

38:21.733 --> 38:28.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A history once
vibrant, then
lost, and now, perhaps, making a
comeback.

38:28.973 --> 38:35.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From downtown Chicago, and 2,400
miles away
here in California's Mojave
Desert, I'm Jeffrey

38:35.446 --> 38:37.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Brown for the "PBS NewsHour."

38:37.215 --> 38:52.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Some stories can
only be told
because of journalists who are
willing to

38:52.130 --> 38:56.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
risk it all, telling the
dangerous stories
in word and picture.

38:56.868 --> 39:02.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Gilkey and Zabihullah
Tamanna were two
such storytellers. They died on
Sunday in

39:02.240 --> 39:06.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a Taliban ambush near Marja in
Southern Afghanistan.

39:06.911 --> 39:11.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gilkey was an award-winning
photographer for
National Public Radio, Tamanna,
a respected

39:11.983 --> 39:14.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
local journalist and translator.

39:14.385 --> 39:20.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here's Gilkey in May, before he
left for Afghanistan,
describing how he used his
camera lens to

39:20.391 --> 39:22.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
capture the story.

39:22.227 --> 39:24.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID GILKEY, National Public
Radio: One of
the amazing things about being
embedded and

39:24.963 --> 39:31.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
working with U.S. forces is just
how intimate
you are with the subjects.

39:31.402 --> 39:38.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is a picture from a
farm, again in
the south, 2010, of the soldiers
talking with

39:38.343 --> 39:40.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
someone they suspected of
planting IEDs.

39:40.211 --> 39:44.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For more on the life
and work
of David Gilkey, I'm joined by
NPR's David

39:44.749 --> 39:46.951 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Greene, co-host of "Morning
Edition."

39:46.985 --> 39:49.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First of all, our condolences to
you and your
staff.

39:49.387 --> 39:50.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID GREENE, National Public
Radio: Thank
you, Gwen. We appreciate that.
It's been a

39:50.855 --> 39:51.890 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hard -- it's been a hard day.

39:51.923 --> 39:53.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's been a hard
day.

39:53.291 --> 39:55.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID GREENE: And I speak for
all of us when
I say, thank you.

39:55.093 --> 39:59.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I read today that --
someone say
that collateral damage has a
face. This is

39:59.197 --> 40:00.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the case of that, isn't it?

40:00.331 --> 40:02.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID GREENE: Yes.

40:02.133 --> 40:08.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, David Gilkey said that.
And it's so
sad that he's fallen victim to
that. I knew

40:08.539 --> 40:15.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David very well. And I think
that he always
knew the risks in going into
conflict zones

40:15.046 --> 40:19.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and places like this, and
believed it was
worth it to tell the story.

40:19.884 --> 40:26.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, he wanted to capture
humanity in stories
like this. I think it just -- we
all knew

40:26.424 --> 40:31.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that this was possible, but to
lose a friend
and a colleague, you just don't
really think

40:31.296 --> 40:32.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it will ever happen.

40:32.630 --> 40:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Most people think of
NPR as an
audio experience...

40:35.633 --> 40:37.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID GREENE: Yes.

40:37.502 --> 40:40.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: ... not as a visual
experience,
but David Gilkey was one of
those who expanded

40:40.071 --> 40:41.839 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that idea.

40:41.873 --> 40:45.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID GREENE: He really -- you
know, and a
lot of people jokingly asked
about that. When

40:45.510 --> 40:49.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David started almost a decade
ago, they would
say, what are you doing taking
pictures for

40:49.947 --> 40:51.783 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a radio company?

40:51.816 --> 40:56.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when I started working with
him, I just
so quickly realized that the
kind of journalism

40:56.954 --> 41:03.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he does, even though it's images
and not sound,
it's exactly what we do. It's
all the sensibilities

41:03.795 --> 41:10.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that I think we believe in. It's
giving people
time and space to just sort of
collect their

41:10.468 --> 41:12.370 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thoughts and think out loud.

41:12.403 --> 41:18.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's being respectful. It's
waiting for someone's
story to kind of emerge. And
that's what we

41:18.476 --> 41:24.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do on the radio. And that's what
David did.
Just to watch him operate, I
mean, it was

41:24.315 --> 41:27.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
such a joy and inspiring,
because he would
just be respectful.

41:27.885 --> 41:32.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He would be curious, and he
would interact
with someone, and sort of just
wait for that

41:32.690 --> 41:34.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
story to come through and
capture it.

41:34.292 --> 41:35.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You traveled with
him a great
deal.

41:35.893 --> 41:38.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID GREENE: Yes, which was a
real honor.

41:38.162 --> 41:43.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We went to Russia together. We
went to Cuba
together. We crossed the U.S.
together on

41:43.101 --> 41:49.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a crazy political trip in 2008.
And -- but,
you know, I'm one of many who
had the honor

41:49.407 --> 41:53.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of traveling with him, because
he would travel
a lot. He loved being on the
road and was

41:53.144 --> 41:56.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just a collaborator like no
other.

41:56.047 --> 42:02.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Was he a war
photographer by gene
or was he just a people
storyteller?

42:02.720 --> 42:04.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID GREENE: You know, it's
funny.

42:04.522 --> 42:08.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He -- if you met him, you would
think he was
a war photographer. You would
almost think

42:08.226 --> 42:14.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was at war himself, because
he sort of
had that tough guy persona. It
was, like,

42:14.365 --> 42:17.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you would want to be in a
foxhole with this
guy.

42:17.668 --> 42:23.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when you get to know him,
you quickly
realize he's -- and he's just
like a soft,

42:23.708 --> 42:31.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gentle soul who was so kind.
And, you know,
he was gruff sometimes. We would
be cranky

42:31.416 --> 42:35.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
together, but he would also --
he knew what
was going on not just in my
life, not just

42:35.987 --> 42:39.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in my wife's life, but my wife's
brothers'
lives.

42:39.357 --> 42:40.324 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:40.358 --> 42:42.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID GREENE: And he would keep
track of that.

42:42.260 --> 42:46.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that -- that level
of interest
and that level of sort of
curiosity and caring,

42:47.031 --> 42:50.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's what came through in his
journalism
and in his photography.

42:50.301 --> 42:53.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tell us about
Zabihullah Tamanna,
because a lot of people don't
understand that

42:53.838 --> 42:59.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in order for someone like David
Gilkey or
for you to do your job in a
place like Afghanistan,

42:59.143 --> 43:02.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a translator or a right-hand
person was necessary.

43:02.647 --> 43:04.449 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID GREENE: Yes.

43:04.482 --> 43:10.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, I mean, I think of Zabi as
part of this
extended family at NPR. Wherever
we are abroad,

43:10.354 --> 43:14.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you talk to anyone who has
reported abroad,
any foreign correspondents -- I
was in Russia

43:14.325 --> 43:20.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and worked with local
translators and local
journalists. They are part of
the family.

43:20.331 --> 43:24.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are risking their lives for
us, to do
journalism with us.

43:24.836 --> 43:29.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They care about the organization
as much as
people like us to who are part
of it. And,

43:30.007 --> 43:35.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, he left behind three
kids and a
wife and was one of the most
respected journalists

43:35.780 --> 43:39.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Afghanistan. And it's -- it's
-- it's devastating.

43:39.050 --> 43:41.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It is devastating.

43:41.118 --> 43:46.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Greene, thank you so much
for taking
some time to tell us about them
both.

43:46.524 --> 43:54.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID GREENE: Thank you, Gwen.

43:54.098 --> 43:59.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will be back
in a moment.

But, first, take this time to
hear from your
local PBS station. It's a chance
to offer

44:04.909 --> 44:14.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your support, which helps keep
programs like
ours on

online right
now: Tiny plastic particles
litter our oceans.

44:36.807 --> 44:43.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What does that mean for the
health of marine
wildlife? Researchers in Sweden
found that

wildlife? Researchers in Sweden
found that

45:17.682 --> 45:24.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exposure to micro-plastic seemed

45:44.041 --> 45:49.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
them more vulnerable to

JUDY WOODRUFF: And tonight on
"Charlie Rose":
more remembrances of Muhammad
Ali. That is

on most PBS stations.

46:19.310 --> 46:21.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
