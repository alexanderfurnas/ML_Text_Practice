JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.733 --> 00:08.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:08.200 --> 00:11.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour"
tonight: President Trump
turns up the heat on
members of his own party,

00:11.267 --> 00:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the health care
makeover he wants faces the
possibility of rejection.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, in her first interview
since leaving office, former
Obama National Security Adviser

00:22.900 --> 00:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Susan Rice talks the
dangers for U.S. credibility
from Trump's White House.

00:29.167 --> 00:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also ahead: Supreme Court
nominee Neil Gorsuch faces more
questions about his view of the

00:34.633 --> 00:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Constitution and the law.

00:37.400 --> 00:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as colors drain from coral
in Australia's Great Barrier
Reef, we examine how warming

00:44.367 --> 00:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
waters are killing the world's
largest living structure.

00:47.133 --> 00:50.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER SMITH, Scripps
Institution of Oceanography:
Corals reefs as we know
them will not exist

00:50.567 --> 00:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the next 10, 20, 30 years.

00:52.833 --> 00:57.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We could single-handedly be
responsible for the extinction
of an entire ecosystem.

00:57.067 --> 01:02.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:05.567 --> 01:08.567 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:08.567 --> 01:13.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
is pressing hard on members
of his own party for support

01:18.433 --> 01:21.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the Republican bill
to replace Obamacare.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, at this hour, it is
not clear he has the votes.

01:24.800 --> 01:27.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The House is scheduled to
vote on the bill on Thursday.

01:27.967 --> 01:32.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For millions, it would change
the amount of money they receive
to buy insurance and eventually

01:33.833 --> 01:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
end an expansion of Medicaid.

01:35.933 --> 01:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last week, the Congressional
Budget Office estimated 24
million more people would be

01:41.800 --> 01:44.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
uninsured over a decade
if it were to pass.

01:44.367 --> 01:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins reports on
the battle from Capitol Hill.

01:47.733 --> 01:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In the basement
of the Capitol, House members
heading to more predictable

01:52.700 --> 01:57.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
votes today conveyed
the Republican divide
over the big health care
vote set for tomorrow.

01:59.767 --> 02:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New York's Tom Reed became a
yes in the last day, thanks
to help for his district.

02:03.467 --> 02:06.067 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:06.067 --> 02:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM REED (R), New York: I
think just a continuation
of the information, the
improvements, as the

02:08.133 --> 02:10.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
detail come out.

02:10.133 --> 02:12.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think more and more
members are getting more and
more comfortable with it.

02:12.167 --> 02:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But not New
Jersey's Leonard Lance, who met
with the president yesterday.

02:15.533 --> 02:16.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He didn't change your mind?

02:16.867 --> 02:18.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:18.900 --> 02:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEONARD LANCE (R), New Jersey:
I think that he wanted to
listen to members, and I was

02:20.433 --> 02:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pleased he invited me and
other members to meet with him.

02:24.033 --> 02:25.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: That
sounds like a polite no.

02:25.467 --> 02:26.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He didn't change your mind.

02:26.467 --> 02:28.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:28.600 --> 02:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEONARD LANCE: I was honored
to be in the White House and
to meet with the president.

02:31.200 --> 02:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The semantic
dance comes because GOP
leaders may not have the votes

02:38.167 --> 02:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they need, this as their bill
hit its last stop before a
final vote the House floor,

02:41.700 --> 02:44.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the House Rules Committee.

02:44.200 --> 02:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's stacked with bill
supporters, but Republican
Rob Woodall worried
about noted the bumpy

02:48.233 --> 02:49.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ride

02:49.233 --> 02:51.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:51.833 --> 02:52.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB WOODALL (R), Georgia:
It seems like we're
going out of our way to
make this more divisive

02:52.667 --> 02:54.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than it has to be.

02:54.700 --> 02:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Budget
Chairman Diane Black
aimed for pragmatic unity.

02:56.533 --> 02:58.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:58.633 --> 03:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIANE BLACK (R), Tennessee: We
all know that analogy that is
made, it's kind of like sausage,

03:00.733 --> 03:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not pretty watching it being
made, but tastes pretty good at
the end when you get it right.

03:07.500 --> 03:10.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think that that's something
we have to encourage all
members to continue to bring

03:10.467 --> 03:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their suggestions forward.

03:12.433 --> 03:17.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Meantime,
President Trump tried to wrangle
votes, meeting with unhappy,

03:18.200 --> 03:20.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and much needed,
conservatives privately.

03:20.533 --> 03:22.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Publicly, at least,
he was confident.

03:22.567 --> 03:26.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of
the United States: We're
going to help get this done.

03:26.300 --> 03:28.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're going to get
it figured out.

03:28.467 --> 03:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a tough situation our
country has been put in.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's not easy.

03:32.933 --> 03:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But the White
House effort has still not won
over the pivotal conservative

03:36.133 --> 03:37.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Freedom Caucus.

03:37.200 --> 03:38.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Chairman Mark Meadows:

03:38.200 --> 03:40.067 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:40.067 --> 03:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK MEADOWS (R), North
Carolina: We had a great
meeting with the vice president.

03:42.100 --> 03:45.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, they are fully
engaged, but I can say this
at this particular point.

03:45.167 --> 03:49.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need changes to the
underlying bill before we
vote on it in the House.

03:49.067 --> 03:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This as
pressure keeps mounting
from outside the Capitol.

03:52.833 --> 03:57.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Among those whipping for
no votes, and dinging
those who vote yes, are
prominent conservative

03:57.433 --> 04:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
groups the Heritage Foundation
and Club for Growth.

04:01.133 --> 04:05.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Pushing in the opposite
direction, the National
Taxpayers Union, which
came out for the bill

04:05.533 --> 04:07.567 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

04:07.567 --> 04:11.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As Republicans worked behind
the scenes, Democrats were happy
to provide public optics, with

04:14.567 --> 04:18.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a flag-waving news conference
celebrating the seventh
anniversary of the Affordable

04:18.967 --> 04:20.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Care Act.

04:20.133 --> 04:21.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
House Minority
Leader Nancy Pelosi:

04:21.433 --> 04:23.467 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

04:23.467 --> 04:25.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), House
Minority Leader: Today, we are
gathered to say how proud we

04:25.600 --> 04:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are of what was accomplished
and contrast it with what is
being proposed, will be less

04:31.400 --> 04:33.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
care for more money.

04:33.800 --> 04:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The
Democrats called up
doctors, rural hospital
workers, business owners and

04:37.333 --> 04:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
patients, all stressing
opposition to Medicaid
cuts in the GOP bill, as
did former Vice President

04:44.067 --> 04:46.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Biden.

04:46.100 --> 04:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN, Former Vice
President of the United States:
We are talking about eliminating

04:48.633 --> 04:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
close to a trillion dollars
in benefits that go to people
to able to meet the commitment

04:55.567 --> 04:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we made that health care is a
right and we're transferring
all that to the wealthy.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But it
is the current White House
now in the spotlight.

05:02.833 --> 05:04.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION: Is there a plan B?

05:04.367 --> 05:05.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary: This is no plan B.

05:05.867 --> 05:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is plan A and plan A.
We're going to get this done.

05:09.133 --> 05:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: An emphatic
message to Republicans from the
White House press secretary.

05:13.033 --> 05:15.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SEAN SPICER: This is it.

05:15.133 --> 05:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you want to see
Obamacare repealed and
replaced, this is the vote.

05:20.033 --> 05:22.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS:
And if they say no?

05:22.267 --> 05:27.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
To that, President
Trump said today, "We
will see what happens."

05:27.133 --> 05:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And just in the past few
minutes, we have some news
out of the Freedom Caucus.

05:30.900 --> 05:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reporters say that the chairman
of that caucus, Mark Meadows,
who we featured, now says he's

05:35.400 --> 05:38.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
encouraged by negotiations,
and he sees some headway.

05:38.167 --> 05:42.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's different than a
yes, but indicates perhaps
some movement late tonight.

05:42.667 --> 05:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also, as we speak, the
House Rules Committee right
above me is still meeting.

05:46.033 --> 05:48.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have been at it
since 10:00 this morning.

05:48.167 --> 05:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So far, no changes to the
bill, but they're expected
to go late tonight, Judy.

05:51.433 --> 05:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Lisa, and
as you showed, there have been
a few members throughout the

05:55.700 --> 06:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
day who are now saying they're
shifting in the direction
of yes, that they have been

06:00.200 --> 06:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
persuaded by specific promises.

06:03.200 --> 06:05.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So what do you know about that?

06:05.067 --> 06:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: They're
absolutely is horse-trading
going on today.

06:07.500 --> 06:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two cases that we know about
for sure, Pennsylvania's
Lou Barletta, he tweeted
out that he is now

06:14.133 --> 06:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a yes after getting a guarantee
from House leadership for a
vote on a bill that he wants

06:19.167 --> 06:21.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that would end -- that
would ban tax credits for
undocumented immigrants.

06:21.267 --> 06:25.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also, Steve King of Iowa, he
is now a yes, sources tell
me, because he has gotten an

06:28.300 --> 06:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
assurance that the
president will push for
some insurance regulation
changes in the Senate.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, those are two new yes
votes, Judy, but there's also
at least two, probably more,

06:35.933 --> 06:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
new no votes, some on the
record, some off the record.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So it's very fluid.

06:40.867 --> 06:43.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's hard to draw
conclusions right now
about where this bill is.

06:43.067 --> 06:46.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lisa,
what about those who are
truly still on the fence?

06:46.167 --> 06:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is known about what they
want or what they need to vote?

06:49.833 --> 06:51.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Here's
what conservatives want.

06:51.900 --> 06:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Conservatives say they want this
bill to include a full repeal
of the individual mandate and

06:55.100 --> 06:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also of the essential
benefits that says what must
be in insurance packages.

06:59.633 --> 07:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The leadership in the House
and Senate say they can't do
that because of the rules of

07:03.733 --> 07:07.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the reconciliation
process, because of the
way the Senate works.

07:07.033 --> 07:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The House Freedom Caucus says
they're not so sure that's true.

07:10.133 --> 07:13.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So they're having a
procedural argument, but it
also is about substance.

07:13.267 --> 07:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's about trying to end
the mandate, which they
don't think this bill does.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's a lot of the
discussion right now.

07:19.233 --> 07:23.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally,
Lisa, will the Republican
leadership go ahead and hold a

07:23.267 --> 07:25.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vote tomorrow if they're not
sure they have the votes?

07:25.767 --> 07:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: You know, I
spoke to one member who told
me that he has heard that

07:28.800 --> 07:32.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Speaker Ryan will hold
the vote regardless, but
that's just one member.

07:32.367 --> 07:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And history tell us, Judy,
usually, if they don't have the
votes, speakers will pull the

07:36.200 --> 07:37.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bill.

07:37.433 --> 07:39.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But we're in unusual
times, as we all know.

07:39.233 --> 07:42.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We
are in unusual times.

07:42.100 --> 07:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins, thank you.

07:45.300 --> 07:49.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the day's other news: Chaos
erupted outside Britain's
Parliament Building, and when it

07:49.967 --> 07:52.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was over, at least
four people were dead.

07:52.400 --> 07:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They included an attacker who
drove into a crowd, a policeman
he stabbed before being

07:58.733 --> 08:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shot dead, and two
civilians hit by the car.

08:01.400 --> 08:05.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paul Davies of Independent
Television News
reports from London.

08:05.267 --> 08:09.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL DAVIES: Parliament
in lock down.

08:09.533 --> 08:12.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Emergency vehicles
block all roads.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
An air ambulance arrives
to collect the casualties.

08:18.933 --> 08:21.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The security services have
warned there'd been many close
calls before, but this was

08:21.733 --> 08:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the day the terror threat
arrived at Westminster,
and even entered the
grounds of the mother

08:28.067 --> 08:30.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of parliaments.

08:30.100 --> 08:34.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here, a police officer
throws a bag of emergency
supplies over the fence.

08:36.033 --> 08:39.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Inside the grounds, medics are
desperately trying to help a
colleague who has been stabbed.

08:41.233 --> 08:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A second person seen here
being treated on the left of
this picture is believed to be

08:44.633 --> 08:49.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the attacker who's
been shot by police.

08:49.133 --> 08:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
As news spreads, so does panic.

08:55.567 --> 09:00.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tourists run away, and then
we hear the sound of gunshots.

09:03.767 --> 09:08.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
While armed officers enter
Parliament, M.P.s are briefed
on what's happening outside.

09:10.733 --> 09:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID LIDINGTON, Parliament
Member: What I am able to say
to the House is that there

09:15.200 --> 09:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has been a serious
incident within the estate.

09:17.733 --> 09:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL DAVIES: But there was
more to this horrifying
event, much more.

09:23.900 --> 09:27.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
On Westminster Bridge,
a trail of carnage.

09:27.233 --> 09:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A car had mounted the pavement,
deliberately mowing down
pedestrians as it headed for the

09:32.967 --> 09:34.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
houses of Parliament.

09:34.433 --> 09:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The injured are scattered
where they were knocked down.

09:37.800 --> 09:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are multiple casualties.

09:40.333 --> 09:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The car reached the perimeter
of Parliament before
crashing into railings.

09:44.300 --> 09:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In this image, there's still
smoke coming from its engine.

09:48.533 --> 09:50.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tourists mill around it.

09:50.567 --> 09:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police say the man on this
stretcher is the one who
was shot by their officers.

09:54.433 --> 09:56.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK ROWLEY, Metropolitan Police
Acting Deputy Commission: And
whilst we currently believe

09:56.500 --> 10:01.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there was only one attacker, I'm
sure the public will understand
us taking every precaution

10:01.267 --> 10:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in locking down and searching
the area as thoroughly and
exhaustively as possible.

10:05.300 --> 10:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL DAVIES: At this stage,
police are not speculating about
the motive of the attacker,

10:11.433 --> 10:13.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the man they are
calling a terrorist.

10:13.533 --> 10:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The incident
came one year after Islamist
militants killed 32 people

10:18.333 --> 10:20.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Brussels, Belgium.

10:20.267 --> 10:23.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Turkey's president
issued a stark warning
to European states today.

10:23.833 --> 10:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Recep Tayyip Erdogan demanded
that they stop barring Turkish
government officials from

10:29.700 --> 10:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rallies of Turkish emigres.

10:31.933 --> 10:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're meant to drum up support
for expanding Erdogan's powers.

10:35.400 --> 10:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Ankara today, the Turkish
leader said that Europe has to
change its ways, or face the

10:41.033 --> 10:43.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
consequences.

10:43.567 --> 10:46.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN,
Turkish President (through
translator): These incidents
are closely followed.

10:46.167 --> 10:50.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you continue this way,
no European in any part
of the world can walk
safely on the streets.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you stay on this
dangerous path, you will
sustain the biggest damage.

10:54.333 --> 10:59.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Turkey holds
a referendum on expanding
Erdogan's powers next month.

11:01.733 --> 11:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's word tonight that
U.S. agencies may have
intercepted communications
by Trump transition

11:06.167 --> 11:08.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
officials.

11:08.233 --> 11:11.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The chair of the House
Intelligence Committee,
Devin Nunes, says it
happened during legal

11:11.600 --> 11:14.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
surveillance of
foreign nationals.

11:14.233 --> 11:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nunes briefed the president at
the White House today, and said
the information is not related

11:19.233 --> 11:21.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to any contacts
with the Russians.

11:21.033 --> 11:23.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

11:23.100 --> 11:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEVIN NUNES (R), California:
What I saw has nothing to do
with Russia and nothing to do

11:26.200 --> 11:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the Russian
investigation, has everything
to do with possible
surveillance activities.

11:33.133 --> 11:34.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the president needs to
know that these intelligence
reports are out there.

11:34.767 --> 11:36.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I have a duty
to tell him that.

11:36.933 --> 11:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nunes says he
believes the intercepts may
have been improperly included

11:41.633 --> 11:43.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in intelligence reports.

11:43.733 --> 11:48.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The chairman did share
the information with
the ranking Democrat on
the intelligence panel

11:49.100 --> 11:50.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
before going public.

11:50.733 --> 11:53.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That is representative
-- or, rather, he didn't
share it with him.

11:53.133 --> 11:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is Representative
Adam Schiff of California.

11:55.033 --> 11:57.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

11:57.033 --> 11:59.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF (D), California:
The chairman will need to decide
whether he is the chairman

11:59.767 --> 12:04.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of an independent
investigation into conduct
which includes allegations
of potential coordination

12:06.767 --> 12:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between the Trump campaign and
the Russians, or he's going
to act as a surrogate of the

12:10.133 --> 12:12.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
White House, because
he cannot do both.

12:12.867 --> 12:17.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Chairman
Nunes repeated today that
there's still no evidence
for the president's

12:17.567 --> 12:20.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
claim that he was wiretapped.

12:20.267 --> 12:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Mr. Trump said he
feels -- quote -- "somewhat
vindicated" by this disclosure.

12:24.800 --> 12:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was day three of
the Senate confirmation
hearings for Supreme Court
nominee Neil Gorsuch,

12:31.433 --> 12:36.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and he again declined
to divulge his views on
a host of legal issues.

12:38.133 --> 12:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans gave him glowing
reviews, but Democrats
complained that he's concealing

12:41.033 --> 12:42.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his views to win confirmation.

12:42.967 --> 12:47.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will have excerpts
from today's testimony and
analysis later in the program.

12:49.700 --> 12:53.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Representatives of 68 nations
gathered in Washington today
to assess the fight against

12:53.300 --> 12:54.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Islamic State group.

12:54.833 --> 12:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang has our report.

12:57.300 --> 13:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The full 68-nation
anti-ISIS coalition convened
at a moment of major gains.

13:03.667 --> 13:05.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Secretary of State
Rex Tillerson:

13:05.767 --> 13:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary
of State: Hard-fought victories
in Iraq and Syria have swung the

13:08.400 --> 13:10.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
momentum in our
coalition's favor.

13:10.867 --> 13:14.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Defeating ISIS is the
United States' number
one goal in the region.

13:14.667 --> 13:18.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Tillerson called
for other nations to step up
their own efforts, and he said

13:18.300 --> 13:22.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the focus of the ISIS fight will
soon shift to stabilization.

13:22.867 --> 13:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That would involve
creating conditions so
refugees can return home.

13:27.300 --> 13:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iraqi Prime Minister Haider
al-Abadi appealed for new
attempts to bring peace.

13:31.533 --> 13:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HAIDER AL-ABADI, Iraqi Prime
Minister (through translator): I
call for containing the regional

13:35.500 --> 13:40.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
differences and regional
conflicts because these are the
main reasons these terrorist

13:40.367 --> 13:42.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
groups rise.

13:42.800 --> 13:46.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In Iraq,
government forces pressed
the now-five-month
battle to retake Mosul

13:47.467 --> 13:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from Islamic State fighters.

13:49.833 --> 13:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): The
security forces are continuing
to help move civilians.

13:55.467 --> 13:56.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ISIS is done.

13:56.433 --> 13:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I swear they are running.

13:57.700 --> 13:59.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have nothing
left in Iraq, I swear.

13:59.967 --> 14:04.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Some of the
fiercest fighting is unfolding
around the al-Nuri Mosque.

14:06.967 --> 14:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's where ISIS leader Abu
Bakr al-Baghdadi declared
a caliphate in July 2014.

14:11.833 --> 14:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The ISIS militants are also
steadily losing ground in Syria.

14:15.500 --> 14:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, U.S. aircraft dropped
Syrian Kurdish fighters and
allied forces near the town of

14:22.400 --> 14:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tabqa, about 30 miles from
Raqqa, the self-proclaimed
capital of ISIS.

14:28.067 --> 14:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the operation is successful,
it would essentially cut off the
militants' Western approach to

14:31.200 --> 14:32.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the city.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm John Yang.

14:34.733 --> 14:38.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: North
Korea test-fired
another missile today.

14:38.300 --> 14:43.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But, this time, the U.S.
military says it blew
up just after launch.

14:43.067 --> 14:48.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Hours later, an American
B-1B bomber joined South
Korean fighter jets in
a show of deterrence.

14:50.100 --> 14:54.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Less than a month ago, the North
had test-fired four ballistic
missiles that landed in Japanese

14:54.833 --> 14:56.467 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
waters.

14:56.467 --> 15:00.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
An urgent new appeal
today about famine in
four war-torn countries.

15:00.600 --> 15:05.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The International Committee
of the Red Cross says that it
needs $300 million in emergency

15:06.667 --> 15:08.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
aid in the next
three to four months.

15:08.833 --> 15:13.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Otherwise, it says mass
starvation looms across
Yemen, Somalia, South
Sudan, and Northeastern

15:15.100 --> 15:17.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Nigeria.

15:17.033 --> 15:18.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOMINIK STILLHART, International
Committee of the Red Cross:
This is not business as

15:18.967 --> 15:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
usual; 20 million people facing
starvation is not something
that we are dealing with

15:26.267 --> 15:27.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
every day.

15:27.433 --> 15:30.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, therefore, we
really need to act now.

15:30.967 --> 15:35.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, if we act now, especially
in Yemen and in Somalia,
famine can be averted.

15:37.933 --> 15:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The United

Back in this country,
the governor of Arkansas
signed a law allowing
concealed handguns at

15:48.667 --> 15:51.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
state colleges, other
government sites and some bars.

15:51.567 --> 15:56.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gun owners would have up to
eight hours of active shooter
training -- have to have.

15:58.100 --> 16:00.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Supporters said it will
let law-abiding people
defend themselves.

16:00.200 --> 16:04.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Opponents said it will make
everyday life more dangerous.

16:04.367 --> 16:09.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Police in Los Angeles
say fear of deportation
is now discouraging
Latinos from reporting

16:10.633 --> 16:13.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
crimes.

16:13.133 --> 16:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chief Charlie Beck
says there's been a 25
percent drop in Latinos
reporting sexual assaults

16:17.233 --> 16:19.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
since January.

16:19.067 --> 16:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Reports of domestic violence
are down 10 percent.

16:22.100 --> 16:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Beck says that people are
afraid of contacting police
or appearing in court.

16:27.967 --> 16:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And Wall Street had a quiet day.

16:29.600 --> 16:34.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Dow Jones industrial
average lost six points
to close at 20661.

16:35.967 --> 16:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 27 points,
and the S&amp;P 500 added four.

16:41.567 --> 16:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the Russia file, allegations
that a former Trump campaign

16:44.733 --> 16:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
manager worked on behalf of
Russia -- one on one with Susan
Rice in her first interview

16:51.767 --> 16:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since leaving public office; the
Gorsuch hearings, more questions
for the Supreme Court nominee;

16:57.000 --> 17:02.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and much more.

17:08.733 --> 17:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From April through August of
last year, Paul Manafort was the
chairman of the Trump campaign.

17:15.733 --> 17:19.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has been under intense
scrutiny for his business and
political ties to both Russia

17:19.600 --> 17:21.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Ukraine.

17:21.567 --> 17:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the Associated Press
uncovered new information
about Manafort and his dealings

17:26.433 --> 17:27.367 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Russians.

17:27.367 --> 17:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has the story.

17:29.433 --> 17:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: According to
the Associated Press, Manafort
worked for a Russian billionaire

17:35.800 --> 17:39.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in 2005 with close ties
to President Vladimir
Putin, and drew up plans
to influence politics

17:40.900 --> 17:44.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the U.S. that would favor
Russian government interests.

17:44.267 --> 17:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more on all of this, we
turn to Jeff Horwitz of the
AP, who helped break the story.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jeff, let's lay out
your findings here.

17:50.300 --> 17:52.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFF HORWITZ,
Associated Press: Sure.

17:52.733 --> 17:56.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, according to memos
that we obtained that
Manafort wrote to Oleg
Deripaska and his associates

17:59.100 --> 18:04.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - and Deripaska is a Russian
aluminum magnate, very close to
Vladimir Putin -- Manafort was

18:06.167 --> 18:09.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
working for Deripaska
for a number of years,
starting sort of in '04,
and probably continuing

18:11.433 --> 18:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to about 2009, on a whole
bunch of projects in Eastern
Europe, with some ties into the

18:16.700 --> 18:18.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
U.S. as well.

18:18.633 --> 18:22.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so what Manafort was
basically promising to do in
the memos we have obtained is to

18:22.367 --> 18:27.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
- - was attempt to undercut
Orange revolutions, so
sort of revolutions that
were -- as a reference

18:29.333 --> 18:33.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the 2004 uprising in Ukraine
that overthrew a pro-Russian
government, to try and prevent

18:35.033 --> 18:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that and sort of promote the
Putin government's interests
throughout the region.

18:39.333 --> 18:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And part of that was focused
on the U.S. as well, with the
idea being that Manafort would

18:42.833 --> 18:45.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
use contacts in
Washington as well.

18:45.300 --> 18:49.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, in the
context of what's happening now
in the Trump administration,

18:49.167 --> 18:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what's the connection between
what Paul Manafort did 10 years
ago or 12 years ago and what's

18:53.800 --> 18:55.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
happening today?

18:55.733 --> 18:57.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF HORWITZ: So, Paul
Manafort's work is
historical on this front.

18:57.867 --> 19:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had a falling with
Oleg Deripaska over a
business deal that soured.

19:02.133 --> 19:07.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, as best as we know,
there is no continued
business relationship
between them at all.

19:09.133 --> 19:13.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the thing that is important
here is that Paul Manafort, in
these memos, both demonstrated

19:15.167 --> 19:19.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a willingness and sort of a
knowledge of the region and set
of contacts to do work on behalf

19:21.200 --> 19:23.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the Russian government.

19:23.367 --> 19:26.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In fact, that's one
of the things that he
was even promising in
these memos, was that

19:26.633 --> 19:31.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
he would happily do
work directly on behalf
of the Russian state,
if it was of interest.

19:31.267 --> 19:33.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Well,
what's the White House
response been to this?

19:33.433 --> 19:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF HORWITZ: So, the White
House's response to this has
been, one, to note that it was

19:36.633 --> 19:37.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
10 years ago.

19:37.633 --> 19:40.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's emphatically true.

19:40.367 --> 19:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they have been very careful
to say that Donald Trump,
President Donald Trump knew

19:45.233 --> 19:48.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
nothing about Paul
Manafort's past clients.

19:48.567 --> 19:53.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, they are -- also,
of course, have sort
of downplayed the role
that Mr. Manafort played

19:53.133 --> 19:54.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
during the campaign.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was the campaign chairman.

19:56.167 --> 20:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was in charge of the ship
for, I think, a number of
months, certainly including the

20:01.467 --> 20:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Republican National Convention.

20:03.533 --> 20:07.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, some of his
people sort of have stayed
on in Trump's orbit as well.

20:07.067 --> 20:12.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the White House's position
is that this has nothing to
do with Mr. Trump, that Paul

20:14.033 --> 20:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Manafort is a private citizen,
that he did nothing illegal,
and that it's time to move

20:17.600 --> 20:19.467 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

20:19.467 --> 20:21.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is
Paul Manafort being
investigated in any way now?

20:21.567 --> 20:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF HORWITZ: So, yes, there
are a number of different
things going on, and some of

20:25.800 --> 20:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this has been -- a lot
of this has been publicly
reported already.

20:28.300 --> 20:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are sort of a
number of different views.

20:30.433 --> 20:35.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, of course, we also
have members of Congress
who are at this point
hinting that they want

20:37.433 --> 20:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to subpoena him or haul him
in front of committees in
either the Senate or the House.

20:44.500 --> 20:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so that, I think, is going
to be something where we might
be getting a bit more public

20:47.533 --> 20:49.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
exposure to this.

20:49.667 --> 20:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, to be
clear, this is not the reason
that he no longer was chairman

20:51.933 --> 20:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of Donald Trump's campaign.

20:53.233 --> 20:54.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That is kind of
a separate issue.

20:54.500 --> 20:56.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFF HORWITZ: No, no.

20:56.633 --> 21:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He left the campaign in August
amid a whole bunch of concerns
as to whether they -- first

21:02.567 --> 21:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of all, whether the Ukrainian
government might have paid him
cash payments in a way that

21:07.633 --> 21:09.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was potentially illicit.

21:09.033 --> 21:10.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That was sort of a
controversy back then.

21:10.967 --> 21:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then we also reported
in, I believe, in 2013, he
actually had been doing lobbying

21:17.700 --> 21:21.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
work or had been -- his firm had
been overseeing lobbying work
in the United States on behalf

21:22.533 --> 21:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of those Ukrainian interests
without disclosing it.

21:25.300 --> 21:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, those two things together
sort of preceded his departure.

21:29.033 --> 21:32.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All
right, Jeff Horwitz of
the Associated Press,
joining us from Washington,

21:32.467 --> 21:34.467 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thanks so much.

21:34.467 --> 21:39.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFF HORWITZ: Thank you.

21:41.400 --> 21:46.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In this morning's
Washington Post, some tough
words for President Trump

21:48.133 --> 21:51.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and his administration
led the opinion pages.

21:51.267 --> 21:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We spoke earlier this evening
with former Obama White House
National Security Adviser

21:56.100 --> 21:58.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Susan Rice, the
author of that piece.

21:58.300 --> 22:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was her first interview
since leaving the White House.

22:01.133 --> 22:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I began by asking about
the allegations leveled
today by House Intelligence
Committee Chairman

22:08.133 --> 22:11.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Devin Nunes that Trump
transition officials,
including the president,
may have been swept

22:13.300 --> 22:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up in surveillance of
foreigners at the end of
the Obama administration.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN RICE, Former U.S.
National Security Adviser:
I know nothing about this.

22:17.733 --> 22:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was surprised to see
reports from Chairman
Nunes on that count today.

22:24.133 --> 22:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And let's back up and
recall where we have been.

22:27.733 --> 22:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president of the United
States accused his predecessor,
President Obama, of wiretapping

22:33.600 --> 22:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Trump Tower during the campaign.

22:35.900 --> 22:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nothing of the sort occurred,
and we have heard that
confirmed by the director of the

22:39.700 --> 22:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FBI, who also pointed out that
no president, no White House
can order the surveillance

22:45.900 --> 22:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of another American citizen.

22:48.033 --> 22:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That can only come from the
Justice Department, with the
approval of a FISA court.

22:52.000 --> 22:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, today, I really don't
know to what Chairman
Nunes was referring, but
he said that whatever

22:59.567 --> 23:04.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was referring to was a
legal, lawful surveillance,
and that it was potentially
incidental collection

23:09.867 --> 23:11.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on American citizens.

23:11.333 --> 23:13.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

23:13.333 --> 23:15.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN RICE: And I think
it's important for
people to understand
what incidental means.

23:15.900 --> 23:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That means that the target
was either a foreign
entity or somebody under
criminal investigation,

23:21.967 --> 23:26.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that the Americans who
were talking to those targets
may have been picked up.

23:28.967 --> 23:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I wanted
to ask you about this, because,
as you also know, in the last

23:33.333 --> 23:38.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
few weeks, The New York
Times has reported that,
in the final days of the
Obama administration,

23:40.267 --> 23:44.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
individuals went out of their
way to spread information
throughout the government about

23:44.100 --> 23:49.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
what they knew about
intelligence that the
Russians had interfered
in the election last

23:51.500 --> 23:56.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
year, and that there may
have been a connection with
Trump campaign officials.

23:56.367 --> 24:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, that story has now been
out there for several weeks.

24:00.133 --> 24:01.333 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Could there be a
connection here?

24:01.333 --> 24:02.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SUSAN RICE: I'm not
aware of any connection.

24:02.767 --> 24:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I read The New York Times story.

24:04.833 --> 24:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I must say, Judy, as one of
the most senior White House
officials and the most senior

24:08.400 --> 24:12.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
responsible for national
security, I found that
report a bit perplexing.

24:12.667 --> 24:17.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wasn't aware of any
orders given to disseminate
that kind of information.

24:17.067 --> 24:18.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

24:18.533 --> 24:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUSAN RICE: So, I have no idea
whether that was the case.

24:21.400 --> 24:26.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the fact is that the
president did request
back in December that the
intelligence community

24:29.533 --> 24:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
compile all of the information
that it had on what had
transpired during the campaign

24:36.500 --> 24:39.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with respect to the Russians
involving themselves in
the presidential campaign.

24:39.300 --> 24:44.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that report was
provided to the American
people in unclassified
form and to Congress

24:45.500 --> 24:47.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in classified form
in early January.

24:47.533 --> 24:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And was there
a concern, though, inside the
Obama administration, inside the

24:51.533 --> 24:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
White House that the new Trump
administration might not follow
up on that intelligence that

24:57.267 --> 24:59.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
had been gathered?

24:59.367 --> 25:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN RICE: I don't think that
was the concern, because, to
the extent that there was any

25:01.500 --> 25:05.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need to follow up, it wouldn't
be done necessarily by the White
House, but by the intelligence

25:05.067 --> 25:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
community, and by the Justice
Department, if appropriate.

25:08.300 --> 25:13.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think our interest was, and
the president's direction was,
let us make sure that we have

25:13.067 --> 25:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
compiled and put together in
one place all the information
that we have, so that it is

25:17.733 --> 25:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there for the new
administration, it's there
for the American people,
and there for Congress

25:21.833 --> 25:23.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to utilize as they see fit.

25:23.900 --> 25:28.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's --
that brings us to the opinion
piece that you wrote that

25:28.167 --> 25:33.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
appeared today in The Washington
Post, Ambassador Rice, in which
you -- what you describe as

25:35.567 --> 25:38.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a pattern of false
statements from this
president could jeopardize
the national security of

25:40.233 --> 25:41.367 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this country.

25:41.367 --> 25:42.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's a serious charge.

25:42.533 --> 25:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What did you mean by that?

25:43.733 --> 25:45.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SUSAN RICE: Well,
let me explain, Judy.

25:45.800 --> 25:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the American people
know that, over the last weeks
of the administration, it's

25:51.533 --> 25:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now been almost -- almost
exactly two months - - we have
heard a number of striking and

25:56.900 --> 26:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually patently misleading
statements from not only the
president, but also from his

26:02.700 --> 26:04.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
principal spokespersons.

26:04.833 --> 26:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And those statements are heard
and digested by the rest of
the world, whether they are

26:09.233 --> 26:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our friends or our adversaries.

26:11.633 --> 26:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Wall Street Journal
made a very similar point
today on its editorial page.

26:16.333 --> 26:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the point is this: The
United States of America is
the leading power in the world.

26:23.233 --> 26:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our friends and our adversaries
respect us in large measure
because they know that we

26:27.533 --> 26:28.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are steady.

26:28.333 --> 26:29.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We are fact-based.

26:29.233 --> 26:31.267 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We are serious.

26:31.267 --> 26:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when we have the White House
of the United States putting
out information that everybody

26:38.267 --> 26:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can see to be inaccurate,
if not deliberately false,
it shakes the credibility
and the confidence

26:43.200 --> 26:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of our allies, and it lends
doubt to our adversaries
who may miscalculate.

26:47.600 --> 26:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it undermines the confidence
of the American people in what
comes out of the White House,

26:51.900 --> 26:56.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is very detrimental in
the event we have a national
crisis and we need to rally

26:56.567 --> 26:58.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
around the flag.

26:58.633 --> 27:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, just to play
devil's advocate for a moment,
how do you or how does anyone

27:02.933 --> 27:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
else know, though, that this is
just not the rough beginning,
rocky beginning of a new

27:10.133 --> 27:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
administration, and that other
countries can see through
mistakes, whatever you want to

27:14.833 --> 27:19.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
call them, statements,
and they're looking at
the overall picture and
U.S. national security

27:21.267 --> 27:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is not really in jeopardy?

27:23.300 --> 27:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN RICE: Well, Judy, I think
if it were one or two such
statements, and then the -- they

27:29.100 --> 27:32.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
were corrected when the
facts were plain, that
would be one thing.

27:32.633 --> 27:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we have had statements
ranging from the allegation that
three million to five million

27:39.667 --> 27:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
illegal immigrants voted in
our elections, which has been
debunked on a bipartisan basis

27:44.767 --> 27:47.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by members of Congress, to
this allegation that we have
already discussed, which was

27:47.567 --> 27:52.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
quite shocking, that the
president's predecessor,
President Obama, had
illegally wiretapped

27:54.133 --> 27:57.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his office building
during the campaign.

27:57.233 --> 28:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have heard from
bipartisan leaders of Congress,
as well as from the director

28:03.800 --> 28:05.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of the FBI, that there's
no information to
support that allegation.

28:05.900 --> 28:10.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And yet there's been no
correction, no apology.

28:10.033 --> 28:14.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the world is not
impervious to what happens
here in the United States.

28:14.367 --> 28:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, on the contrary, they
watch it very, very carefully.

28:17.433 --> 28:20.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they wonder and worry,
what does this mean?

28:20.667 --> 28:22.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Can we trust the word
of the White House?

28:22.667 --> 28:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, in the
meantime, different subject.

28:24.800 --> 28:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the Trump administration
convened a meet hearing in
Washington of the leaders

28:28.933 --> 28:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from 68 countries to talk
about the fight against
ISIS, the path forward.

28:35.767 --> 28:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, among other things,
officials of this administration
are saying the reason ISIS

28:41.700 --> 28:44.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is still the threat that it
is to the world is in part
because of the failed policies

28:45.667 --> 28:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the Obama administration.

28:47.133 --> 28:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUSAN RICE: Well, I think the
facts don't bear that out.

28:49.833 --> 28:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The strategy that the Trump
administration is pursuing,
at the behest of the very same

28:56.800 --> 29:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
military leaders who advised
the Obama administration,
is virtually unchanged.

29:02.533 --> 29:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fundamentals of the
strategy, which are to work with
partners, in the case of Iraq,

29:05.300 --> 29:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Iraqi government, in the
case of Syria, with the Syrian
democratic forces, a mixture

29:12.233 --> 29:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Kurds and Arabs, to take
back territory, remains the
thrust of our strategies, as it

29:16.900 --> 29:18.967 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
should be.

29:18.967 --> 29:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The last thing
I want to ask you about is a
decision that was announced

29:21.933 --> 29:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or that appears to have been
made by this administration
to shift more authority over

29:26.333 --> 29:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
military operations to the
Pentagon, in the context of
criticism that under President

29:33.300 --> 29:37.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Obama there was too
micromanaging out of
the White House about
everything that happened

29:38.233 --> 29:39.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that the military did.

29:39.833 --> 29:43.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SUSAN RICE: Well, I
think that criticism
is a well-trodden line.

29:43.767 --> 29:46.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have heard it many times.

29:46.467 --> 29:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I think the fact is this.

29:48.500 --> 29:51.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama took very,
very seriously his role
as commander in chief.

29:51.733 --> 29:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, you know, when things
go wrong, as, unfortunately,
tragically, they did in
Yemen recently during

29:58.733 --> 30:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the first military raid of this
administration, or when we're
trying to figure out what just

30:03.133 --> 30:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happened in Syria with respect
to a bombing that caused a
number of civilian casualties

30:10.100 --> 30:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - some say it was a mosque --
we say it wasn't - - it's very
important that the commander

30:13.300 --> 30:18.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in chief own responsibility
for decisions such as that
and is willing to say to the

30:20.833 --> 30:24.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
men and women in uniform,
that was my choice, and
not blame it on others,
whether the commanders

30:26.367 --> 30:28.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or people below him.

30:28.500 --> 30:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Former National
Security Adviser to President
Obama Susan Rice, thank you very

30:32.633 --> 30:33.867 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

30:33.867 --> 30:38.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SUSAN RICE: Good to
be with you, Judy.

30:39.533 --> 30:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

30:45.933 --> 30:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Australia's Great Barrier
Reef under threat.

30:49.900 --> 30:54.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, first, a look at
the third day of Supreme
Court confirmation
hearings and what more

30:55.800 --> 30:58.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we learned about Neil Gorsuch.

30:58.067 --> 31:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joining me at the table tonight,
"PBS NewsHour" hour Supreme
Court analyst Marcia Coyle of

31:02.600 --> 31:06.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"The National Law Journal," Amy
Howe, editor of SCOTUSblog.com.

31:06.767 --> 31:10.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Pam Karlan, she's a professor
of law at Stanford University.

31:10.967 --> 31:14.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She worked in the Justice
Department during the
Obama administration.

31:14.367 --> 31:19.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Ilya Shapiro, he's a
senior fellow in constitutional
studies at the Cato Institute.

31:20.233 --> 31:21.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a libertarian think tank.

31:21.467 --> 31:23.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And welcome all of you
back to the "NewsHour."

31:23.800 --> 31:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want us to start by listening
to something that Senator
Dianne Feinstein had to say.

31:30.800 --> 31:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She pressed Judge Gorsuch
on his views about how to
interpret the Constitution.

31:32.833 --> 31:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she expressed some concern
over what he said before on
the importance of Supreme Court

31:38.500 --> 31:39.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
precedent.

31:39.500 --> 31:40.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Let's listen.

31:40.500 --> 31:42.167 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

31:42.167 --> 31:44.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D),
California: We talked
about precedent.

31:44.300 --> 31:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what's happened is, every
Republican-appointed judge has
gone back and is a no vote.

31:50.633 --> 31:54.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, how does -- how
does one look at you?

31:54.900 --> 31:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the life of me, I really
don't know, when you're there,
what you're going to do with

32:00.433 --> 32:02.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

32:02.533 --> 32:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH, Supreme Court
Nominee: Senator, all I can do
is -- I can't promise you how

32:07.467 --> 32:09.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I would rule in a
particular case.

32:09.300 --> 32:13.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That would be deeply
wrong to sit here at
a confirmation table.

32:13.267 --> 32:18.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think we agree on that,
that it would be a violation
of the independent judiciary

32:20.233 --> 32:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a nominee to a court to
make a promise on any case
in order to win confirmation.

32:24.600 --> 32:26.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

32:26.333 --> 32:27.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LINDSEY GRAHAM (R),
South Carolina: Are
you an originalist?

32:27.500 --> 32:29.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NEIL GORSUCH: I'm happy
to be called that.

32:29.833 --> 32:34.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I do worry about the use
of labels in our civic
discussion to sometimes
ignore the underlying

32:37.333 --> 32:41.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ideas, as if originalism
belonged to a party.

32:41.867 --> 32:43.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It doesn't.

32:43.133 --> 32:45.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
As if it belonged to
an ideological wing.

32:45.533 --> 32:46.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It doesn't.

32:46.533 --> 32:48.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

32:48.033 --> 32:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, here's
what I say about originalism.

32:49.533 --> 32:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Whether you like it or not,
is it bound by the law?

32:51.600 --> 32:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH: Of course it is.

32:53.133 --> 32:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the whole point of
how you interpret the law.

32:55.300 --> 32:57.367 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

32:57.367 --> 33:00.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM: Now, to those
who believe the Constitution
is a living, breathing document

33:00.267 --> 33:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that can speak to you and
nobody else, that bothers me.

33:04.133 --> 33:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The bottom line is, there are
different ways of looking at
the role of being a judge.

33:11.200 --> 33:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you believe that your way
of looking at being a judge
has stood the test of time?

33:17.733 --> 33:19.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NEIL GORSUCH: I do.

33:19.700 --> 33:22.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Marcia
Coyle, what did we learn
about Judge Gorsuch from this?

33:22.467 --> 33:24.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, "The
National Law Journal": OK.

33:24.533 --> 33:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, I think two things were
going on here in the exchange,
particularly with Senator

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Feinstein.

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First of all, she was trying
to get at, what kind of
originalist is Judge Gorsuch?

33:34.867 --> 33:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're not all the same.

33:37.300 --> 33:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, Justice Scalia,
who was a self-proclaimed
originalist, often said
that Justice Clarence

33:41.667 --> 33:44.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Thomas was the only
true originalist on
the Supreme Court.

33:44.500 --> 33:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, she was trying to get
a sense of him and also her
concern about precedent.

33:51.400 --> 33:55.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it is true every Supreme
Court nominee has testified
to respect for precedent.

33:56.567 --> 34:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But precedents, old
decisions, do get overruled.

34:00.533 --> 34:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The question was, what factors
do you use, can you justify
upsetting the law by overruling

34:06.133 --> 34:08.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an old decision?

34:08.200 --> 34:12.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Judge Gorsuch did lay out
the factors multiple times,
even though he won't commit

34:13.800 --> 34:17.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to not overruling
a specific case.

34:17.267 --> 34:19.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Pam Karlan, what
did you take away from this?

34:19.367 --> 34:21.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAM KARLAN, Stanford
Law School: Well, here's
what was interesting.

34:21.967 --> 34:25.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He did commit to not
overruling Brown against
Board Of Education.

34:25.367 --> 34:27.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He said that case was
correctly decided.

34:27.433 --> 34:32.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He did commit to not overturning
Griswold about the right
of married couples to use

34:32.267 --> 34:34.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
contraception.

34:34.400 --> 34:38.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he refused to commit to
the same idea with regard to
cases like Roe or cases like

34:38.867 --> 34:40.967 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Lawrence.

34:40.967 --> 34:44.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there's no honest
originalist who really
can say that the people
who ratified the 14th

34:46.533 --> 34:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Amendment in 1868 thought
that it protected gay people,
given that the same people who

34:51.033 --> 34:55.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ratified that amendment
all prohibited sodomy
in their states.

34:57.100 --> 35:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think he gave us a very
clear sense of what kind of
an originalist he was today

35:02.800 --> 35:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the way he answered
questions about different
lines of precedent.

35:04.533 --> 35:06.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ilya Shapiro?

35:06.467 --> 35:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ILYA SHAPIRO, Cato
Institute: Well, Pam, I'm
an honest originalist.

35:07.833 --> 35:09.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
At least I try to be.

35:09.900 --> 35:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would say that the
14th Amendment does protect
gay rights in various ways.

35:13.233 --> 35:17.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I filed briefs supporting
the challengers in Obergefell
and all the others.

35:17.700 --> 35:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Cato Institute has long
been about that, because you
have to understand that you do

35:22.000 --> 35:24.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
originalism at the right time.

35:24.167 --> 35:28.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You're not looking into
the brains, into minds
of the people that were
enacting it or ratifying

35:28.400 --> 35:29.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

35:29.400 --> 35:30.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You look at the words.

35:30.600 --> 35:32.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And what did the words
mean at the time?

35:32.767 --> 35:36.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Equal means equal, just
like you don't have to
update the Constitution
to apply the Interstate

35:38.567 --> 35:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Commerce Clause to airplanes
or the Internet, because
that's interstate commerce.

35:41.200 --> 35:43.267 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

35:43.267 --> 35:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Howe,
I'm going to come to you to
ask you to adjudicate this.

35:45.233 --> 35:47.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

35:47.300 --> 35:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY HOWE, SCOTUSblog.com: Well,
I think that this is really
sort of a bigger picture issue,

35:50.233 --> 35:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is that the senators,
the Democrats senators, are
trying to get more information

35:55.833 --> 35:57.867 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about Gorsuch.

35:57.867 --> 36:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, Donald Trump
said he wanted to appoint
justices in the mold of Scalia

36:02.633 --> 36:04.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Clarence Thomas.

36:04.800 --> 36:07.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Democratic senators
are trying to figure out,
well, you know, what makes him

36:07.767 --> 36:09.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
think that?

36:09.833 --> 36:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, OK, and there's
originalism, but what kind of
originalism -- originalist are

36:13.133 --> 36:15.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you?

36:15.233 --> 36:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
there's something else I
want you all to listen to.

36:17.233 --> 36:20.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
During his campaign, we know
that then-candidate Donald Trump
promised to appoint justices

36:22.567 --> 36:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with similar philosophies
to himself and to
Justice Antonin Scalia.

36:25.433 --> 36:30.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, Democratic Senator
Patrick Leahy questioned
- - today questioned
Judge Gorsuch on where

36:31.033 --> 36:31.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his views are.

36:31.567 --> 36:33.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

36:33.633 --> 36:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PATRICK LEAHY (D), Vermont:
Mr. Priebus said you have the
vision of Donald Trump, and,

36:36.633 --> 36:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by nominating you, Donald Trump
was talking about changing
potentially 40 years of law,

36:43.233 --> 36:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
suggesting you are coming
in as a Trojan horse.

36:49.400 --> 36:51.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What vision do you share
with President Trump?

36:51.433 --> 36:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH: Senator, I mean,
no disrespect to any other
person in saying, they don't

36:57.367 --> 36:58.667 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
speak for me.

36:58.667 --> 37:00.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I don't speak for them.

37:00.867 --> 37:05.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, I have great
admiration for Justice Scalia,
as we have talked about.

37:07.800 --> 37:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have admiration for every
member of this committee and
for the president of the United

37:10.933 --> 37:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
States, for the vice president
of the United States.

37:13.400 --> 37:16.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But, respectfully, none
of you speaks for me.

37:16.067 --> 37:18.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I speak for me.

37:18.200 --> 37:19.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I am a judge.

37:19.900 --> 37:21.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I am independent.

37:21.433 --> 37:22.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I make up my own mind.

37:22.900 --> 37:24.867 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

37:24.867 --> 37:26.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD DURBIN (D-IL), Minority
Whip: Judge, in eight out
of 10 cases that came before

37:26.567 --> 37:28.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you, you ruled against the
students with disabilities.

37:28.267 --> 37:29.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

37:29.700 --> 37:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH: I'm sure
they were unanimous panels.

37:31.733 --> 37:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to suggest that I have
some animus against children,
Senator, would be mistaken.

37:39.433 --> 37:40.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

37:40.433 --> 37:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RICHARD DURBIN: Judge, please.

37:43.733 --> 37:45.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm not suggesting that.

37:45.800 --> 37:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You are -- what I'm basically
saying to you is, I can only
look at your court opinions,

37:52.367 --> 37:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the words you write,
because, like many nominees,
you are careful in your
testimony before us.

37:57.933 --> 38:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have told us time and again,
no place for my heart here.

38:00.800 --> 38:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is all about the facts.

38:02.100 --> 38:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is all about the law.

38:03.333 --> 38:05.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't buy that.

38:05.300 --> 38:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think that the decisions
of courts are so robotic,
so programmatic that all you

38:11.633 --> 38:13.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need to do is to look at the
facts and look at the law and
there's an obvious conclusion.

38:13.867 --> 38:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If that were the case, there
would never be a dissent.

38:16.033 --> 38:19.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy
Howe, do we -- what do
we take away from this?

38:19.667 --> 38:24.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was about whether
Judge Gorsuch sees people
as human beings, or is
he blindly following

38:25.967 --> 38:27.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the law, it seemed?

38:27.967 --> 38:29.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY HOWE: Well, what I would
say, I think maybe what Durbin
was trying to say -- and

38:29.967 --> 38:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
maybe it was just inartfully
phrased -- is - - and he had
something there, the idea Judge

38:34.100 --> 38:35.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Gorsuch keeps
saying, I'm a judge.

38:35.900 --> 38:38.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I apply the laws to the facts.

38:38.067 --> 38:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's not always that
easy, particularly when you
get to the Supreme Court.

38:41.633 --> 38:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cases get to the Supreme
Court because they're hard.

38:44.700 --> 38:49.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as Senator Durbin said, if
it were that easy, a computer
could do it, there would

38:50.300 --> 38:52.267 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be no dissents.

38:52.267 --> 38:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so what he was, I think,
trying to get at was, you
know, like, when there's a gray

38:55.533 --> 38:57.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
area, what else are you
going to bring to the table?

38:57.367 --> 38:59.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do
you take away from all
this, Ilya Shapiro?

38:59.900 --> 39:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ILYA SHAPIRO: Well, I
look at it another couple
of changes during the
day's questioning with

39:06.467 --> 39:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Al Franken about arbitration,
and then with Ben Sasse
about the same topic.

39:08.533 --> 39:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this goes towards how some
judges are simply more willing
to bend the law to achieve

39:13.300 --> 39:17.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a just result, because,
otherwise, they don't like the
result that they're getting.

39:17.167 --> 39:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Franken was talking about
how arbitration provisions
might go against the little guy.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then Ben Sasse said, well,
I might agree with you in those
cases that you're presenting.

39:24.600 --> 39:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we, senators, the Congress,
should change those laws.

39:28.300 --> 39:30.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's where the debate is.

39:30.367 --> 39:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sometimes, just reaching a
result that seems unjust, that
is an indication for Congress

39:34.800 --> 39:36.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to change it.

39:36.033 --> 39:38.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Pick up
on that, Pam Karlan.

39:38.033 --> 39:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAM KARLAN: Well, the question
is what the interpretation
of the Arbitration Act is.

39:41.900 --> 39:46.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The current Supreme Court,
with a Republican majority, has
narrowed people's ability to

39:48.967 --> 39:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get into court by reading a
law that's been around since
the 1920s more narrowly than

39:51.633 --> 39:53.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the court used to.

39:53.733 --> 39:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think it's important
to understand that laws can
be read in a lot of different

39:58.667 --> 40:00.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ways.

40:00.233 --> 40:02.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're not always
absolutely clear.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And judges have to bring
judgment to those laws.

40:04.967 --> 40:09.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And conservatives and liberals
have very different views
on how to read those laws.

40:10.700 --> 40:11.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It isn't mechanical.

40:11.633 --> 40:13.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Amy Howe is exactly right.

40:13.667 --> 40:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to the extent that judges
suggest this is mechanical,
with the kind of balls and

40:17.600 --> 40:21.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strikes metaphors, or the I'm
just a lawyer applying the
-- I'm just a judge applying

40:21.867 --> 40:26.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the law, they're hiding what
is often going on, which is
the exercise of judgment about,

40:28.767 --> 40:32.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what does a word like -- a
phrase like free and appropriate
education in the Endrew case

40:32.367 --> 40:33.367 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mean?

40:33.367 --> 40:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Marcia Coyle?

40:35.533 --> 40:39.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: I tend to agree
more with Pam, because I think
that Senator Durbin was trying

40:41.400 --> 40:45.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - if you had listened to
the whole exchange, he was
trying to find exactly that.

40:47.800 --> 40:50.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is this a judge who
reads laws narrowly?

40:50.867 --> 40:55.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In this particular case
involving individuals
with disabilities in
education, the children,

40:57.800 --> 41:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he focused on a word that
Judge Gorsuch had in an opinion
that appeared to narrow the

41:03.833 --> 41:08.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
standard for these children
to get the help they needed
in the -- in public schools or

41:09.033 --> 41:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
outside of public schools.

41:11.100 --> 41:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think, again, this was
an effort, even if not really
direct and clear, to try to

41:15.967 --> 41:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
understand how Judge
Gorsuch approaches the law.

41:19.000 --> 41:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, in this
final excerpt from today's
hearing that I want to share,

41:23.400 --> 41:28.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this was an exchange with
Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a
Democrat, about a court decision

41:28.267 --> 41:30.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on campaign finance.

41:30.300 --> 41:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, Judge Gorsuch expressed
concern about the idea of
judges being political and the

41:33.933 --> 41:35.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
role of politics in
the federal court.

41:35.867 --> 41:37.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Let's listen.

41:37.933 --> 41:41.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH: I'm distressed to
hear you think that judges or
the Supreme Court is an organ

41:43.733 --> 41:45.267 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of a party.

41:45.267 --> 41:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That, to me, is just --
I know you feel that way.

41:49.600 --> 41:50.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that distresses me.

41:50.600 --> 41:52.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

41:52.600 --> 41:53.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHELDON WHITEHOUSE (D),
Rhode Island: It distresses
me, too, quite a lot.

41:53.867 --> 41:54.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NEIL GORSUCH: And
I just don't...

41:54.433 --> 41:56.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

41:56.100 --> 41:58.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BEN SASSE (R), Nebraska:
Most people aren't
watching these hearings.

41:58.167 --> 42:01.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And most people are going
to see some headline
summary of what happened.

42:03.433 --> 42:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they see something that looks
like Republicans voted one way
and Democrats voted another

42:05.933 --> 42:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way, and they have echoing
in their ears the sounds of
people saying that you are some

42:12.900 --> 42:17.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
sort of a shill for
big business, and that
the American people
should be scared of you,

42:19.933 --> 42:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we will have in this body
done something to further
erode the public trust.

42:22.833 --> 42:27.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I sincerely hope that
my colleagues on the other side
of the aisle, as they approach

42:27.267 --> 42:32.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voting, will recognize that
the audience after they vote
isn't just people in their next

42:34.133 --> 42:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
primary who want to see a
greater politicization of every
question in American life.

42:39.267 --> 42:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, I'm going
to come to you, Ilya Shapiro.

42:41.333 --> 42:45.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Did we come away from at least
from what we heard so far
thinking these courts are more

42:45.267 --> 42:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
political than ever because
of the kinds of questions
and answers we're hearing?

42:49.633 --> 42:51.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ILYA SHAPIRO:
Well, I'm not sure.

42:51.700 --> 42:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we come away thinking
the senators are more political
even than we possibly could

42:53.900 --> 42:55.167 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have imagined.

42:55.167 --> 42:57.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was a very fraught
hearing in that way.

42:57.267 --> 43:00.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if you look at the actual
facts, at the Supreme Court,
the Democratically appointed

43:00.367 --> 43:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
justices vote together more
often, certainly in the
controversial cases, than
the Republican-appointed

43:05.833 --> 43:07.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ones.

43:07.300 --> 43:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We always talk about, will
Kennedy go one way or another?

43:09.133 --> 43:13.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Will Roberts do
another Obamacare vote
of a certain kind?

43:13.300 --> 43:17.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's much less debate about,
will Sotomayor defect or what
crazy thing will Breyer come

43:17.700 --> 43:19.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
up with these days?

43:19.367 --> 43:22.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, I think there's just
a lot of intellectual
fervent on the right.

43:22.933 --> 43:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's -- and so that's what
gives people -- turns them on
or turns them off the court.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Marcia Coyle,
are we picking up more from
listening to these exchanges

43:35.800 --> 43:40.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about whether we should be
reading politics into so much
of what the Supreme Court does?

43:40.367 --> 43:45.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Well, I think
everybody has to not be naive
about what the Supreme Court

43:45.933 --> 43:47.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
does.

43:47.200 --> 43:49.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Supreme Court is a
political institution.

43:49.367 --> 43:52.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The justices are there
through a political process.

43:52.567 --> 43:57.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what you have to step
back and think about is,
are the justices, when
they make decisions,

43:58.467 --> 44:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
acting in a partisan way?

44:00.600 --> 44:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's where, at least
I still believe, that the
institution is not partisan.

44:08.167 --> 44:13.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I remember, during today's
hearing, Senator Graham being
very frustrated and saying, gee,

44:15.100 --> 44:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when Justice Scalia went
through here, it was 97-0.

44:18.933 --> 44:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When Justice Ginsburg, a
Democratic appointee, went
through here, it was 93 or 96-0.

44:24.867 --> 44:27.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What has happened?

44:27.367 --> 44:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, I think both I
think the executive
branch and the legislative
branch share the blame.

44:34.233 --> 44:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans and Democrats
share the blame.

44:36.233 --> 44:41.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The way this particular vacancy
has been handled has really
upped the political stakes.

44:41.933 --> 44:43.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And there's a cost.

44:43.967 --> 44:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a cost to Judge
Gorsuch, who has had to set
-- prove his independence.

44:49.467 --> 44:51.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And then there's a
cost to the institution
of the Supreme Court.

44:51.700 --> 44:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Pam Karlan,
where do you come down on just
how political this whole thing

44:55.000 --> 44:57.067 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is?

44:57.067 --> 45:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAM KARLAN: I don't think this
is so much political, as it
is fundamental disagreements

45:00.533 --> 45:05.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in America about what our
Constitution means and
about how to interpret it.

45:05.067 --> 45:10.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And those map on sometimes
to partisan divisions, but I
think they're bigger than that.

45:11.500 --> 45:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's a profound moment in
our constitutional history.

45:13.500 --> 45:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Howe,
you get the last word on the
politics of this whole thing.

45:16.400 --> 45:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY HOWE: Well, I tend to
agree with Marcia that there's
politics at the court, but not

45:22.267 --> 45:24.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
necessarily partisanship.

45:24.767 --> 45:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do think, you know,
Senator John Kennedy
of Louisiana kind of
went off-message today.

45:27.833 --> 45:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He told Gorsuch that: Many of
my constituents voted for Trump
because of the Supreme Court.

45:34.833 --> 45:38.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why Trump put out
the list that Gorsuch was
on, was to try and get...

45:38.667 --> 45:40.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
During the campaign.

45:40.733 --> 45:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY HOWE: During the campaigns
-- to get the votes of social
conservatives, to reassure

45:42.433 --> 45:45.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
them that he was going
to appoint someone that
would make them happy.

45:45.433 --> 45:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you're saying
that wasn't the message that
maybe they intended to get

45:48.200 --> 45:50.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out there.

45:50.300 --> 45:51.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY HOWE: That is certainly
not the message that Judge
Gorsuch was advancing today.

45:51.767 --> 45:53.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, we
did -- today was the second day.

45:53.700 --> 45:55.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it looks like they
may go in tomorrow.

45:55.500 --> 45:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're waiting to see how much
longer things go tonight.

45:58.633 --> 46:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are going to be back with
the four of you tomorrow.

46:00.533 --> 46:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we thank you all very much.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Amy Howe, Pam Karlan, Marcia
Coyle, Ilya Shapiro, thank you.

46:04.733 --> 46:06.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ILYA SHAPIRO: Thank you.

46:06.033 --> 46:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Thanks, Judy.

46:10.500 --> 46:14.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY HOWE: Thank you.

46:14.967 --> 46:19.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Great
Barrier Reef along the coast of
Australia is considered one of

46:21.233 --> 46:24.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the greatest natural
wonders of the world.

46:24.100 --> 46:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It actually consists of more
than 2,900 smaller reefs and 900
islands and countless species

46:31.467 --> 46:32.967 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of fish.

46:32.967 --> 46:36.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But its health and future
are very much in doubt.

46:36.167 --> 46:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Miles O'Brien has the story
for our weekly segment on the
Leading Edge of science and

46:40.833 --> 46:42.867 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
technology.

46:42.867 --> 46:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Half the size
of Texas, spanning 1,400 miles,
Australia's Great Barrier Reef

46:48.467 --> 46:51.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is the largest living
structure on the planet.

46:51.733 --> 46:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is rich in beauty and
diversity, but it is dying, as
the ocean waters steadily warm.

46:58.767 --> 47:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID WACHENFELD, Great Barrier
Reef Marine Park Authority: It's
a very confronting situation.

47:00.833 --> 47:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I hope the people of the
world take this as a call to
action to do more about climate

47:04.533 --> 47:06.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
change.

47:06.600 --> 47:10.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Coral reef
ecologist David Wachenfeld is
director for reef recovery at

47:10.367 --> 47:13.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Great Barrier Reef
Marine Park Authority.

47:13.733 --> 47:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the second consecutive
summer of extensive
coral destruction, or
bleaching, on the reef.

47:20.800 --> 47:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID WACHENFELD: We are using
aerial surveys and underwater
surveys to try and cover that

47:26.867 --> 47:31.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whole enormous area of the Great
Barrier Reef to get a handle
on the extent and severity

47:31.367 --> 47:33.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the event.

47:33.433 --> 47:37.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, certainly, this year is
shaping up to be another very
bad year, as was last year.

47:39.833 --> 47:42.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Last
year, two-thirds of the
corals in the northern
part of the Great Barrier

47:42.267 --> 47:46.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Reef died, the worst
die-off in history.

47:46.700 --> 47:48.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
As for this year, it
is too early to tell.

47:48.900 --> 47:53.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the outlook is grim,
as this is one big piece
of an unprecedented
global coral crisis.

47:55.867 --> 47:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
C. MARK EAKIN, National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration:
Since June of '14, we have

47:58.233 --> 48:01.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
had continuous bleaching
somewhere in the world.

48:01.833 --> 48:06.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Globally, over 70 percent of
the coral reefs around the
globe have been exposed to the

48:06.567 --> 48:09.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
high temperatures
that cause bleaching.

48:09.033 --> 48:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Coral
reef ecologist Mark Eakin
is the coordinator for
the National Oceanic

48:14.833 --> 48:17.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Atmospheric Administration's
Coral Reef Watch.

48:17.567 --> 48:22.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He relies on data from
scientific satellites
operated by NOAA, the
Europeans, and the Japanese

48:23.767 --> 48:26.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that measure ocean
water temperature.

48:26.333 --> 48:31.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He, along with David
Wachenfeld, is co-author
of a new study published
in the journal "Nature"

48:33.367 --> 48:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
documenting the link between
warm waters and dying coral
in the Great Barrier Reef.

48:37.400 --> 48:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
C. MARK EAKIN: What we did
here at Coral Reef Watch was to
provide the satellite data that

48:44.033 --> 48:46.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
gives the information on
the areas where the high
temperatures occurred.

48:46.633 --> 48:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there are charts in there
showing where the bleaching was
worst and where the temperatures

48:53.633 --> 48:57.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
were highest for the
longest time, and the
correlation between that
heat stress and where

48:58.133 --> 49:00.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the bleaching occurred
was very high.

49:00.800 --> 49:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Coral reefs
are the rain forests of
the sea, brimming with
mind-boggling diversity

49:05.533 --> 49:07.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that is still not
fully explored.

49:07.967 --> 49:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER SMITH, Scripps
Institution of Oceanography:
Despite the fact that
coral reefs occupy a

49:10.133 --> 49:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very small footprint of the
overall Earth's surface, less
than 0.1 percent, an area about

49:17.033 --> 49:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the size of the country of
France, they're home to more
species of marine organisms than

49:19.800 --> 49:22.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
any other marine
ecosystem on the planet.

49:22.000 --> 49:27.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Jen Smith
is associate professor
in marine biology at
the Scripps Institution

49:28.533 --> 49:31.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of Oceanography at
the University of
California, San Diego.

49:31.733 --> 49:36.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We met at Scripps' Birch
Aquarium, home to some
spectacular displays
of reef ecosystems

49:38.900 --> 49:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to nurture curious minds and,
behind the scenes, an extensive
nursery to nurture the coral

49:46.767 --> 49:49.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
itself.

49:49.300 --> 49:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most corals are nourished
through a symbiotic
relationship with algae,
that convert sunlight

49:54.800 --> 49:56.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
into energy, which
the corals tap into.

49:56.833 --> 50:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER SMITH: So, it's like
having a garden growing in your
stomach where 90 percent of

50:01.533 --> 50:05.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
your daily nutrition
comes directly from that
garden in your stomach.

50:05.200 --> 50:09.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The pigments
in the algae are the source
of the vivid rainbow of colors

50:09.767 --> 50:12.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a healthy coral reef.

50:12.100 --> 50:14.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the algae are very
temperature-sensitive.

50:14.200 --> 50:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A few degrees warmer
than normal, and their
photosynthesis is enhanced.

50:19.100 --> 50:24.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That may sound good,
but the unfortunate
byproduct is a toxin.

50:24.067 --> 50:29.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the coral is forced to spit
out its food source, revealing
its white color, thus the

50:30.300 --> 50:32.867 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
term bleaching.

50:32.867 --> 50:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jen Smith showed me Birch's
display of an unhealthy
bleached coral reef.

50:37.500 --> 50:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER SMITH: As long as you
still see white skeleton, that's
usually an indication that

50:41.700 --> 50:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the coral is still alive,
because, as soon as the tissue
starts dying, your seaweed will

50:48.100 --> 50:51.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
start settling on that skeleton
and start growing over it.

50:51.467 --> 50:56.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, within a matter of a few
weeks or even a month during
a bleaching event, you will

50:58.400 --> 51:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have an idea of whether that
coral is dead and getting
overgrown by seaweed, or whether

51:01.633 --> 51:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's on its way to recovery.

51:04.000 --> 51:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The sustained
global bleaching event
is not giving corals
a chance to recover.

51:10.467 --> 51:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many coral reefs are further
stressed by other types of human
activity: runoff from sewage,

51:14.733 --> 51:16.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
agriculture, and overfishing.

51:16.767 --> 51:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But scientists say the current
bleaching is happening whether
those local factors are

51:21.633 --> 51:23.667 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
present or not.

51:23.667 --> 51:28.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is clear warming water is
the culprit, and reducing our
use of fossil fuels is the

51:29.267 --> 51:31.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
only solution.

51:31.833 --> 51:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scientists say the world
must adhere to obligations
to do just that made
by 195 nations in Paris

51:38.533 --> 51:40.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 2015.

51:40.633 --> 51:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
C. MARK EAKIN: This is really
the only thing that's going
to deal with this global coral

51:46.367 --> 51:48.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bleaching problem.

51:48.100 --> 51:50.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Even if we do, though,
we're going to lose a
lot of coral reefs.

51:50.867 --> 51:55.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But the Trump
administration is filled with
climate change skeptics pushing

51:57.800 --> 52:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to roll back Obama-era
regulations aimed at
reducing greenhouse gases.

52:02.333 --> 52:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, what if we do nothing
to slow climate change?

52:04.433 --> 52:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER SMITH: Corals reefs
as we know them will not exist
in the next 10, 20, 30 years.

52:11.333 --> 52:14.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We could single-handedly be
responsible for the extinction
of an entire ecosystem.

52:14.167 --> 52:19.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Coral reefs are
more than spectacular, vivid
examples of nature's beauty.

52:21.133 --> 52:25.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fish they harbor are also a
food source for a half-billion
people, and natural barriers

52:26.233 --> 52:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
against storms and floods.

52:27.933 --> 52:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, before too long, they
may only exist behind glass.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Clearly,
they are a global treasure.

52:43.067 --> 52:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's hope more attention
is paid to how to save them.

52:46.333 --> 52:48.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's the
