11:07.933 --> 11:08.800
SEVERAL REASONS.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.000
LET'S JUST TALK FIRST OFF HAVING

THERE'S ALREADY SOME PUSHBACK.

11:17.833 --> 11:20.667
TYPICALLY IN THE PAST SINCE POST

11:20.667 --> 11:21.567

11:25.600 --> 11:27.533
HAVING THEM IN NEW YORK BECAUS

11:27.533 --> 11:28.800
THE JAIL IS ACTUALLY CONNECTED

11:28.800 --> 11:31.233
TO THE COURTHOUSE BY A TUNNEL SO

11:31.233 --> 11:32.433
YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOVE THE

11:32.433 --> 11:36.233
SUSPECT EVERY TIME ON A -- IN

11:36.233 --> 11:37.200
CAR THAT HE HAS TO APPEAR IN

11:37.200 --> 11:37.533

11:37.533 --> 11:39.400
WE SAW THIS YESTERDAY WHEN THE

PROBABLY SEE EVERY DAY THAT THAT

FORTH HERE

12:03.333 --> 12:03.400
WEEKS.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.133
THIS IS NOT JUST A MURDER THAT

12:34.433 --> 12:35.133

13:23.200 --> 13:25.767

13:25.767 --> 13:26.767
SO COOPERATIVE DOESN'T

13:26.767 --> 13:28.533
NECESSARILY MEAN THAT HE GAVE UP

13:28.533 --> 13:29.900
ALL OF THIS STUFF ABOUT TH

13:32.267 --> 13:33.900

13:33.900 --> 13:35.633

13:59.033 --> 14:00.533
THAT'S SORT OF A PLACEHOLDER

19:54.367 --> 19:55.600
TO THE ALLEGED KILLING -

19:55.600 --> 19:58.933
>> TWO YEARS AGO IN LOUISIANA, A

19:58.933 --> 20:00.933
RAPPER NAMED TERRENCE HATCH WA

20:00.933 --> 20:02.333
TRIED FOR FIRST-DEGREE MURDER.

20:02.333 --> 20:04.200
PROSECUTORS ARGUED THAT A FE

20:04.200 --> 20:06.067
CRYPTIC WORDS OF ONE RAP SON

20:06.067 --> 20:07.900
WERE IN FACT A CONFESSION.

20:07.900 --> 20:09.833
HATCH WAS FOUND NOT GUILTY

20:09.833 --> 20:11.600
ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIA

20:11.600 --> 20:13.533
USES OF RAP LYRIC IN A TRIAL WAS

20:13.533 --> 20:15.400
THE CASE OF VANTE SKINNER.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.333
SKINNER WAS CONVICTED IN 2008 OF

20:17.333 --> 20:19.667
SHOOTING A FELLOW DRUG DEALE

20:19.667 --> 20:20.833
OUTSIDE HIS NEW JERSEY HOUSE

20:20.833 --> 20:23.300
DURING HIS TRIAL, PROSECUTOR

20:23.300 --> 20:25.800
READ 13 PAGE OF SKINNER'

20:25.800 --> 20:27.267
VIOLENT, GRAPHIC RAP LYRICS.

20:27.267 --> 20:29.300
THESER LYRICS THAT HAD BEEN --

20:29.300 --> 20:31.467
THESE WERE LYRICS THAT HAD BEE

20:31.467 --> 20:32.067
WRITTEN MONTHS TO YEARS BEFORE

20:32.067 --> 20:32.800
THE SHOOTING

20:32.800 --> 20:36.000
PROSECUTORS READ THEM TO SHO

20:36.000 --> 20:38.667
SKINNER'S ALLEGED PROPENSITY T

20:38.667 --> 20:38.833
VIOLENCE

20:38.833 --> 20:41.333
AN APPLE CAT COURT RULED THE

20:41.333 --> 20:43.833
EXTENSIVE READINGS UNFAIRL

20:43.833 --> 20:44.633
PREJUDICED THE JURY.

20:44.633 --> 20:45.667
STATE SUPREME COURT IS WEIGHIN

20:45.667 --> 20:47.600
WHETHER SKINNER DESERVES A NEW

20:47.600 --> 20:47.933
TRIAL.

20:47.933 --> 20:50.900
TO CRITICS LIKE ERIC NIELSEN

20:50.900 --> 20:51.933
PROSECUTORS RARELY IF EVER

20:51.933 --> 20:54.233
SHOULD USE RAP AS EVIDENCE I

20:54.233 --> 20:54.400
COURT.

20:54.400 --> 20:56.367
HE SAYS IT'S AN ART FORM THA

20:56.367 --> 20:57.800
INTENTIONALLY USES ELABORATE

20:57.800 --> 20:59.933
WORD PLAY AND EXAGGERATION

20:59.933 --> 21:02.567
AND WHILE IT MAY OFTEN CONTAIN

21:02.567 --> 21:04.433
GRAPHIC VIOLENCE, NIELSEN ARGUES

21:04.433 --> 21:05.967
THAT'S A REFLECTION OF THE

21:05.967 --> 21:06.800
COMMUNITIES WHERE MANY YOUNG

21:06.800 --> 21:07.867
BLACK MEN LIVE

21:07.867 --> 21:10.333
HE SAYS RAPPERS ARE CREATING

21:10.333 --> 21:11.767
CHARACTERS, NOT WRITING DIARIES.

21:11.767 --> 21:14.733
>> THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTAN

21:14.733 --> 21:16.167
DISTINCTION THAT CONSTANTLY GETS

21:16.167 --> 21:17.367
MISSED IS THAT THERE IS AN

21:17.367 --> 21:21.133
AUTHOR AND A NARRATOR.

21:21.133 --> 21:22.500
WE SEEM TO BE ABLE TO GRASP TH

21:22.500 --> 21:23.667
CONCEPT WITH EVERY OTHER ART

21:23.667 --> 21:25.867
FORM THAT USES THE FIRST-PERSO

21:25.867 --> 21:26.133
NARRATIVE.

21:26.133 --> 21:29.000
BUT RAPPERS WHO GO THE EXTRA

21:29.000 --> 21:30.833
MILE TO SIGNAL THAT THEY ARE

21:30.833 --> 21:32.033
INVENTING A NARRATOR WITH THEI

21:32.033 --> 21:35.800
USE OF A STAGE NAME, WE STIL

21:35.800 --> 21:37.033
REVERT BACK TO THIS IDEA THA

21:37.033 --> 21:40.833
THEY'RE THE SAME, THAT W

21:40.833 --> 21:41.633
CONFLATE THE TWO

21:41.633 --> 21:42.200
>> YOU DON'T BUY INTO TH

21:42.200 --> 21:43.500
ARGUMENT THAT THIS IS AL

21:43.500 --> 21:43.800
FICTION.

21:43.800 --> 21:45.433
YOU BELIEVE IF THEY ARE

21:45.433 --> 21:46.667
RAPPING ABOUT A VIOLENT,

21:46.667 --> 21:47.600
CRIME-RIDDEN LIFE, THAT THAT

21:47.600 --> 21:48.367
DOES TELL YOU ABOUT THE ARTIST

21:48.367 --> 21:48.700
THEMSELVES

21:48.700 --> 21:49.833
>> ABSOLUTELY.

21:49.833 --> 21:50.833
I WOULD SAY YOU CAN'T HAVE I

21:50.833 --> 21:51.700
BOTH WAYS.

21:51.700 --> 21:53.200
AND I'D SAY THAT I'M RAPPING

21:53.200 --> 21:54.467
ABOUT STUFF BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT

21:54.467 --> 21:56.267
I LIVE IN, AND THIS IS WHAT

21:56.267 --> 21:58.700
SEE EVERY DAY.

21:58.700 --> 22:00.167
AND THEN COME IN TO COURT AN

22:00.167 --> 22:01.600
SAY EVERYTHING THAT I SAID I

22:01.600 --> 22:06.833
THE RAP IS COMPLETELY UNTRUE

22:06.833 --> 22:09.767
>> SO IF THAT SONG IS A MADE-U

22:09.767 --> 22:10.867
STORY, WHY DO YOU WRITE A STOR

22:10.867 --> 22:11.433
LIKE THAT?

22:11.433 --> 22:13.300
WHY ARE YOU TELLING THE STORY?

22:13.300 --> 22:16.367
>> THAT'S MY LANE, I'M IN TH

22:16.367 --> 22:17.833
LANE FOR -- THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

22:17.833 --> 22:19.633
I GOT TO KEEP BUILDING MY BRAN

22:19.633 --> 22:20.833
UNTIL I GET TO BE WHERE I WANT

22:20.833 --> 22:21.100
TO BE.

22:21.100 --> 22:22.567
I FOUND SOMETHING THAT I'M

22:22.567 --> 22:24.433
TALENTED AT, AND FOUND A WAY T

22:24.433 --> 22:30.233
MAKE MONEY OFF OF.

22:30.233 --> 22:32.900
>> ANTWAN STEWARD SAYS LIKE IT

22:32.900 --> 22:33.567
OVER NOT RAP SELLS

22:33.567 --> 22:35.667
IN THE VIOLENT, GANG-RIDDE

22:35.667 --> 22:36.600
STREETS WHERE HE GREW UP, IT

22:36.600 --> 22:38.933
GAVE HIM PLENTY TO RAP ABOUT

22:38.933 --> 22:40.700
>> EVERYDAY LIFE WHERE I'M FROM,

22:40.700 --> 22:42.667
IT JUST GUESS ON

22:42.667 --> 22:43.800
LIKE YOU WALK DOWN THE STREET,

22:43.800 --> 22:45.433
YOU MIGHT SEE A NEEDLE THAT WA

22:45.433 --> 22:46.933
USED FOR DOPE LAYING ON TH

22:46.933 --> 22:47.367
GROUND

22:47.367 --> 22:49.133
KNOW WHAT I MEAN

22:49.133 --> 22:50.600
YOU GREW UP IN THAT ENVIRONMEN

22:50.600 --> 22:53.233
YOUR WHOLE LIFE, IT'S THAN HARD,

22:53.233 --> 22:54.000
IT COMES NATURALLY

22:54.000 --> 22:55.733
>> I THINK IT BECOMES EVEN

22:55.733 --> 22:59.567
EASIER TO SORT OF NEGATE RAP A

22:59.567 --> 23:03.200
ART WHEN THE RAP ITSELF IS

23:03.200 --> 23:06.667
PROJECTING STEREOTYPES O

23:06.667 --> 23:07.567
CRIMINALITY ABOUT PARTICULARLY

23:07.567 --> 23:08.767
YOUNG BLACK MEN IN THE UNITE

23:08.767 --> 23:09.167
STATES

23:09.167 --> 23:12.100
AND SO I THINK PROSECUTORS HAV

23:12.100 --> 23:14.933
A VERY POWERFUL TACTIC, AND ON

23:14.933 --> 23:15.467
OF THE THINGS MOST POWERFU

23:15.467 --> 23:18.567
ABOUT IT IS THAT IT ALLOWS THE

23:18.567 --> 23:19.533
TO PLAY UPON BUT UNFORTUNATELY

23:19.533 --> 23:22.233
ALSO PERPETUATE THOSE ENDURING

23:22.233 --> 23:22.467
STEREOTYPES.

23:22.467 --> 23:24.267
>> WHAT ABOUT THE ARGUMENT THA

23:24.267 --> 23:27.267
THE CONTENT OF SOME KINDS OF RAP

23:27.267 --> 23:29.167
MUSIC IS SO VIOLENT THAT IF YO

23:29.167 --> 23:30.900
NAUGHT IN FRONT OF A JURY, THA

23:30.900 --> 23:32.767
IF THE PROSECUTION SAYS THIS GUY

23:32.767 --> 23:33.967
RAPS LIKE THIS, AND WE THINK

23:33.967 --> 23:36.433
HE'S GUILTY OF X, THAT THE JUR

23:36.433 --> 23:37.833
WILL BELIEVE ANYTHING?

23:37.833 --> 23:38.867
>> I DON'T THINK THAT MATCHE

23:38.867 --> 23:40.000
REALITY OF WHAT HAPPENS IN A

23:40.000 --> 23:40.300
COURTROOM.

23:40.300 --> 23:43.767
WE MUST GET A UNANIMOUS JURY

23:43.767 --> 23:44.133
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.

23:44.133 --> 23:46.933
AND PLAYING A RAP IS NOT GOING

23:46.933 --> 23:47.300
TO CONVICT SOMEBODY.

23:47.300 --> 23:49.433
IF IT WAS, THEN YOU'D HAVE RAP

23:49.433 --> 23:51.367
BEING PLAYED EVERY DAY, AND WE

23:51.367 --> 23:52.633
WOULDN'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT

23:52.633 --> 23:54.900
PRODUCING OTHER EVIDENCE

23:54.900 --> 23:56.033
>> ANTWAN STEWARD'S DOUBLE

25:34.967 --> 25:35.500
AT THE EMERGENCY ROOM.

25:35.500 --> 25:37.233
>> SO WHY ARE HOSPITAL

25:37.233 --> 25:38.400
INTERESTED IN HAVING THIS KIND

25:38.400 --> 25:40.000
OF INFORMATION

25:40.000 --> 25:43.800
>> WELL, UNDER OBAMACARE THE

25:43.800 --> 25:45.133
HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO KEE

25:45.133 --> 25:46.067
PATIENTS HEALTHY BECAUSE THE LAW

25:46.067 --> 25:47.167
CHANGE THE WAY THEY ARE PAID

25:47.167 --> 25:49.100
UNDER THE LAW, HOSPITALS GET

25:49.100 --> 25:50.133
PENALIZED IF YOU COME BACK T

25:50.133 --> 25:51.433
THE EMERGENCY ROOM FOO

25:51.433 --> 25:51.600
FREQUENTLY

25:51.600 --> 25:53.933
AND IF A HOSPITAL ISN'T MEETIN

25:53.933 --> 25:55.000
CERTAIN PATIENT QUALITY AN

25:55.000 --> 25:56.800
HEALTH OUTCOMES.

25:56.800 --> 25:58.167
AND INSURERS ARE FOLLOWING THE

25:58.167 --> 25:59.167
SAME MOLD, TOO

25:59.167 --> 26:00.433
INSURERS NO LONGER WANT TO PAY

26:00.433 --> 26:02.600
FOR HOSPITALS WHO ARE JUST DOING

26:02.600 --> 26:03.500
MORE AND MORE TESTS AN

26:03.500 --> 26:04.567
PROCEDURES OVER AND OVER AGAIN

26:04.567 --> 26:06.167
THEY WANT TO BE PAYING FOR

26:06.167 --> 26:06.267
QUALITY.

26:06.267 --> 26:08.300
SO HOSPITALS ARE GOING TO BE

26:08.300 --> 26:09.533
HELD ACCOUNTABLE IF PATIENTS ARE

26:09.533 --> 26:11.133
TOO SICK, IF PATIENTS ARE COMING

26:11.133 --> 26:12.133
BACK TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM TOO

26:12.133 --> 26:12.633
FREQUENTLY

26:12.633 --> 26:16.600
>> WHAT ABOUT ALL OF THI

26:16.600 --> 26:17.833
INFORMATION, AS A PATIENT, AM

26:17.833 --> 26:18.933
OPTING IN OR OUT OF IT

26:18.933 --> 26:19.933
IF THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG, CA

26:19.933 --> 26:20.800
I CORRECT THE ASSUMPTION THA

26:20.800 --> 26:21.967
THE HOSPITAL IS GOING BY

26:21.967 --> 26:23.133
>> RIGHT NOW HOSPITALS ARE A

26:23.133 --> 26:24.800
THE VERY EARLY STAGE OF USIN

26:24.800 --> 26:26.133
THIS DATA.

26:26.133 --> 26:27.167
BUT THERE'S A VERY LARGE

26:27.167 --> 26:28.967
HOSPITAL CHAIN CALLED CAROLINA'S

26:28.967 --> 26:30.700
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM

26:30.700 --> 26:32.367
THEY OWN OVER 900 HOSPITALS,

26:32.367 --> 26:33.933
NURSING HOMES, PHYSICIANS'

26:33.933 --> 26:35.900
OFFICES THROUGHOUT NORTH AND

26:35.900 --> 26:36.267
SOUTH CAROLINA

26:36.267 --> 26:37.300
SO THEY'RE KIND OF ON TH

26:37.300 --> 26:38.000
FOREFRONT OF USING THIS.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.433
WHAT THEY HOPE TO EVENTUALLY D

26:39.433 --> 26:41.633
IS TO ALLOW PATIENTS TO OPT OUT.

26:41.633 --> 26:43.333
BUT ONLY TO OPT OUT OF SOME OF

26:43.333 --> 26:44.067
IT

26:44.067 --> 26:45.833
IF YOU'RE NOT FILLING YOUR

26:45.833 --> 26:46.333
PRESCRIPTIONS, THE HOSPITA

26:46.333 --> 26:47.767
FEELS THEY WANT TO KNOW, AND

26:47.767 --> 26:48.833
THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO KNO

26:48.833 --> 26:49.067
THAT

26:49.067 --> 26:50.200
IF YOU DON'T WANT THE HOSPITAL

26:50.200 --> 26:52.233
KNOWING WHAT YOU'RE BUYING A

26:52.233 --> 26:54.133
CVS OR AT THE GROCERY STORE, YOU

26:54.133 --> 26:55.367
CAN HAVE AN OPTION TO OPT OUT OF
