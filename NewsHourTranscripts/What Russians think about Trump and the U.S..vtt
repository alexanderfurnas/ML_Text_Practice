JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we
continue our series
Inside Putin's Russia.

00:04.100 --> 00:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There may be no more
consequential relationship
for the United States
than with Russia.

00:11.133 --> 00:14.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Both nations possess
world-ending capacity,
and may be at the most
critical moment since

00:15.233 --> 00:17.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the end of the Cold War.

00:17.366 --> 00:21.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tonight, we explore the
bilateral relationship,
the tension and how
Russians see the United

00:22.466 --> 00:24.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

00:24.466 --> 00:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again in partnership with
the Pulitzer Center on Crisis
Reporting, special correspondent

00:28.366 --> 00:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nick Schifrin and producer
Zach Fannin start their report
in Moscow on Victory Day.

00:35.300 --> 00:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: On Russia's most
patriotic holiday, Russians
of all ages remember what

00:40.966 --> 00:43.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they consider their
finest moment.

00:43.066 --> 00:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They mark the anniversary
of victory in World War
II by honoring the dead.

00:49.400 --> 00:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kiriginov Naimovich's
grandfather fought the Nazis.

00:51.333 --> 00:54.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He says Russia and the
U.S. were once allies,
and should be again.

00:54.566 --> 00:58.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KIRIGINOV NAIMOVICH, Russia
(through translator): We really
want to love you and be friends

00:58.400 --> 00:59.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with you.

00:59.933 --> 01:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are waiting for you to
finally meet us halfway.

01:01.966 --> 01:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: For Russians,
it's the U.S. who's
unwilling to come halfway.

01:08.533 --> 01:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many here believe President
Trump wants to improve things,
but is being blocked by what

01:10.300 --> 01:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dimitry Schyukin calls the
American establishment.

01:13.233 --> 01:18.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIMITRY SCHYUKIN, Russia
(through translator):
Trump wants to do
something, but he's forced

01:19.333 --> 01:21.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to follow the general
political line.

01:21.333 --> 01:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEXANDER DUGIN, TV Host: Donald
Trump is the most right-wing
candidate of the Republican

01:25.233 --> 01:27.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Party.

01:27.766 --> 01:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Perhaps
nobody expressed more hope
in Trump than Alexander
Dugin, a right-wing

01:29.700 --> 01:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TV firebrand and philosopher
who's helped inspire
the Kremlin's ideology.

01:33.266 --> 01:36.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALEXANDER DUGIN: Really,
we supported Trumpism.

01:36.533 --> 01:38.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We supported agenda.

01:38.466 --> 01:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Dugin says
the Kremlin saw Trump as a
kindred spirit who vowed not to

01:42.200 --> 01:44.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
meddle internationally.

01:44.400 --> 01:48.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALEXANDER DUGIN: We
supported this choice
of anti-establishment
conservative American

01:49.233 --> 01:51.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
revolution.

01:51.366 --> 01:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: That changed
when President Trump ordered a
missile strike on Russia ally

01:54.266 --> 01:58.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Syria, and said he
felt must respond to a
chemical weapons attack.

01:58.033 --> 02:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of
the United States: As long as
America stands for justice, then

02:04.200 --> 02:06.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
peace and harmony will
in the end prevail.

02:06.866 --> 02:11.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALEXANDER DUGIN: We trusted not
in Trump as pro-Russian figure.

02:11.400 --> 02:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We trusted in Trump realist.

02:14.333 --> 02:16.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we are disappointed.

02:16.133 --> 02:18.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The
disappointment and
tensions have been growing.

02:18.666 --> 02:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last month, over the Baltic
Sea, a Russian jet flew within
five feet of a U.S. Air Force

02:22.666 --> 02:24.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
reconnaissance plane.

02:24.733 --> 02:28.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That same week, a NATO
jet shadowed the Russian
defense minister's
plane and a Russian jet

02:28.300 --> 02:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
came up and rocked its wings
to demonstrate it was armed.

02:35.733 --> 02:36.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, the Obama
administration accused
Russia of hacking the
election, and then seized

02:36.966 --> 02:40.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russian properties and
increased sanctions.

02:40.266 --> 02:42.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
All of that has led to
Russian frustration.

02:42.900 --> 02:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maria Zakharova is the
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman.

02:44.900 --> 02:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIA ZAKHAROVA, Russian Foreign
Ministry Spokeswoman: We were
trying to establish normal

02:48.466 --> 02:49.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
relationship, normal.

02:49.733 --> 02:52.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do you know this word,
normal relationship?

02:52.766 --> 02:54.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is wrong with this?

02:54.800 --> 02:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: President Putin
and I have been discussing
various things, and I think it's

02:59.166 --> 03:01.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going very well.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Last
week, the U.S. took steps
toward normalization.

03:03.233 --> 03:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Presidents Trump and Putin
announced a deal on Syria.

03:06.400 --> 03:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both presidents called their
meeting the first step to
warming the relationship.

03:09.633 --> 03:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through translator):
If we develop our relations in

03:13.766 --> 03:18.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the same way, there is every
reason to believe that we would
be able to at least partially

03:20.133 --> 03:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
restore the level of
interaction that we need.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The
president echoed that hope.

03:23.700 --> 03:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Sunday, he tweeted he
wouldn't dwell on 2016 hacking,
and wrote, "Now was the time

03:27.933 --> 03:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to move forward in working
constructively with Russia."

03:32.300 --> 03:36.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is not the language other
Trump administration officials
use about Russia on Syria.

03:36.366 --> 03:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NIKKI HALEY, U.S. Ambassador
to the United Nations: How
many more children have to die

03:40.533 --> 03:41.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
before Russia cares?

03:41.533 --> 03:43.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: On Ukraine.

03:43.600 --> 03:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary
of State: We do call on Russia
to exercise influence over

03:47.300 --> 03:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the separatists in the
region, whom they do hold
complete control over.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And
on Putin personally.

03:54.066 --> 03:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE POMPEO, CIA Director:
This is a man for whom veracity
doesn't translate into English.

03:57.533 --> 04:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The one senior
administration official who's
declined to echo that criticism

04:01.633 --> 04:04.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is Donald Trump, as
candidate and president.

04:04.433 --> 04:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Wouldn't it
be a great thing if we could
actually get along with Russia?

04:07.100 --> 04:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Wouldn't that be a good thing?

04:08.133 --> 04:09.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

04:09.133 --> 04:10.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I respect Putin.

04:10.800 --> 04:13.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He is a strong leader,
I can tell you that,
unlike what we have.

04:13.066 --> 04:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have a pathetic leader.

04:14.100 --> 04:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION: Putin is a killer.

04:15.333 --> 04:17.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: There
are a lot of killers.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have a lot of killers.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What, you think our
country is so innocent?

04:21.533 --> 04:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And last
week in Warsaw, President
Trump once again questioned
the U.S. intelligence

04:27.566 --> 04:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
community's unanimous
assessment that Russia
hacked the 2016 election.

04:29.133 --> 04:31.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: I
think it was Russia.

04:31.533 --> 04:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think it was probably
other people and/or
countries, and I see
nothing wrong with that

04:37.533 --> 04:39.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
statement.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Nobody really knows.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER (D), Virginia:
At the very least, giving the
president all the benefit of the

04:43.233 --> 04:45.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
doubt, this is very
bizarre behavior.

04:45.766 --> 04:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Democratic
Senator Mark Warner is
the vice chairman of
the Senate Intelligence

04:48.100 --> 04:49.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Committee.

04:49.100 --> 04:51.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:51.100 --> 04:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER: We are seeking
to determine if there is an
actual fire, but there's clearly

04:54.333 --> 04:56.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a lot of smoke.

04:56.366 --> 04:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Warner is helping
lead the Senate's investigation
into Russia's interference

04:58.766 --> 05:03.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the 2016 election and
whether President Trump or his
campaign colluded with Russia's

05:03.233 --> 05:05.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
attempts to sway the election.

05:05.066 --> 05:06.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We first interviewed
him three weeks ago.

05:06.366 --> 05:08.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:08.466 --> 05:12.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER: It is very strange
that any presidential candidate,
and in particular a Republican

05:13.900 --> 05:18.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
presidential candidate,
would parrot so much
of the Russian line.

05:18.633 --> 05:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Republican
Senator James Lankford is also
on the Intelligence Committee.

05:22.433 --> 05:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In some ways, has President
Trump aligned himself with the
ideals expressed by Russia?

05:27.233 --> 05:29.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:29.733 --> 05:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD (R),
Oklahoma: Yes, he's
pushing out some messages
that are consistent with

05:30.533 --> 05:32.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Kremlin policies.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would tell you, at every
opportunity that I have, I
try to articulate very clearly

05:34.600 --> 05:36.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there's no question that the
Russians were trying to hack
into our elections, and there's

05:36.933 --> 05:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no question that we should
have a strong NATO and that the
United States should be a part

05:40.033 --> 05:42.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of that NATO alliance.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Do you
believe that he's not
echoing that because the
Russians have compromising

05:44.866 --> 05:45.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
material on him?

05:45.866 --> 05:46.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:46.866 --> 05:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK WARNER: I don't know.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I hope not.

05:50.700 --> 05:55.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the goal of this
investigation is to not
only reconfirm Russian
intervention and explain

05:58.400 --> 06:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that to the American public,
but to also see if there were
any contacts between the Trump

06:02.566 --> 06:04.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
campaign and the Russians.

06:04.566 --> 06:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And just this
week, we learned that, last
June, Donald Trump Jr. met with

06:07.833 --> 06:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya
and lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin,
both believed to have ties

06:13.700 --> 06:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the Russian government.

06:14.866 --> 06:16.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I spoke to Senator
Warner again last night.

06:16.233 --> 06:18.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:18.266 --> 06:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER: This indication
that they were willing to accept
this information from Russians

06:21.200 --> 06:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and it was part of an overall
Russian government effort to
help Trump and to hurt Clinton,

06:28.166 --> 06:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think this is the first
time the American public has
seen that in black and white.

06:31.033 --> 06:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Much of this
town has been worried about
Trump and Russia since he became

06:34.933 --> 06:36.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

06:36.966 --> 06:39.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Current administration officials
tell "NewsHour" the White House
drafted an executive order

06:39.300 --> 06:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that would have lifted sanctions
imposed on Russia over Ukraine.

06:42.800 --> 06:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senior administration officials
and the intelligence community
successfully lobbied against it.

06:47.066 --> 06:50.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, this spring,
senators passed a bill
that would restrict the
president's ability to

06:50.766 --> 06:53.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lift those sanctions.

06:53.333 --> 06:56.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bill's not yet a law,
but it was designed to
be a nearly unanimous
message to the president

06:56.500 --> 06:57.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and to Putin.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: We
believe strongly that
what Russia continues to
do to be able to threaten

07:01.966 --> 07:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ukraine, threaten its neighbors,
threaten NATO, to continue
to pry into not only our

07:05.500 --> 07:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
elections, but other
elections, is destabilizing,
and it demands a response.

07:09.133 --> 07:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have yet to have a
consequence to what they
did in the election time.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And they should.

07:14.366 --> 07:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In some ways, the
president has fallen in line.

07:16.466 --> 07:20.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On Sunday, he tweeted he
wouldn't lift sanctions
on Russia over Ukraine
until Ukrainian and

07:20.866 --> 07:22.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Syrian problems are solved.

07:22.866 --> 07:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And last week, he also
endorsed Article 5,
NATO's collective defense.

07:26.066 --> 07:31.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: The United States
has demonstrated not merely with
words, but with its actions,

07:32.966 --> 07:37.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we stand firmly
behind Article 5, the
mutual defense commitment.

07:39.466 --> 07:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: That convinces
many in Moscow that the U.S.
establishment is making sure

07:44.400 --> 07:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the U.S. remains anti-Russian.

07:46.666 --> 07:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dmitri Trenin is a former Soviet
army colonel who directs the
Carnegie Center in Moscow.

07:50.200 --> 07:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DMITRI TRENIN, Former Soviet
Army Colonel: The United States
has been, remains, and will

07:53.833 --> 07:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be the power that defines common
Western, i.e., U.S.-driven,
foreign, defense and security

08:02.533 --> 08:04.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
policy.

08:04.533 --> 08:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And given that,
Trenin says the U.S. remains
Russia's main adversary.

08:06.966 --> 08:09.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And Russia is simply
targeting the U.S. with
whatever tool it can.

08:09.933 --> 08:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DMITRI TRENIN: I'm sure that
the Russians have been looking
at things, have been hacking

08:14.833 --> 08:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things, have been using the
material that they have hacked.

08:18.533 --> 08:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why are you surprised
that you are being hacked?

08:23.300 --> 08:25.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a method of espionage.

08:25.366 --> 08:27.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is what you do.

08:27.333 --> 08:29.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
If you can do it, do it.

08:29.300 --> 08:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you can protect against
that, protect against
it, but don't whine.

08:32.766 --> 08:35.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But it
goes one step further.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Many in Russia look at
Washington's turbulence
and see a U.S. they'd
considered strong and

08:38.766 --> 08:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
unified suddenly weakened.

08:40.966 --> 08:43.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they're exploiting that
weakness in the U.S. foundation.

08:43.066 --> 08:45.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALEXANDER DUGIN: It
is not so coherent.

08:45.533 --> 08:48.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is not so stable.

08:48.100 --> 08:50.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it is vulnerable,
I would say.

08:50.033 --> 08:51.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we seen that.

08:51.933 --> 08:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have seen what we needed
to see, vulnerability
of American society.

08:57.933 --> 09:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Nick
now joins me in our studio.

09:00.333 --> 09:02.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, Nick, that sounds
pretty foreboding.

09:02.433 --> 09:05.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: I think it should
sound foreboding, because it is.

09:05.700 --> 09:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think usual Russians really do
see a vulnerability in the U.S.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They see a lack of unity.

09:12.066 --> 09:17.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when talking frankly to
people who actually know what
they're talking about in Russia,

09:18.166 --> 09:20.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's not so much denial
that they did it.

09:20.200 --> 09:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is that we did it in the
United States last year,
and we will keep doing it.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, from talking
to them, is there any doubt
that they are going to keep

09:28.166 --> 09:30.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on doing it?

09:30.200 --> 09:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: No, I don't think
so, mostly because they don't
feel like they paid a price.

09:32.800 --> 09:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Russian government doesn't
feel like the United States
government really penalized

09:37.533 --> 09:39.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
them for what
happened last year.

09:39.533 --> 09:44.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, frankly, a lot of
American officials here in
Washington agree with that.

09:44.466 --> 09:48.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They fault the Obama
administration and the
Trump administration
for simply not following

09:48.833 --> 09:53.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through on some of the things
that they feel like Russia
should have paid for what they

09:53.166 --> 09:54.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
did last year.

09:54.666 --> 09:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, you and I
talked a little bit about this.

09:57.500 --> 09:58.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You talked to so many experts.

09:58.966 --> 10:00.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is there hope?

10:00.700 --> 10:03.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Is there a glimmer of
a belief anywhere that
this can be repaired?

10:03.900 --> 10:08.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: There
are analysts in Moscow
who think the only thing
we can hope is that

10:09.900 --> 10:11.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we avoid war.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, there are some people
who are that dire right now.

10:13.433 --> 10:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the people who are
trying to make it better and
hope it can make it better are

10:18.033 --> 10:22.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doing what basically President
Trump and Putin did earlier in
that story we showed, trying

10:22.866 --> 10:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to find a lowest common
denominator, if you will, trying
to find a corner of Syria, for

10:29.900 --> 10:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
example, where they can work
together and use that very
small deal to expand perhaps

10:35.366 --> 10:38.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into greater Syria, to
expand into a kind of
warming of the relationship.

10:38.300 --> 10:43.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And certainly the people
who understand that
this relationship has
to get better, that's

10:44.200 --> 10:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what they're trying to do.

10:45.733 --> 10:47.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, looking for
places to make that happen.

10:47.166 --> 10:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Absolutely.

10:48.466 --> 10:49.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nick
Schifrin, thank you.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is a remarkable series.

10:51.300 --> 10:52.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

10:52.300 --> 10:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Thanks very much.

10:54.366 --> 10:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
