PARTICULARLY THE NUMBER OF GAS

POINT NEXT YEAR, AT ISSIS IS, WE

10:03.433 --> 10:06.867
HAVE ASSESSED THAT BY MID 2014

THEY WOULD REACH APPEA

10:07.933 --> 10:09.300
CAPABILITY, IF NOT STOPPED, THEY

10:09.300 --> 10:11.967
COULD BREAK OUT AND MAKE ENOUG

10:11.967 --> 10:13.333
WEAPON-GRADE URANIUM FOR A BOM

TONIGHT WE EXAMINE A

EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM IN OREGON

DIESEL ENGINES IN THE WORKS.

11:30.100 --> 11:32.667
THEY HAVE BEEN MORE ENTHUSIASTIC

ABOUT GREEN CARS THAN ANYWHERE

EVERY CAR WILL BE MORE FUE

11:42.033 --> 11:44.500
EFFICIENT, THANKS TO A DEAL THAT

11:44.500 --> 11:47.600
WAS STRUCK WITH BY THE PRESIDENT

11:57.100 --> 12:03.133
>> THE MILEAGE WILL INCREASE

12:03.133 --> 12:07.033
2/3, TO NEARLY 55 MPG, MEANING

12:07.033 --> 12:09.000
THAT AMERICANS WILL BE CUTTING

12:09.000 --> 12:10.467
BACK ON PURCHASES AT THE PUMP.

12:10.467 --> 12:13.767
THAT IS WHERE THE BAD NEWS

12:13.767 --> 12:14.133
STARTS

12:14.133 --> 12:18.200
BY DEFINITION, MORE EFFICIEN

12:18.200 --> 12:20.567
CARS USE LESS GAS AND THAT MEANS

12:20.567 --> 12:22.433
LESS GAS TAXES FOR STATE AND

12:22.433 --> 12:23.467
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

12:23.467 --> 12:26.867
THOSE GAS TAXES.

12:26.867 --> 12:31.833
A FEDERAL LEVY OF $.18 A GALLON.

12:31.833 --> 12:33.367

HIGHWAYS AND BRIDGES ACROSS TH

12:34.600 --> 12:34.833
COUNTRY.

12:34.833 --> 12:37.133
AND THAT IS ALREADY A HUGE

12:37.133 --> 12:37.367
PROBLEM.

12:37.367 --> 12:39.733
>> WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THA

12:39.733 --> 12:40.700
TERRIFYING BRIDGE COLLAPSE

12:58.533 --> 12:59.767
A DOWNWARD SPIRAL.

12:59.767 --> 13:01.333
WHAT IT MEAN IS THE FEDERA

13:01.333 --> 13:02.900
GOVERNMENT IS NOT GOING TO B

13:02.900 --> 13:04.733
ABLE TO HELP STATES AND LOCALITY

13:04.733 --> 13:06.433
MAINTAIN WHAT THEY HAVE GOT.

13:06.433 --> 13:09.600
IT MEANS THAT PEOPLE WILL PA

13:09.600 --> 13:13.167
WITH LESS SAFE DRIVING

13:13.167 --> 13:13.300
CONDITIONS

13:13.300 --> 13:15.433

13:15.433 --> 13:16.933
REVENUE TO MAINTAIN THE ROADS?

13:16.933 --> 13:17.533
>> NO.

13:17.533 --> 13:18.867
JUST PLAIN NO.

13:18.867 --> 13:20.767
>> VICKI BURGER IS A REPUBLICA

13:20.767 --> 13:22.767
MEMBER OF THE OREGON HOUSE

13:22.767 --> 13:25.033
SHE SAID THAT AS THE STATE

13:25.033 --> 13:26.100
RESIDENTS BUY MORE EFFICIENT

13:26.100 --> 13:28.033
CARS AND LESS GAS, THE BUDGE

13:28.033 --> 13:29.633
CRUNCH IS ONLY GOING GET WORSE

13:29.633 --> 13:32.433
BUT SHE THINKS THERE MAY BE

13:32.433 --> 13:32.933
SOLUTION

13:32.933 --> 13:35.200
INSTEAD OF HAVING OREGON

13:35.200 --> 13:40.900
MOTORISTS PAY A $.30 TAX O

13:40.900 --> 13:42.567
EVERY GALLON, HAVE THEM PAY

13:42.567 --> 13:45.167
FEE, A PENNY OR TWO ON EVERY

13:45.167 --> 13:46.233
MILE THEY DRIVE.

13:46.233 --> 13:48.167
IT'S CALLED A VMT FEE.

13:48.167 --> 13:51.033
OREGON WAS THE FIRST STATE I

13:51.033 --> 13:53.967
THE UNION TO IMPOSE A GAS TAX

13:53.967 --> 13:56.933
CENTURY AGO AND IT SET UP AN

13:56.933 --> 13:58.800
EXPERIMENT TO SEE IF IT CAN LEAD

13:58.800 --> 13:59.867
THE NATION AGAIN

13:59.867 --> 14:02.167
>> 300 VOLUNTEERS LET THE STAT

14:02.167 --> 14:04.133
HOOK UP TRANSMITTERS AND

14:04.133 --> 14:05.733
COMPUTERS TO THEIR CAR, SO THE

14:05.733 --> 14:07.533
MILEAGE IN OREGON COULD BE

14:07.533 --> 14:09.233
TRACKED WITH A GPS

14:09.233 --> 14:11.667
>> THE TECHNOLOGY WORKED JUS

14:11.667 --> 14:18.033
FINE, BUT CIVIL LIBERTY AN

14:18.033 --> 14:21.967
PRIVACY ADVOCATES FELT IT WOUL

14:21.967 --> 14:24.233
GIVE BIG BROTHER AN OPPORTUNIT

14:24.233 --> 14:26.200
TO SNOOP ON PRIVATE CITIZENS

14:26.200 --> 14:27.600
SO IT FADED OUT OF VIEW.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.533
UNTIL THE OREGON DEPARTMENT OF

14:29.533 --> 14:31.067
TRANSPORTATION RAN A NEW

14:31.067 --> 14:32.933
EXPERIMENT LATE LAST YEAR.

14:32.933 --> 14:36.233
THIS TIME, PARTICIPANTS HAD

14:36.233 --> 14:38.500
RANGE OF CHOICES

14:38.500 --> 14:41.367
THEY COULD LET SMARTPHONES TRACK

14:41.367 --> 14:43.867
THEIR MOVEMENTS OR HAVE GPS THAT

14:43.867 --> 14:46.733
SENT DATA TO AFFIRM INSTEAD OF

14:46.733 --> 14:49.933
THE GOVERNMENT OR HAD A DEVICE

14:49.933 --> 14:51.733
THAT RECORDED HOW MANY MILES

14:51.733 --> 14:53.167
THEY DROVE, NOT WHERE THEY

14:53.167 --> 14:53.267
DROVE.

14:53.267 --> 14:56.767
THAT IS WHAT VICKI BURGE

14:56.767 --> 14:57.867
DECIDED TO HAVE.

14:57.867 --> 15:00.133
>> FROM A TAX POLICY POINT O

15:00.133 --> 15:01.200
VIEW, THIS WAS REALL

15:01.200 --> 15:02.200
INTERESTING TO ME, BECAUSE WHE

15:02.200 --> 15:03.967
I GO TO THE PUMP, I'M FILLING MY

15:03.967 --> 15:06.933
CAR WITH GAS, I'M NOT THINKING

15:06.933 --> 15:09.500
OF THE TAXES I'M PAYING, I'M

15:09.500 --> 15:10.167
PAYING FEDERAL AND STATE

15:10.167 --> 15:12.267
WHEN YOU GET A BILL IN THE MAIL,

15:12.267 --> 15:14.000
YOU THINK OF THE TAXES YOU PAY

15:14.000 --> 15:15.967
AND THAT SORT OF AWAKENS THI

15:15.967 --> 15:18.700
SENSE OF OH, I'M PAYING A TA

15:18.700 --> 15:20.533
HERE FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF USIN

15:20.533 --> 15:21.800
THE ROADS.

15:21.800 --> 15:22.433
WHICH, I DON'T THINK PEOPL

15:22.433 --> 15:23.733
THINK ABOUT WHEN THEY JUST FIL

15:23.733 --> 15:27.867
THEIR TANK

15:27.867 --> 15:29.000
>> BUT SKEPTICS THINK THAT

15:29.000 --> 15:30.500
ADMINISTERING A PROGRAM LIKE

15:30.500 --> 15:34.500
THAT COULD BE A MESS AND TAXIN

15:34.500 --> 15:36.700
FUEL EFFICIENT CARS SENDS AN

15:36.700 --> 15:37.767
ANTI-GREEN MESSAGE

15:37.767 --> 15:39.833
TAXING HYBRIDS MORE THAN

15:39.833 --> 15:40.100
HUMMERS.

15:40.100 --> 15:43.833

16:03.867 --> 16:06.300
REDUCING THAT INCENTIVE.

16:06.300 --> 16:07.900
>> THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND IS

16:07.900 --> 16:11.533
NEARLY BROKE AND THE AMOUN

16:11.533 --> 16:17.167
GATHERED FROM THE TAXES IS GOING

16:17.167 --> 16:17.433
DOWN

16:17.433 --> 16:19.467
WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE?

16:19.467 --> 16:21.300
>> FIRST THING I WOULD DO IS

16:21.300 --> 16:22.933
RAISE THE GAS TAX AND INDEX IT

16:22.933 --> 16:24.233
TO INFLATION OVER TIME

16:24.233 --> 16:26.067
>> IN OTHER WORDS, THE GAS TAX

16:26.067 --> 16:27.100
WOULD AUTOMATICALLY RISE AT TH

16:27.100 --> 16:29.867
RATE OF INFLATION.

16:29.867 --> 16:31.567
SUPPORTERS OF MILEAGE FEES ARGUE

16:31.567 --> 16:34.333
THAT LEGISLATORS ELECTRIC TH

16:36.233 --> 16:37.600
TAXES SO THEY SAY STATE AN

16:37.600 --> 16:38.700
FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS NEED ANOTHER

16:38.700 --> 16:40.467
PLAN TO PAY FOR CRITICAL REPAIRS

16:40.467 --> 16:42.600
TO ROADS AND BRIDGES

16:42.600 --> 16:48.100
LAST MONTH, OREGON PASSED A LA

16:48.100 --> 16:50.867
EXPANDING THE MILEAGE FEE IN

2015, THIS TIME TO 5,000

16:52.900 --> 16:54.767

REPUBLICAN CO-SPONSOR THAT COULD

17:00.767 --> 17:02.067
TEST THE FEES NATIONALLY

17:02.067 --> 17:04.600
I WANT TO TAKE THAT OREGON

EXPERIENCE AND MOVE IT TO TH

17:06.733 --> 17:07.567
NATIONAL LEVEL

20:37.633 --> 20:40.500
TALKED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT

RECEIVE FOOD STAMPS ARE IN TOUGH

20:46.633 --> 20:46.867
SITUATIONS

20:46.867 --> 20:51.200
SOME OF THEM ARE GENERATIONA

20:51.200 --> 20:51.433
POVERTY.

20:51.433 --> 20:53.367
THEY RECEIVED FOOD STAMPS WHEN

20:53.367 --> 20:55.533
THEY WERE CHILDREN AND THEY HAVE

20:55.533 --> 20:57.533
THEM NOW AND THERE ARE OTHER

SITUATION.

21:01.367 --> 21:03.433
THERE'S GOING TO BE FRAUD AN

21:03.433 --> 21:04.933
ABUSE AND SELECT EXAMPLES THAT

21:04.933 --> 21:05.933
MAKE PEOPLE SCRATCH THEIR HEAD

21:05.933 --> 21:08.200
AND WONDER WHY, THERE'S A LOT OF

21:08.200 --> 21:09.200
PEOPLE, FOR EXAMPLE, FOR THE

21:09.200 --> 21:11.033
REALLY POOR, IT'S A TYPE O

21:11.033 --> 21:11.300
CURRENCY

21:11.300 --> 21:14.833

21:16.133 --> 21:19.300
BUY THE STORE, WITH THEIR FOOD

21:19.300 --> 21:19.667

21:19.667 --> 21:23.133
ELSE IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH.

21:23.133 --> 21:24.467
IT'S HARD TO POLICE.

21:24.467 --> 21:26.267
THAT DOES HAPPEN

21:26.267 --> 21:27.933
>> THE GOVERNMENT SAID THERE'S A

21:27.933 --> 21:30.767
1% FRAUD RATE IN THE FOOD STAM

21:30.767 --> 21:32.133
PROGRAM, BUT EVEN THAT IS $750

21:32.133 --> 21:33.500
MILLION A YEAR

21:33.500 --> 21:35.600
HOW SIGNIFICANT A PROBLEM IS

21:35.600 --> 21:35.767
FRAUD?

21:35.767 --> 21:37.667
>> IT'S A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM.

21:37.667 --> 21:40.567
AND QUITE FRANKLY, 1%, IT'

21:40.567 --> 21:43.667
TOUGH TO TELL HOW MUCH EXISTS.

21:43.667 --> 21:49.767
IT HAPPENS ONE, THE RECIPIENTS

21:49.767 --> 21:51.400
COULD BE ABUSING AND BIG AND

21:51.400 --> 21:54.267
SMALL BUSINESSES COULD B

21:54.267 --> 21:54.567
ABUSING THE PROGRAM AS WELL.

21:54.567 --> 21:58.800
THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTUR

21:58.800 --> 22:00.633
THAT RUNS THE PROGRAM IS TRYIN

22:00.633 --> 22:02.867
TO STAY ON TOP OF THIS BUT THE

22:02.867 --> 22:05.000
RESOURCES AND DEPARTMENT IS SO

22:05.000 --> 22:06.367
LARGE, THAT THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO
