JUDY WOODRUFF: We
close tonight with two
affectionate looks at Africa.

00:04.233 --> 00:09.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
First, a journalist's
love of the continent,
family and his craft.

00:11.233 --> 00:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown begins with
our latest addition to
the "NewsHour" Bookshelf.

00:13.733 --> 00:16.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: As a
19-year-old college
student, Jeffrey Gettleman
traveled to East Africa

00:16.666 --> 00:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and fell in love with a place.

00:18.566 --> 00:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He also fell in love that
year with a woman back home.

00:21.500 --> 00:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their time together and apart,
and his life and work covering
a continent as a Pulitzer

00:25.933 --> 00:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Prize-winning correspondent for
The New York Times, make up the
story told in "Love, Africa:

00:32.133 --> 00:34.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A Memoir of Romance,
War, and Survival."

00:34.366 --> 00:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Gettleman joins me now.

00:35.900 --> 00:37.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome to you.

00:37.966 --> 00:38.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN,
Author, "Love, Africa: A
Memoir of Romance, War,
and Survival": Thank

00:38.533 --> 00:40.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

00:40.666 --> 00:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This is a place,
a region that you have looked
at for a long time in a certain

00:41.633 --> 00:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
voice, right, as journalist.

00:43.700 --> 00:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But now you're presenting
a different voice.

00:47.066 --> 00:49.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What is this?

00:49.166 --> 00:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: Well, I feel
very conflicted about my work
sometimes in Africa, because,

00:52.200 --> 00:54.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as journalists, we
focus on conflict.

00:54.933 --> 00:56.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We focus on argument
and dispute.

00:56.633 --> 00:59.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: This is
the way we hear about
Africa most of the time.

00:59.933 --> 01:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: And this
is true for all journalists.

01:02.133 --> 01:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But my job as a journalist
in East Africa, I'm often
steeped in these conflicts.

01:08.566 --> 01:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that wasn't why I came to
East Africa in the first place.

01:11.133 --> 01:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I came on a safari as
a student and was blown
away by the warmth, by
the sense of connectedness

01:17.500 --> 01:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
between people, like, just
a different way of life.

01:21.400 --> 01:24.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so this book, to me,
is a bit of an escape.

01:24.333 --> 01:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, often, we get
frustrated with what's
happening in today's world.

01:30.766 --> 01:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We feel sort of the woes
of the world on our back.

01:32.800 --> 01:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I wanted to write a book
that celebrated something
that meant a lot to me.

01:36.300 --> 01:39.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: You were
drawn to this place.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It wasn't real obvious why.

01:41.500 --> 01:45.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: I think,
thinking more deeply about
what it was that really moved

01:45.666 --> 01:50.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me, it was experiencing a
part of the world that's very
different from how I grew up in

01:50.266 --> 01:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
suburban Chicago, how most
of us grew up, a lot poorer,
a lot less developed.

01:57.266 --> 02:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there was this spirit,
this sense of warmth and
openness among people.

02:03.066 --> 02:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even though I had so much more
than the people I was around,
I felt very little resentment.

02:07.433 --> 02:09.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I felt very little bitterness.

02:09.466 --> 02:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I felt welcome in a part of
the world that couldn't be
any more different from what I

02:13.566 --> 02:15.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
experienced.

02:15.666 --> 02:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There is a
kind of fraught situation of
writing about Africa always,

02:19.400 --> 02:21.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
right, how to
write about Africa.

02:21.733 --> 02:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have to deal with that, as
a journalist and in this case.

02:24.333 --> 02:27.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: And I was
trying to be honest about that
in this book, because there's

02:27.566 --> 02:30.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
many books written by
passing correspondents.

02:30.200 --> 02:34.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the term in Africa
is mzungu, which means
white man, like gringo.

02:34.766 --> 02:39.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I cover these conflicts, I go
into a famine zone, I go into
a part of South Sudan where

02:39.000 --> 02:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people are killing each
other, and they're stuck.

02:41.533 --> 02:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Their houses have been burned.

02:42.900 --> 02:44.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have lost everything
they have owned.

02:44.366 --> 02:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have lost loved ones.

02:46.600 --> 02:50.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're sharing their misery
with me, and I am dutifully
recording it in my notebook,

02:50.866 --> 02:53.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and then transmitting
it to the world.

02:53.100 --> 02:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then I get on a plane and
take off, and go back to my
wife and kids and my comfortable

02:57.000 --> 02:58.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

02:58.433 --> 03:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's morally
problematic in some ways.

03:01.633 --> 03:03.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But that's my role.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We all have our roles.

03:04.700 --> 03:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The aid workers have their
roles in delivering aid.

03:06.300 --> 03:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The militaries have their
role in providing security.

03:08.966 --> 03:13.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as a journalist, my role
is to just try and gather as
much material, and open a window

03:15.100 --> 03:17.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to a different
part of the world.

03:17.166 --> 03:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, in this
book, there is the other part
of the love story, which is

03:20.233 --> 03:23.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
your wife, who you
now go home too.

03:23.900 --> 03:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you're open about the
problems of a marriage amid
the life you are leading.

03:30.433 --> 03:33.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She leaves behind a
life as a lawyer to
come and work with you.

03:33.633 --> 03:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: i think what
we struggled with is what a
lot of young people struggle

03:37.566 --> 03:38.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with.

03:38.966 --> 03:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We were both really determined
to pursue our careers.

03:40.800 --> 03:43.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She was dead set on being a
criminal defense attorney.

03:43.366 --> 03:45.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I really wanted to
be a journalist.

03:45.500 --> 03:49.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had to go where the jobs
took us, and we did a lot of
damage to our relationship.

03:49.766 --> 03:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we didn't respect and honor
what we suspected that we had,
which was a very special bond.

03:56.866 --> 04:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there were years that we
screwed it up, and we threw
away a lot of time together.

04:00.366 --> 04:04.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's not
giving away the ending to say
that it worked out, right?

04:04.100 --> 04:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: Yes, we
were lucky enough to finally
sort of see which way is up.

04:10.133 --> 04:11.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we have a wonderful
life in Kenya.

04:11.400 --> 04:12.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a great place
to raise a family.

04:12.633 --> 04:14.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have two little boys
that were born there.

04:14.633 --> 04:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What do you want
to convey here that we either
miss as viewer or watchers

04:21.066 --> 04:24.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of the world, or that
America itself misses,
right, in its policy?

04:24.333 --> 04:25.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN:
Where do I begin?

04:25.966 --> 04:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OK, a couple quick things.

04:28.566 --> 04:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is, in a lot of these
really bad situations,
there is an undercurrent
of hope, and of dignity,

04:34.400 --> 04:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and of humanity, and community.

04:36.533 --> 04:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For instance, I covered the
Westgate Mall massacre, where
some terrorists came into

04:40.533 --> 04:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a crowded mall in Nairobi, and
gunned down dozens of people.

04:44.333 --> 04:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They didn't kill more people,
because there was a response by
neighborhood police officers,

04:49.333 --> 04:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who were much more lightly
armed than these terrorists
that had assault rifles.

04:54.066 --> 04:59.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And these guys went streaming
into this mall, under fire, with
these cheap pistols, fighting

04:59.933 --> 05:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
against these terrorists.

05:02.066 --> 05:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were taking shots, they
were getting hit, they were
getting wounded, and they kept

05:04.233 --> 05:06.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
going.

05:06.233 --> 05:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These guys came in as
basically volunteers,
and saved a lot of lives.

05:09.400 --> 05:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, even in this moment, that
was there was still an element
of humanity, and community,

05:15.566 --> 05:17.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and pulling together
at the right time.

05:17.666 --> 05:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have seen that in war
zones, and in battle zones,
and in famine situations.

05:22.300 --> 05:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The one other thing I think is,
a lot of the problems in Africa
are because of things that

05:29.133 --> 05:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happened outside of
Africa, or because of
American policy especially.

05:31.833 --> 05:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I wrote a bit in
this book about the
mistakes that the American
government has made under

05:36.433 --> 05:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
different administrations.

05:37.833 --> 05:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It wasn't a Republican
problem or a Democrat problem.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was kind of a
lack of interest.

05:42.633 --> 05:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the results were famine,
and chaos, and pirates.

05:47.033 --> 05:52.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But some of that was because of
specific decisions the American
government had made that were

05:53.233 --> 05:55.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bad decisions and led to
a whole chain of events.

05:55.266 --> 05:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But in this part of the world,
a lot of people aren't paying
that close of attention.

05:58.633 --> 06:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I felt that it was my
responsibility to write a very
personal book, an accessible

06:02.766 --> 06:07.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
book, a kind of escape,
adventure story, but
to do some educating.

06:07.333 --> 06:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
the book is "Love, Africa."

06:10.833 --> 06:11.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Gettleman,
thank you very much.

06:11.900 --> 06:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: Thank you.

06:14.333 --> 06:17.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Read Jeffrey
Gettleman's reflections
on closing The New
York Times' East Africa
