JUDY WOODRUFF: But first:
Schools are paying a lot more
attention to what students post

00:04.400 --> 00:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
online, and that can have
severe consequences for
students and schools.

00:09.166 --> 00:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Harvard University
withdrew the admittance
of at least 10 incoming
freshmen who had reportedly

00:16.166 --> 00:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
posted violent, racist and
sexually explicit content
in a private Facebook group.

00:21.566 --> 00:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
High schools are cracking down,
too, with some hiring outside
companies to police social

00:26.800 --> 00:28.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
media posts.

00:28.800 --> 00:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But monitoring online behavior
is difficult, and civil
rights groups are watching.

00:34.733 --> 00:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Lisa
Stark with our partner Education
Week visited a school district

00:38.566 --> 00:40.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Arizona.

00:40.733 --> 00:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: It's just before
summer break at Dysart High
School in Surprise, Arizona,

00:44.666 --> 00:46.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
outside Phoenix.

00:46.700 --> 00:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Students are eating lunch,
signing yearbooks, and they're
immersed in social media.

00:52.600 --> 00:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat,
Instagram, YouTube.

00:58.533 --> 01:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 90 percent of teens
say they go online every
day, and nearly a quarter are

01:02.766 --> 01:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
online almost constantly.

01:04.633 --> 01:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let me ask you, first of
all, do you all have phones?

01:07.733 --> 01:08.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: Yes.

01:08.733 --> 01:10.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: Yes, we do.

01:10.233 --> 01:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA STARK: Do you ever
not have a phone with you?

01:11.966 --> 01:12.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: No.

01:12.966 --> 01:14.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: It's always on.

01:14.966 --> 01:18.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: We sat down with
four Dysart students to talk
about how they use social media.

01:18.500 --> 01:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Snapchat, I post every single
day, like, every day, all day.

01:21.633 --> 01:24.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
STUDENT: I always
like post my thoughts,
certain way I'm feeling.

01:24.466 --> 01:26.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Depends on how I'm
feeling that day.

01:26.466 --> 01:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: When I'm done with all
my work, and if I don't have
any work from other classes,

01:28.900 --> 01:31.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I just go on my phone
and see what's going on.

01:31.366 --> 01:32.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STUDENT: I don't really
care who sees it.

01:32.900 --> 01:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Like, I'm just posting it
because I think it's public.

01:34.700 --> 01:36.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Like, I'm open about it.

01:36.666 --> 01:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: The problem for
schools, what happens on social
media doesn't always stay

01:41.933 --> 01:44.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on social media.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: I see a lot of
bullying on Facebook that
it transfers to the school.

01:49.533 --> 01:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, like, at the beginning
of this year, this girl got
into an altercation on Facebook,

01:54.533 --> 01:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and she ended up fighting
the girl at school.

01:56.733 --> 01:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY HARTJEN, Principal, Dysart
High School: When something's
posted on social media and

01:59.633 --> 02:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's being talked about
on campus and it disrupts
learning, that's when
we have to step in and

02:06.066 --> 02:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
decide if there's something
that we need to react to.

02:08.200 --> 02:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Nationwide, a
growing number of districts are
watching what's posted online

02:12.666 --> 02:15.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for anything that might
impact their schools.

02:15.766 --> 02:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Principal Amy Hartjen says the
number one concern is safety.

02:20.533 --> 02:23.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What's like, OK, we have
to get involved here?

02:23.300 --> 02:25.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Bullying, would
that be a red line?

02:25.000 --> 02:27.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY HARTJEN: Absolutely,
threats, intimidations.

02:27.466 --> 02:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: What if
someone posts something
that is offensive
language, racist, sexist?

02:30.366 --> 02:31.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY HARTJEN: Absolutely.

02:31.366 --> 02:32.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: Really?

02:32.566 --> 02:34.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And why would that
be a red line?

02:34.566 --> 02:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY HARTJEN: Because that
is just -- it's against
the campus culture.

02:40.600 --> 02:44.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Students threatening
to harm others or themselves
sometimes telegraph that on

02:46.633 --> 02:49.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
social media, and districts
have been sued for not paying
attention to online posts.

02:51.166 --> 02:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These days, the schoolyard
has new boundaries.

02:53.800 --> 02:56.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZACHERY FOUNTAIN, Dysart
District Communications
Chief: The information
space is just as important

02:56.866 --> 03:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the physical space anymore,
because it has that ability
to snowball at a really rapid

03:01.866 --> 03:03.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pace.

03:03.900 --> 03:07.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: Zachery
Fountain is the Dysart
District Communications
Chief, and point man

03:07.066 --> 03:08.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on social media.

03:08.566 --> 03:11.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He trains staff on how to
document troublesome posts.

03:11.700 --> 03:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZACHERY FOUNTAIN: That's
teaching them things like asking
for a screen shot of what has

03:18.700 --> 03:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happened, understanding that
a message could disappear in
five seconds, as soon as it's

03:21.233 --> 03:23.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
brought to their
attention by a student.

03:23.800 --> 03:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Nationwide,
both public and private
schools keep tabs on
social media in a variety

03:28.166 --> 03:33.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of ways: hiring firms
to actively monitor
students' accounts,
encouraging students to

03:35.633 --> 03:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
report anything worrisome,
friending students to
gain access to posts
that may not be public,

03:41.300 --> 03:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and through simple alerts
every time the district
and its schools are
mentioned in any type

03:46.100 --> 03:48.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of media.

03:48.166 --> 03:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's anecdotal evidence, but
no hard data, to show that early
identification of troubling

03:54.000 --> 03:57.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
social media posts can help
schools head off problems.

03:59.166 --> 04:01.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
School officials here
insist they are most
concerned about safety.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're not trying to
pry into students' lives.

04:04.066 --> 04:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But civil rights and privacy
groups say it can be a slippery
slope and that some districts

04:08.933 --> 04:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have gone too far, that
they have violated students'
constitutional rights.

04:15.900 --> 04:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Students have been disciplined
for liking other posts, for
private online chats that

04:19.933 --> 04:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
others made public, for
forwarding racist posts, even
in order to denounce them.

04:26.966 --> 04:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHAD MARLOW, American Civil
Liberties Union: Schools need
to think about, how do we take

04:29.100 --> 04:32.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on these issues in an
appropriate way that
doesn't have kind of
the collateral damage

04:34.133 --> 04:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
effect of destroying students'
privacy and free speech rights?

04:37.300 --> 04:40.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: Chad Marlow
is with the American
Civil Liberties Union.

04:40.533 --> 04:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says, first and foremost,
school shouldn't have open-ended
access to students' social

04:46.366 --> 04:48.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
media accounts.

04:48.033 --> 04:49.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You're saying no
fishing expeditions?

04:49.233 --> 04:51.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHAD MARLOW: No
fishing expeditions.

04:51.333 --> 04:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the way to do that is
by not allowing passwords to
be turned over, what we call

04:54.633 --> 04:56.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
shoulder surfing.

04:56.700 --> 04:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Log onto your account, and the
teacher will stand over the
student's shoulder and say,

04:59.866 --> 05:01.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
scroll, scroll, scroll.

05:01.433 --> 05:02.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA STARK: Are you asking
students for passwords?

05:02.866 --> 05:04.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WENDY KLARKOWSKI, School
Resource Officer: No.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: Or log-in
information or anything?

05:06.733 --> 05:08.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WENDY KLARKOWSKI: No.

05:08.800 --> 05:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: School resource
officer Wendy Klarkowski is
assigned to Shadow Ridge High

05:11.633 --> 05:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
School in the Dysart district.

05:13.666 --> 05:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her morning routine includes
searching for school-related
posts on social media.

05:19.366 --> 05:21.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She's uncovered
criminal activity.

05:21.400 --> 05:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WENDY KLARKOWSKI: A young
man had decided to bring some
marijuana-laced brownies to

05:23.433 --> 05:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
school, and he advertised
them on Twitter and,
meet me in the cafeteria.

05:27.233 --> 05:29.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We got him with all the
brownies still on him.

05:29.166 --> 05:31.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: And possible
campus disruptions.

05:31.500 --> 05:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WENDY KLARKOWSKI: Some kids
were going to protest something
they thought was unfair,

05:34.500 --> 05:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and it was all over Twitter,
so we were able to get the kids
that were leading it, actually,

05:41.466 --> 05:44.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the night before, so that
they put an end to that, so
it didn't disrupt the campus.

05:44.200 --> 05:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: But why isn't
that their free speech right
to protest something they're

05:47.933 --> 05:50.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not happy about?

05:50.600 --> 05:53.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WENDY KLARKOWSKI: It is
their right to protest,
but it is not their right
to disturb an educational

05:53.700 --> 05:55.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
institution.

05:55.600 --> 05:58.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: The ACLU's Marlow
worries about districts
stifling free speech.

05:58.900 --> 06:03.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHAD MARLOW: It is very
important to draw the line
between punishing an action that

06:05.833 --> 06:08.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
occurs on social media
vs. thoughts that are
expressed on social media.

06:08.700 --> 06:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Once you start policing and
punishing thoughts, you are into
very, very dangerous territory.

06:13.200 --> 06:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Two of the Dysart
students we spoke with say they
tread more carefully online

06:19.766 --> 06:23.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
after each posted a
disparaging remark about
one of their teachers.

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: I made a reference to
one of my teachers last year
on Facebook, and I almost got a

06:29.166 --> 06:31.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
referral for it, for
what I said about her.

06:31.133 --> 06:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then me and the teacher
ended up talking, and now
she's my favorite teacher ever.

06:33.633 --> 06:36.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HADIN KHAN, Student:
It was funny at first.

06:36.133 --> 06:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then I was like, OK, I need
to take some precautions
for next time, when I'm
angry about something,

06:41.433 --> 06:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not mention names or anything.

06:42.933 --> 06:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I could say English teacher, as
opposed to saying their name.

06:44.700 --> 06:47.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: So, you
are censoring yourself
in a way, right?

06:47.133 --> 06:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HADIN KHAN: Yes, kind of.

06:48.133 --> 06:49.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA STARK: How do you feel
about having to do that?

06:51.500 --> 06:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HADIN KHAN: I don't really
have a problem with it, because
it's not that serious of

06:53.233 --> 06:55.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an issue.

06:55.300 --> 06:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Superintendent Gail
Pletnick insists the district
is careful not to violate free

07:00.166 --> 07:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
speech or privacy rights.

07:02.233 --> 07:03.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GAIL PLETNICK, Superintendent,
Dysart Unified School District:
We're not crossing that line.

07:03.366 --> 07:06.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're not monitoring
people 24/7.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
