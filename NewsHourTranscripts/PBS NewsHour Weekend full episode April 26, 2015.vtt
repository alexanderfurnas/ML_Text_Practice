01:32.492 --> 01:34.127
DIFFICULT NOW AND I HAVE NOTHING

01:36.897 --> 01:38.899
>> Stewart: A DOZEN AFTERSHOCKS

01:38.899 --> 01:39.866
HAVE MADE THE SEARCH EVEN MORE

01:39.866 --> 01:40.867
TREACHEROUS ACROSS THE KATHMANDU

01:40.867 --> 01:41.735
VALLEY, WHICH IS HOME TO SOME

01:41.735 --> 01:43.537
2.5 MILLION PEOPLE.

01:43.537 --> 01:44.938
THE CAPITAL CITY ITSELF IS JUST

01:44.938 --> 01:46.073
50 MILES SOUTHEAST OF THE

01:46.073 --> 01:49.176
QUAKE'S EPICENTER.

01:49.176 --> 01:50.644
THOUSANDS OF DISPLACED RESIDENTS

01:50.644 --> 01:51.645
AND TOURISTS ARE BEING FORCED TO

01:51.645 --> 01:54.514
SLEEP OUTSIDE.

01:54.514 --> 01:55.215
>> EVERYONE WAITED FOR IT TO

01:55.215 --> 01:56.984
FINISH.

01:56.984 --> 01:58.719
AND ONCE IT FINISHED THERE WERE

01:58.719 --> 02:00.220
JUST FLOODS OF PEOPLE RUNNING

02:00.220 --> 02:02.756
TO OPEN SPACES.

02:02.756 --> 02:03.690

AT LEAST 17 PEOPLE WERE KILLED.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.402
BACK IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL,

02:15.402 --> 02:16.803
THE QUAKE DESTROYED SOME OF

02:16.803 --> 02:18.305
NEPAL'S TREASURED ARCHITECTURE,

02:18.305 --> 02:19.673
INCLUDING THIS LANDMARK BUILT

02:19.673 --> 02:22.876
FOR NEPAL'S QUEEN IN 1832.

02:22.876 --> 02:23.977
NEPAL IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S

02:23.977 --> 02:25.579
POOREST COUNTRIES.

02:25.579 --> 02:26.880
INDIA, CHINA AND SINGAPORE HAVE

02:26.880 --> 02:28.148
DISPATCHED RESCUE TEAMS TO THE

02:28.148 --> 02:29.549
REGION.

02:29.549 --> 02:30.951
THE U.S. HAS SENT A RESPONSE

02:30.951 --> 02:32.552
TEAM ALONG WITH AN INITIAL

02:32.552 --> 02:34.287
MILLION DOLLARS IN AID.

02:34.287 --> 02:35.555
THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAID TODAY

02:35.555 --> 02:36.990
THAT THREE AMERICANS WERE KILLED

02:36.990 --> 02:38.692
IN THE EARTHQUAKE.

02:38.692 --> 02:39.960
TONIGHT, NEPAL'S GOVERNMENT IS

02:39.960 --> 02:41.628
WORKING TO SET UP 16 RELIEF

02:41.628 --> 02:43.196
STATIONS ACROSS THE AFFECTED

02:43.196 --> 02:44.798
AREA IN AN EFFORT TO DISTRIBUTE

02:44.798 --> 02:47.768
WATER, FOOD AND MEDICINE.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.102
IN BALTIMORE, A DEMONSTRATION

02:49.102 --> 02:50.904
OVER THE DEATH OF 25-YEAR-OLD

02:50.904 --> 02:52.606
FREDDIE GRAY STARTED PEACEFULLY

02:52.606 --> 02:53.974
BUT TURNED VIOLENT LAST NIGHT

02:53.974 --> 02:54.808
WHEN PROTESTERS CLASHED WITH

02:54.808 --> 02:56.309
POLICE.

02:56.309 --> 02:57.577
AUTHORITIES ARRESTED ABOUT 34

02:57.577 --> 02:58.645
PEOPLE.

02:58.645 --> 02:59.479
SIX OFFICERS SUFFERED MINOR

02:59.479 --> 03:00.914
INJURIES.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.349
FANS ATTENDING THE BALTIMORE

03:02.349 --> 03:03.717
ORIOLES GAME WERE TOLD TO STAY

03:03.717 --> 03:04.451
IN PLACE BECAUSE OF SAFETY

03:04.451 --> 03:06.153
CONCERNS.

03:06.153 --> 03:07.354
I'M JOINED NOW ONCE AGAIN BY

03:07.354 --> 03:08.121
BALTIMORE SUN REPORTER LUKE

03:08.121 --> 03:11.324
BROADWATER.

03:11.324 --> 03:12.125
>> Stewart: LUKE, DO YOU KNOW

03:12.125 --> 03:15.762
WHY THINGS TURNED VIOLENT?

03:15.762 --> 03:18.632
>> WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHY

03:18.632 --> 03:20.967
THINGS TURNED VIOLENT.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.070
UP UNTIL MID AFTERNOON, IT HAD
HAD

03:23.070 --> 03:25.705
BEEN A VERY PEACEFUL PROTEST.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.841
1,200 PEOPLE HAS DESCENDED ON

03:27.841 --> 03:30.977
CITY HALL AND PEOPLE WERE

03:30.977 --> 03:32.846
EXPECT, RESPECTING THEM,

03:32.846 --> 03:34.047
GATHERING AMEND THE POLICE LET

03:34.047 --> 03:35.882
THEM DO IT AND THEN THE MARCH

03:35.882 --> 03:38.185
CAME DOWN TO CAMDEN YARD WHERE

03:38.185 --> 03:39.519
THE ORIOLES PLAY AND THINGS

03:39.519 --> 03:40.821
REALLY GOT OUT OF CONTROL, I

03:40.821 --> 03:42.089
WOULD SAY LESS THAN 100 PEOPLE

03:42.089 --> 03:43.523
WERE INVOLVED IN THE VIOLENCE

03:43.523 --> 03:45.125
AND THE RIOTING AND LOOTING SO

03:45.125 --> 03:48.295
IT WAS A SMALL MINORITY OF THE

03:48.295 --> 03:49.529
PROTESTERS, BUT THEY DID A LOT

03:49.529 --> 03:51.731
OF PROPERTY DAMAGE AND SOME

03:51.731 --> 03:53.467
PEOPLE DID GET INJURED.

03:53.467 --> 03:54.534
THEY SMASHED THE WINDOWS OF

03:54.534 --> 03:56.336
POLICE CARS AND SOME CIVILIAN

03:56.336 --> 03:58.472
CARS, THE WINDOWS OF PROPERTY --

03:58.472 --> 04:00.907
OF BUSINESSES IN THE AREA.

04:00.907 --> 04:04.244
THERE WERE SOME, AND THERE WERE

04:04.244 --> 04:05.979
SOME ASSAULTS.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.247
SO IT WAS NOT A PRETTY SIGHT

04:07.247 --> 04:08.348
LAST NIGHT IN BALTIMORE.

04:08.348 --> 04:10.317
>> Stewart: CAN YOU DESCRIBE

04:10.317 --> 04:12.452
THE LEVEL OF THE POLICE FORCE?

04:12.452 --> 04:13.420
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF

04:13.420 --> 04:14.421
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE

04:14.421 --> 04:16.022
MILITARIZATION OF THE POLICE.

04:16.022 --> 04:17.657
HOW MANY POLICE OFFICERS, WERE

04:17.657 --> 04:21.094
THEY IN COMBAT GEAR?

04:21.094 --> 04:22.395
>> YES.

04:22.395 --> 04:24.431
THEY DID NOT START OUT IN COMBAT

04:24.431 --> 04:26.199
GEAR, BUT THEY DID ACQUIRE IT AS

04:26.199 --> 04:27.667
THE NIGHT WENT ON.

04:27.667 --> 04:30.036
BY OUR ESTIMATION THERE WERE

04:30.036 --> 04:31.671
OVER 1,000, I AM SORRY, OVER

04:31.671 --> 04:33.173
1,000 POLICE OFFICERS, PROBABLY

04:33.173 --> 04:36.810
ABOUT 1,300 FROM THE POLICE

04:36.810 --> 04:37.744
FORCE, THE STATE TROOPERS DID

04:37.744 --> 04:39.045
COME IN AS WELL AND SOME FROM

04:39.045 --> 04:41.515
THE COUNTY POLICE FORCE AS WELL.

04:41.515 --> 04:44.484
THEY HAD SHIELDS, THEY HAD THEIR

04:44.484 --> 04:45.585
BATONS OUT.

04:45.585 --> 04:48.388
THEY HAD THEIR HELMETS AND THEY

04:48.388 --> 04:53.026
DID ENGAGE IN SOME CROWD CONTROL

04:53.026 --> 04:54.327
TACTICS THAT, YOU KNOW, LOOKED

04:54.327 --> 04:55.228
LIKE MILITARY OPERATIONS IN

04:55.228 --> 04:56.496
TERMS OF PUSHING THE CROWD BACK

04:56.496 --> 04:59.332
WITH THE SHIELDS.

04:59.332 --> 05:02.435
THEY HAD THE POLICE CHOPPER

05:02.435 --> 05:05.772
SHOUTING ORDERS TO DISPERSE AND

05:05.772 --> 05:07.107
THEN THREATENED THOSE WHO DID

05:07.107 --> 05:07.607
NOT WITH ARREST.

05:07.607 --> 05:09.476
>> Stewart: THE MAYOR AND THE

05:09.476 --> 05:10.443
COMMISSIONER ARE MAKING A

05:10.443 --> 05:11.411
DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THE

05:11.411 --> 05:12.712
PROTESTERS AND PEOPLE THEY ARE

05:12.712 --> 05:14.714
CALLING AGITATORS.

05:14.714 --> 05:16.783
TO WHOM ARE THEY REFERRING?

05:16.783 --> 05:17.417
>> YES.

05:17.417 --> 05:19.452
YOU ARE RIGHT.

05:19.452 --> 05:20.987
EVEN BEFORE THE PROTESTS STARTED

05:20.987 --> 05:23.924
THE MAYOR AND THE POLICE

05:23.924 --> 05:25.525
COMMISSIONER AND FAITH LEADERS

05:25.525 --> 05:26.960
IN BALTIMORE EXPRESSED A LOT OF

05:26.960 --> 05:28.361
CONCERN ABOUT OUTSIDE GROUPS

05:28.361 --> 05:29.129
COMING IN.

05:29.129 --> 05:30.397
THEY DIDN'T MENTION ANYONE BY

05:30.397 --> 05:31.164
NAME.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.934
I BELIEVE THEY WERE REFERRING TO

05:33.934 --> 05:37.237
MR. SHABAZZ, THE HEAD OF THE

05:37.237 --> 05:39.206
NEW BLACK PANTHERS.

05:39.206 --> 05:41.274
THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT HIS

05:41.274 --> 05:42.876
INFLUENCE AND OTHERS INFLUENCE

05:42.876 --> 05:44.744
AND THE PROTEST POTENTIALLY

05:44.744 --> 05:45.245
TURNING VIOLENT.

05:45.245 --> 05:47.347
WE HAD HAD A WEEK OF NONVIOLENT

05:47.347 --> 05:49.082
PROTESTS IN BALTIMORE AND LAST

05:49.082 --> 05:50.183
NIGHT WAS THE FIRST REAL

05:50.183 --> 05:51.751
VIOLENCE THAT WE SAW.

05:51.751 --> 05:52.786
>> Stewart: LUKE BROADWATER

05:52.786 --> 05:56.189
FROM THE BALTIMORE SUN, THANKS,

05:56.189 --> 05:56.623
LUKE.

05:56.623 --> 06:01.861

06:03.663 --> 06:04.664

06:04.664 --> 06:05.832
THE LIFE OF 12-YEAR-OLD TAMIR

06:17.077 --> 06:18.845
NOVEMBER 22.

06:18.845 --> 06:20.313
THEY'LL USE THE FOOTAGE TO PUT

06:20.313 --> 06:21.248
TOGETHER A 3-D MOCK-UP OF THE

06:21.248 --> 06:23.116
SHOOTING.

06:23.116 --> 06:24.451
TAMIR RICE'S FAMILY IS SUING THE

06:24.451 --> 06:25.151
CITY AND THE TWO OFFICERS

06:25.151 --> 06:27.420

MANAGED TO GET A HOLD OF SOME OF

06:30.156 --> 06:31.658
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S EMAILS DURING

06:31.658 --> 06:33.793
A COMPUTER BREACH LAST YEAR.

06:33.793 --> 06:35.295

CLASSIFIED INFORMATION WAS

06:39.833 --> 06:41.668

06:41.668 --> 06:43.703
HOWEVER, THE "NEW YORK TIMES"

06:43.703 --> 06:45.138

SOME ARCHIVED CORRESPONDENCE

06:46.339 --> 06:48.041
WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.809
THOSE MESSAGES MAY INCLUDE THE

06:49.809 --> 06:50.810
PRESIDENT'S EMAIL WITH PEOPLE

07:00.186 --> 07:01.921
HIGHLY-ANTICIPATED CASES

07:01.921 --> 07:03.790

07:05.158 --> 07:06.126
FROM FOUR STATES THAT HAVE

07:06.126 --> 07:08.061
SUCCESSFULLY BANNED IT.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.396
PROMINENT ATTORNEY DAVID BOIES

07:09.396 --> 07:10.497
IS ONE OF THE LAWYERS FIGHTING

07:10.497 --> 07:11.631
THE BANS.

07:11.631 --> 07:12.832
HE TOLD NBC's "MEET THE PRESS"

07:12.832 --> 07:14.100
HE EXPECTS THE COURT WILL

07:14.100 --> 07:15.302
EFFECTIVELY LEGALIZE SAME-SEX

07:15.302 --> 07:18.104
MARRIAGE NATIONWIDE.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.707

07:20.707 --> 07:22.142
YEARS, WE'VE SEEN A TREMENDOUS

07:22.142 --> 07:23.343
MOVEMENT THAT I THINK MAKES IT

07:23.343 --> 07:24.311
EASIER NOW FOR THE SUPREME COURT

07:24.311 --> 07:25.979
TO MAKE THAT TOTAL DECISION.

07:25.979 --> 07:27.080
>> Stewart: WE'LL HAVE MORE ON

07:27.080 --> 07:27.847
THIS STORY TOMORROW ON THE

07:27.847 --> 07:29.983
NEWSHOUR.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.318
IN MALAYSIA, POLICE HAVE

07:31.318 --> 07:32.619
ARRESTED TWELVE MEN SUSPECTED OF

07:32.619 --> 07:33.987
PLOTTING AN ISIS-INSPIRED

07:33.987 --> 07:35.422
TERRORIST ATTACK ON GOVERNMENT

07:35.422 --> 07:38.358
TARGETS AROUND KUALA LUMPUR.

07:38.358 --> 07:39.859
THE SUSPECTS RANGE IN AGE FROM

07:39.859 --> 07:41.494
17 TO 41 AND ARE REPORTEDLY

07:41.494 --> 07:42.962
LINKED TO A SENIOR ISLAMIC STATE

07:42.962 --> 07:45.165
LEADER IN SYRIA.

07:45.165 --> 07:46.700
INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY ALSO

07:46.700 --> 07:48.401
SEIZED EQUIPMENT TO MAKE

07:48.401 --> 07:49.669
EXPLOSIVES AND AN ISLAMIC STATE

07:49.669 --> 08:02.649
FLAG DURING THE ARRESTS.

08:02.649 --> 08:03.950
>> Stewart: EARLIER THIS WEEK,

08:03.950 --> 08:05.418
THE NEWSHOUR BROUGHT YOU A

08:05.418 --> 08:06.953
SPECIAL REPORT ON HIGH-TECH

08:06.953 --> 08:11.558
MAPPING THAT HELPS RESEARCHERS

08:11.558 --> 08:12.325
UNDERSTAND AND EVEN PREDICT

08:12.325 --> 08:13.026
MAJOR DISEASE OUTBREAKS, LIKE

08:13.026 --> 08:14.194
MALARIA.

08:14.194 --> 08:15.295
NOW WE'RE LEARNING THAT MILLIONS

08:15.295 --> 08:16.730
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST

08:16.730 --> 08:17.664
VULNERABLE TO THAT DEADLY

08:17.664 --> 08:18.365
DISEASE COULD BE SAVED BY A

08:18.365 --> 08:19.632
VACCINE.

08:19.632 --> 08:21.067
HEALTH CORRESPONDENT ALOK JHA

08:21.067 --> 08:22.702
EXPLAINS WHY THE COST OF THE NEW

08:22.702 --> 08:23.970
VACCINE COULD BECOME AN ISSUE IN

08:23.970 --> 08:30.577
THE FIGHT AGAINST MALARIA.

08:30.577 --> 08:31.611
>> IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME

08:31.611 --> 08:32.345
COMING.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.481
AFTER 20 YEARS, SUSTAINED EFFORT

08:34.481 --> 08:36.282
OF VACCINES FOR A DISEASE THAT

08:36.282 --> 08:37.951
HAS CRIPPLED SO MANY COUNTRIES

08:37.951 --> 08:41.921
IN AFRICA.

08:41.921 --> 08:44.324
>> GHANA LAST YEAR, TO SEE THE

08:44.324 --> 08:45.925
CLINICAL TRIALS FOR THE NEW

08:45.925 --> 08:47.660
MALARIA VACCINE, SCIENTISTS

08:47.660 --> 08:49.162
HOPED TO PREVENT UP TO HALF OF

08:49.162 --> 08:50.930
THE CASES.

08:50.930 --> 08:53.166
NOW, AFTER GIVING IT TO 15,000

08:53.166 --> 08:54.601
CHILDREN, THEY FOUND IT REDUCES

08:54.601 --> 08:56.136
CASE BY ABOUT A THIRD.

08:56.136 --> 08:59.973
>> WE REALLY DO HAVE A MALARIA

08:59.973 --> 09:01.541
VACCINE WE NEED ONE MORE

09:01.541 --> 09:03.009
EFFECTIVE THAN THAT BUT THIS IS

09:03.009 --> 09:04.611
THE FIRST ONE AND BECAUSE

09:04.611 --> 09:07.080
MALARIA IS SUCH A MAJOR PROBLEM,

09:07.080 --> 09:09.015
SO MANY CHILDREN DIE FROM

09:09.015 --> 09:10.183
MALARIA, UNDER SOME

09:10.183 --> 09:11.117
CIRCUMSTANCES USING A VACCINE

09:11.117 --> 09:12.552
THAT ONLY GIVES YOU 30 PERCENT

09:12.552 --> 09:14.287
OF PROTECTION MAY BE A VERY

09:14.287 --> 09:15.321
USEFUL THING TO DO.

09:15.321 --> 09:18.258
>> WHEN A MOSQUITO BITES IT

09:18.258 --> 09:19.692
RELEASES PARASITES INTO YOUR

09:19.692 --> 09:20.960
BLOODSTREAM, THEY MULTIPLY INTO

09:20.960 --> 09:22.295
THOUSANDS OF NEW PARASITES,

09:22.295 --> 09:24.197
WHICH ATTACK RED BLOOD CELLS,

09:24.197 --> 09:26.099
CAUSING FEVER AND DEATH.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.468
THE VACCINE HAS TWO COMPONENTS,

09:28.468 --> 09:30.437
ONE FROM THE PARASITES AND ONE

09:30.437 --> 09:32.605
FROM HEPATITIS B VIRUS WHICH

09:32.605 --> 09:33.706
TOGETHER KICK START THE IMMUNE

09:33.706 --> 09:34.641
SYSTEM.

09:34.641 --> 09:35.842
THE TREATMENT REQUIRES THREE

09:35.842 --> 09:38.044
DOSES OF VACCINE AND A BOOSTER

09:38.044 --> 09:40.847
FOR THE BEST RESULTS.

09:40.847 --> 09:43.516
THAT WOULD BE EASIER TO

09:43.516 --> 09:44.684
ADMINISTER, THAT IS EASIER TO

09:44.684 --> 09:45.618
ADMINISTER IN COUNTRIES WITH A

09:45.618 --> 09:47.220
POOR HEALTHCARE STRUCTURE.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.988
BUT THE MAIN THING IS THE COST.

09:48.988 --> 09:51.291
PAYING FOR MILLIONS OF THE

09:51.291 --> 09:52.492
VACCINE FOR MILLIONS IS OUT OF

09:52.492 --> 09:55.128
REACH OF MOST AFRICAN COUNTRIES.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.997
>> MEASLES AND POLIOS WERE,

09:57.997 --> 09:59.332
STARTED ONLY WHEN STRATEGIC SEEN

09:59.332 --> 10:01.000
WAS PAID FOR BY OTHERS.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.769
THE EXPERIMENTS ARE OVER,

10:02.769 --> 10:03.770
INTERNATIONAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH

10:03.770 --> 10:04.804
AUTHORITIES WILL NOW WORK OUT

10:04.804 --> 10:07.841
WHERE AND WHEN THIS LIFESAVING

10:07.841 --> 10:12.345
VACCINE COULD BE USE.

10:20.019 --> 10:21.020
>> Stewart: NOW FOR OUR

10:21.020 --> 10:22.689
SIGNATURE SEGMENT.

10:22.689 --> 10:24.057
EVEN THOUGH THE UNITED STATES

10:24.057 --> 10:25.425
RANKS AMONG THE TOP NATIONS FOR

10:25.425 --> 10:26.793
INTERNET USERS, THE U.S.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.161
ACTUALLY LAGS BEHIND OTHER

10:28.161 --> 10:29.395
COUNTRIES WHEN IT COMES TO

10:29.395 --> 10:31.431
AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO THE WEB.

10:31.431 --> 10:32.866
HERE IN NEW YORK CITY, MOST

10:32.866 --> 10:34.234
PEOPLE PAY ABOUT 50 TO $60 A

10:34.234 --> 10:36.035
MONTH TO GET ONLINE.

10:36.035 --> 10:37.704
BUT IN PLACES LIKE LONDON, SEOUL

10:37.704 --> 10:38.638
AND PARIS, IT COSTS NEARLY HALF

10:38.638 --> 10:40.507
THAT.

10:40.507 --> 10:41.808
AND NOT ONLY IS ACCESS IN THE

10:41.808 --> 10:43.910
U.S. MORE EXPENSIVE, IT'S ALSO

10:43.910 --> 10:45.478
SLOWER.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.546
HARI SREENIVASAN EXPLAINS HOW

10:46.546 --> 10:47.547
THAT'S AFFECTING THE POOR MOST

10:47.547 --> 10:51.317
OF ALL.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.585
>> Sreenivasan: TWO YEARS AGO

10:52.585 --> 10:53.786
KAREN BEEN NEVER HAD TO WALK TO

10:53.786 --> 10:54.687
GET SOMEPLACE.

10:54.687 --> 10:55.822
SHE OWNED A CAR.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.090
SHE ALSO HAD A CORPORATE JOB IN

10:57.090 --> 10:58.091
ATLANTA AND A HOUSE WITH A POOL

10:58.091 --> 11:01.661
IN THE BACKYARD.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.129
BUT TODAY THIS SINGLE MOTHER OF

11:03.129 --> 11:05.198
TWO BOYS IS UNEMPLOYED AND ON

11:05.198 --> 11:07.567
THE JOB HUNT IN NEW YORK CITY.

11:07.567 --> 11:08.601
THEY MOVED HERE FOR A BETTER

11:08.601 --> 11:09.602
LIFE BUT QUICKLY RAN OUT OF

11:09.602 --> 11:10.970
MONEY.

11:10.970 --> 11:12.405
AND THE ONE THING SHE NEEDS

11:12.405 --> 11:14.107
RIGHT NOW TO GET BACK ON HER

11:14.107 --> 11:15.174
FEET IS WHAT MOST OF US TAKE FOR

11:15.174 --> 11:17.110
GRANTED.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.646
>> I FEEL THAT THE INTERNET WILL

11:19.646 --> 11:21.180
DEFINITELY BE A CATALYST IN ME

11:21.180 --> 11:22.949
GETTING OUT OF THE SITUATION WE

11:22.949 --> 11:25.084
ARE IN.

11:25.084 --> 11:27.120
IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A JOB

11:27.120 --> 11:28.154
THEY WANT ME TO GO ONLINE AND

11:28.154 --> 11:29.689
FILL OUT AN APPLICATION.

11:29.689 --> 11:30.523
THERE IS NO MORE HARDCOPIES WHEN

11:30.523 --> 11:32.325
IT COMES TO RESUMES.

11:32.325 --> 11:33.660
>> Sreenivasan: BUT IT'S

11:33.660 --> 11:34.928
DIFFICULT FOR BEEN TO GO ONLINE

11:34.928 --> 11:36.462
AND SEND OUT HER RESUME.

11:36.462 --> 11:37.830
SHE CAN'T AFFORD THE MONTHLY

11:37.830 --> 11:39.265
INTERNET BILL, WHICH COSTS

11:39.265 --> 11:40.266
AROUND $60 A MONTH IN NEW YORK

11:40.266 --> 11:42.402
CITY.

11:42.402 --> 11:43.670
SO AFTER SCHOOL, THE THREE MAKE

11:43.670 --> 11:45.305
A BEELINE FOR THE LIBRARY.

11:45.305 --> 11:46.839
BEEN'S 11-YEAR-OLD SON ISHAN

11:46.839 --> 11:48.241
SIDDIQUI RUSHES TO FINISH HIS

11:48.241 --> 11:49.208
HOMEWORK BEFORE THE LIBRARY

11:49.208 --> 11:50.643
CLOSES.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.111
>> IT WAS KIND OF DIFFICULT

11:52.111 --> 11:53.746
BECAUSE SOMETIMES IN CLASS I

11:53.746 --> 11:55.214
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND SOMETHING AND

11:55.214 --> 11:56.749
I WANTED TO GO ON THE COMPUTER

11:56.749 --> 11:57.917
BUT I COULDN'T GO ON IT SO I

11:57.917 --> 11:59.018
COULDN'T RESEARCH WHAT I WANTED

11:59.018 --> 11:59.986
TO.

11:59.986 --> 12:01.821
>> Sreenivasan: THE BEEN FAMILY

12:01.821 --> 12:04.023
IS ONE OF 730,000 HOUSEHOLDS IN

12:04.023 --> 12:05.625
NEW YORK THAT DOES NOT HAVE

12:05.625 --> 12:07.860
INTERNET IN THE HOME.

12:07.860 --> 12:09.562
THE CITY SAYS IT'S DOING ITS

12:09.562 --> 12:11.397
PART TO PULL NEW YORKERS OUT OF

12:11.397 --> 12:12.932
THE DIGITAL DARK, BUT IT TAKES

12:12.932 --> 12:13.733
MORE THAN JUST HAVING AN

12:13.733 --> 12:15.134
INTERNET CONNECTION.

12:15.134 --> 12:15.935
THAT CONNECTION HAS TO BE

12:15.935 --> 12:17.770
AFFORDABLE TOO.

12:17.770 --> 12:20.440
>> THE INTERNET TODAY IS REALLY

12:20.440 --> 12:22.308
WHAT RAILROADS AND ROADS WERE AT

12:22.308 --> 12:24.344
THE TURN OF THE CENTURY; THEY'RE

12:24.344 --> 12:26.179
OUR PRIMARY WAY BOTH OF DOING

12:26.179 --> 12:27.780
COMMERCE AND FOR PEOPLE TO GET

12:27.780 --> 12:28.982
CONNECTED TO THE ECONOMY, TO GET

12:28.982 --> 12:30.516
EDUCATION.

12:30.516 --> 12:32.151
>> Sreenivasan: MAYA WILEY IS A

12:32.151 --> 12:33.152
COUNSEL TO NEW YORK CITY MAYOR

12:33.152 --> 12:34.520
BILL DE BLASIO.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.022
HER MISSION IS TO MAKE HIGH

12:36.022 --> 12:37.657
SPEED INTERNET MORE ACCESSIBLE

12:37.657 --> 12:39.192
TO NEW YORKERS, ESPECIALLY FOR

12:39.192 --> 12:40.560
PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY

12:40.560 --> 12:42.428
FOR BASIC BROADBAND.

12:42.428 --> 12:43.329
SHE CONSIDERS IT A SOCIAL

12:43.329 --> 12:44.631
JUSTICE ISSUE.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.399
>> NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE AND NO

12:46.399 --> 12:48.267
MATTER YOUR FINANCIAL RESOURCES,

12:48.267 --> 12:49.702
YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GET ONLINE

12:49.702 --> 12:50.637
FOR FREE AND GET HIGH SPEED

12:50.637 --> 12:51.604
INTERNET.

12:51.604 --> 12:52.839
>> Sreenivasan: SO THE CITY IS

12:52.839 --> 12:54.307
FOCUSED ON ROLLING OUT FREE

12:54.307 --> 12:55.842
WIRELESS LIKE WITH THESE VANS

12:55.842 --> 12:57.176
THAT DOUBLE AS MOBILE COMPUTER

12:57.176 --> 12:58.811
LABS AND WI-FI HUBS.

12:58.811 --> 13:00.079
THEY'RE USUALLY PARKED IN FRONT

13:00.079 --> 13:02.248
OF PUBLIC HOUSING APARTMENTS.

13:02.248 --> 13:04.384
THE CITY IS ALSO EXPANDING WI-FI

13:04.384 --> 13:06.052
UNDERGROUND AND IN PUBLIC SPACES

13:06.052 --> 13:08.087
LIKE MADISON SQUARE PARK.

13:08.087 --> 13:09.789
AND LATER THIS YEAR, THE CITY

13:09.789 --> 13:11.257
WILL TURN DEFUNCT PAY PHONES

13:11.257 --> 13:13.559
INTO FREE WIRELESS HUBS.

13:13.559 --> 13:15.228
PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE ALSO

13:15.228 --> 13:16.963
JOINING IN, LENDING OUT FREE

13:16.963 --> 13:18.631
HOTSPOTS-- MOBILE DEVICES THAT

13:18.631 --> 13:20.199
TRANSMIT A WIRELESS SIGNAL--

13:20.199 --> 13:21.634
THAT LOW-INCOME FAMILIES CAN

13:21.634 --> 13:24.437
CHECK OUT, MUCH LIKE BOOKS.

13:24.437 --> 13:27.040
BEEN AND HER SONS TOOK ONE HOME.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.641
>> WHEN THE LIBRARY CLOSES ON

13:28.641 --> 13:30.209
FRIDAY, IT CLOSES REALLY EARLY,

13:30.209 --> 13:31.644
BUT WHEN I GO HOME I CAN FINISH

13:31.644 --> 13:33.646
DOING WHAT I WANT ON THE

13:33.646 --> 13:34.947
COMPUTER, AND NOW WHEN I STUDY I

13:34.947 --> 13:37.050
GET BETTER GRADES.

13:37.050 --> 13:37.984
>> Sreenivasan: BUT IN

13:37.984 --> 13:39.385
NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THE CITY'S

13:39.385 --> 13:40.953
WIRELESS PROGRAMS DON'T YET

13:40.953 --> 13:42.655
EXTEND FAR ENOUGH, RESIDENTS ARE

13:42.655 --> 13:43.856
LITERALLY TAKING MEASURES INTO

13:43.856 --> 13:45.391
THEIR OWN HANDS.

13:45.391 --> 13:47.060
A FEW TIMES A WEEK ROBERT SMITH

13:47.060 --> 13:48.428
CLIMBS TO THE ROOFTOPS OF RED

13:48.428 --> 13:50.296

THE RED HOOK INITIATIVE, A

13:54.400 --> 14:00.640
COMMUNITY CENTER THAT RECEIVES

14:00.640 --> 14:01.407
SUPPORT FROM THE CITY, HE

14:01.407 --> 14:02.308
INSTALLS TINY ROUTERS THAT BEAM

14:02.308 --> 14:03.543
OUT WIRELESS SIGNALS.

14:03.543 --> 14:04.444
THERE ARE DOZENS OF THESE

14:04.444 --> 14:05.745
THROUGHOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

14:05.745 --> 14:06.846
ESSENTIALLY CREATING A BLANKET

14:06.846 --> 14:08.381
OF FREE WI-FI.

14:08.381 --> 14:09.482
>> HAVING INTERNET ACCESS JUST

14:09.482 --> 14:11.317
OPENS UP A WHOLE ANOTHER WORLD

14:11.317 --> 14:12.351
OF OPPORTUNITY, LIKE PEOPLE CAN

14:12.351 --> 14:13.386
OBTAIN LIKE A COLLEGE LEVEL

14:13.386 --> 14:14.320
DEGREE OF EDUCATION JUST FROM

14:14.320 --> 14:15.588
THE INTERNET.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.056

14:17.056 --> 14:18.558
IN PUBLIC HOUSING HIS WHOLE LIFE

14:18.558 --> 14:19.792
AND SAYS MOST OF HIS FRIENDS

14:19.792 --> 14:21.360
CAN'T AFFORD AN INTERNET BILL.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.962
THAT'S BECAUSE 60% OF THE

14:22.962 --> 14:24.530
RESIDENTS IN RED HOOK LIVE IN

14:24.530 --> 14:26.299
LOW INCOME PUBLIC HOUSING, WHERE

14:26.299 --> 14:27.667
THE AVERAGE FAMILY'S INCOME IS

14:27.667 --> 14:30.436
JUST OVER $23,000.

14:30.436 --> 14:32.171
>> IT'S RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE

14:32.171 --> 14:34.040
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES TO

14:34.040 --> 14:35.808
HAVE THIS BASIC THING IN YOUR

14:35.808 --> 14:37.076
HOUSE THAT MAKES POSSIBLE EVERY

14:37.076 --> 14:39.112
OTHER ASPECT OF LIFE.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.480
>> Sreenivasan: SUSAN CRAWFORD

14:40.480 --> 14:41.748
IS A PROFESSOR AT CARDOZO LAW

14:41.748 --> 14:43.015
SCHOOL IN NEW YORK CITY.

14:43.015 --> 14:44.283
SHE ALSO SERVED AS PRESIDENT

14:44.283 --> 14:45.318
OBAMA'S SPECIAL ASSISTANT FOR

14:45.318 --> 14:46.753
TECHNOLOGY.

14:46.753 --> 14:48.454
SHE SAYS PEOPLE TODAY EXPECT TO

14:48.454 --> 14:50.323
HAVE INTERNET ACCESS ANYTIME, IN

14:50.323 --> 14:52.125
THE SAME WAY THEY EXPECT WATER

14:52.125 --> 14:53.826
FROM A FAUCET OR POWER FROM AN

14:53.826 --> 14:54.927
ELECTRICAL OUTLET, MUCH LIKE A

14:54.927 --> 14:56.829
PUBLIC UTILITY.

14:56.829 --> 14:59.132
>> IN AMERICA, WE'RE IN THIS

14:59.132 --> 15:00.733
WEIRD MOMENT, WHERE ALTHOUGH IT

15:00.733 --> 15:02.268
FEELS LIKE A UTILITY TO MOST

15:02.268 --> 15:03.603
AMERICANS, AND THEY NEED, THEY

15:03.603 --> 15:04.570
KNOW THEY CAN'T HAVE A HOUSE

15:04.570 --> 15:05.505
WITHOUT IT OR BUSINESS WITHOUT

15:05.505 --> 15:06.773
IT.

15:06.773 --> 15:07.707
IT'S A LUXURY THAT ACTUALLY IS A

15:07.707 --> 15:09.242
UTILITY.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.676
>> Sreenivasan: A LUXURY, SHE

15:10.676 --> 15:12.612
SAYS, BECAUSE A HANDFUL OF

15:12.612 --> 15:14.347
INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS, LIKE

15:14.347 --> 15:15.882
TIME WARNER AND COMCAST, HAVE

15:15.882 --> 15:17.316
CORNERED THE MARKET ON

15:17.316 --> 15:18.951
BROADBAND, LEAVING CUSTOMERS

15:18.951 --> 15:20.887
WITH FEWER CHOICES AND HIGHER

15:20.887 --> 15:21.888
PRICES-- ON AVERAGE $30 AND $60

15:21.888 --> 15:23.589
A MONTH.

15:23.589 --> 15:24.757
>> THAT'S HAPPENED BECAUSE OF A

15:24.757 --> 15:25.792
LACK OF REGULATION.

15:25.792 --> 15:27.493
DOESN'T HAPPEN BY MAGIC.

15:27.493 --> 15:28.861
IT HAPPENS BECAUSE IT'S IN THEIR

15:28.861 --> 15:30.062
INTERESTS TO CONTROL MARKETS AND

15:30.062 --> 15:31.831
REAP STEADY PROFITS.

15:31.831 --> 15:33.366
>> Sreenivasan: ALTHOUGH THE

15:33.366 --> 15:34.567
FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS

15:34.567 --> 15:35.968
COMMISSION OFFICIALLY CLASSIFIED

15:35.968 --> 15:37.703
BROADBAND INTERNET AS A PUBLIC

15:37.703 --> 15:39.372
UTILITY THIS PAST FEBRUARY, IT

15:39.372 --> 15:40.973
SAID THAT IT WOULD NOT GET

15:40.973 --> 15:42.675
INVOLVED WITH PRICING DECISIONS.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.544
BUT THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.179
SEVERAL U.S. CITIES ARE NOW

15:46.179 --> 15:47.713
OFFERING THEIR OWN PUBLICLY-

15:47.713 --> 15:49.348
FUNDED BROADBAND SERVICES--

15:49.348 --> 15:51.250
CITIES LIKE CHATTANOOGA,

15:51.250 --> 15:52.718
TENNESSEE, WILSON, NORTH

15:52.718 --> 15:54.387
CAROLINA, BRISTOL, VIRGINIA,

15:54.387 --> 15:55.588
LAFAYETTE, LOUISIANA, AND CEDAR

15:55.588 --> 15:57.390
FALLS, IOWA.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.158
THE HOPE IS THAT THESE SERVICES

15:59.158 --> 16:00.660
WILL ATTRACT NEW BUSINESSES AND

16:00.660 --> 16:02.161
EXPAND INTERNET ACCESS TO MORE

16:02.161 --> 16:03.196
PEOPLE ACROSS THE ECONOMIC

16:03.196 --> 16:04.630
SPECTRUM.

16:04.630 --> 16:05.832
BUT THERE ARE SOME WHO ARE

16:05.832 --> 16:07.767
CRITICAL OF THIS NEW MODEL.

16:07.767 --> 16:10.069
>> WHEN GOVERNMENTS GO INTO

16:10.069 --> 16:11.604
BUSINESS AND COMPETE WITH THE

16:11.604 --> 16:13.940
PRIVATE SECTOR, IT'S JUST NOT

16:13.940 --> 16:15.007
THEIR, IT'S JUST NOT THEIR

16:15.007 --> 16:16.375
FORTE.

16:16.375 --> 16:17.677
>> Sreenivasan: JEFF EISENACH IS

16:17.677 --> 16:19.111
WITH THE AMERICAN ENTERPRISE

16:19.111 --> 16:20.379
INSTITUTE AND STUDIES POLICIES

16:20.379 --> 16:21.547
THAT AFFECT THE INFORMATION

16:21.547 --> 16:23.082
TECHNOLOGY SECTOR.

16:23.082 --> 16:24.517
HE SAYS THAT, ALTHOUGH THE

16:24.517 --> 16:25.818
GOVERNMENT CAN PLAY A ROLE IN

16:25.818 --> 16:27.220
BRINGING INTERNET ACCESS TO

16:27.220 --> 16:28.588
POORER AMERICANS, PUBLIC

16:28.588 --> 16:30.156
BROADBAND SERVICES CAN'T KEEP UP

16:30.156 --> 16:31.424
WITH THE INNOVATION THAT THE

16:31.424 --> 16:32.525
PRIVATE BROADBAND INDUSTRY

16:32.525 --> 16:33.793
OFFERS.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.494
>> THE LARGEST INVESTORS IN THE

16:35.494 --> 16:37.196
UNITED STATES TODAY, ARE

16:37.196 --> 16:38.798
AMERICA'S BROADBAND COMPANIES.

16:38.798 --> 16:40.499
THEY'RE AT&T AND VERIZON ARE

16:40.499 --> 16:41.834
ALWAYS ON THE TOP, LITERALLY,

16:41.834 --> 16:43.135
THE TOP OF THE LIST THAT THE

16:43.135 --> 16:44.303
COMPANIES SPENDING THE MOST

16:44.303 --> 16:44.904
MONEY.

16:44.904 --> 16:45.671
WHAT YOU DON'T WANT IS

16:45.671 --> 16:46.939
GOVERNMENT COMING IN AND

16:46.939 --> 16:48.441
REPLACING ALL OF THE INNOVATION,

16:48.441 --> 16:49.809
ALL OF THE DYNAMISM, ALL OF THE

16:49.809 --> 16:51.244
GROWTH, ALL OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL

16:51.244 --> 16:52.712
PROGRESS THAT WE'RE SEEING

16:52.712 --> 16:53.813
THROUGHOUT THE INTERNET,

16:53.813 --> 16:54.747
INCLUDING IN THE BROADBAND

16:54.747 --> 16:55.681
MARKET.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.283
>> Sreenivasan: FOR HER PART,

16:57.283 --> 16:58.751
MAYA WILEY SAYS THAT WHILE A

16:58.751 --> 17:00.453
PUBLIC BROADBAND MODEL ISN'T

17:00.453 --> 17:02.188
REALISTIC FOR NEW YORK, THE CITY

17:02.188 --> 17:03.556
CAN PLAY A ROLE IN BRINGING FREE

17:03.556 --> 17:05.157
INTERNET TO ITS POORER

17:05.157 --> 17:06.525
RESIDENTS, AS WELL AS BRINGING

17:06.525 --> 17:07.627
DOWN THE COST.

17:07.627 --> 17:08.794
>> WE ARE THE LARGEST CITY IN

17:08.794 --> 17:09.929
THE COUNTRY AND ONE OF THE MOST

17:09.929 --> 17:10.763
DIVERSE.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.198
THAT MEANS WE CAN'T JUST SIMPLY

17:12.198 --> 17:13.766
REPLICATE A MODEL FROM

17:13.766 --> 17:14.934
CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE, EVEN

17:14.934 --> 17:16.202
THOUGH IT'S A WONDERFUL MODEL,

17:16.202 --> 17:17.770
WE'RE JUST VERY DIFFERENT.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.205
WHEN WE TAKE OUR PAY PHONES AND

17:19.205 --> 17:20.640
TURN THEM INTO WIRELESS HOT

17:20.640 --> 17:22.174
SPOTS, AND THEY'RE FREE HOT

17:22.174 --> 17:23.676
SPOTS, THAT IS A FORM OF

17:23.676 --> 17:25.077
COMPETITION FOR, SAY, TIME

17:25.077 --> 17:26.512
WARNER CABLE THAT HAS

17:26.512 --> 17:28.214
SUBSCRIBERS THAT PAY MONEY FOR

17:28.214 --> 17:29.548
WIRELESS SERVICE, RIGHT?

17:29.548 --> 17:30.883
THAT SHOULD HELP CREATE SOME

17:30.883 --> 17:33.085
PRICE PRESSURE DOWNWARD.

17:33.085 --> 17:34.220
>> Sreenivasan: WILEY SAYS

17:34.220 --> 17:35.087
THERE'S NO ONE-SIZE-FITS ALL

17:35.087 --> 17:36.255
SOLUTION.

17:36.255 --> 17:37.590
THE CITY IS LOOKING TO EXPAND

17:37.590 --> 17:38.991
RED HOOK'S WIRELESS MESH PROGRAM

17:38.991 --> 17:40.660
TO OTHER COMMUNITIES.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.461
WILEY'S TEAM ALSO PLANS ON

17:42.461 --> 17:43.996
WORKING WITH PRIVATE COMPANIES

17:43.996 --> 17:45.598
TO CREATE MORE FREE WIRELESS, AS

17:45.598 --> 17:47.099
IT DID WITH SPRINT FOR THE

17:47.099 --> 17:48.734
LIBRARY HOTSPOTS.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.469
KAREN BEEN AND HER SONS HAVE HAD

17:50.469 --> 17:52.305
THE DEVICE NOW FOR FOUR MONTHS.

17:52.305 --> 17:53.806
SHE RECENTLY STARTED TAKING

17:53.806 --> 17:55.675
E.M.T. TRAINING CLASSES, AND NOW

17:55.675 --> 17:57.243
THAT SHE HAS INTERNET IN THE

17:57.243 --> 17:58.511
HOUSE, SHE CAN EASILY DO HER

17:58.511 --> 18:00.179
ASSIGNMENTS ONLINE.

18:00.179 --> 18:01.714
SHE'S HOPING THAT INTERNET

18:01.714 --> 18:03.049
ACCESS WILL GIVE HER THE EDGE

18:03.049 --> 18:04.784
SHE NEEDS TO PASS HER

18:04.784 --> 18:06.352
CERTIFICATION TEST IN JUNE AND,

18:06.352 --> 18:08.421
WITH ANY LUCK, TO FIND A JOB.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.289
>> IT WOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE TO

18:10.289 --> 18:11.724
PAY 50, 60, $70 A MONTH FOR

18:11.724 --> 18:12.825
HIGH-SPEED INTERNET.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.527
DEFINITELY NOT.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.495
SO HAVING ACCESS TO THE WEB AT

18:16.495 --> 18:18.364
HOME ALLOWS ME TO LOOK FOR

18:18.364 --> 18:21.767
EMPLOYMENT MORE FREELY.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.035
>> Sreenivasan: BEEN IS HOPEFUL

18:23.035 --> 18:24.503
THAT THE CITY'S WIRELESS WILL

18:24.503 --> 18:25.571
SOON OPEN DOORS FOR HER AND HER

18:25.571 --> 18:31.944
SONS.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.980

18:33.980 --> 18:34.847
PRICE AND SPEED OF INTERNET IN

18:34.847 --> 18:35.648
THE U.S. COMPARES TO THE REST OF

18:44.824 --> 18:46.559
YESTERDAY'S PROGRAM ABOUT

18:46.559 --> 18:48.127
ISRAEL'S WATER SURPLUS, WE SAID

18:48.127 --> 18:49.695
THAT UNDER A 1994 AGREEMENT,

18:49.695 --> 18:51.130
ISRAEL SUPPLIES SOME WATER TO

18:51.130 --> 18:52.665
JORDAN AT NO COST.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.233
HOWEVER, ISRAEL DOES CHARGE

18:54.233 --> 18:55.868
JORDAN FOR THE OPERATING COSTS

18:55.868 --> 18:57.069
OF SUPPLYING THAT WATER.

18:57.069 --> 19:09.248
WE REGRET THE ERROR.

19:09.248 --> 19:10.383
>> Stewart: THE "WASHINGTON

19:10.383 --> 19:11.617

19:11.617 --> 19:12.985
STARTLING HEALTH CRISIS IN THIS

19:12.985 --> 19:14.387
COUNTRY: THE NUMBER OF WOMEN IN

19:14.387 --> 19:16.088
THE U.S. WHO DIE IN CHILDBIRTH

19:16.088 --> 19:17.656
IS NEARING THE HIGHEST RATE IN A

19:17.656 --> 19:20.459
QUARTER-CENTURY.

19:20.459 --> 19:22.561
AN ESTIMATED 18.5 MOTHERS DIED

FOR EVERY 100,000 BIRTHS IN

2013, COMPARED WITH 7.2 IN 1987.

19:28.134 --> 19:29.969
THE POST REPORTS THAT THIS

19:29.969 --> 19:31.704
TRANSLATES TO "...A WOMAN

19:31.704 --> 19:33.472
GIVING BIRTH HERE IS TWICE AS

19:33.472 --> 19:35.107
LIKELY TO DIE THAN IN SAUDI

19:35.107 --> 19:36.575
ARABIA AND THREE TIMES AS LIKELY

19:44.517 --> 19:45.584
>> Stewart: IN YOUR PIECE,

19:45.584 --> 19:46.352
THERE IS A STARTLING LINE AND I

19:46.352 --> 19:47.820
AM JUST GOING READ IT, IT SAYS

19:47.820 --> 19:49.622
THE UNITED STATES IS THE ONLY

19:49.622 --> 19:52.425
ADVANCED ECONOMY IN THE WORLD

19:52.425 --> 19:53.692
WITH RISING MATERNAL MORTALITY

19:53.692 --> 19:54.760
RATES.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.395
WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY

19:56.395 --> 19:58.330
AS OPPOSED TO OTHER ADVANCED

19:58.330 --> 19:59.432
ECONOMIES THAT IS CAUSING THIS

19:59.432 --> 20:00.633
PROBLEM?

20:00.633 --> 20:02.501
>> WELL, OFTEN THIS PROBLEM

20:02.501 --> 20:04.070
CONFOUNDS A LOT IN THE MEDICAL

20:04.070 --> 20:05.037
COMMUNITY.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.239
THERE IS NOT ONE THING DRAGGING

20:07.239 --> 20:08.607
THE PROBLEM.

20:08.607 --> 20:10.743
EXPERTS, I HAVE SPOKE TO TELL ME

20:10.743 --> 20:12.278
THAT SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY

20:12.278 --> 20:14.613
THERE IS -- THERE ARE GAPS IN

20:14.613 --> 20:15.648
HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE,

20:15.648 --> 20:17.083
ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTH.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.151
FOR EXAMPLE, IN MISSISSIPPI, ONE

20:19.151 --> 20:21.420
OF THE HIGHEST MATERNAL

20:21.420 --> 20:23.456
MORTALITY RATES, THAT THE STATE

20:23.456 --> 20:26.425
DID NOT EXPAND MEDICAID OR

20:26.425 --> 20:27.359
SOMETHING LIKE 100,000 PEOPLE

20:27.359 --> 20:30.496
WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ANY

20:30.496 --> 20:33.165
HEALTHCARE, AND MANY OF THEM ARE

20:33.165 --> 20:36.969
WOMEN, YOU HAVE IN MISSISSIPPI

20:36.969 --> 20:39.638
160 DOCTORS, 100,000 RESIDENTS,

20:39.638 --> 20:40.673
THAT DRIVES PART OF THIS

20:40.673 --> 20:41.407
PROBLEM.

20:41.407 --> 20:42.441
>> Stewart: ONE OF THE

20:42.441 --> 20:43.476
INTERESTING THINGS IN YOUR

20:43.476 --> 20:45.878
PIECE IS THAT THE PROBLEMS ARE

20:45.878 --> 20:47.913
DESCRIBED AS PREVENTABLE.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.448
SO WHAT IS STOPPING PEOPLE FROM

20:49.448 --> 20:49.949
PREVENTING THEM?

20:49.949 --> 20:52.818
>> WELL, SOME DOCTORS SAY IT IS

20:52.818 --> 20:54.353
SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS GETTING A

20:54.353 --> 20:56.055
ROUTINE CHECKUP.

20:56.055 --> 20:58.657
SO MANY WOMEN LACK ACCESS TO

20:58.657 --> 21:00.493
HEALTHCARE, ESPECIALLY IN THE

21:00.493 --> 21:02.061
SOUTH, AND SO MAYBE JUST SOME OF

21:02.061 --> 21:03.596
THE SIMPLE GOING TO THAT DOCTOR

21:03.596 --> 21:05.731
AND SAYING, HEY, SOMETHING

21:05.731 --> 21:06.966
DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

21:06.966 --> 21:09.268
HELP ME OUT.

21:09.268 --> 21:12.771
ANOTHER THING, OFFICIAL REASON

21:12.771 --> 21:14.874
OFTENTIMES DOCTORS WILL SEE

21:14.874 --> 21:17.543
WOMEN, WOMEN MIGHT SAY SOMETHING

21:17.543 --> 21:18.777
IS OFF, SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT

21:18.777 --> 21:20.513
AND PHYSICIANS MAY WRITE THAT

21:20.513 --> 21:23.149
OFF AS STRESS OR PERHAPS JUST

21:23.149 --> 21:26.852
PARANOIA, AND THAT, AND NURSES

21:26.852 --> 21:30.089
SAY MAY GO HOME AND THEN SHE MAY

21:30.089 --> 21:32.124
ENTER PREMATURE LABOR AND START

21:32.124 --> 21:32.992
BLEEDING, IF SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN

21:32.992 --> 21:35.194
AT THE HOSPITAL AT THE TIME OF

21:35.194 --> 21:37.062
THIS, THAT COULD POSSIBLY HAVE

21:37.062 --> 21:37.730
SAVED HER LIFE.

21:37.730 --> 21:38.764
>> Stewart: THIS MAKES ME

21:38.764 --> 21:41.800
THINK THAT THIS IS JUST A VERY

21:41.800 --> 21:44.870
STARK EXAMPLE OF THE BIGGER

21:44.870 --> 21:47.239
ISSUE OF THAT CERTAIN POPULATION

21:47.239 --> 21:48.240
MS. THIS COUNTRY BASED ON

21:48.240 --> 21:50.376
WHETHER IT IS RACE OR BASED ON

21:50.376 --> 21:52.478
ECONOMIC STANDING HAVE BETTER

21:52.478 --> 21:53.612
ACCESS TO BETTER HEALTHCARE.

21:53.612 --> 21:58.250
>> IT IS INCREDIBLE TO SEE THE

21:58.250 --> 21:59.985
NUMBERS, IT IS VERY DRASTIC, IN

21:59.985 --> 22:01.487
SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY

22:01.487 --> 22:02.421
AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN ARE

22:02.421 --> 22:05.958
NEARLY TWICE AS LIKELY TO DIE OF

22:05.958 --> 22:07.993
PREGNANCY RELATED COMPLICATIONS.

SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE'S CECILY

22:40.759 --> 22:41.961
STRONG TOOK A SATURDAY NIGHT OFF

22:41.961 --> 22:42.895
TO HOST THE EVENT.

22:42.895 --> 22:43.762
>> HILLARY'S CAMPAIGN SLOGAN IS

22:43.762 --> 22:44.630
IT'S YOUR TIME, WHICH I ASSUME

22:44.630 --> 22:45.764
IS WHAT SHE SAYS INTO A MIRROR

22:45.764 --> 22:54.440
AS SHE DEADLIFTS 200 POUNDS

22:54.440 --> 22:56.242
THAT'S "RAND," LIKE HE DIDN'T

23:04.283 --> 23:05.584
>> I'LL BET WHEN THE PRESIDENT

23:05.584 --> 23:06.919
WALKED IN AND SAW ALL THOSE

23:06.919 --> 23:08.087
BELLHOPS HE SAID, "FINALLY SOME

23:08.087 --> 23:12.191
DECENT SECURITY."

23:12.191 --> 23:13.626
>> Stewart: THE PRESIDENT SPARED

23:13.626 --> 23:15.361
NO ONE, INCLUDING HIMSELF, WITH

23:15.361 --> 23:16.895
JOKES ON EVERYTHING FROM HIS

23:16.895 --> 23:18.330
EXECUTIVE ACTIONS TO FOREIGN

23:18.330 --> 23:19.965
RELATIONS.

23:19.965 --> 23:21.700
>> I LOOK SO OLD, JOHN BOEHNER

23:21.700 --> 23:22.901
HAS ALREADY INVITED NETANYAHU TO

23:22.901 --> 23:26.038

23:33.345 --> 23:35.080
ALL WHILE FINDING TIME TO PRAY

23:35.080 --> 23:37.316

23:37.316 --> 23:38.217
(LAUGHTER)

23:38.217 --> 23:40.552
>> Stewart: THE PRESIDENT CAME

23:45.658 --> 23:47.493
I'M THE WORST PRESIDENT OF HIS

23:47.493 --> 23:49.728
LIFETIME.

23:49.728 --> 23:50.929
WHICH IS INTERESTING, BECAUSE I

23:50.929 --> 23:52.431
THINK DICK CHENEY IS THE WORST

23:52.431 --> 23:56.835
PRESIDENT OF MY LIFETIME.

23:56.835 --> 23:58.470
>> Stewart: BUT HE DIDN'T LET

23:58.470 --> 23:59.405
DEMOCRATS OFF THE HOOK.

23:59.405 --> 24:00.406
>> TODAY, THANKS TO OBAMACARE,

24:00.406 --> 24:01.640

24:04.276 --> 24:04.943
YOU'RE WELCOME, SENATE

24:04.943 --> 24:10.582
DEMOCRATS.

24:24.563 --> 24:25.364
>> BEFORE WE LEAVE YOU TONIGHT

24:25.364 --> 24:28.267
WE RETURN TO OUR LEAD STORY FROM

24:28.267 --> 24:28.767
NEPAL.

24:28.767 --> 24:31.704

24:31.704 --> 24:33.672
IN IN, ARE IN URGENT NEED OF

24:33.672 --> 24:34.606
HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANT BECAUSE

24:34.606 --> 24:36.742

24:50.055 --> 24:51.423
ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE CASE.

24:51.423 --> 24:53.192
>> ONE REASON WHY MARRIAGE

24:53.192 --> 24:55.327
EQUALITY IS SO IMPORTANT TO US

24:55.327 --> 24:57.896
IS SO OUR KIDS CAN BE LEGALLY

24:57.896 --> 24:58.731
BOTH OF OURS.

24:58.731 --> 25:00.733
>> THESE ARE NOT POLITICALLY.

25:00.733 --> 25:02.167
>> THEY SHOULD BE TREATED FAIRLY

25:02.167 --> 25:03.535
THERE IS NO QUESTION AMOUNT THAT

25:03.535 --> 25:04.737
BUT TO BE TREATED FAIRLY DOES

25:04.737 --> 25:06.505
NOT REQUIRE YOU TO CHANGE THE

25:06.505 --> 25:07.973
DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE.

25:07.973 --> 25:08.974
>> Stewart: THAT'S IT FOR THIS
