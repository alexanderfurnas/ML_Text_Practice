07:01.855 --> 07:03.323
BEHIND THAT HAS BEEN RETAILERS.

07:03.323 --> 07:05.659
SO, A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE TAKEN UP

07:05.659 --> 07:07.661
EMPLOYMENT IN THESE FIELDS, AND

07:07.661 --> 07:08.995
SO NOW THAT WE MIGHT BE SEEING

07:08.995 --> 07:10.463
SOME WAGE GROWTH BY THE LEADERS

07:10.463 --> 07:12.232
IN THOSE AREAS, THAT COULD

07:12.232 --> 07:13.500
TRANSLATE INTO BETTER CONSUMER

07:13.500 --> 07:14.334
SPENDING.

07:14.334 --> 07:15.869
BUT IT MIGHT NOT HAVE A HUGE

07:15.869 --> 07:17.137
IMPACT ON THE OVERALL WAGE

07:17.137 --> 07:18.171
GROWTH BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO KEEP

07:18.171 --> 07:19.673
IN MIND THESE ARE LOW-WAGE JOBS,

07:19.673 --> 07:22.242
OFTEN $8, $10, $12 AN HOUR.

07:22.242 --> 07:23.243
>> Sreenivasan: HOW DOES THAT

07:23.243 --> 07:24.711
COMPARE WITH WHAT THE COST OF

07:24.711 --> 07:25.979
LIVING OR THE CONSUMER PRICE

07:25.979 --> 07:27.614
INDEX IS THESE DAYS?

07:27.614 --> 07:31.251
>> WELL, ONE GOOD NOTE: WAGES

07:31.251 --> 07:33.620
HAVE BEEN GROWING ABOUT 2.2%

07:33.620 --> 07:34.954
OVER THE PAST YEAR, ACCORDING TO

07:34.954 --> 07:36.656
YESTERDAY'S JOBS REPORT.

07:36.656 --> 07:38.291
AT THE SAME TIME, CONSUMER

07:38.291 --> 07:40.493
PRICES, THANKS TO FALLING OIL,

07:40.493 --> 07:42.896
HAS BEEN BARELY MOVING AHEAD AT

07:42.896 --> 07:43.296
ALL.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.598
SO, THESE WAGE INCREASES SHOULD

07:45.598 --> 07:47.801
FEEL REAL TO CONSUMERS, SO IT IS

07:47.801 --> 07:48.535
A HELP.

07:48.535 --> 07:49.336
>> Sreenivasan: OKAY, AND THEN,

07:49.336 --> 07:50.837
HOW DOES THIS FIT IN THIS LARGER

07:50.837 --> 07:51.271
PICTURE?

07:51.271 --> 07:52.639
YOU MENTIONED THE PRICE OF OIL.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.174
WHEN THE PRICE OF OIL GOES DOWN,

07:54.174 --> 07:55.275
PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE MORE

07:55.275 --> 07:56.343
MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS.

07:56.343 --> 07:58.378
IS THAT THE REASON THEY GO OUT

07:58.378 --> 07:59.579
TO RESTAURANTS, AND THEN THAT'S

07:59.579 --> 08:00.847
THE REASON THE RESTAURANTS HAVE

08:00.847 --> 08:01.848
TO HIRE MORE WORKERS?

08:01.848 --> 08:03.917
I MEAN, HOW DOES IT ALL CONNECT?

08:03.917 --> 08:04.818
>> YEAH, THERE'S DEFINITELY A

08:04.818 --> 08:05.685
CONNECTION THERE.

08:05.685 --> 08:06.686
I MEAN, RESTAURANTS HAVE BEEN

08:06.686 --> 08:08.822
ONE AREA, ONE OF THE FEW AREAS

08:08.822 --> 08:10.423
WITHIN CONSUMER SPENDING THAT

08:10.423 --> 08:11.858
WE'VE REALLY SEEN STRONG GROWTH

08:11.858 --> 08:14.828
WITH THE FALL IN OIL PRICES.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.129
IT HASN'T QUITE TRANSLATED TO

08:16.129 --> 08:18.565
OTHER AREAS LIKE YOUR GENERAL

08:18.565 --> 08:19.933
MERCHANDISE STORES YET.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.301
SO, THAT'S THE CONNECTION,

08:21.301 --> 08:22.469
THEN-- PEOPLE FEEL A LITTLE BIT

08:22.469 --> 08:24.003
BETTER AND THEN MAYBE GO OUT AND

08:24.003 --> 08:25.271
SPEND.

08:25.271 --> 08:26.973
BUT THE CONSUMERS ARE STILL

08:26.973 --> 08:27.507
CAUTIOUS.

08:27.507 --> 08:28.708
WE ARE SEEING THE HIGHEST

08:28.708 --> 08:30.410
SAVINGS RATES IN SEVERAL YEARS,

08:30.410 --> 08:31.644
AND WE'VE SEEN, SINCE THE

08:31.644 --> 08:33.413
HOLIDAY SEASON, NOT PARTICULARLY

08:33.413 --> 08:34.781
ROBUST OVERALL CONSUMER

08:34.781 --> 08:35.148
SPENDING.

08:35.148 --> 08:36.583
SO, I THINK THERE'S STILL A

08:36.583 --> 08:38.518
SENSE THAT, YOU KNOW, AFTER THE

08:38.518 --> 08:39.886
DEEP RECESSION, PEOPLE JUST

08:39.886 --> 08:41.521
AREN'T WILLING TO OPEN UP THEIR

08:41.521 --> 08:42.789
WALLETS QUITE AS FAR.

08:42.789 --> 08:43.556
>> Sreenivasan: AND THEN, HOW DO

08:43.556 --> 08:45.392
THESE NUMBERS ABOUT WAGE

08:45.392 --> 08:47.594
INCREASES CONNECT TO THIS

08:47.594 --> 08:49.295
OVERALL JOB CREATION REPORT,

08:49.295 --> 08:50.764
BECAUSE THIS IS ALL THE JOBS

08:50.764 --> 08:51.664
THAT ARE CREATED, NOT

08:51.664 --> 08:53.066
NECESSARILY JUST LOW-WAGE JOBS,

08:53.066 --> 08:53.733
RIGHT?

08:53.733 --> 08:55.135
>> OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.103
SO, WE HAD BEEN SEEING A QUITE

08:57.103 --> 09:00.073
ROBUST JOB GROWTH BEFORE MARCH,

09:00.073 --> 09:01.674
THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTHS.

09:01.674 --> 09:02.809
WE'D SEEN THE STRONGEST JOB

09:02.809 --> 09:04.577
CREATION ON A MONTHLY AVERAGE

09:04.577 --> 09:06.513
SINCE THE 1990s.

09:06.513 --> 09:08.081
SO, CERTAINLY, THAT WAS QUITE

09:08.081 --> 09:09.182
STRONG.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.116
WE HAD A STEP-BACK IN MARCH.

09:10.116 --> 09:10.884
THAT COULD BE FOR A NUMBER OF

09:10.884 --> 09:12.485
REASONS, INCLUDING, YOU KNOW, A

09:12.485 --> 09:15.622
STRONGER DOLLAR REDUCING

09:15.622 --> 09:17.056
EXPORTS.

09:17.056 --> 09:18.925
AND THERE'S AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN

09:18.925 --> 09:21.361
IN ASIA AND PARTS OF EUROPE, AND

09:21.361 --> 09:22.495
THAT MIGHT JUST BE CAUSING

09:22.495 --> 09:23.763
BUSINESSES TO BE A LITTLE BIT

09:23.763 --> 09:24.531
CAUTIOUS.

09:24.531 --> 09:26.466
THE TREND FOR JOBS IS STILL UP.

09:26.466 --> 09:27.934
WE EXPECT TO SEE WAGES

09:27.934 --> 09:30.136
ACCELERATE IF WE CONTINUE TO BE

09:30.136 --> 09:30.904
ADDING JOBS AT THE PACE WE HAD

09:30.904 --> 09:32.105
BEEN BEFORE LAST MONTH.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.540
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT, ERIC

09:33.540 --> 09:34.374
MORATH OF THE "WALL STREET

09:34.374 --> 09:35.141
JOURNAL" JOINING US FROM

09:35.141 --> 09:36.242
WASHINGTON, THANKS SO MUCH.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.677
>> SURE, ANY TIME.

09:47.787 --> 09:48.621
>> Sreenivasan: YOU'VE PROBABLY

09:48.621 --> 09:50.390
READ STORIES FOR YEARS NOW ABOUT

09:50.390 --> 09:51.591
HOW YOUNG GIRLS ARE INFLUENCED

09:51.591 --> 09:53.626
BY THE ADVERTISEMENTS THAT THEY

09:53.626 --> 09:55.195
SEE FEATURING ULTRA-THIN

09:55.195 --> 09:57.197
MODELS-- ADS, EXPERTS BELIEVE,

09:57.197 --> 09:59.065
THAT MAY MAKE THEM MORE

09:59.065 --> 10:00.934
SUSCEPTIBLE TO EATING DISORDERS

10:00.934 --> 10:02.135
LIKE ANOREXIA.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.603
NOW, THE FRENCH ARE TAKING NEW

10:03.603 --> 10:05.505
STEPS TO FIX THE PROBLEM.

10:05.505 --> 10:06.272
FOR MORE ABOUT THIS, WE ARE

10:06.272 --> 10:07.740
JOINED NOW VIA SKYPE FROM PARIS

10:07.740 --> 10:08.842
BY ALISSA RUBIN OF THE "NEW YORK

10:08.842 --> 10:09.442
TIMES."

10:09.442 --> 10:10.310
SHE HAS BEEN COVERING THE STORY.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.678
SO, THEY'RE PROPOSING A LAW.

10:11.678 --> 10:13.313
WHAT'S IN THE LAW?

10:13.313 --> 10:14.347
>> WELL, THERE ARE A VARIETY OF

10:14.347 --> 10:15.215
MEASURES.

10:15.215 --> 10:18.318
THE ONE THAT'S PROBABLY GOTTEN

10:18.318 --> 10:20.386
THE MOST ATTENTION IS A

10:20.386 --> 10:22.589
REQUIREMENT THAT MODELS WOULD

10:22.589 --> 10:23.957
HAVE TO PRESENT A DOCTOR'S

10:23.957 --> 10:25.325
CERTIFICATE SAYING THAT THEY

10:25.325 --> 10:26.593
WERE AT A HEALTHY ENOUGH WEIGHT

10:26.593 --> 10:27.627
TO WORK.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.430
AND ANYONE EMPLOYING MODELS WHO

10:30.430 --> 10:31.731
WAS EMPLOYING PEOPLE WITHOUT

10:31.731 --> 10:33.566
SUCH A CERTIFICATE WOULD BE

10:33.566 --> 10:35.768
PENALIZED, BOTH FINANCIALLY AND

10:35.768 --> 10:37.470
POTENTIALLY WITH SIX MONTHS IN

10:37.470 --> 10:38.071
JAIL.

10:38.071 --> 10:39.072
>> Sreenivasan: AND WHAT WOULD

10:39.072 --> 10:40.206
BE CONSIDERED HEALTHY?

10:40.206 --> 10:41.140
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER

10:41.140 --> 10:42.141
PROVISIONS?

10:42.141 --> 10:44.077
>> SOME OF THE OTHER PROVISIONS

10:44.077 --> 10:46.012
ARE ACTUALLY QUITE INTERESTING.

10:46.012 --> 10:47.981
ONE OF THEM IS... OUTLAWS

10:47.981 --> 10:50.683
INTERNET SITES THAT ENCOURAGE

10:50.683 --> 10:52.886
ANOREXIA, AND THAT'S SOMETHING

10:52.886 --> 10:54.454
THAT'S NOT MUCH TALKED ABOUT BUT

10:54.454 --> 10:55.955
THERE ARE SUCH SITES.

10:55.955 --> 10:57.690
THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF THEM, I

10:57.690 --> 10:59.592
DON'T THINK, BUT THEY ARE

10:59.592 --> 11:03.062
CERTAINLY DISTURBING TO LOOK AT.

11:03.062 --> 11:05.198
AND THEN, A THIRD PROVISION

11:05.198 --> 11:07.400
WOULD ACTUALLY REQUIRE THAT ALL

11:07.400 --> 11:12.839
PHOTOGRAPHS OF... WHICH SHOW

11:12.839 --> 11:15.041
MODELS' BODIES, IF THEY HAD BEEN

11:15.041 --> 11:18.278
RETOUCHED EITHER TO MAKE THE

11:18.278 --> 11:21.180
FIGURE-- THE FRENCH WORD IS

11:21.180 --> 11:24.484
SILHOUETTE-- LOOK HEAVIER OR

11:24.484 --> 11:26.686
THINNER THAN IT REALLY IS, THE

11:26.686 --> 11:28.888
PHOTO WOULD HAVE TO BE LABELED.

11:28.888 --> 11:31.524
SO, IT'S THREE QUITE SIGNIFICANT

11:31.524 --> 11:34.761
PROVISIONS, AND WE'LL SEE IF

11:34.761 --> 11:36.429
THEY PASS THE FRENCH SENATE,

11:36.429 --> 11:38.498
WHICH IS THE NEXT BODY THAT WILL

11:38.498 --> 11:39.666
HAVE TO LOOK AT IT.

11:39.666 --> 11:40.967
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT'S THE

11:40.967 --> 11:42.302
MODELING INDUSTRY OR THE FASHION

11:42.302 --> 11:44.504
INDUSTRY HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS?

11:44.504 --> 11:45.772
>> WELL, IT'S QUITE INTERESTING.

11:45.772 --> 11:47.307
THE FASHION INDUSTRY, THE BIG

11:47.307 --> 11:48.641
FASHION HOUSES-- OF WHICH, AS

11:48.641 --> 11:49.943
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

11:49.943 --> 11:52.245
THEM HERE-- HAVE BEEN PUBLICLY

11:52.245 --> 11:54.447
VERY QUIET ABOUT IT.

11:54.447 --> 11:55.982
BUT THE UNION OF MODELING

11:55.982 --> 11:57.750
AGENCIES HAS SPOKEN UP, AND THEY

11:57.750 --> 11:59.285
FEEL THE WAY THE LAW HAS BEEN

11:59.285 --> 12:03.523
DRAFTED IS VERY UNFAIR AND

12:03.523 --> 12:04.490
INACCURATE.

12:04.490 --> 12:06.826
THE BASIS ON WHICH THE LAW IS...

12:06.826 --> 12:10.229
BEEN DONE IS THE... WHAT'S

12:10.229 --> 12:12.332
CALLED THE BODY MASS INDEX,

12:12.332 --> 12:14.067
WHICH IS AN INTERNATIONALLY USED

12:14.067 --> 12:14.801
INDEX.

12:14.801 --> 12:17.604
AND THERE'S A WEIGHT RANGE FOR

12:17.604 --> 12:19.472
NORMAL WEIGHT, FOR OVERWEIGHT,

12:19.472 --> 12:22.775
FOR OBESITY AND FOR UNDERWEIGHT.

12:22.775 --> 12:24.811
AND ALL MODELS WOULD HAVE TO BE

12:24.811 --> 12:27.947
AT LEAST WITHIN THE NORMAL

12:27.947 --> 12:29.248
WEIGHT, NOT THE UNDERWEIGHT

12:29.248 --> 12:30.083
RANGE.

12:30.083 --> 12:30.850
>> Sreenivasan: ANY DIFFERENCE

12:30.850 --> 12:31.985
BETWEEN THE FRENCH AND AMERICAN

12:31.985 --> 12:33.820
SENSIBILITIES ABOUT THIS?

12:33.820 --> 12:35.188
>> NO, I THINK, ACTUALLY, THE

12:35.188 --> 12:36.556
SENSIBILITIES ARE FAIRLY

12:36.556 --> 12:38.925
SIMILAR, BUT THE PHILOSOPHY OF

12:38.925 --> 12:40.860
GOVERNMENT IS QUITE DIFFERENT.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.495
THE FRENCH ARE QUITE WILLING TO

12:42.495 --> 12:45.098
REGULATE VERY EXTENSIVELY AND IN

12:45.098 --> 12:46.833
GREAT DETAIL MANY ASPECTS OF

12:46.833 --> 12:51.371
LIFE AND... AND USE THE POWERS

12:51.371 --> 12:53.206
OF GOVERNMENT TO DO THAT, AND

12:53.206 --> 12:54.941
AMERICANS ARE MUCH MORE

12:54.941 --> 12:56.309
RELUCTANT TO REGULATE.

12:56.309 --> 12:57.243
I THINK, ON THIS, THEY'RE

12:57.243 --> 12:58.611
WILLING TO BE A BIT MORE

12:58.611 --> 12:59.545
PRESCRIPTIVE.

12:59.545 --> 13:00.313
>> Sreenivasan: AND SO, WHAT DO

13:00.313 --> 13:01.414
SAY THEY IS THE CONNECTION

13:01.414 --> 13:03.683
BETWEEN THE IMAGES THAT A YOUNG

13:03.683 --> 13:06.285
WOMAN SEES AND HER LIKELIHOOD TO

13:06.285 --> 13:07.920
BE ANOREXIC, WHICH IS SOMETIMES

13:07.920 --> 13:09.922
A PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDER, RIGHT?

13:09.922 --> 13:11.691
>> YES, IT'S VERY OFTEN, IF NOT

13:11.691 --> 13:12.959
ALWAYS, A PSYCHOLOGICAL

13:12.959 --> 13:13.960
DISORDER.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.862
WELL, HERE, I THINK THIS IS

13:15.862 --> 13:19.565
WHERE IT'S QUITE CONFUSING.

13:19.565 --> 13:21.634
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT THE BASIS

13:21.634 --> 13:24.303
WAS FOR... FOR TARGETING THE

13:24.303 --> 13:26.539
FASHION INDUSTRY.

13:26.539 --> 13:27.573
WHEN I AT LEAST SPOKE WITH

13:27.573 --> 13:29.942
PSYCHIATRISTS ABOUT THIS, THEY

13:29.942 --> 13:31.644
ALL SAY THAT THERE ARE SO MANY

13:31.644 --> 13:33.813
FACTORS THAT GO INTO A YOUNG

13:33.813 --> 13:37.150
WOMAN CHOOSING OR SLIPPING INTO

13:37.150 --> 13:39.018
A STATE WHERE SHE... SHE STARVES

13:39.018 --> 13:40.286
HERSELF.

13:40.286 --> 13:42.221
AND SO, IT'S NOT REALLY CLEAR

13:42.221 --> 13:45.525
THAT DOING THIS WILL HAVE A... A

13:45.525 --> 13:47.994
VERY MEASURABLE EFFECT, BUT MORE

13:47.994 --> 13:50.029
THAT IT CREATES SORT OF

13:50.029 --> 13:52.532
DIFFERENT RESPECTED BODY IMAGES

13:52.532 --> 13:54.534
OTHER THAN ONES THAT ARE... THAT

13:54.534 --> 13:58.004
ARE OFTEN VERY SERIOUSLY THIN,

13:58.004 --> 13:59.205
WHICH IS WHAT MANY OF THE

13:59.205 --> 14:00.740
FASHION MODELS WHO ARE, OF

14:00.740 --> 14:02.241
COURSE, VERY MUCH A PART OF THE

14:02.241 --> 14:05.478
PARIS SCENE ARE AND HAVE TO BE

14:05.478 --> 14:06.713
IN ORDER TO GET... TO GET WORK.

14:06.713 --> 14:07.580
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

14:07.580 --> 14:08.514
ALISSA RUBIN OF THE "NEW YORK

14:08.514 --> 14:09.682
TIMES," THANKS SO MUCH.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.217
>> THANK YOU.

14:19.826 --> 14:21.728
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW, TO OUR

14:21.728 --> 14:22.562
SIGNATURE SEGMENT.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.163
ON THIS EASTER WEEKEND, WE TAKE

14:24.163 --> 14:25.965
YOU TO JERUSALEM, WHERE NEW

14:25.965 --> 14:27.667
ARCHAEOLOGICAL FINDINGS ARE

14:27.667 --> 14:29.435
SPURRING A RENEWED DEBATE ABOUT

14:29.435 --> 14:32.205
THE FINAL HOURS OF JESUS' LIFE.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.407
JUST WHERE WAS HE PUT ON TRIAL

14:34.407 --> 14:35.808
AND PARADED BEFORE BEING

14:35.808 --> 14:36.809
CRUCIFIED?

14:36.809 --> 14:37.977
IT'S NOT JUST AN ACADEMIC

14:37.977 --> 14:38.611
QUESTION.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.012
MILLIONS OF CHRISTIAN PILGRIMS

14:40.012 --> 14:41.114
FROM AROUND THE WORLD HAVE

14:41.114 --> 14:42.749
RETRACED THE ROUTE OVER THE

14:42.749 --> 14:45.017
YEARS KNOWN AS THE VIA DOLOROSA,

14:45.017 --> 14:46.586
BUT SOME SAY THE LATEST FINDINGS

14:46.586 --> 14:48.254
SUGGEST THEY'VE BEEN WALKING THE

14:48.254 --> 14:49.188
WRONG WAY.

14:49.188 --> 14:50.289
NEWSHOUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

14:50.289 --> 14:53.025
MARTIN FLETCHER EXPLAINS.

14:53.025 --> 14:55.128
>> Reporter: FOR CENTURIES,

14:55.128 --> 14:57.096
CHRISTIAN PILGRIMS HAVE COME TO

14:57.096 --> 14:58.731
JERUSALEM TO RETRACE THE LAST

14:58.731 --> 15:00.900
HOURS OF JESUS' LIFE, WALKING

15:00.900 --> 15:02.402
THE TRADITIONAL STATIONS OF THE

15:02.402 --> 15:04.470
CROSS ON THE VIA DOLOROSA, OR

15:04.470 --> 15:06.105
WAY OF SUFFERING.

15:06.105 --> 15:07.540
THE BIGGEST CROWDS COME ON GOOD

15:07.540 --> 15:08.908
FRIDAY, BUT YOU'LL FIND PILGRIMS

15:08.908 --> 15:11.010
HERE EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR.

15:11.010 --> 15:11.944
THE HOODS ARE VISITING FROM

15:11.944 --> 15:13.312
UPSTATE NEW YORK.

15:13.312 --> 15:14.847
>> I JUST WANTED TO SEE WHERE

15:14.847 --> 15:15.948
THE DIFFERENT STATIONS WERE AND

15:15.948 --> 15:16.849
WHAT THEY REPRESENT.

15:16.849 --> 15:17.817
I'VE ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT THE

15:17.817 --> 15:19.185
STATIONS OF THE CROSS BUT NEVER

15:19.185 --> 15:21.521
REALLY UNDERSTOOD IT.

15:21.521 --> 15:22.622
>> I'M FOLLOWING THE STATIONS OF

15:22.622 --> 15:25.291
THE CROSS FROM ONE THROUGH 14.

15:25.291 --> 15:26.058
>> Reporter: AT THE FIFTH

15:26.058 --> 15:26.993
STATION OF THE CROSS, WHERE

15:26.993 --> 15:28.661
PILGRIMS LAY THEIR HANDS WHERE

15:28.661 --> 15:30.363
THEY BELIEVE JESUS RESTED HIS

15:30.363 --> 15:32.331
HAND, WE MET KEN COSTA FROM

15:32.331 --> 15:33.166
INDIA.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.367
>> VERY SPIRITUAL.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.968
I FELT THAT I WAS TOUCHING

15:35.968 --> 15:37.403
JESUS' HAND.

15:37.403 --> 15:38.938
AND SINCE IT'S IMPRINTED HERE,

15:38.938 --> 15:40.206
AS THIS IS THE FIFTH STATION

15:40.206 --> 15:42.341
WHERE SIMON OF CYRENE HELPED

15:42.341 --> 15:44.644
JESUS, SO MY BELIEF IS THAT THIS

15:44.644 --> 15:46.078
WAS THE WAY.

15:46.078 --> 15:47.113
>> Reporter: BUT WAS IT?

15:47.113 --> 15:48.881
RECENTLY REVEALED DISCOVERIES ON

15:48.881 --> 15:50.082
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CITY--

15:50.082 --> 15:51.918
REMNANTS OF AN ANCIENT PALACE

15:51.918 --> 15:53.553
WHICH JUST MAY BE THE TRUE SITE

15:53.553 --> 15:55.254
OF THE TRIAL OF JESUS-- IS

15:55.254 --> 15:56.756
RENEWING DEBATE ABOUT THE TRUE

15:56.756 --> 15:58.691
ROUTE OF THE VIA DOLOROSA.

15:58.691 --> 15:59.926
THIS IS THE ROUTE OF THE CURRENT

15:59.926 --> 16:01.861
VIA DOLOROSA, GOING FROM EAST TO

16:01.861 --> 16:03.563
WEST, ENDING AT THE CHURCH OF

16:03.563 --> 16:04.897
THE HOLY SEPULCHRE.

16:04.897 --> 16:06.833
THAT'S THE WAY MILLIONS OF

16:06.833 --> 16:07.733
CHRISTIAN PILGRIMS OVER THE

16:07.733 --> 16:09.235
YEARS HAVE FOLLOWED IN THE

16:09.235 --> 16:10.536
FOOTSTEPS OF CHRIST.

16:10.536 --> 16:11.704
BUT THERE'S ARCHAEOLOGICAL

16:11.704 --> 16:13.339
EVIDENCE THAT THEY'VE GOT IT ALL

16:13.339 --> 16:15.341
WRONG, THAT THE REAL HISTORICAL

16:15.341 --> 16:16.909
VIA DOLOROSA ENDS AT THE HOLY

16:16.909 --> 16:18.811
CHURCH BUT THAT IT SHOULD START

16:18.811 --> 16:20.713
MORE THAN A HALF MILE WAY ON THE

16:20.713 --> 16:22.415
WEST SIDE OF THE CITY, NEAR THE

16:22.415 --> 16:24.350
TOWER OF DAVID MUSEUM.

16:24.350 --> 16:26.118
THIS IS ONE VERY SPECIAL STREET

16:26.118 --> 16:27.253
NAME, ISN'T IT?

16:27.253 --> 16:29.789
VIA DOLOROSA?

16:29.789 --> 16:31.123
TO UNDERSTAND BETTER, WE VISITED

16:31.123 --> 16:32.425
WITH FRANCISCAN FATHER

16:32.425 --> 16:34.193
ALESSANDRO CONIGLIO.

16:34.193 --> 16:35.027
CHRISTIANS, WHEN THEY COME TO

16:35.027 --> 16:38.364
JERUSALEM, I IMAGINE EVERYONE--

16:38.364 --> 16:41.267
EVERY SINGLE ONE-- WALKS THE VIA

16:41.267 --> 16:41.901
DOLOROSA.

16:41.901 --> 16:42.501
>> YES.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.036
>> Reporter: WHY?

16:44.036 --> 16:45.171
>> BECAUSE THIS IS THE PATH THAT

16:45.171 --> 16:47.006
JESUS WALKED.

16:47.006 --> 16:47.907
IT'S A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE.

16:47.907 --> 16:50.042
>> Reporter: HE TOOK US TO THE

16:50.042 --> 16:51.244
VERY START OF THE TRADITIONAL

16:51.244 --> 16:52.712
VIA DOLOROSA.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.213
EACH OF THE 14 STATIONS IS

16:54.213 --> 16:55.715
MARKED WITH NUMBERS TO HELP

16:55.715 --> 16:57.383
PILGRIMS FIND THEM.

16:57.383 --> 16:58.718
SO, ACTUALLY, THE FIRST STATION

16:58.718 --> 16:59.986
OF THE CROSS IS IN A MUSLIM

16:59.986 --> 17:01.320
BOYS' SCHOOL.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.289
>> YES.

17:03.289 --> 17:04.056
>> Reporter: A SCHOOL NOW, BUT,

17:04.056 --> 17:05.391
AT THE TIME OF JESUS, IT WAS THE

17:05.391 --> 17:07.293
ANTONIA FORTRESS WHERE IT'S LONG

17:07.293 --> 17:08.461
BEEN BELIEVED THE TRIAL OF JESUS

17:08.461 --> 17:09.829
TOOK PLACE.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.364
>> THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT

17:11.364 --> 17:13.733
PLACE FOR US BECAUSE HERE JESUS

17:13.733 --> 17:15.968
STARTED HIS PASSION.

17:15.968 --> 17:19.438
HERE HE WAS JUDGED BY PILATE.

17:19.438 --> 17:20.473
>> Reporter: THE SECOND STATION,

17:20.473 --> 17:21.641
ACROSS THE STREET IN TWO

17:21.641 --> 17:23.409
FRANCISCAN SHRINES, IS WHERE

17:23.409 --> 17:25.478
TRADITION HAS IT JESUS TAKES UP

17:25.478 --> 17:26.879
THE CROSS AND IS FLOGGED BY

17:26.879 --> 17:28.447
SOLDIERS.

17:28.447 --> 17:30.116
STATION THREE: JESUS FALLS FOR

17:30.116 --> 17:31.884
THE FIRST TIME.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.786
STATION FOUR: JESUS MEETS HIS

17:33.786 --> 17:34.887
MOTHER.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.756
STATION FIVE: SIMON HELPS JESUS

17:36.756 --> 17:38.357
CARRY THE CROSS.

17:38.357 --> 17:39.225
THAT'S ALSO WHERE WE SEE

17:39.225 --> 17:41.193
PILGRIMS TOUCHING THE WALL.

17:41.193 --> 17:43.296
STATION SIX: VERONICA WIPES THE

17:43.296 --> 17:44.997
FACE OF JESUS.

17:44.997 --> 17:46.599
HE FALLS FOR THE SECOND TIME AT

17:46.599 --> 17:48.634
STATION SEVEN AND COMFORTS THE

17:48.634 --> 17:50.069
WOMEN OF JERUSALEM AT STATION

17:50.069 --> 17:51.437
EIGHT.

17:51.437 --> 17:52.905
NUMBER NINE: JESUS FALLS FOR THE

17:52.905 --> 17:55.408
THIRD TIME AT THIS ROMAN PILLAR.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.009
THE LAST STATIONS, TEN TO 14,

17:57.009 --> 17:58.044
ARE INSIDE THE CHURCH OF THE

17:58.044 --> 17:59.845
HOLY SEPULCHRE, BELIEVED TO BE

17:59.845 --> 18:01.847
THE EXACT PLACE WHERE JESUS IS

18:01.847 --> 18:04.650
CRUCIFIED, DIES AND IS BURIED.

18:04.650 --> 18:06.118
THE SITE WAS IDENTIFIED BACK IN

18:06.118 --> 18:07.887
THE FOURTH CENTURY BY HELENA,

18:07.887 --> 18:09.388
MOTHER OF CONSTANTINE, THE FIRST

18:09.388 --> 18:11.090
CHRISTIAN ROMAN EMPEROR.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.458
PILGRIMS HAVE WORSHIPPED HERE

18:12.458 --> 18:13.926
EVER SINCE.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.027
BUT ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE

18:15.027 --> 18:16.562
OLD CITY, AT THE TOWER OF DAVID

18:16.562 --> 18:18.664
MUSEUM, WE MET ARCHAEOLOGIST

18:18.664 --> 18:20.366
SHIMON GIBSON, WHO GAVE US A

18:20.366 --> 18:21.734
LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE IN A BRAND

18:21.734 --> 18:23.669
NEW EXHIBIT THAT CHALLENGES THE

18:23.669 --> 18:25.137
EXISTING ROUTE OF THE VIA

18:25.137 --> 18:26.405
DOLOROSA.

18:26.405 --> 18:27.473
>> SO, THIS IS IT.

18:27.473 --> 18:28.341
>> Reporter: THIS WAS ONCE A

18:28.341 --> 18:29.675
ONE-STORY PRISON, LONG AGO

18:29.675 --> 18:30.609
ABANDONED.

18:30.609 --> 18:31.911
NO ONE THOUGHT VERY MUCH ABOUT

18:31.911 --> 18:32.678
IT.

18:32.678 --> 18:34.213
BUT THEN, ARCHAEOLOGISTS STARTED

18:34.213 --> 18:35.715
DIGGING AND KEPT GOING,

18:35.715 --> 18:38.117
UNCOVERING LAYERS OF 2,800 YEARS

18:38.117 --> 18:39.885
OF HISTORY, INCLUDING WHAT COULD

18:39.885 --> 18:41.887
BE THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE PALACE

18:41.887 --> 18:43.222
OF HEROD THE GREAT.

18:43.222 --> 18:45.057
>> NOW, THESE RECENT EXCAVATIONS

18:45.057 --> 18:47.326
REALLY BROUGHT TO LIGHT FURTHER

18:47.326 --> 18:50.763
PROOF OF THE EXISTENCE OF A

18:50.763 --> 18:54.233
MONUMENTAL EDIFICE WHICH CAN BE

18:54.233 --> 18:57.136
IDENTIFIED AS THE COMPOUND OF

18:57.136 --> 18:59.638
HEROD THE GREAT AND SUBSEQUENTLY

18:59.638 --> 19:02.375
THE PRAETORIUM WHERE PONTIUS

19:02.375 --> 19:03.442
PILATE SAT.

19:03.442 --> 19:04.377
>> Reporter: PILATE, THE ROMAN

19:04.377 --> 19:06.012
GOVERNOR WHO SENTENCED JESUS TO

19:06.012 --> 19:06.979
DEATH.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.347
IF PILATE HELD THE TRIAL AT

19:08.347 --> 19:10.116
HEROD'S PALACE, WHICH GIBSON AND

19:10.116 --> 19:11.951
MANY OTHER HISTORIANS BELIEVE,

19:11.951 --> 19:13.486
THEN THE AREA NEAR THE TOWER OF

19:13.486 --> 19:15.921
DAVID MUSEUM IS WHERE THE VIA

19:15.921 --> 19:17.823
DOLOROSA SHOULD START.

19:17.823 --> 19:18.924
IN FACT, ORIGINALLY IN THE FIRST

19:18.924 --> 19:20.793
MILLENNIUM, PILGRIMSDIDTHINK

19:20.793 --> 19:22.828
THE VIA DOLOROSA WENT THIS WAY.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.030
WHEN WE SAY WE HAVE FOUND

19:24.030 --> 19:25.631
SOMETHING NEW TODAY, WE'RE

19:25.631 --> 19:27.066
ACTUALLY GOING BACK TO THE OLD

19:27.066 --> 19:28.601
ROUTE OF THE VIA DOLOROSA.

19:28.601 --> 19:29.468
>> YES.

19:29.468 --> 19:30.369
>> Reporter: SO, WHY IS THE VIA

19:30.369 --> 19:32.004
DOLOROSA TODAY WHERE IT IS?

19:32.004 --> 19:34.040
>> THE TRADITIONAL VIA DOLOROSA

19:34.040 --> 19:36.008
WAS REALLY ESTABLISHED AT THE

19:36.008 --> 19:37.009
TIME OF THE CRUSADERS.

19:37.009 --> 19:40.379
THE CRUSADERS, IN 1099, INVADED

19:40.379 --> 19:41.514
JERUSALEM.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.983
THEY WERE ABLE THEN TO REARRANGE

19:43.983 --> 19:46.952
THE FEATURES WITHIN THE CITY IN

19:46.952 --> 19:49.422
ORDER TO FIT IN WITH THEIR IDEA

19:49.422 --> 19:51.424
OF WHERE THE HOLY SITES SHOULD

19:51.424 --> 19:52.558
BE.

19:52.558 --> 19:54.160
HENCE, THEY DECIDED THAT THE

19:54.160 --> 19:56.128
ANTONIA FORTRESS, THAT WOULD BE

19:56.128 --> 19:57.463
THE STARTING POINT FOR THE VIA

19:57.463 --> 19:58.831
DOLOROSA, AND, OF COURSE, THE

19:58.831 --> 20:01.267
ENDPOINT HAD TO BE THE CHURCH OF

20:01.267 --> 20:02.535
THE HOLY SEPULCHRE.

20:02.535 --> 20:03.302
>> Reporter: THE THEORY THAT THE

20:03.302 --> 20:04.670
TRADITIONAL VIA DOLOROSA MIGHT

20:04.670 --> 20:06.605
GO THE WRONG WAY ISN'T NEW, BUT

20:06.605 --> 20:07.840
THIS EXHIBIT IS.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.442
JUST OPENED TO PUBLIC, IT'S GOT

20:09.442 --> 20:10.810
PEOPLE TALKING.

20:10.810 --> 20:11.911
LISTEN TO WHAT'S HAPPENING ON

20:11.911 --> 20:13.012
THIS TOUR.

20:13.012 --> 20:13.913
>> AND SO, IF WE CAN PROVE THAT

20:13.913 --> 20:16.082
HEROD'S PALACE IS HERE, THEN WE

20:16.082 --> 20:18.050
CAN PROVE THE VIA DOLOROSA, THE

20:18.050 --> 20:20.252
HISTORICAL VIA DOLOROSA, SHOULD

20:20.252 --> 20:21.821
START FROM SOMEWHERE AROUND

20:21.821 --> 20:22.455
HERE.

20:22.455 --> 20:25.224
>> HMM, THAT WILL CHANGE A FEW

20:25.224 --> 20:25.724
THINGS.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.927
>> THAT WILL CHANGE A FEW

20:27.927 --> 20:28.627
THINGS!

20:28.627 --> 20:30.930
>> I'M...

20:30.930 --> 20:30.396
>> NOT IMPRESSED?

20:30.396 --> 20:31.530
>> I DON'T LIKE YOUR WORDING.

20:31.530 --> 20:32.598
WE HAVE TO BE VERY SENSITIVE

20:32.598 --> 20:33.632
ABOUT SAYING WE CAN PROVE.

20:33.632 --> 20:34.333
WE CAN'T PROVE.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.302
WE CAN ASK THE QUESTION: MIGHT

20:36.302 --> 20:38.737
THE TRIAL HAVE BEEN HERE EVEN

20:38.737 --> 20:40.606
IF TRADITION SAYS IT WAS THERE?

20:40.606 --> 20:41.340
>> Reporter: ARE YOU GETTING

20:41.340 --> 20:43.008
SPECIFICALLY MORE GROUPS COMING

20:43.008 --> 20:45.945
HERE BECAUSE OF THE STORY THAT

20:45.945 --> 20:47.246
JESUS CHRIST'S TRIAL MAY HAVE

20:47.246 --> 20:47.713
BEEN HERE?

20:47.713 --> 20:49.548
>> ABSOLUTELY, EVERY DAY.

20:49.548 --> 20:51.951
>> Reporter: TOWER OF DAVID

20:51.951 --> 20:53.752
MUSEUM DIRECTOR EILAT LIEBER HAS

20:53.752 --> 20:55.621
BIG PLANS FOR THE NEW EXHIBIT

20:55.621 --> 20:56.622
AND HOPES IT WILL ATTRACT

20:56.622 --> 20:57.957
HISTORY BUFFS AND PILGRIMS

20:57.957 --> 20:58.657
ALIKE.

20:58.657 --> 21:00.960
TODAY, THE MUSEUM GETS 300,000

21:00.960 --> 21:00.726
VISITORS A YEAR.

21:00.726 --> 21:02.094
>> WE WANT A MILLION VISITORS

21:02.094 --> 21:03.295
EVERY YEAR.

21:03.295 --> 21:05.631
>> Reporter: NO DOUBT THERE'S A

21:05.631 --> 21:07.066
BUSINESS SIDE TO ALL THIS;

21:07.066 --> 21:08.334
CHRISTIAN TOURISTS ACCOUNT FOR

21:08.334 --> 21:09.969
MORE THAN HALF OF ISRAEL'S $11

21:09.969 --> 21:12.338
BILLION TOURISM INDUSTRY AND THE

21:12.338 --> 21:14.039
TRADITIONAL VIA DOLOROSA, WHICH

21:14.039 --> 21:15.508
IS LINED WITH TOURIST SHOPS

21:15.508 --> 21:17.977
GALORE, IS A TOP DESTINATION.

21:17.977 --> 21:19.979
BUT FOR PILGRIMS LIKE KEN COSTA,

21:19.979 --> 21:22.114
WALKING THE VIA DOLOROSA IS NOT

21:22.114 --> 21:24.750
ABOUT MONEY NOR ABOUT HISTORY.

21:24.750 --> 21:27.887
>> IT'S ONLY FAITH.

21:27.887 --> 21:28.721
>> Reporter: IT'S ONLY FAITH?

21:28.721 --> 21:29.588
>> YES, IT IS.

22:33.719 --> 22:35.120
BONNIE LOFTON COMMENTED: "MY

22:35.120 --> 22:36.722
DOCTOR AND I HAVE HAD THIS

22:36.722 --> 22:37.656
DISCUSSION.

22:37.656 --> 22:38.657
I AM GLAD THAT I LIVE IN OREGON.

22:38.657 --> 22:39.925
WHEN THE TIME COMES THAT THE

22:39.925 --> 22:41.193
BENEFITS DO NOT OUTWEIGH THE

22:41.193 --> 22:42.828
SUFFERING, I WANT IT WELL KNOWN

22:42.828 --> 22:45.431
BY MY FAMILY MY WISHES TO HOW I

MICHELLE VIETOR SAID SIMPLY: "I

22:48.334 --> 22:50.302
WANT THE ABILITY TO DECIDE WHEN

22:50.302 --> 22:51.070
TO GO.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.504
I DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S ANYONE

22:52.504 --> 22:53.706
ELSE'S BUSINESS."

22:53.706 --> 22:54.873
AND THERE WAS THIS FROM CANDID

22:54.873 --> 22:56.575
ONE: "I'M A PRE-BOOMER WHO'S

22:56.575 --> 22:58.344
ALSO RETIRED, WITH LOTS OF TIME

22:58.344 --> 23:00.412
TO ALLOCATE TO INEVITABILITY.

23:00.412 --> 23:02.248

23:02.314 --> 23:04.149
IMPLIED IN THIS SEGMENT'S EXPOSÉ

23:04.149 --> 23:06.285
IS THAT WE MAKE LIVING EASIER

23:06.285 --> 23:08.520
FOR ALL BY NOT KEEPING DEATH AS

23:08.520 --> 23:09.622
AN UNMENTIONABLE."

23:09.622 --> 23:11.090
THERE WERE SOME WHO TOLD US

23:11.090 --> 23:12.591

ADCOCK: "SPEAKING AS SOMEONE WHO

23:17.129 --> 23:19.131
WAS A CHURCH PASTOR FOR 35

23:19.131 --> 23:21.166
YEARS, I CAN TELL YOU I WISH

23:21.166 --> 23:22.568
MORE PEOPLE WERE WILLING TO HAVE

23:22.568 --> 23:24.136

23:24.136 --> 23:25.604
AND JANA L. JOHNSEN: "AS A

23:25.604 --> 23:28.140
HOSPITAL/HOSPICE CHAPLAIN, I

23:28.140 --> 23:29.742
INITIATED OR FACILITATED THESE

23:37.549 --> 23:38.917
GIVING, TO BE ABLE TO SHARE

23:38.917 --> 23:40.953
THESE INTIMATE CONVERSATIONS."

23:40.953 --> 23:42.588
AND BEVERLY BERG: "WHEN I WORKED

23:42.588 --> 23:44.189
AT THE V.A., I DEALT WITH DYING

23:44.189 --> 23:45.891
AND DEATH ON A FAIRLY REGULAR

23:45.891 --> 23:46.558
BASIS.

23:46.558 --> 23:48.127
SOME JUST NEEDED SOMEONE TO LET

23:48.127 --> 23:49.695
THEM KNOW IT WAS OKAY TO DIE IF

23:49.695 --> 23:51.030
THIS WAS WHAT THEY WANTED, THAT

23:51.030 --> 23:52.164
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO FIGHT

23:52.164 --> 23:53.666
ANYMORE JUST TO MAKE EVERYONE

23:53.666 --> 23:55.267
AROUND THEM HAPPY."

23:55.267 --> 23:56.769
AND FINALLY, NOUBAR GEE OFFERED

23:56.769 --> 23:58.404
THIS ADVICE: "THINK ABOUT IT,

23:58.404 --> 24:00.472
TALK ABOUT IT, BUT DO NOT BE

24:00.472 --> 24:02.041
PRE-OCCUPIED BY IT."
