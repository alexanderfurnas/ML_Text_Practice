GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill.
Judy Woodruff is on assignment.

00:07.407 --> 00:11.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Donald Trump's
money troubles. Hillary Clinton
outraises

00:11.979 --> 00:18.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him by tens of millions of
dollars and attacks
him as bad for the economy. His
defense? Just

00:18.452 --> 00:20.220 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you wait.

00:20.254 --> 00:24.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Also ahead this Tuesday:
Venezuela's desperation.
The country's deepening debt and
political

00:25.025 --> 00:30.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crisis pushes hungry citizens to
riot in search
of food.

00:30.130 --> 00:35.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Making the Grade -- the
latest in our
weekly education series examines
how to turn

00:35.302 --> 00:37.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
students into scientists by
ditching textbooks.

00:38.005 --> 00:41.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTY MATHES, Teacher, Sage
Valley Junior
High School: It's not the child
needs to memorize

00:41.808 --> 00:48.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these things. It's the student
needs to be
able to do some pretty intense
stuff. We are

00:48.148 --> 00:49.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
actually doing the science.

00:49.983 --> 00:56.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:56.757 --> 00:59.159 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:59.192 --> 01:11.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Iran has closed its
largest deal
with an American company in over
three decades.

01:11.571 --> 01:16.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Airplane manufacturer Boeing
announced it's
signed an agreement to sell
commercial jets

01:16.376 --> 01:21.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Iran Air, the country's main
carrier. Iran's
transportation minister said the
sale could

01:21.882 --> 01:27.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be worth up to $25 billion. It
marks Iran's
first major deal with a U.S.
company since

01:27.988 --> 01:31.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
last year's landmark nuclear
agreement.

01:31.158 --> 01:35.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Attorney General Loretta Lynch
traveled to
Orlando today, as the Justice
Department pushed

01:35.896 --> 01:42.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ahead with its murder
investigation. Omar
Mateen killed 49 people at a gay
nightclub

01:42.069 --> 01:47.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there more than a week ago. This
afternoon,
Lynch visited a memorial at
Orlando's City

01:47.207 --> 01:52.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hall. She signed a note of
condolence, and
stopped at a display of wreaths
honoring each

01:52.713 --> 01:54.448 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
victim.

01:54.481 --> 01:56.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORETTA LYNCH, U.S. Attorney
General: The
message of Orlando that I have
seen today,

01:56.683 --> 02:01.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and what the American people
have seen in
the wake of this horrific
assault, is a message

02:01.788 --> 02:07.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of determination to remove
hatred and intolerance
from our midst, to live our
lives freely and

02:07.828 --> 02:14.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
without fear and to stay true to
the principles
of liberty, justice and equality
that define

02:14.468 --> 02:16.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
America at our best.

02:16.303 --> 02:20.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Lynch said
investigators are still
working to determine whether
they missed any

02:20.707 --> 02:25.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
warning signs that would have
confirmed Mateen
was a threat.

02:25.545 --> 02:29.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maine Republican Susan Collins
led Senate
colleagues from both sides of
the aisle today

02:29.683 --> 02:35.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in unveiling a compromise on gun
control.
The measure, which would bar
anyone on the

02:35.188 --> 02:40.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government's no-fly list from
buying guns,
comes after the Senate rejected
four bills

02:40.560 --> 02:43.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from Republicans and Democrats
last night.

02:43.830 --> 02:48.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Collins said it was time to put
aside party
differences and end the Senate
gridlock.

02:48.502 --> 02:55.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R), Maine:
All of us are
united in our desire to getting
something

02:55.542 --> 03:05.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
significant done on this vital
issue. Surely,
the terrorist attacks in San
Bernardino and

03:05.185 --> 03:15.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Orlando that took so many
lives are a call
for compromise, a plea for
bipartisan action.

03:15.162 --> 03:21.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But Republican
Senator John Cornyn
of Texas, whose own proposal
failed last night,

03:21.201 --> 03:25.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
cautioned that people on
government watch
lists who have not been charged
with a crime

03:25.272 --> 03:27.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shouldn't be denied due process.

03:27.174 --> 03:31.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R), Texas: I
remain concerned
about a provision on the back
end, after you

03:31.611 --> 03:37.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have been denied a
constitutional right. But
we will see how the votes come
out. I think

03:37.451 --> 03:44.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's a slippery slope when an
American citizen
is denied a constitutional right
without forcing

03:44.357 --> 03:49.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the government to come forward
with some evidence
on the front end, as opposed to
leaving that

03:49.896 --> 03:51.698 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the back end.

03:51.731 --> 03:56.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Senate could
vote on the gun
control compromise bill as early
as this week.

03:56.670 --> 04:01.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Longtime Pennsylvania
Congressman Chaka Fattah
was convicted today of
racketeering. A federal

04:01.708 --> 04:06.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
jury found the 11-term lawmaker
guilty of
all the charges against him,
including fraud,

04:07.013 --> 04:11.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
money laundering, and bribery.
Prosecutors
said Fattah routed federal grant
money to

04:11.985 --> 04:17.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nonprofits he controlled, so he
could pay
off debts from his failed
mayoral bid in 2007.

04:17.991 --> 04:22.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The 59-year-old Democrat will be
sentenced
in October.

04:22.529 --> 04:28.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Obama administration today
OKed routine
commercial use of small drones,
after years

04:28.201 --> 04:33.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of grappling with rules to
govern them. The
Federal Aviation
Administration's regulations

04:33.073 --> 04:39.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mean operators can fly without
special permission.
The rules require drones to stay
within visual

04:39.546 --> 04:46.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sight -- visual line of sight,
no higher than
400 feet. Flights are prohibited
over unprotected

04:46.186 --> 04:52.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people, and pilots must pass an
aviation exam
at an FAA testing center.

04:52.425 --> 04:57.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S.-led coalition today
reported only
a third of Fallujah has been
cleared of Islamic

04:57.364 --> 05:02.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State militants. That assessment
comes days
after the Iraqi government
declared victory,

05:02.402 --> 05:08.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and nearly a month after the
Iraqi army launched
its offensive there. Meanwhile,
in Syria,

05:08.441 --> 05:13.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
activists said ISIS militants
have now retaken
all the territories in Raqqa
province that

05:13.780 --> 05:17.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it previously lost to Syrian
government forces.

05:17.484 --> 05:21.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
British Prime Minister David
Cameron made
a last-ditch appeal to Britons
today, urging

05:21.955 --> 05:28.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them to vote to stay in the
European Union.
It came 48 hours ahead of
Thursday's referendum

05:28.695 --> 05:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to decide whether or not Britain
will remain
a part of the E.U.

05:33.200 --> 05:38.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Speaking in front of 10 Downing
Street, Cameron
warned leaving the bloc would be
irreversible.

05:38.104 --> 05:43.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CAMERON, British Prime
Minister: To
put it as clearly as I can, our
economic security

05:43.577 --> 05:51.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is paramount. It is stronger if
we stay. If
we leave, we put it at risk.
That is a risk

05:51.284 --> 05:58.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to jobs, a risk to families, a
risk to our
children's future, and there is
no going back.

05:58.491 --> 06:03.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The latest poll
tilts narrowly
in favor of Britain remaining in
the E.U.,

06:03.830 --> 06:06.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but that support is dwindling.

06:06.166 --> 06:11.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, strenuous
new physical
testing for Marine combat posts
are weeding

06:11.104 --> 06:16.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out most female recruits. That's
according
to new data obtained by the
Associated Press.

06:16.876 --> 06:22.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Pentagon opened combat jobs
to women six
months ago. But about 86 percent
of female

06:22.215 --> 06:27.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marine recruits, or roughly six
out of seven
women, failed the tests. That's
compared to

06:27.153 --> 06:29.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
3 percent of men.

06:29.723 --> 06:34.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Wall Street, stocks finished
the day with
modest gains after Federal
Reserve Chair Janet

06:34.594 --> 06:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yellen said the Central Bank
will remain cautious
in raising interest rates. The
Dow Jones industrial

06:40.634 --> 06:47.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average gained more than 24
points to close
above 17829. The Nasdaq rose six
points, and

06:47.741 --> 06:50.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the S&amp;P 500 added five.

06:50.877 --> 06:56.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Donald Trump's
campaign cash crunch; the
International Olympic

06:56.683 --> 07:02.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Committee upholds an Olympics
ban on Russian
track and field athletes;
revamping science

07:02.522 --> 07:17.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
standards for more effective
classroom learning;
and much more.

07:17.270 --> 07:22.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The summertime phase of the
presidential campaign
got under way with news of a
striking fund-raising

07:22.776 --> 07:25.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gap between Hillary Clinton and
Donald Trump.

07:25.779 --> 07:29.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
He's written a lot of books
about his business.

07:29.482 --> 07:31.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They all seem to end at chapter
11.

07:31.718 --> 07:32.285 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

07:32.319 --> 07:34.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

07:34.120 --> 07:39.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Democrat Hillary
Clinton returned
to the swing state of Ohio today
to take aim

07:39.759 --> 07:43.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at Donald Trump's business
record and economic
experience.

07:43.096 --> 07:48.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: You
might think that,
because he has spent his life as
a businessman,

07:48.501 --> 07:58.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he'd be better prepared to
handle the economy.
Well, it turns out he's
dangerous there too.

07:58.311 --> 08:03.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just like he shouldn't have his
finger on
the button, he shouldn't have
his hands on

08:03.883 --> 08:04.784 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our economy.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

08:06.686 --> 08:10.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Recent polls show
Clinton leading
Trump nationally, but the divide
is even bigger

08:10.890 --> 08:16.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when it comes to money, raised
and spent.
May fund-raising reports
released yesterday

08:16.730 --> 08:18.698 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tell the tale.

08:18.732 --> 08:24.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton ended the month with $42
million in
cash on hand. By contrast, the
Trump campaign

08:24.704 --> 08:32.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reported it has $1.3 million.
That's less
than primary candidates Ted
Cruz, at $6.8

08:32.245 --> 08:38.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
million, and Ben Carson, at $1.7
million.
They dropped out months ago.

08:38.351 --> 08:44.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even Democrat Bernie Sanders,
who has not
formally ended his campaign,
still had $9.2

08:44.991 --> 08:50.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
million at the end of last
month. Trump said
he is unconcerned about the gap
and will raise

08:50.764 --> 08:54.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more this month. He spoke by
phone on this
morning's "Today Show."

08:54.267 --> 08:58.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
What I will do is just what I
did in the primaries.

08:58.605 --> 09:04.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spent $55 million of own money
to win the
primaries, 55. Now, that's a lot
of money,

09:04.611 --> 09:07.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, by even any standard. I
have a lot
of cash, and I may do it again
in the general

09:07.881 --> 09:09.616 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

09:09.649 --> 09:14.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Trump campaign
put out its
very first fund-raising e-mail
today with

09:14.087 --> 09:19.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a pledge from the candidate to
personally
match contributions up to $2
million over

09:20.026 --> 09:22.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the next 48 hours.

09:22.195 --> 09:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the campaign trail, it was
business as
usual. Trump met with
evangelical leaders

09:27.367 --> 09:33.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meeting in Manhattan. In video
posted from
the private session, he raised
questions about

09:33.106 --> 09:38.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton's Christianity, and he
cautioned attendees
that they should be careful how
they decide

09:38.578 --> 09:40.480 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who to pray for.

09:40.513 --> 09:44.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We can't again be,
again, politically
correct and say we pray for all
of our leaders,

09:44.050 --> 09:49.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because all of your leaders are
selling Christianity
down the tubes, selling the
evangelicals down

09:49.923 --> 09:55.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the tubes, and it's a very, very
-- it's a
very, very bad thing that's
happening now.

09:55.662 --> 10:00.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Trump also said he
would continue
his criticism of Clinton with a
major speech

10:00.967 --> 10:03.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
also in New York tomorrow.

10:03.236 --> 10:09.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on the growing campaign
divide on
money and ideology as the
outlines of the

10:09.042 --> 10:14.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
general election take shape, we
turn to Matea
Gold, who covers campaign
finance for "The

10:14.080 --> 10:19.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Washington Post," and USA Today
Washington
bureau chief Susan Page.

10:19.118 --> 10:25.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Matea, Donald Trump says he's
just being lean
and mean. How much of that is
even conceivable?

10:25.959 --> 10:30.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD, The Washington Post:
The problem
here is it's not just Trump that
he's raising

10:30.597 --> 10:36.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
money for. It's the Republican
Party as a
whole, and in fact the entire
GOP down-ticket

10:36.402 --> 10:41.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ballot that's relying on his
fund-raising
to put money into the coffers of
the RNC to

10:42.008 --> 10:44.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
finance a get-out-the-vote
operation.

10:44.210 --> 10:48.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Trump's reaction to the
fund-raising
report and the backlash was very
telling this

10:48.748 --> 10:54.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
morning. He threatened to
actually just self-fund
and leave the party on its own
if GOP leaders

10:54.387 --> 10:58.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't rally around him and help
him bring
in the funds. And that's caused
an incredible

10:58.525 --> 11:01.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
amount of alarm among Republican
strategists
today.

11:01.494 --> 11:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And you have been
covering campaign
finance issues for a long -- a
while by now,

11:07.066 --> 11:09.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Matea. How unprecedented is
this, this gap?

11:09.536 --> 11:14.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: Well, Trump's
campaign is simply
unprecedented. And we have not
had a major

11:14.140 --> 11:17.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
party nominee self-finance in
this way.

11:17.744 --> 11:21.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And up until the primaries, it
was less of
a question about how much cash
he had on hand,

11:21.915 --> 11:26.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
because he was putting
substantial sums into
his campaign, at least in the
forms of loans

11:27.020 --> 11:32.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every month. That changed in
May, when he
only fronted his campaign an
additional $2.2

11:32.892 --> 11:37.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
million, raised $3.1 million.
This is the
month where he effectively
clinched the Republican

11:37.730 --> 11:39.465 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nomination.

11:39.499 --> 11:43.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those figures are very, very
small for summer
heading into the key summer
months.

11:43.770 --> 11:47.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So when you clinch a
nomination,
the theory is that you unite the
money and

11:47.473 --> 11:50.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the money comes flowing it. But
that doesn't
seem to have happened, at least
not yet.

11:50.743 --> 11:52.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau
Chief, USA Today:
Well, it doesn't come in unless
you ask for

11:52.512 --> 11:54.380 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one problem is that Donald
Trump has not
done the kind of meticulous
fund-raising that

11:56.849 --> 12:01.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
every other presidential
candidate has done
when they clinch of nomination.
In fact, he

12:01.521 --> 12:04.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hasn't done -- this is part of a
piece. He
hasn't done the other things
that conventional

12:04.724 --> 12:07.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
candidates have done since
clinching the nomination.

12:07.393 --> 12:11.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
People look at this --
Republicans look at
this and say seven weeks in
which he hasn't

12:11.598 --> 12:16.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
broadened his message. He hasn't
built up
the staff in key states, and he
hasn't raised

12:17.003 --> 12:19.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the money that he will need in
the campaign
that continues.

12:19.706 --> 12:24.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Explain to people
why -- what
this money goes for, because you
could understand

12:24.043 --> 12:28.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
someone saying, oh, she's just
fat and happy.
She doesn't need this money.
She's being greedy.

12:28.448 --> 12:31.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, there's actual things
you pay for
with this money.

12:31.184 --> 12:34.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Well, you pay for
people, staffers
who are going to walk around key
states, identify

12:34.854 --> 12:36.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your voters and turn them out on
Election
Day.

12:36.923 --> 12:43.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You pay for TV ads. Hillary
Clinton and her
super PACs have now put on more
than $23 million

12:43.463 --> 12:48.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- more than $23 million worth
of ads in eight
battleground states, compared to
zero spent

12:48.935 --> 12:53.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on campaign ads by Donald
Trump's campaign.
And that is setting an
impression.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are mostly -- there's some
positive
ads. More of them are negative
ads. They're

12:56.943 --> 13:00.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
setting an impression of Donald
Trump, and
he is not responding to it. So,
as the campaign

13:00.747 --> 13:04.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
goes on, that impression gets
more and more
set and it becomes harder and
harder to change

13:04.617 --> 13:06.419 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it if you wait.

13:06.452 --> 13:09.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Matea, let's talk
about Hillary
Clinton's $42 million. To the
extent that

13:09.689 --> 13:12.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he is not raising money, where
is she raising
money from?

13:12.859 --> 13:17.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: Well, last night in
New York,
Secretary Clinton had three
high-dollar fund-raising

13:17.964 --> 13:20.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
events in conjunction with the
Democratic
Party.

13:20.700 --> 13:25.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a strategy she has
actually been pursuing
since last fall, when she formed
the earlier

13:25.838 --> 13:29.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and largest joint fund-raising
committee a
presidential campaign has ever
done with the

13:29.942 --> 13:34.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
party. That has been a very
successful strategy
for her, helping bring in not
only small donations

13:34.947 --> 13:41.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to her campaign, but much-needed
large donations
into the DNC, which was
suffering from a long

13:41.521 --> 13:43.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
debt they were holding.

13:43.289 --> 13:47.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the DNC, while it has not
raised as much
money as the RNC this cycle,
it's getting

13:47.160 --> 13:51.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a big boost from Clinton's
campaign. That
is something that Trump is just
starting to

13:51.364 --> 13:53.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
try to chip away at with the
Republican Party.

13:53.166 --> 13:57.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And it's fair to say
after -- she
raised more last night in three
high-dollar

13:57.170 --> 13:59.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
events than he has on hand right
now.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: I would imagine so.

14:01.274 --> 14:08.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she has tapped into a very
active small-dollar
donor base. Really, after
getting a scare

14:08.147 --> 14:12.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Senator Sanders, who
managed to really
finance almost all his entire
campaign with

14:12.585 --> 14:17.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
small online donations,
Clinton's campaign
really upped up their efforts in
that area,

14:17.824 --> 14:21.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have brought in substantial
amount of money
online through small donations.

14:21.828 --> 14:26.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's something that has
Republican strategists
scratching their head, wonder
why Trump has

14:26.399 --> 14:31.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not tried to do the same with
his supporters,
who clearly have the kind of
fervent support

14:31.270 --> 14:33.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the candidate that could
translate into
a lot of money.

14:33.773 --> 14:37.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, that support
is predicated,
in part, Susan, on the fact that
he's a millionaire

14:38.010 --> 14:41.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and has a lot of money and
throughout the
primary talked about how he was
paying his

14:41.881 --> 14:43.549 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
own way.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a lot of that paying his own
way were
loans. Right? So, we know --
there are two

14:46.886 --> 14:50.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things we discovered, which is,
he lent himself
some of that money, and the
other part is

14:50.056 --> 14:53.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that a lot of the money that was
spent went
to Trump's own companies.

14:53.092 --> 14:59.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: That's right, to his
air -- for
the airplane, the Trump aircraft
that he uses,

14:59.966 --> 15:06.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
toward the resorts that he owns,
or his companies
own, where he's used them for
news conferences

15:06.839 --> 15:08.741 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and for rallies.

15:08.775 --> 15:13.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So some of this money has gone
back to him.
Some of it, he's loaned. He's
sent mixed messages

15:13.246 --> 15:17.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on whether he's willing to put a
lot of money
into a general election. And you
see that...

15:17.583 --> 15:20.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Isn't that part of
his appeal,
that I'm a rich guy and I'm not
going to reach

15:20.253 --> 15:21.420 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in your pocket?

15:21.454 --> 15:22.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: And I can't be
bought. I'm not
going to...

15:22.255 --> 15:22.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I can't be
bought.

15:22.955 --> 15:24.757 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Yes. That's right.

15:24.791 --> 15:26.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, one thing that Republicans
will say is
that he hasn't done things in
the conventional

15:26.726 --> 15:31.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way this far, and he's gotten
the nomination.
It's -- I think it's true that
his core support

15:31.898 --> 15:36.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remains behind him, and maybe if
he appealed
to them for small donations,
maybe they would

15:36.636 --> 15:38.571 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
come through.

15:38.604 --> 15:42.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is this sense of the
clock ticking.
We are just 20-some days away
from the Republican

15:42.375 --> 15:44.210 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Convention.

15:44.243 --> 15:46.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Matea, you talked
about small
dollars. What about the big
dollars, the deep

15:46.179 --> 15:50.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pockets of people like Charles
Koch and the
-- who really helped Mitt Romney
and have

15:50.850 --> 15:53.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
helped previous party nominees?

15:53.152 --> 15:55.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: Well, so it's a
really mixed picture.

15:55.922 --> 16:01.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Koch network, which is a
very powerful
organization which really runs
its own sort

16:01.894 --> 16:06.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of shadow political party, it's
completely
focused on competitive Senate
races right

16:06.732 --> 16:11.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now and is staying out of the
presidential
race. There are some longtime
veteran party

16:11.704 --> 16:16.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fund-raisers who had signed on
and lent their
name to the Trump fund-raising
effort with

16:16.742 --> 16:18.477 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the RNC.

16:18.511 --> 16:22.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, I have been told that a
lot of those
people are sort of signed on in
name only,

16:22.715 --> 16:27.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and there are sort of limited
amounts of impact
that they're able to have trying
to get people

16:27.119 --> 16:31.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
signed up to bundle checks from
their friends
and family. So I think it's
really a mixed

16:31.090 --> 16:32.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
picture right now.

16:32.925 --> 16:35.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, you're waiting
to see what
happens with the next campaign
finance reports

16:35.595 --> 16:37.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in June. That's what he said
today.

16:37.096 --> 16:38.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: That's right.

16:38.965 --> 16:41.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And let's see what happens in
the polls, too,
because one of the surprising
things is, as

16:41.467 --> 16:46.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terrible a time as Donald Trump
has had the
last couple of weeks, he has not
-- Hillary

16:46.505 --> 16:51.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton has only a small lead
nationwide.
And you had Quinnipiac polls
coming out today

16:51.477 --> 16:55.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that showed it basically tied up
in Pennsylvania
and Ohio, two key states.

16:55.481 --> 17:00.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this gives Republicans some
hope that
with the shakeup in the Trump
organization,

17:00.286 --> 17:04.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the departure of Corey
Lewandowski as the
campaign manager, maybe Trump is
ready to

17:04.190 --> 17:07.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make some of the changes that
Republicans
really believe he has to make if
this is going

17:07.526 --> 17:09.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be a competitive race.

17:09.362 --> 17:19.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Susan Page of USA
Today, and Matea
Gold of The Washington Post,
thank you both.

17:19.405 --> 17:26.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATEA GOLD: Thank you.

17:26.646 --> 17:33.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Just last week, the
International
Association of Athletic
Federations, also

17:34.020 --> 17:40.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
known as the IAAF, voted to ban
Russia's track
and field team from competing at
this summer's

17:40.293 --> 17:43.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Olympics in Rio de Janeiro
because of widespread
doping.

17:43.863 --> 17:49.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the International Olympic
Committee
agreed, but added one
significant loophole.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang has that story.

17:51.137 --> 17:56.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The IAAF decision was
unprecedented
in Olympic history. Russian
President Vladimir

17:56.742 --> 18:00.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Putin slammed it as unfair
collective punishment.

18:00.880 --> 18:07.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today's move by the IOC seems to
send a contradictory
signal. On the one hand, the IOC
did uphold

18:07.520 --> 18:12.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the ban. But it also said that
Russia's track
and field athletes could
participate if they

18:13.025 --> 18:17.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pass follow-up drug tests
administered in
other countries.

18:17.496 --> 18:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is a lot of confused
reaction to all
of this.

18:20.299 --> 18:25.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to help us understand it
all, Christine
Brennan is back with us. She's a
sportswriter,

18:25.738 --> 18:29.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
columnist and commentator with
USA Today and
ABC News.

18:29.575 --> 18:35.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Christine, this is very
confusing. On the
one hand, they uphold the ban,
and they say

18:35.114 --> 18:40.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the IAAF was -- they
respected their
right to impose the ban. But
they also opened

18:40.252 --> 18:43.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the door for athletes to
compete. How does
this work?

18:43.723 --> 18:45.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN, USA Today:
Oh, it's going
to be confusion.

18:45.691 --> 18:48.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have never seen -- I have
covered the Olympics,
John, for 32 years. I have never
seen anything

18:48.194 --> 18:53.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like this. We're six weeks out
from the Rio
opening ceremonies, and this
could be a situation

18:53.132 --> 18:58.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where we don't know who is
marching in under
the Russian flag or the Olympic
flag in terms

18:58.037 --> 19:03.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of athletes, track and field
athletes from
Russia, until they march in, in
the opening

19:03.175 --> 19:05.011 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ceremony.

19:05.044 --> 19:08.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a battle right now we're
seeing between
the IOC and the International
Track and Field

19:08.848 --> 19:12.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Federation. We have never seen
anything quite
like this.

19:12.818 --> 19:17.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Why is this going on?
Why are these
two organizations battling this
out?

19:17.289 --> 19:20.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Can I blame
it on Vladimir
Putin?

19:20.159 --> 19:25.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He -- Putin put an Olympics in
the middle
of nowhere, spent $51 billion --
billion with

19:25.331 --> 19:31.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a B -- dollars to do that. And I
think that
we're talking about an old boys'
network here,

19:31.404 --> 19:35.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very old boys' network, with the
IOC. Think
FIFA.

19:35.641 --> 19:41.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Putin did them a big favor
to the tune
of $51 billion, John. And there
is no doubt

19:41.347 --> 19:45.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Putin has a voice and has a say
within the
International Olympic Committee.
If they had

19:45.284 --> 19:50.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just said no Russian athletes at
all, the
IOC has said this, which is what
the IAAF

19:50.122 --> 19:53.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has basically said -- the IAAF
has gone against
Putin.

19:53.659 --> 19:57.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The International Olympic
Committee has left
the door open a crack, and that
is all because

19:57.596 --> 19:59.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Putin bailed them out two years
ago.

19:59.398 --> 20:02.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And we should point
out that the
IOC publicly says they're doing
this because

20:02.501 --> 20:05.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the presumption of innocence of
these athletes
is being damaged.

20:05.938 --> 20:10.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Right, but --
right. We
weren't born yesterday in terms
of the politics

20:11.010 --> 20:12.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of international sport.

20:12.812 --> 20:17.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will say this. The idea of
having clean
athletes at the Olympics, the
Russian system

20:17.049 --> 20:20.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is rotten to the core. That is
what we have
seen over and over again. The
World Anti-Doping

20:20.686 --> 20:25.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Agency saying you cannot trust
anyone who
has gone through the doping
system in Russia.

20:25.624 --> 20:29.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the idea of having --
finding clean
athletes, you would almost need
a time machine

20:29.728 --> 20:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to go back a couple years and
test them under,
say, U.S. or Western European
rules.

20:34.667 --> 20:39.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And because we can't trust the
Russian system,
and what they have been doing,
their doping

20:39.071 --> 20:43.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
facilities, I don't know how
we're going to
-- they're going to get clean
results for

20:43.075 --> 20:47.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these athletes in six weeks. You
will see
someone, say, who ran the New
York City Marathon,

20:47.213 --> 20:50.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well, if they had a clean test
there, OK,
that's one.

20:50.049 --> 20:54.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that's certainly wouldn't --
I don't think
would give us any confidence
that that athlete

20:54.920 --> 20:56.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has been clean for the last
couple of years.

20:56.789 --> 21:01.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: So, do we know how
they're going
to try to prove their innocence
and how -- what

21:01.327 --> 21:05.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the IOC has in mind when they
say they have
got to pass these follow-up
tests?

21:05.297 --> 21:08.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: I think the
endgame here
is that they are going to want
to get some

21:08.167 --> 21:09.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russian athletes into the
Olympics.

21:09.935 --> 21:13.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, again, I know this sounds
like cloak
and dagger and like some kind of
Bond movie,

21:13.506 --> 21:17.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but I really think we're there
with this,
because of this incredible,
unprecedented

21:17.643 --> 21:21.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
battle between these two
powerful organizations.

21:21.313 --> 21:26.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact that you have got the
track and field
athletes, you have also got
Russian swimmers,

21:27.019 --> 21:32.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John, and several others.
There's another
report coming out in mid-July
about the state-sponsored

21:32.224 --> 21:37.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
systemic doping among the
Russian athletes.
So, at that point, you might
hear the cry

21:37.863 --> 21:40.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to have the Russian athletes be
completely
kicked out of the Olympic Games.

21:40.833 --> 21:45.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that's only two weeks before
Rio. I think
what we could see happening is
many more Russian

21:45.137 --> 21:48.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
athletes than we even think
about right now
being allowed in, only because
they're going

21:48.607 --> 21:50.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to run out of time to prove that
they're guilty.

21:50.743 --> 21:53.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: We have got less than
a minute
left, and we have got all sorts
of issues

21:53.846 --> 21:55.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
surrounding the Rio Olympics.

21:55.681 --> 21:59.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're less than six weeks away.
You have the
Zika virus. You have got
questions about health

21:59.952 --> 22:04.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and safety down there. And now
you have got
this. Is there a big cloud
that's going to

22:04.323 --> 22:05.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be over these Games?

22:05.624 --> 22:07.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: There could
be unlike any
other Olympics.

22:07.393 --> 22:10.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Usually, there's always
something that you
think about, terrorism in Sochi
or terrorism

22:10.629 --> 22:15.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Athens, a home game for the
terrorists
at the Olympics in Athens in
'04, and then

22:15.601 --> 22:17.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nothing bad happens.

22:17.436 --> 22:21.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question here is maybe will
Rio be that
first Olympic city to be
consumed by the Olympic

22:21.774 --> 22:25.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Games? Because, as you said, so
many things
on their plate. And then you
throw in this

22:25.578 --> 22:29.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian controversy. And I hope
that's not
the case, but I think Rio might
really be

22:29.915 --> 22:32.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that first Olympic city to have
real trouble
hosting the Games.

22:32.952 --> 22:35.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Two months away. We
will see what
happens.

22:35.154 --> 22:41.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Christine Brennan, thanks so
much for being
with us.

22:41.160 --> 22:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Thank you,
John.

22:47.666 --> 22:55.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Coming up on the
"NewsHour": Venezuelans
hit their breaking point as food
and resources

22:55.808 --> 23:01.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
become scarce; addressing the
high population
of prisoners with disabilities;
and breaking

23:01.780 --> 23:05.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down the genius of Cole Porter's
most famous
songs.

23:05.651 --> 23:11.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: For years, Common
Core academic
standards for math and English
have been the

23:11.123 --> 23:13.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
subject of battles all over the
country.

23:13.659 --> 23:18.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's also a move afoot to
set new standards
for science as well, and a
number of states

23:18.964 --> 23:22.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are starting to adopt them
voluntarily.

23:22.234 --> 23:26.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent John
Tulenko of Education
Week reports.

23:26.305 --> 23:34.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: It takes just 10
minutes to
cross through Gillette, Wyoming.
This small

23:34.246 --> 23:41.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
city sits in the northeast
corner of the state,
surrounded by hundreds of miles
of prairie.

23:41.353 --> 23:47.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But schools here in Campbell
County are on
the edge of something big, the
next generation

23:47.593 --> 23:49.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
science standards.

23:49.495 --> 23:50.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTY MATHES, Sage Valley
Junior High School:
You are going to build a strand
of DNA, and

23:50.963 --> 23:54.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you are going to decode it and
figure out
what that DNA actually says.

23:55.000 --> 24:00.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: For Christy Mathes
at Sage Valley
Junior High School, the new
standards are

24:00.039 --> 24:02.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about learning to think like a
scientist.

24:02.241 --> 24:06.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTY MATHES: There's a lot of
really good
stuff in them. Every standard is
a performance

24:06.945 --> 24:12.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
task. It's not, the child needs
to memorize
these things. It's the student
needs to be

24:12.084 --> 24:18.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
able to do some pretty intense
stuff. We are
analyzing, we are critiquing, we
are creating,

24:18.090 --> 24:21.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we are actually doing the
science.

24:21.093 --> 24:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Take today's
lesson on genes.
Mathes had her students pick
fictional character

24:27.299 --> 24:32.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cards with the name, height,
hair and eye
color of each character.

24:32.237 --> 24:37.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTY MATHES: This is a
secret. Just you
and your group know.

24:37.309 --> 24:43.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: In teams, they
built a genetic
model of their character's
traits and then

24:43.315 --> 24:45.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the groups traded models.

24:45.050 --> 24:49.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTY MATHES: And then they're
going to
figure out who you had based on
what you code

24:49.755 --> 24:50.956 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for.

24:50.989 --> 24:54.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: OK, so orange,
red, red represents
what?

24:54.326 --> 24:56.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUDENT: She has blue eyes.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN TULENKO: Blue eyes.

24:58.831 --> 25:03.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What did you grasp about
genetics from doing
this exercise today?

25:03.268 --> 25:07.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: That there are so
different many
parts of genetics that go into
so many different

25:07.506 --> 25:12.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things. Something as small as
like the size
of a gene, it's really, really
small. It can

25:12.411 --> 25:14.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
change drastically how your life
turns out.

25:14.913 --> 25:19.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Developed by the
National Academy
of Sciences and others, the next
generation

25:19.918 --> 25:23.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
standards are more comprehensive
than what
teachers here had been using.

25:23.255 --> 25:25.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MAHONEY, Sage Valley
Junior High School:
You might have had a teacher
that liked a

25:25.324 --> 25:29.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dinosaur unit, and they threw it
out in the
2nd grade, and then the same
unit get taught

25:29.161 --> 25:32.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the 3rd grade and in the 4th
grade, and
you're like, well, I know a lot
about dinosaurs.

25:32.164 --> 25:37.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Before the new
standards, middle
school teachers like Mike
Mahoney were left

25:37.102 --> 25:38.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to fill the gaps.

25:38.904 --> 25:42.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MAHONEY: I would always
have to start
at the -- like nobody knew
anything, at the

25:42.708 --> 25:48.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very beginning: What is science?
And it's
kind of tough to get into a lot
of the different

25:48.781 --> 25:52.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
curriculum things that you want
to teach when
you have to spend so much time
just on the

25:52.217 --> 25:53.952 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
basics.

25:53.986 --> 25:57.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: The new standards
brought more
structure, spelling out for the
first time

25:57.289 --> 26:00.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what should be taught, grade by
grade, in
elementary school.

26:00.459 --> 26:05.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTY MATHES: Every 5th grader
is going
to have this experience. Every
4th grader

26:05.531 --> 26:10.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is going to have this
experience. Then those
kids come to junior high and
it's not a catch-up

26:10.803 --> 26:15.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
game. You know, what did you
miss? What did
you get? What do I need to do?
They are always

26:15.207 --> 26:18.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
building on what came before and
what comes
next.

26:18.210 --> 26:22.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: In Wyoming,
Campbell County
is leading the way with these
standards, which

26:22.881 --> 26:27.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the state has yet to adopt
officially; 17
other states are already on
board, accounting

26:28.020 --> 26:34.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for an estimated 35 percent of
public school
students nationwide.

26:34.626 --> 26:37.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Evans heads the National
Association
of Science Teachers.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID EVANS, Executive Director,
National
Association of Science Teachers:
I think that

26:39.231 --> 26:44.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the most important reason for
developing new
standards is that we have
actually learned

26:44.336 --> 26:51.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot about the way children
learn. And children
learn science best by actually
doing it.

26:51.977 --> 26:56.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: So far, there's
been little
pushback. Unlike the Common
Core, there aren't

26:56.482 --> 27:01.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yet state-level science tests to
hold schools
and teachers accountable, and
the federal

27:01.086 --> 27:02.788 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
role has been different too.

27:02.821 --> 27:06.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID EVANS: The federal
government and the
Department of Education really
hasn't had

27:06.758 --> 27:11.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anything to do with the next
generation science
standards. It's really just that
simple. There

27:11.697 --> 27:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have not been strong incentives
and there
hasn't been any arm-twisting.

27:14.199 --> 27:17.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: But these new
standards still
have a long way to go.

27:17.936 --> 27:23.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID EVANS: There's an
established line of
data right now that documents
the fact that

27:23.041 --> 27:27.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're not spending very much
time teaching
science in elementary school.

27:27.179 --> 27:33.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Nationwide,
schools spend 143
minutes a day on math and
reading, but only

27:33.218 --> 27:36.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
20 minutes on science. And
there's another
big concern.

27:36.255 --> 27:42.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID EVANS: The majority of
elementary school
teachers don't feel comfortable
teaching science.

27:42.194 --> 27:47.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most elementary school teachers
don't receive
a lot of preparation in science
itself or

27:47.065 --> 27:48.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in science education.

27:48.634 --> 27:51.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: So how does the light
travel?

27:51.470 --> 27:55.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: To help its
teachers, Campbell
County is using a federal grant
worth just

27:55.908 --> 27:59.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
under a million dollars to
develop new lessons
for every grade.

27:59.778 --> 28:01.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jamie Howe teaches 4th grade.

28:01.547 --> 28:09.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE HOWE, Teacher: I have
learned to step
back and let their exploration
take over.

28:09.588 --> 28:14.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, before, you know, you would
always want
to help them and guide them and
tell them

28:14.526 --> 28:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what the answer should be. So I
have had to
learn to step back and let them
be in charge.

28:20.799 --> 28:22.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: We got it.

28:22.701 --> 28:27.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: That's Gillette, a
good-size
city for Wyoming. But the rest
of the state

28:27.439 --> 28:32.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looks more like this, tons of
open space and
very few people. That means the
schools out

28:32.978 --> 28:38.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here are often very small, and
they face a
unique set of challenges in
implementing next

28:38.417 --> 28:40.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
generation science standards.

28:40.552 --> 28:46.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wright Junior Senior High
School, 40 miles
south of Gillette, is a good
example. It has

28:46.558 --> 28:49.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some 200 students and only three
science teachers.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH SEAMANDS, Wright Junior
Senior High
School: One guy teaches 7th and
8th grade.

28:52.297 --> 28:55.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One guy teaches 9, 10. I teach
11 and 12.

28:55.934 --> 28:58.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Have you guys converted Celsius
to kelvins?

28:58.203 --> 29:02.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Small schools like
Sarah Seamands'
can't support having specialists
to teach

29:02.507 --> 29:06.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just biology or physics. She has
to do it
all.

29:06.211 --> 29:08.046 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How many subjects do you teach
here?

29:08.080 --> 29:13.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH SEAMANDS: I teach four
subjects. I teach
anatomy, chemistry,
environmental science,

29:14.019 --> 29:14.853 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and physics.

29:14.886 --> 29:16.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: What's that like
for you?

29:16.655 --> 29:23.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SARAH SEAMANDS: It's
challenging. Some weeks,
I nail the chemistry and physics
and maybe

29:23.228 --> 29:30.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
environmental science, and then,
my anatomy
class, I neglect them.

29:30.268 --> 29:34.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So then I got to do really
interesting things
with anatomy, and then my
chemistry class

29:34.940 --> 29:37.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kind of falls off. At least,
that's how I
feel.

29:37.142 --> 29:42.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: With the new
standards, teachers
like Seamands will have to
change not in one

29:42.314 --> 29:44.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
subject, but four.

29:44.116 --> 29:50.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH SEAMANDS: They have just
told us it's
coming, that it's in -- it's on
its way, and

29:50.088 --> 29:53.191 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be prepared, because things are
going to change.

29:53.225 --> 29:58.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Ready or not,
Wyoming is on
the verge of adopting the new
standards statewide,

29:58.230 --> 30:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but with one big exception.

30:01.867 --> 30:06.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is coal country, and
officials removed
language that had emphasized the
major role

30:06.972 --> 30:12.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of human activities, such as
fossil fuel combustion,
when teaching students about the
causes of

30:12.811 --> 30:14.813 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
global warming.

30:14.846 --> 30:21.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID EVANS: Changing the
standards to prevent
teachers from teaching what is
clearly scientifically

30:21.853 --> 30:26.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
accepted documented information
is unfortunate.

30:27.025 --> 30:31.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the practices of science and
the way that
science is done and teaching
students to be

30:31.963 --> 30:37.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
able to go out and ask their own
questions,
collect the evidence, and know
how to engage

30:37.402 --> 30:40.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a scientific argument is very
encouraging.

30:40.572 --> 30:46.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Today, Wyoming has
put its modified
standards out for public review.
They could

30:46.078 --> 30:50.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
make it to the governor's desk
for approval
by late fall.

30:50.248 --> 30:58.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Campbell County, Wyoming, I'm
John Tulenko
of Education Week, reporting for
the "PBS

30:58.190 --> 31:01.426 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
NewsHour."

31:01.460 --> 31:14.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The fall in world
oil prices has
likely hit no country as hard as
it has Venezuela.

31:14.606 --> 31:20.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once flush with cash, the
country is now in
crisis, with a collapsing
economy, skyrocketing

31:20.946 --> 31:26.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crime and inflation rates, and
major food
shortages, all this as the
government of President

31:26.585 --> 31:30.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nicolas Maduro tries to maintain
control.

31:30.222 --> 31:35.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on this situation, we
turn to Nicholas
Casey of The New York Times, who
is reporting

31:35.060 --> 31:36.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tonight from Caracas.

31:36.595 --> 31:38.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you for joining us.

31:38.430 --> 31:43.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Nicholas, give me a sense
about how long
this collapse -- it feels like a
slow-motion

31:43.135 --> 31:46.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
collapse -- how long has it been
going on
and what has caused it?

31:46.404 --> 31:49.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS CASEY, The New York
Times: It's been
going on for a couple of years
now.

31:49.674 --> 31:54.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's been tied to the
collapse in oil
prices in Venezuela. Venezuela
gets almost

31:54.980 --> 31:59.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all of its revenue from oil. So,
when these
prices started to collapse, the
first thing

31:59.785 --> 32:05.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you saw was that some of the
foods started
to disappear, not in huge
quantities, but

32:05.490 --> 32:09.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
enough that there were lines in
front of stores.

32:09.161 --> 32:14.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The electricity started to
disappear. There's
even problems with water right
now because

32:14.132 --> 32:18.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the government doesn't have the
money that
it needs. Now, what's happened
with the food

32:18.503 --> 32:22.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that there has been so much
which has gone
at this point, that people are
starting to

32:22.841 --> 32:24.609 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
get hungry.

32:24.643 --> 32:30.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And last week and the week
before, we saw
a wave of lootings of stores.
People basically

32:30.048 --> 32:34.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
left these lines that they were
gathered in
and started to go directly into
the stores,

32:34.953 --> 32:37.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
break down the doors, and take
things that
were inside.

32:37.122 --> 32:43.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You say that the
lack -- the collapse
of the oil -- of oil prices
contributed to

32:43.428 --> 32:51.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this. How much was that tied up
with the collapse
in faith of this current
leadership, of President

32:51.136 --> 32:54.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maduro? How much of one thing
creating the
other?

32:54.339 --> 32:59.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS CASEY: Well, it's not
just, as you
point out, the collapse of the
oil prices

32:59.878 --> 33:02.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which has caused what's happened
here.

33:02.814 --> 33:07.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are other countries, like
Mexico and
Brazil, which have a lot of oil
revenues themselves,

33:07.252 --> 33:14.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and don't have the same problems
as Venezuela.
Venezuela and Maduro came after
years of what

33:14.125 --> 33:19.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of economists say was
economic mismanagement
by Hugo Chavez, who totally
transformed the

33:19.698 --> 33:21.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
economy here.

33:21.499 --> 33:26.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government spent lots of
money, lots of
money, and didn't save much for
a time when

33:26.037 --> 33:31.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the price of oil wouldn't be as
high as it
was before. So, now Venezuela
finds itself

33:31.243 --> 33:36.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the position where it needs
money. It doesn't
produce a lot of food. It needs
money to import

33:36.448 --> 33:38.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
food, and it doesn't have
anything right now.

33:38.783 --> 33:43.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in the short term, it's the
price of oil
which has got us here. But in
the long term,

33:43.989 --> 33:48.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's a lot of economic changes
that took place
in this country in the so-called
Bolivarian

33:48.760 --> 33:51.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Revolution that came from Hugo
Chavez.

33:51.263 --> 33:55.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: So, you are
witnessing food riots;
you are witnessing a lot of
economic angst

33:55.934 --> 34:02.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as well. Is there also hoarding
going on,
people who are just --
businesses or individual

34:02.741 --> 34:04.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
merchants who are just keeping
it to themselves?

34:04.943 --> 34:10.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS CASEY: Well, that's one
thing that
the government is blaming on
what's happening.

34:10.048 --> 34:15.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Personally, as a reporter, I
have not seen
people have been able to hoard
large amounts

34:15.320 --> 34:21.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of food, because there's not a
lot of food
to find. The idea of being able
to hoard eggs

34:21.793 --> 34:26.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or sugar or rice seems almost
impossible,
given the amounts of these
things that are

34:26.731 --> 34:28.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
arriving.

34:28.466 --> 34:30.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even on an individual level,
there's a
lot of people who would love to
be able to

34:30.936 --> 34:36.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a stash for the event that
they couldn't
get any more, but most people
are just thinking

34:36.474 --> 34:38.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of day to day, what they're able
to get.

34:38.643 --> 34:42.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Are there any
efforts under way
by international organizations,
like Organization

34:42.847 --> 34:45.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of American States, to try to
intervene, to
try to help?

34:45.850 --> 34:50.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS CASEY: Well, yes, the
OAS is trying
to put pressure now on
Venezuela.

34:50.355 --> 34:56.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's more political pressure
right now.
There is an effort under way to
recall President

34:56.695 --> 35:02.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nicolas Maduro, largely because
of all these
economic problems which the
country is having.

35:02.701 --> 35:07.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government seems to be
trying to slow
the process down, or at least
fight it.

35:07.072 --> 35:12.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what's happened now is that
the Organization
of American States is holding a
special meeting

35:12.610 --> 35:18.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this week to try to determine
whether Venezuela
is in violation of its
democratic charter.

35:18.550 --> 35:24.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, this could eventually
result in Venezuela
being kicked out of the OAS,
which is kind

35:24.322 --> 35:30.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of like a U.N. sort of body that
is in the
Western Hemisphere.

35:30.261 --> 35:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This would be an embarrassment
for Venezuela.
But in terms of changing the
situation with

35:35.133 --> 35:41.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how much food is here, that
doesn't get Venezuelans
very far. They're not going to
see suddenly

35:41.373 --> 35:46.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their eggs and rice on the
shelves because
of the political pressure that's
going on

35:46.978 --> 35:49.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against Venezuela from the
international community.

35:49.514 --> 35:53.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You wrote in one of
your stories
that eggs used to be used for
celebration,

35:53.318 --> 35:55.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but now an egg is like gold.

35:55.587 --> 35:58.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nicholas Casey of The New York
Times, thank
you for your reporting from
Caracas.

35:58.623 --> 36:04.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICHOLAS CASEY: Thanks for
having me.

36:04.996 --> 36:13.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now to our series on
Broken Justice.

36:13.538 --> 36:18.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we look at a part of
the criminal
justice system that tends to get
less attention,

36:18.543 --> 36:20.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
prisoners with disabilities.

36:20.412 --> 36:22.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Judy recorded this conversation
yesterday.

36:22.514 --> 36:27.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A new report
breaks down public
data to outline the scope of the
issue.

36:27.952 --> 36:34.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It says more than 750,000 people
with disabilities
are behind bars in the U.S.,
including more

36:34.793 --> 36:42.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
than half-a-million with
cognitive impairments,
at least 250,000 with mobility
problems, and

36:42.167 --> 36:46.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
140,000 who are blind or have
vision loss.

36:46.304 --> 36:51.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The report was issued by a
nonprofit disability
group known as RespectAbility,
which also

36:51.910 --> 36:57.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hopes to cast a spotlight on
what happens
to individuals after they leave
prison.

36:57.282 --> 37:02.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi is the
president and
CEO of this group, and she joins
me now.

37:02.587 --> 37:04.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to the program.

37:04.322 --> 37:05.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JENNIFER LASZLO MIZRAHI,
President and CEO,
RespectAbility: Thank you for
having me.

37:05.590 --> 37:07.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why was this
important for
you to focus on?

37:07.459 --> 37:11.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER LASZLO MIZRAHI: Well,
this was a
great injustice, because what
you predominantly

37:11.529 --> 37:16.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see are individuals of color,
people who are
African-Americans, Hispanic, new
immigrants,

37:16.901 --> 37:21.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whose disabilities were never
appropriately
diagnosed or addressed.

37:21.039 --> 37:25.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I myself am somebody with a
disability. And
so I know it can be harder to
get ahead, but

37:25.310 --> 37:31.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you are doubly disadvantaged,
if you have
multiple minority status, the
school-to-prison

37:31.216 --> 37:33.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pipeline is almost a direct
ticket.

37:33.384 --> 37:37.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I know I was just
looking at
some census data this afternoon.
People with

37:37.188 --> 37:40.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
disabilities make up something
like 19, 20
percent of population overall.

37:40.959 --> 37:46.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But your report finds they are
over 30 percent
of people behind bars in this
country. How

37:46.598 --> 37:48.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
did that happen?

37:48.500 --> 37:52.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER LASZLO MIZRAHI: It
really happens
when young people who have
dyslexia or executive

37:52.403 --> 37:57.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
function disorder don't get the
diagnosis,
don't get the accommodations
that they need

37:57.675 --> 37:59.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and they deserve in school.

37:59.611 --> 38:04.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They wind up getting in trouble,
getting suspended,
dropping out of school. They're
not graduating

38:04.516 --> 38:08.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
high school and they're getting
in trouble
very early. So you can really
see the problem

38:08.453 --> 38:13.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only -- already almost predict
the outcome
when somebody is in the third
grade, if these

38:13.658 --> 38:15.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
issues are not addressed.

38:15.193 --> 38:18.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is one of your
arguments that
they were wrongly convicted?

38:18.630 --> 38:23.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER LASZLO MIZRAHI: In some
cases, yes,
because, in some cases, what has
happened

38:23.134 --> 38:28.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is they have an intellectual
disability that
they don't understand the
charges that are

38:28.139 --> 38:33.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against them, and they have not
gotten the
legal -- the legal support that
they need.

38:33.444 --> 38:37.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in some cases, they're
very, very smart,
and they might be deaf. There's
all kinds

38:37.415 --> 38:42.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of situation where individuals
who are hearing-impaired
are not given the right language
supports

38:43.021 --> 38:46.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
with ASL, American Sign
Language, so they
can defend themselves.

38:46.157 --> 38:50.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have real injustice for
people who
are in jail, and there are
people who committed

38:50.195 --> 38:53.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crimes because their path to
success wasn't
in place.

38:53.498 --> 38:58.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: To what extent
are our jails,
our city jails, county jails,
and state and

38:58.603 --> 39:02.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
federal prisons equipped to deal
with these
issues?

39:02.407 --> 39:05.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER LASZLO MIZRAHI: They
are not even
remotely equipped to deal. And
most of it

39:05.810 --> 39:08.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is not equipment. It's actually
training.
It's awareness.

39:08.913 --> 39:14.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, somebody who lived
in a house
with lead paint poisoning,
somebody like Freddie

39:14.285 --> 39:18.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gray, who is a case we're all
familiar with,
he didn't have the ability to
follow multistep

39:18.957 --> 39:20.992 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
instructions.

39:21.025 --> 39:25.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, in school, people
thought he had behavior
differences, when it was really
learning differences.

39:25.330 --> 39:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so he was suspended, and
then he didn't
complete school, and then he was
in and out

39:28.967 --> 39:30.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the correction system.

39:30.735 --> 39:35.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then when somebody like that
goes into
incarceration, again, lots of
complicated

39:35.073 --> 39:38.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
instructions, and before you
know it, they're
in solitary confinement.

39:38.109 --> 39:45.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: To what extent
are either legislators,
are federal -- are the Congress
looking at

39:45.650 --> 39:51.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this issue, addressing it? You
and I were
just speaking about efforts
right now to look

39:51.689 --> 39:55.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at prison reform. But you were
saying disabilities
are not a part of that.

39:55.693 --> 39:58.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JENNIFER LASZLO MIZRAHI:
Unfortunately, the
data just has not been known.

39:58.463 --> 40:03.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's sort of like the housing
crisis, where
all the data was sitting there
hidden in plain

40:03.768 --> 40:08.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sight, but nobody was looking at
it. It's
really this explosive bomb of
information

40:08.640 --> 40:10.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that no one was looking at.

40:10.508 --> 40:14.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the new legislation that is
being proposed
does not address any of these
issues at all.

40:14.946 --> 40:20.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By the way, I do support these
prison reforms.
There are people who really
shouldn't be in

40:21.019 --> 40:25.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the prison system because of
their long sentences
for nonviolent offenses.

40:25.723 --> 40:30.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you have got to have a
pathway to get
a job, because the way things
are now, these

40:30.361 --> 40:36.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
individuals who leave
incarceration, they're
not literate, and they wind up
back in prison.

40:36.200 --> 40:40.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it is -- as
we said a moment,
it is part of the focus of this
report, what

40:40.672 --> 40:45.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
these individuals with
disabilities face once,
if and when they are released.

40:45.376 --> 40:47.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JENNIFER LASZLO MIZRAHI: Right.

40:47.345 --> 40:51.449 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What you see is that
three-quarters of individuals
who are released from
incarceration -- and,

40:51.482 --> 40:56.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the way, that's 600,000
people every single
year -- within five years,
three-quarters

40:57.021 --> 41:01.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of them are back in jail. The
system is broken,
and it absolutely must be fixed.

41:01.659 --> 41:05.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How -- Jennifer
Mizrahi, how
do you -- how do you even begin
to get your

41:05.897 --> 41:12.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
arms around this? What are some
steps that
you argue need to be taken
immediately and

41:12.303 --> 41:14.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the near term?

41:14.205 --> 41:17.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER LASZLO MIZRAHI: Well,
in terms of
thinking about when people
reenter the community,

41:17.375 --> 41:22.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you need to be ready to have
scaffolding for
success, so that people can get
a job, so

41:22.246 --> 41:24.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that they can get their
medication.

41:24.248 --> 41:29.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People with significant mental
health differences
who need medication to keep from
having psychotic

41:29.821 --> 41:34.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
episodes leave incarceration
with no health
care, and therefore no medicine,
and then

41:34.692 --> 41:38.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's not surprising that they're
doing something
that's putting them back in
jail.

41:38.796 --> 41:42.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there's basic things on the
exit. There's
things you need to do for
accommodations while

41:42.900 --> 41:48.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're incarcerated, especially
around literacy
and training, to help them build
those skills.

41:48.539 --> 41:53.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then there is to ensure that
the prison
pipeline doesn't continue,
starting really

41:53.411 --> 41:58.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
very much with early
intervention, particularly
in minority communities, to make
sure they're

41:58.316 --> 42:00.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
getting the tools that they need
to succeed.

42:00.551 --> 42:04.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How should people
think -- I
know there's been a lot of, of
course, publicity

42:04.188 --> 42:09.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about crimes of all sort that
get attention
in the news media all the time.
Public -- people

42:09.627 --> 42:11.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
read about it and they hear
about it.

42:11.929 --> 42:17.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do they understand and weigh
the difference
between a disability that is
causing someone

42:17.935 --> 42:26.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do something to commit a
crime, and one
that where there's will involved
and a disability,

42:26.611 --> 42:31.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and it's something for which one
has to serve
time, must be held accountable?

42:31.182 --> 42:35.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER LASZLO MIZRAHI: Well, a
crime clearly
is something that harms another
person. And

42:35.520 --> 42:40.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so if you're harming people,
then there has
to be something to be done.

42:40.691 --> 42:45.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, in many cases, you can go
to a mental
health treatment program or an
addiction program

42:45.563 --> 42:51.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
or a work program. The
alternative sentencing
is really important, because
America has only

42:51.302 --> 42:57.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
5 percent of the world's
population, but we
have 25 percent of the world's
incarcerated

42:57.074 --> 42:58.443 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
prisoners.

42:58.476 --> 43:02.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's incredible; 2.2 million
Americans are
currently incarcerated.

43:02.980 --> 43:09.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jennifer Laszlo
Mizrahi, with
the group RespectAbility, we
thank you very

43:09.320 --> 43:10.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
much for talking to us.

43:10.888 --> 43:15.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER LASZLO MIZRAHI: Thank
you very much
for your focus on these issues.

43:15.960 --> 43:28.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Cole Porter left a
legacy as one
of the nation's finest composers
and songwriters.

43:28.039 --> 43:32.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was born in Indiana 125 years
ago this
month.

43:32.710 --> 43:38.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To celebrate, Jeffrey Brown once
again joined
composer and musicologist Rob
Kapilow at Signature

43:38.716 --> 43:40.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Theatre in Arlington, Virginia.

43:40.885 --> 43:45.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's the latest in our
occasional series on
what makes great music great.

43:45.289 --> 43:47.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Rob Kapilow,
welcome back.

43:47.959 --> 43:49.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW, Composer: So great
to be here.

43:49.727 --> 43:51.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Cole Porter this
time, OK,
so you have picked one of his
most famous

43:51.963 --> 43:53.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
songs, "You're the Top!"

43:53.364 --> 43:57.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW (singing): You're
the top. You're
the Coliseum.

43:57.702 --> 43:59.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Who could forget that?

43:59.504 --> 44:01.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You're the
Coliseum, it shows
he's a man known for the
sophistication of

44:01.706 --> 44:04.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his language, right, the sort of
high-Brown,
but low-brow as well.

44:04.742 --> 44:05.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROB KAPILOW: Right.

44:05.943 --> 44:07.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And for the
songs, because
he did both.

44:07.812 --> 44:10.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: He did both, but
the truth is,
though he's really famous for
these incredibly

44:11.015 --> 44:15.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
witty, sophisticated lyrics with
these erudite
rhymes and imagery, it's
actually the way

44:15.419 --> 44:17.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they combine with the music that
makes it
so unforgettable.

44:17.788 --> 44:22.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And people often underestimate
how crucial
the music is to those famous
lyrics.

44:22.760 --> 44:24.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, how does it
work in this
song?

44:24.495 --> 44:26.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: So, let's take the
most famous
one, "You're the Top!" the
opening one.

44:26.397 --> 44:29.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, it seems like who could
possibly ruin
that great lyric? I mean, it's
got an exclamation

44:29.867 --> 44:32.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mark. "You're the top!" But let
me ruin it
for you.

44:32.603 --> 44:34.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OK. He could have written this.

44:34.238 --> 44:36.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
(singing): You're the top.

44:36.073 --> 44:41.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, I mean, the lyric stays the
same. My
version simply leapt one octave
to the same

44:41.679 --> 44:48.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
notes. He leaps one note higher
to this great
dissonance, but then a full
octave higher,

44:48.085 --> 44:51.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this huge leap. It's a leap up
to the top.

44:51.822 --> 44:56.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in a way, that leap, all the
energy of
the leap and the dissonance
already tells

44:56.127 --> 45:00.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us what "You're the Top!" is
about before
we have heard a single note from
the voice.

45:00.097 --> 45:06.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COLE PORTER, Musician (singing):
You're the
top. You're the Coliseum. You're
the top.

45:06.070 --> 45:09.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You're the Louvre museum.

45:09.707 --> 45:15.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This song, it's
not a story,
right, because not much happens.
It's just

45:15.179 --> 45:19.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him -- over and over again,
you're the top,
in different language. But
you're saying it's

45:19.116 --> 45:20.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
also in different music.

45:20.851 --> 45:24.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: It's the music that
makes the
language so witty, just that
difference.

45:24.555 --> 45:30.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It could have been after this
leap, all even
notes, you're the top. But,
instead of square

45:30.294 --> 45:36.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the beat, you're the top,
it's syncopated,
not just the top, you're the
top, but even

45:36.834 --> 45:38.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you're. You're the top.

45:38.603 --> 45:42.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's that swingy rhythm that
tells us
what you're the top feels like.
So instead

45:42.540 --> 45:48.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a boring version, you're the
top, it's
the music that makes it --
you're the top.

45:48.813 --> 45:50.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's what makes it so
fantastic.

45:50.615 --> 45:53.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And he was one of
these composers
who did both music and lyrics.

45:53.884 --> 45:56.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: He did do both the
music and
lyrics, and that makes people
tend to think

45:56.921 --> 45:59.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that somehow it really matters
which comes
first.

45:59.624 --> 46:03.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the most frequently asked
question of
all songwriters. Which comes
first, the music

46:03.427 --> 46:04.028 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and the lyrics?

46:04.061 --> 46:05.196 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Of course.

46:05.229 --> 46:07.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ROB KAPILOW: It makes no
difference. In a
great song...

46:07.598 --> 46:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: No difference?

46:08.499 --> 46:10.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: No difference
whatsoever.

46:10.368 --> 46:14.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a great song, once words and
music combine,
they become a new, completely
interdependent

46:14.105 --> 46:18.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
element. Words cease to have a
purely literary
meaning, and music ceases to
have a purely

46:18.743 --> 46:23.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
musical meaning. Though it's
true, these are
enormously sophisticated lyrics,
without the

46:23.047 --> 46:27.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
music, they would never work,
and the last
line of this first verse is a
perfect example.

46:27.618 --> 46:30.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it's everything that
people think
of when they think of Cole
Porter. You have

46:30.921 --> 46:35.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got these three great images.
So, what are
you? You're a Bendel bonnet.
That means a

46:35.126 --> 46:39.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bonnet from that upper-class
women's store,
Bendel's. You're a Bendel bonnet
and a Shakespeare

46:39.930 --> 46:41.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sonnet.

46:41.799 --> 46:44.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first thing that makes it
great is this
syncopation. He goes, you're up,
Bendel bonnet.

46:44.268 --> 46:47.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The same thing for Shakespeare
sonnet.

46:47.672 --> 46:53.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COLE PORTER (singing): You're a
Bendel bonnet,
a Shakespeare's sonnet. You're
Mickey Mouse.

46:53.644 --> 46:58.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: So what do we
finish with? You're
Mickey Mouse, incredibly
low-brow, popular

46:58.983 --> 47:01.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the '30s, introduced in 1928.

47:01.318 --> 47:06.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's that combination of the
syncopation
and the music underneath that
makes these

47:06.424 --> 47:08.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
witty, sophisticated lyrics
unforgettable.

47:08.592 --> 47:10.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
(singing): You're a Bendel
bonnet, a Shakespeare
sonnet. You're Mickey Mouse.

47:10.394 --> 47:13.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then the piano almost speaks
to you.

47:13.764 --> 47:16.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
(singing): Yes, you're Mickey
Mouse.

47:17.001 --> 47:21.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're back for another round
of great
Porter.

47:21.072 --> 47:23.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This goes to what
we often
talk about, what makes a great
song, right?

47:23.874 --> 47:27.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: Yes. What makes a
great song
is not the great words and it's
not the great

47:27.078 --> 47:32.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
music. It's the combination of
the two. Words
mean nothing by themselves.
Music means nothing

47:32.183 --> 47:37.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by themselves. The two reinforce
themselves
and become a new unit that
cannot be understood

47:37.154 --> 47:40.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
separately. And in Porter's
case, he wrote
both and they are both great.

47:40.391 --> 47:41.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Cole Porter.

47:42.026 --> 47:42.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Rob Kapilow, thanks.

47:42.626 --> 47:46.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROB KAPILOW: Thank you.

47:47.031 --> 47:58.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now an on-air peek
at our new
online series, "ScienceScope."

47:58.676 --> 48:04.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the first episode, "NewsHour"
science producer,
Nsikan Akpan, delves into the
world of smells,

48:04.415 --> 48:08.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and how every sniff we make
changes odor itself.

48:08.085 --> 48:12.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Whoa. What's that?
It looks
like a space alien puked.

48:12.990 --> 48:20.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can you guess what it is? That
is an odor,
or at least what an odor looks
like. Odors

48:20.064 --> 48:24.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are normally invisible, swirling
around us.
But I will tell you the secret
behind why

48:24.435 --> 48:26.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you can see this one.

48:26.971 --> 48:35.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hey there. My name is Nsikan
Akpan, and you
have landed upon the first
episode of "ScienceScope."

48:35.079 --> 48:40.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here, we will put science itself
under a microscope,
showing you how amazing
discoveries are made

48:40.384 --> 48:42.153 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the people behind them.

48:42.186 --> 48:46.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First up, these trippy looking
waves. This
smell-scape is brought to you by
high-powered

48:46.657 --> 48:49.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lasers, a gigantic tank of water
and this
guy.

48:49.794 --> 48:53.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CRIMALDI, University of
Colorado at Boulder:
You can learn more about this
problem from

48:53.430 --> 48:57.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sitting and looking at something
like this
than just anything else.

48:57.067 --> 49:02.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: That's John
Crimaldi, an engineer
and fluid mechanist at the
University of Colorado,

49:02.206 --> 49:04.008 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Boulder.

49:04.041 --> 49:09.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His lab studies how smells move
through space.
Do they drift like clouds or
curl like smoke,

49:09.380 --> 49:13.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or do smells have another shape
altogether?
The answers will lay the
foundation for a

49:13.584 --> 49:19.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nationwide project that is
studying how animals
and humans use smells to map
their surroundings.

49:19.523 --> 49:25.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CRIMALDI: If we have
situations where
we want to detect, say, a
location of a chemical

49:25.796 --> 49:30.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weapon, or if we want to try and
find hidden
contraband, or if we want to
find somebody

49:30.801 --> 49:36.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's trapped under the snow in
an avalanche,
the tools we use in the 21st
century to do

49:36.941 --> 49:37.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this are animals.

49:37.842 --> 49:39.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Or people.

49:39.677 --> 49:43.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that puts both at tremendous
risk. Crimaldi
and his colleagues want to
outsource this

49:43.881 --> 49:48.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
risk to robots by teaching them
how to smell.
That sounds pretty wild, I know.
But think

49:49.019 --> 49:53.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about it. We have machines to
replace our
other senses, such as cameras
with facial

49:53.257 --> 49:59.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recognition or implants to
restore our hearing,
but we don't have similar
technology for smell.

49:59.330 --> 50:04.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Step one is learning how air
carries odor
into our noses. Air isn't
static, as you might

50:04.835 --> 50:07.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think. It's turbulent, like a
river.

50:07.371 --> 50:11.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CRIMALDI: One of the ways
of thinking
about turbulence is, it's a
collection of

50:11.141 --> 50:15.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rotating pieces of fluid that
people often
called eddies.

50:15.045 --> 50:19.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's bigger eddies. And
inside those
eddies are smaller eddies. But
point is, is

50:19.550 --> 50:25.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that flow is structured. It's
not -- it has
an element of randomness, but it
has a high

50:25.389 --> 50:27.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
degree of structure.

50:27.258 --> 50:31.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Smells are tiny
chemical molecules
that get swept around by
turbulent air. But

50:31.228 --> 50:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these odors can also travel
underwater, where
creatures like fish and hermit
crabs can smell

50:35.966 --> 50:37.835 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
them, too.

50:37.868 --> 50:42.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CRIMALDI: And it turns out
that the physics
of flows in air and flows in
water are exactly

50:42.706 --> 50:44.475 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the same.

50:44.508 --> 50:46.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: So, Crimaldi's
team measures
these odors underwater. They
start by pumping

50:46.911 --> 50:51.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
5,000 gallons of water through a
50-foot-long
tank. Next, they spread laser
light into a

50:51.982 --> 50:56.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sheet that slices through the
water, and then
finally comes the dye.

50:56.220 --> 51:00.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CRIMALDI: And so what we're
doing is,
we're using a special kind of
dye as a surrogate

51:00.858 --> 51:06.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the odor. And this dye has
exactly the
same types of properties that an
odor would

51:06.497 --> 51:11.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have if it were in this flow,
but it has a
special property that, if we
shine a laser

51:11.101 --> 51:12.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
light on it, then it's
fluorescent.

NSIKAN AKPAN: What they find is,
odor moves
like taffy. It's constantly
being pulled and

51:17.875 --> 51:20.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
stretched into thin filaments.

51:20.544 --> 51:24.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you have ever caught a whiff
of a bakery
when you walk down the street,
you have picked

51:24.248 --> 51:30.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up a filament. In some areas,
odors get dragged
away, leaving a blank space.
This blank space

51:30.287 --> 51:36.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is called intermittency. Small
disturbances
like a quick sniff are the tugs
in the smelly

51:36.427 --> 51:38.162 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tug of war.

51:38.195 --> 51:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here's a demonstration built by
Crimaldi's
team. A tube is standing in for
an animal's

51:42.099 --> 51:50.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nostril. So, now breathe in. Now
exhale. And
you create an olfactory cyclone
that changes

51:51.008 --> 51:55.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want structure of the odor
plume. So whenever
you're in a garden and you stop
to smell the

51:55.346 --> 51:59.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
roses, just remember that every
sniff you
make is changing the aroma for
someone else.
