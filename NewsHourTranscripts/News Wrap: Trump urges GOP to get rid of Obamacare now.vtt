JUDY WOODRUFF: Senate
Republicans have begun
the Fourth of July recess
with President Trump

00:04.566 --> 00:09.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
urging them to get rid of
Obamacare, even if they
can't replace it yet.

00:11.533 --> 00:14.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a tweet this morning, he
said: "If Republican senators
are unable to pass what they are

00:16.733 --> 00:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
working on now, they should
immediately repeal, and then
replace at a later date."

00:21.733 --> 00:24.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House said later
that it is still - - quote --
"fully committed" to getting a

00:24.166 --> 00:26.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bill through the Senate.

00:26.233 --> 00:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president's feud with cable
news hosts Mika Brzezinski
and Joe Scarborough escalated

00:31.700 --> 00:34.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

00:34.333 --> 00:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump drew widespread
condemnation yesterday
for crudely criticizing
Brzezinski's appearance

00:39.133 --> 00:41.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and intelligence.

00:41.166 --> 00:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the "Morning Joe" team
on MSNBC charged the White
House had threatened them with a

00:46.066 --> 00:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tabloid expose last spring.

00:48.533 --> 00:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC: We got
a call that, hey, The National
Enquirer is going to run

00:54.733 --> 00:56.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a negative story
against you guys.

00:56.966 --> 01:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was, you know --
Donald is friends with -- the
president's friends with the guy

01:02.833 --> 01:05.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that runs The National Enquirer.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And they said, if you
call the president up,
and you apologize for
your coverage, then

01:14.200 --> 01:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he will pick up the phone and
basically spike the story.

01:18.566 --> 01:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The
National Enquirer said
that it was unaware of
any discussions involving

01:23.533 --> 01:26.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the White House and the
"Morning Joe" hosts.

01:26.166 --> 01:30.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The president answered
Scarborough's allegation
another tweet.

01:30.133 --> 01:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He said -- quote -- "Fake news.

01:32.333 --> 01:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He called me to stop a
National Enquirer article.

01:35.633 --> 01:37.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I said no."

chaos that had greeted the
original order in January.

The Foreign Ministry said
that the move runs counter to
President Trump's commitment to

02:19.433 --> 02:21.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the one-China policy.

of the city's
handover from Britain.

02:33.533 --> 02:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

troops at an army garrison,
a display aimed at groups

02:39.666 --> 02:42.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
calling for Hong
Kong's independence.

02:42.100 --> 02:45.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Xi made clear that
China is not letting go.

02:45.200 --> 02:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
XI JINPING, Chinese President
(through translator):
After 20 years of Hong
Kong's return to the

02:49.400 --> 02:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
motherland, the practice of
one country, two systems has
gained universally acknowledged

02:53.833 --> 02:56.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
success.

02:56.233 --> 02:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, we have encountered
some new situations,
new problems and new
challenges in the practice.

02:59.500 --> 03:01.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It is not horrible
to have problems.

03:01.966 --> 03:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The point is to figure out
some ways to solve them.

03:04.633 --> 03:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Chinese
Foreign Ministry also
caused a stir, dismissing
the 1997 agreement

03:10.466 --> 03:12.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Britain.

03:12.433 --> 03:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A spokesman said it --
quote -- "no longer has any
practical significance."

03:16.433 --> 03:21.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There is word that the
flow of refugees out
of Syria has reversed.

03:21.033 --> 03:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N. Refugee Agency
reports nearly half-a-million
Syrians have returned
to their homes this

03:26.500 --> 03:28.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

03:28.500 --> 03:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most have returned to areas
where government forces have
regained control after years of

03:32.400 --> 03:34.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fighting.

03:34.433 --> 03:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in this country, a gunman
opened fire at a hospital in
New York City, killing one

03:40.566 --> 03:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doctor and seriously
wounding several others,
before taking his own life.

03:45.666 --> 03:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police said the shooter was also
a doctor who had once worked
at the Bronx Lebanon Hospital.

03:50.500 --> 03:53.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Emergency crews and
heavily armed police
descended on the scene.

03:53.300 --> 03:58.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Officials said it was an
isolated incident, and
not an act of terror.

Local and federal authorities
in Chicago unveiled new efforts
today to cut the flow of illegal

04:04.733 --> 04:07.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
guns, including adding
more federal agents.

04:07.933 --> 04:12.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The announcement came as
President Trump tweeted
that crime and killings
in Chicago have reached

04:13.900 --> 04:16.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
epidemic proportions.

04:16.100 --> 04:19.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Officials in the city
said there's actually
been some improvement,
but they also welcomed

04:19.833 --> 04:21.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the federal help.

04:21.833 --> 04:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOEL LEVIN, U.S. Attorney:
Significant progress is being
made in the effort to combat the

04:25.133 --> 04:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
violence in Chicago, but the
level of violence continues at
an unacceptable level, and it

04:31.600 --> 04:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is a battle which can only be
fought with all hands on deck.

04:35.833 --> 04:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is state, federal,
and local law enforcement.

of people were allowed
back into their homes.

05:02.666 --> 05:06.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A few thousand others
are still in shelters.
