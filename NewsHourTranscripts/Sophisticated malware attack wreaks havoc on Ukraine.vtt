JUDY WOODRUFF: As we
reported earlier, governments
and industries the
world over are trying to

00:04.966 --> 00:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deal with effects of the latest
in a series of cyber-attacks.

00:08.966 --> 00:13.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The so-called ransomware
assault is the second such
strike in the last six weeks.

00:15.133 --> 00:17.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hari Sreenivasan in
New York has more.

00:17.600 --> 00:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This
attack originated yesterday
in Ukraine, and rapidly
spread through Europe

00:22.033 --> 00:24.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and beyond.

00:24.100 --> 00:27.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The virus is called
Petya, and it takes
over infected computers,
effectively locking out

00:28.233 --> 00:29.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
users.

00:29.766 --> 00:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A payment is required to return
control of the machine and data.

00:32.433 --> 00:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In early May, a similar
virus called WannaCry spread
to over 150 countries.

00:39.900 --> 00:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This new attack shows
signs of greater technical
sophistication, but
both apparently used,

00:45.000 --> 00:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in part, a tool developed by the
U.S. National Security Agency,
a tool that was leaked into

00:48.966 --> 00:50.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the open last year.

00:50.766 --> 00:52.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
With me now for more on
this is Rodney Joffe.

00:52.900 --> 00:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is the senior vice president
and national security executive
for Neustar, a cyber-security

00:57.833 --> 00:59.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
firm.

00:59.933 --> 01:03.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rodney, it seems that we have
not learned that much from
what happened two months ago,

01:04.833 --> 01:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but it seems that the attackers
have learned a little bit more.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RODNEY JOFFE, Senior
Vice President and Senior
Technologist, Neustar,
Inc.: There's no question

01:08.600 --> 01:10.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that this is more sophisticated.

01:10.666 --> 01:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When we look at the code, when
we look at the mechanism that
was used, this one is much

01:14.800 --> 01:16.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more sophisticated.

01:16.266 --> 01:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It actually uses three different
vectors we have seen so far.

01:19.400 --> 01:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The vector you're talking about
that was used in WannaCry is
the third option that is used

01:25.166 --> 01:27.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by this one.

01:27.233 --> 01:31.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It uses two others, but
the damage is much more
significant in this case.

01:33.166 --> 01:36.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is not looking like so much
like ransomware anymore, but
it's starting to look like it's

01:38.333 --> 01:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a deliberate attempt to cause
havoc by destroying machines.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is
this something that a
hacker collective would
do, or is this something

01:49.000 --> 01:51.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that a state government
would be interested in
doing, destabilizing
Ukraine from all of

01:51.800 --> 01:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these companies that do business
with it or pay taxes to it?

01:54.866 --> 01:59.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RODNEY JOFFE: You know,
it's real tough these
days to tell where the
dividing line is between

02:01.800 --> 02:03.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the criminals and nation
states, and they really do work
hand in hand, especially in

02:03.900 --> 02:05.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Eastern Europe.

02:05.966 --> 02:10.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if you look this, the
criminals are obviously out
there for financial gain.

02:12.366 --> 02:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was set up in such a way
that there's very little chance
of much in terms of financial

02:15.366 --> 02:17.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
gain.

02:17.400 --> 02:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, as of last evening,
by the way, there was $10,500
that had actually paid into this

02:22.433 --> 02:24.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wallet.

02:24.533 --> 02:26.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I have got to tell
you that the effort that
went into writing the
code and distributing

02:26.133 --> 02:29.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it clearly cost a lot
more than $10,500.

02:29.466 --> 02:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What
is the measurable impact
on Ukraine going forward?

02:36.500 --> 02:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RODNEY JOFFE: I think that the
biggest problem that they're
going to be facing is the fact

02:41.800 --> 02:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the ability to pay taxes to
the state is seriously affected.

02:45.100 --> 02:50.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have seen images that
were tweeted of things
like supermarkets where
the checkout systems

02:52.533 --> 02:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had been compromised -- and
we're showing the screen.

02:55.633 --> 03:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We also see the very large --
obviously, the multinational
shipping line that has now been

03:01.266 --> 03:03.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
affected.

03:03.400 --> 03:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it looks like a deliberate
attempt to cause some kind of
significant financial impact,

03:08.200 --> 03:11.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not just on the citizens of
Ukraine, but on Ukraine itself.

03:11.900 --> 03:15.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You
know, when you said
you noticed differences
in the design between

03:15.500 --> 03:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the WannaCry and this, do we
have any indication that paying
these people off actually gets

03:20.233 --> 03:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you your data back, or was it
not even designed to do that?

03:23.033 --> 03:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RODNEY JOFFE: Theoretically,
it was designed to do that,
but it's clear so far that the

03:30.066 --> 03:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mechanism that was put in place
to actually collect ransom is
nowhere near the sophistication

03:36.433 --> 03:38.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the malware itself.

03:38.400 --> 03:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you don't think that someone
would have made that kind
of mistake, built something

03:41.733 --> 03:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that was very, very effective
to compromise, and no
real ability to collect.

03:48.400 --> 03:52.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We haven't seen or heard
of anyone so far who has
been able to decrypt it.

03:54.300 --> 03:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what we also know is that,
within a very short time after
the malware was discovered,

03:59.466 --> 04:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the single e-mail address
that was needed to communicate
with was actually shut down

04:02.666 --> 04:04.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by the provider.

04:04.733 --> 04:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So that's one reason that I
believe that no one is going
to be able to easily get their

04:09.933 --> 04:12.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
data back.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The second thing is that there
are reports that are surfacing
now, as folks have looked

04:14.533 --> 04:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the code, that there is
at least one bug in the code
that actually makes it so that

04:20.400 --> 04:22.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
decryption is not possible.

04:22.466 --> 04:25.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Are the rest
of us basically collateral
damage when it comes to what's

04:25.966 --> 04:27.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
happening, say, between
Ukraine and Russia?

04:27.966 --> 04:31.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is falling on the
day now where this is
Constitution Day for Ukraine.

04:31.966 --> 04:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're celebrating their
independence from Russia,
what, 21 years ago.

04:34.566 --> 04:37.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RODNEY JOFFE: We clearly
are collateral damage.

04:37.100 --> 04:40.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This was obviously
targeted at Ukraine.

04:40.933 --> 04:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it is affecting others.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
However, one of the things that
we have learned in the past is
that, in many ways, the people

04:49.266 --> 04:51.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
behind a lot of the
malware don't care about
the collateral damage.

04:51.900 --> 04:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have a single target or
a single objective, and they
don't really seem to care.

04:55.966 --> 04:57.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have seen that for years.

04:57.366 --> 04:59.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is no different.

04:59.366 --> 05:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Rodney Joffe
joining us from Washington,
D.C., tonight, thanks so

05:00.200 --> 05:01.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

05:01.366 --> 05:01.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RODNEY JOFFE: Thanks
for having me.
