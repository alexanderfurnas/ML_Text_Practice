JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.139 --> 00:07.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.008 --> 00:12.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Mere words cannot give voice to
such suffering.

00:12.212 --> 00:17.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Making history.
As the first
sitting U.S. president to visit
Hiroshima,

00:17.818 --> 00:24.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Japan, President Obama pays
tribute to victims,
and calls for an end to nuclear
weapons.

00:24.825 --> 00:30.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's Friday. Mark Shields
and David Brooks
take on a week full of news and
politics,

00:30.530 --> 00:34.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the candidates level new
attacks at each
other.

00:34.268 --> 00:41.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, courtroom canines: how
man's best friend
is helping younger crime victims
feel more

00:41.642 --> 00:43.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at ease taking the stand.

00:43.343 --> 00:47.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PEARL CURIEL, Mother: I couldn't
be right
there, where the mom is supposed
to be. I

00:47.948 --> 00:53.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
couldn't hold my daughter and
rub her back
while she talked, you know? But
he was. He

00:53.587 --> 00:56.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was able to say, you know what,
I'm not going
to leave you.

00:56.590 --> 01:04.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:04.698 --> 01:07.534 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:07.567 --> 01:17.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
went today
where none of his predecessors
had gone while

01:17.177 --> 01:22.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in office: Hiroshima, Japan. He
sought to
navigate between honoring the
victims, and

01:23.016 --> 01:29.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
standing by the U.S. atomic
bombings that
left 130,000 dead, and led to
the end of World

01:29.890 --> 01:31.758 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
War II.

01:31.792 --> 01:37.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The nuclear
bomb that destroyed
Hiroshima on August 6, 1945,
changed Japan

01:37.864 --> 01:44.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the world forever; 70,000
people were
killed instantly. By year's end,
another 70,000

01:44.705 --> 01:47.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
were dead from radiation
poisoning.

01:47.441 --> 01:53.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The city was flattened, apart
from a one domed
building, now known as the
Atomic Bomb Dome.

01:53.447 --> 01:58.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It stands as a reminder of the
first-ever
atomic attack on a human
population and as

01:58.819 --> 02:00.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a symbol of peace.

02:00.887 --> 02:05.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama solemnly paid
his respects
there today. And with Japanese
Prime Minister

02:05.525 --> 02:09.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Shinzo Abe, he laid a wreath at
the nearby
Hiroshima Peace Memorial.

02:09.896 --> 02:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
We stand here in the middle of
this city and

02:12.766 --> 02:20.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
force ourselves to imagine the
moment the
bomb fell. We force ourselves to
feel the

02:20.907 --> 02:29.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dread of children confused by
what they see.
We listen to a silent cry.

02:29.049 --> 02:34.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Three days
after Hiroshima,
a second atomic bomb killed
70,000 more in

02:34.588 --> 02:39.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nagasaki. The U.S. did it to
bring a quicker
end to World War II.

02:39.493 --> 02:45.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president offered no apology
today, but
renewed his call for abolishing
nuclear weapons.

02:45.098 --> 02:50.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Among those
nations like my
own that hold nuclear
stockpiles, we must

02:50.504 --> 02:58.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have the courage to escape the
logic of fear,
and pursue a world without them.
We may not

02:58.178 --> 03:05.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
realize this goal in my
lifetime, but persistent
effort can hold back the
possibility of catastrophe.

03:05.819 --> 03:11.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: In an emotional
moment afterward,
Mr. Obama greeted survivors of
the Hiroshima

03:11.992 --> 03:18.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bombing. Other survivors joined
the crowds
lining his motorcade route.
Fewer than 83,000

03:18.331 --> 03:19.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are still alive.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): I'm
very happy
to see him visiting here. He has
sent out

03:23.770 --> 03:27.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a message for peace in the past,
and today
he is putting his words into
practice.

03:27.841 --> 03:32.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AKIRA KONDO, Hiroshima Survivor
(through translator):
It would have been much better
if a U.S. president

03:32.212 --> 03:37.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could have made the visit
earlier. It took
71 years. I think it could have
happened earlier.

03:37.117 --> 03:41.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: A younger
generation brought
its own perspective to the
visit.

03:41.121 --> 03:46.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): His
visit to Hiroshima
means a lot, because it's a step
forward from

03:46.359 --> 03:48.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all the conciliatory rhetoric we
have traded
so far.

03:48.862 --> 03:53.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But there've
also been protests
in the day's leading up to the
visit and demands

03:53.500 --> 03:55.268 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for an apology.

03:55.302 --> 03:58.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Of
course he will
not apologize, simply, because,
if he does,

03:59.005 --> 04:03.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.S. cannot use the nuclear
weapon again.
I believe he's not apologizing
here to leave

04:03.643 --> 04:07.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the possibility to use nuclear
weapons open
for the future.

04:07.047 --> 04:12.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Even before his
election
at a 2008 speech in Berlin,
Germany, Mr. Obama

04:12.586 --> 04:14.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
embraced the opposite goal.

04:14.354 --> 04:19.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: This is the moment
when we must
renew the goal of a world
without nuclear

04:19.860 --> 04:21.728 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weapons.

04:21.761 --> 04:24.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Yet now the
Defense Department
is in the midst of a sweeping
upgrade of its

04:24.231 --> 04:30.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nuclear arsenal. The plan is to
spend $1 trillion
over the next three decades on
new nuclear

04:30.637 --> 04:33.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
submarines, bombers and weapons
themselves.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

04:36.476 --> 04:42.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will look at
the nuclear
threat in the world today after
the news summary.

04:42.082 --> 04:47.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The events at Hiroshima came
after major economic
powers wrapped up a two-day
Group of Seven

04:47.521 --> 04:53.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Summit in Japan. In a warning
aimed at China,
the leaders opposed unilateral
actions in

04:53.527 --> 04:59.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the East and South China Seas.
Instead, they
called for peaceful resolutions
to territorial

04:59.432 --> 05:00.767 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
disputes.

05:00.800 --> 05:05.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Beijing responded that the G7
should stick
to economic matters.

05:05.205 --> 05:10.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is word that Iran is
honoring all its
major obligations under the
nuclear deal it

05:10.577 --> 05:16.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
signed with world powers last
year. The Associated
Press obtained the confidential
assessment

05:16.550 --> 05:23.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the U.N.'s Nuclear Agency. It
says that
Tehran has now corrected a
previous violation.

05:23.790 --> 05:29.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under the deal, Iran won relief
from international
sanctions in exchange for limits
on its nuclear

05:29.796 --> 05:31.598 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
activities.

05:31.631 --> 05:37.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. presidential campaign
was strictly
a West Coast affair today. All
three candidates

05:37.204 --> 05:41.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaigned with an eye on the
calendar and
the date of June 7.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins has our report.

05:43.743 --> 05:46.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I want to make a big play for
California.

05:46.780 --> 05:47.447 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Should I?

05:47.480 --> 05:49.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

05:49.316 --> 05:53.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: One day after
clinching the
GOP nomination, Donald Trump
kept up his push

05:53.286 --> 05:59.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the Golden State. Outside
his Fresno event,
protesters kept up their push
too. But, elsewhere,

05:59.693 --> 06:04.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump gained new, if lukewarm,
words of support
from a former opponent, Florida
Senator Marco

06:04.397 --> 06:06.099 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Rubio.

06:06.132 --> 06:07.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), Florida: I
don't want
Hillary Clinton to be president.
If there's

06:07.934 --> 06:11.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something I can do to help that
from happening,
and it's helpful to the cause, I
would most

06:11.671 --> 06:13.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
certainly be honored to be
considered for
that.

06:13.607 --> 06:16.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Trump, too, is
talking about
Hillary Clinton.

06:16.243 --> 06:21.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: The inspector
general, who's
a Democrat, did a big, big
number on her.

06:21.047 --> 06:24.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I don't know how she can
continue to run,
I will be honest with you. How
does she continue

06:24.584 --> 06:28.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to run? Do you think Hillary
looks presidential
in office?

06:29.022 --> 06:30.924 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CROWD: No!

06:30.957 --> 06:34.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Like Trump, the
two remaining
Democrats spent their campaign
day in voter-rich

06:34.661 --> 06:41.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
California, with polls showing a
much tighter
race between them as the June 7
primary nears.

06:41.101 --> 06:44.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Bernie Sanders went big,
rallying with union
workers on the San Pedro
Waterfront.

06:44.571 --> 06:48.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
You and I are going to have to
tell the billionaire

06:48.842 --> 06:55.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
class they cannot get it all,
that this economy
and government belong to all of
us.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

06:57.617 --> 07:04.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: It is an
absurdity that
you have multibillionaire like
Sheldon Adelson

07:04.658 --> 07:09.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
contributing large sums of money
to another
billionaire, like Donald Trump.

07:09.396 --> 07:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Hillary Clinton
met with
community leaders in Oakland,
hitting again

07:13.533 --> 07:15.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at Trump's temperament.

07:15.468 --> 07:17.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
You know, I like to say, yes, we
can use the

07:17.304 --> 07:21.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House as a bully pulpit.
We don't want
a bully in the White House. But
we can use

07:21.574 --> 07:28.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the bully pulpit to talk about
issues. Let's
begin to cut across all the
barriers, the

07:28.415 --> 07:31.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
geographic barriers and
everything else that
stand in the way.

07:31.318 --> 07:36.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: For now, what's
standing
in Clinton's way is the number
73, as in the

07:36.790 --> 07:40.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
remaining delegates she needs
for the nomination.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Eight automakers
are recalling
more than 12 million vehicles in
the U.S.

07:48.001 --> 07:53.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to replace the air bag
inflators. The devices
made by the Japanese firm Takata
can explode

07:53.606 --> 07:59.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with too much force. They have
been linked
to at least 11 deaths worldwide.
The new recalls

07:59.279 --> 08:03.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are part of an expanded campaign
announced
earlier this month.

08:03.750 --> 08:09.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N. Refugee Agency is
urging Hungary
and Serbia to help migrants now
camping in

08:09.656 --> 08:15.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
desperate conditions. They're on
the Serbian
side of the border, blocked from
moving north

08:15.395 --> 08:21.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the fence that Hungary put up
last year.
U.N. officials say that some 300
migrants

08:21.234 --> 08:27.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are living in tents there. They
have no access
to toilets or to running water,
and have to

08:27.340 --> 08:30.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rely on aid groups for food.

08:30.343 --> 08:35.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nearly 40,000 Verizon workers
may be back
on the job in the Eastern U.S.
next week with

08:35.782 --> 08:41.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a new four-year contract. The
company and
its unions reached a tentative
deal today

08:41.321 --> 08:48.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to end a strike. Landline and
cable employees
walked off the job April 13 in
nine Eastern

08:48.695 --> 08:51.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
states and the District of

In economic news, growth ran at
annual rate
of eight-tenths of a percent in
the first

08:57.070 --> 09:02.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quarter. That is relatively
weak, but it's
better than the initial
estimate. The Federal

09:02.642 --> 09:07.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reserve chairwoman, Janet
Yellen, also said
today that she expects another
interest rate

09:07.981 --> 09:12.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hike before long, if growth
continues to improve.

09:12.519 --> 09:17.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Wall Street capped off its
strongest week
since March. The Dow Jones
industrial average

09:17.590 --> 09:26.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gained 45 points to close at
17873. The Nasdaq
rose more than 31, and the S&amp;P
500 added nine

09:26.733 --> 09:34.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
points. For the week, the Dow
and S&amp;P 500
was up 2 percent. The Nasdaq
rose 3 percent.

09:34.407 --> 09:39.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a look at
the world's nuclear reality 70
years after

09:39.946 --> 09:47.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.S. dropped the atomic
bomb; one Japanese
man's quest to remember the 12
American POWs

09:47.787 --> 09:57.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
killed at Hiroshima; a top
chef's solution
to food waste; and much more.

09:57.831 --> 10:03.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
killed at Hiroshima; a top
chef's solution
to food waste; and much more.

10:03.803 --> 10:09.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We return to the president's
visit to Hiroshima
with a look at his nuclear
legacy and at the

10:09.442 --> 10:11.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ongoing threat from those
weapons.

10:12.011 --> 10:16.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For that we turn to Stephen
Rademaker, who
was assistant secretary of state
for arms

10:16.683 --> 10:23.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
control and nonproliferation
during the George
W. Bush administration, and
Rachel Bronson,

10:23.289 --> 10:28.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who is the executive director
and publisher
of the Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists,

10:28.394 --> 10:32.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which focuses on nuclear weapons
and disarmament.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

10:33.933 --> 10:39.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we did hear President Obama
today in Japan
repeating the goal that he laid
out, he first

10:40.006 --> 10:45.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
laid out when he came into
office. He said
the nations that hold nuclear
stockpiles must

10:45.578 --> 10:48.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have the courage to pursue a
world without
them.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rachel Bronson, how has the
president done
on that front?

10:51.885 --> 10:55.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHEL BRONSON, Bulletin of the
Atomic Scientists:
Well, I think the president
started off very

10:55.955 --> 11:00.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strong. Obviously, you mentioned
his Prague
speech in 2009.

11:00.527 --> 11:05.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's a strange bookmark to
come out at
the end of it today, towards the
end of his

11:05.598 --> 11:10.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration. We have had
enormous progress
in the first part of his
administration and

11:10.970 --> 11:18.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much less in more recent years,
so some big
victories early on, I do think
important agreements

11:18.411 --> 11:23.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like New START and the Iran
deal, but then
slower progress in the last few
years.

11:23.516 --> 11:26.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How would you
rate the president's
progress on this, Stephen
Rademaker?

11:26.352 --> 11:28.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN RADEMAKER, Former U.S.
Arms Control
Official: Well, I would say the
goals that

11:28.688 --> 11:33.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president set for himself in
the Prague
speech were completely
unrealistic, and so

11:33.927 --> 11:37.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's not surprising that, having
confronted
reality during the course of his
administration,

11:37.797 --> 11:40.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's had to back down from those
unrealistic
aims.

11:40.600 --> 11:44.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, he continues to
articulate the
abolition of nuclear weapons as
a goal, but

11:44.971 --> 11:49.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, unlike in 2009, when I
think he was
sincere and he really thought
this was achievable,

11:49.142 --> 11:53.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think today he wants to
abolish nuclear
weapons in the same way that
other politicians

11:53.346 --> 11:58.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say they want to abolish poverty
or eliminate
drug addiction.

11:58.351 --> 12:02.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an aspiration, but not
something that
we -- something we all
understand is not going

12:02.922 --> 12:04.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be achieved anytime soon.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Rachel Bronson,
what should
the president have done and what
do you think

12:07.360 --> 12:09.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his successor should be doing?

12:09.195 --> 12:16.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHEL BRONSON: Well, I think
what he likely
needs to do at this point is we
need, as a

12:16.369 --> 12:22.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country, to kind of take a look
at this massive
modernization program that the
president is

12:22.041 --> 12:23.910 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
undertaking.

12:23.943 --> 12:30.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in an effort to reduce the
number of nuclear
weapons around the world, he
kind of engaged

12:30.149 --> 12:37.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the Russians and signed an
arms deal
to help reduce what we had
around -- exactly

12:37.256 --> 12:41.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what he had set out to do. But
to get that,
he had to make a deal, which was
that he was

12:41.461 --> 12:47.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
going to invest in the
modernization of our
nuclear arsenal, which he has
done.

12:47.700 --> 12:53.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, looking at that very hard,
what it begins
to look like is not just
modernization, not

12:53.072 --> 12:58.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just keeping those weapons safe,
so that we
don't rust our way to
disarmament, which would

12:58.378 --> 13:02.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be very dangerous, but it seems
like we're
actually building a new fleet.
And the kinds

13:02.849 --> 13:07.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of money -- the budget has
ballooned, and
so the next president is really
going to have

13:07.820 --> 13:14.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to take a hard look at how do we
get back
on pace to make sure that not
only do we continue

13:14.594 --> 13:21.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to decrease numbers, but that
our arsenal
isn't becoming stronger, bigger,
you know,

13:21.534 --> 13:23.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more threatening.

13:23.336 --> 13:26.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stephen
Rademaker, how do you
look at what the president
should have done

13:26.305 --> 13:28.041 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
differently?

13:28.074 --> 13:31.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN RADEMAKER: Well, if you
accept the
fantasy that we're about to
abolish nuclear

13:31.277 --> 13:34.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weapons, then, of course,
spending a trillion
dollars to modernize it is a
waste of money.

13:34.881 --> 13:36.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But the reality is...

13:36.649 --> 13:37.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're coming at
this from
a very different direction from
Ms. Bronson.

13:38.017 --> 13:39.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEPHEN RADEMAKER: Of course.

13:39.852 --> 13:43.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reality is, as the president
has recognized,
we're not about to eliminate
nuclear weapons.

13:43.423 --> 13:46.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're going to be around for a
long time,
so it is necessary to make these
investments

13:46.826 --> 13:48.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in modernization.

13:48.594 --> 13:55.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I know this number, $1
trillion, gets
thrown around. If you want to
deceptively

13:55.868 --> 13:58.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
present any budget number, you
won't give
the one-year number, you will
give the 30-year

13:58.905 --> 14:03.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
number, because it's a vastly
larger number.
It basically works out to 5
percent of the

14:03.209 --> 14:06.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
defense budget, which, compared
to the amount
of money that we spent during
the Cold War

14:06.179 --> 14:08.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on nuclear weapons, is
relatively small.

14:08.381 --> 14:11.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we're not
going to resolve
what the U.S. should do here.

14:11.217 --> 14:16.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But let's broaden this out just
quickly. Rachel
Bronson, when you compare where
the world

14:16.556 --> 14:21.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is today with where we were,
say, 25 years
ago, at the end of the Cold War,
has there

14:21.360 --> 14:25.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been progress made when it comes
to nuclear
weapons from your perspective or
not?

14:25.465 --> 14:27.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RACHEL BRONSON: Yes, there
certainly has been
progress.

14:27.867 --> 14:33.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But just picking up on where
Steve was, it
is important to note that the
military itself

14:33.473 --> 14:38.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is beginning to balk at the
price tag associated
with this. And they are
beginning to look

14:38.878 --> 14:43.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at and say, it's not going to
come out of
our budget. It's got to come out
of different

14:43.149 --> 14:44.951 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pockets.

14:44.984 --> 14:49.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they're balking too. These
costs are really
escalating. And it seems beyond
our ability,

14:49.689 --> 14:53.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A, to afford, or, if we are
going to afford
it, we're not going to be able
to do other

14:53.292 --> 14:55.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things that the military wants
to do.

14:55.228 --> 14:59.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's not just kind of where
these numbers
are. There is a lot of concern
at what this

14:59.232 --> 15:04.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is going to cost and at what
cost to other
kinds of tasks and other weapons
that the

15:04.370 --> 15:08.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
U.S. might be want to be
investing in. So
I just think -- I wanted to make
that point.

15:08.975 --> 15:10.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

15:10.877 --> 15:13.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHEL BRONSON: But in terms of
where we are
from the Cold War, we have seen
massive reductions

15:13.846 --> 15:15.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and important reductions.

15:15.681 --> 15:20.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have also seen progress in
beginning to
move highly enriched uranium,
plutonium out

15:20.186 --> 15:25.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of certain countries. The
president has done
-- has moved the needle
positively in directions

15:25.424 --> 15:30.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that have made the world safer,
but, you know,
this is a new world. And we're
entering a

15:30.096 --> 15:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new world where more countries
have nuclear
weapons, we have to worry about
non-state

15:34.534 --> 15:36.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
actors who try to get their
hands on them.

15:36.903 --> 15:42.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So in terms of a strategic
threat, it's going
down to some extent, but, you
know, this is

15:42.241 --> 15:47.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a new world, and we're in a very
dangerous
position. The Bulletin of the
Atomic Scientists

15:47.113 --> 15:51.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sets the doomsday clock. And we
moved it from
five to three minutes to
midnight two years

15:51.884 --> 15:56.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago, and we kept it this year at
three minutes
to midnight, because it's a very
troubling

15:56.789 --> 15:57.456 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me...

15:59.425 --> 16:00.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RACHEL BRONSON: We have
deteriorating relations
between the U.S. and Russia, and
this modernization

16:00.960 --> 16:02.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
program is very concerning.

16:02.728 --> 16:05.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm sorry to
interrupt, but
I do want to get back to Stephen
Rademaker

16:05.398 --> 16:07.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on this.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can respond to what she
said. I don't
think the two of you are going
to come together,

16:09.969 --> 16:15.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but in terms of whether the
world is safer
today than it was at the end of
the Cold War,

16:15.508 --> 16:18.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when the U.S. and the then
Soviet Union were
then armed to the teeth?

16:18.945 --> 16:21.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN RADEMAKER: I think we're
in a better
place today than we were at the
end of the

16:21.414 --> 16:26.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cold War, but let's be clear,
there hasn't
been much progress during the
Obama administration

16:26.786 --> 16:28.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the elimination of nuclear
weapons.

16:28.554 --> 16:32.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think Rachel would agree
with me on
that. In fact, actually, Russia
deploys 200

16:32.592 --> 16:36.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more nuclear weapons today than
it did when
President Obama took office.
That's according

16:36.429 --> 16:38.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to the official data
declarations.

16:38.598 --> 16:44.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China has recently started
testing independently
targetable reentry vehicles.
It's deploying

16:44.403 --> 16:50.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a mobile ICBM system. It just
deployed within
the last year its first
operationally deployed

16:50.776 --> 16:55.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
submarine launch missiles. So,
the Chinese
nuclear threat is increasing
significantly.

16:55.882 --> 17:00.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the basic problem with
the agenda
outlined by President Obama. He
obviously

17:00.519 --> 17:05.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
believes in it with all his
heart, but the
rest of the world doesn't. He
doesn't have

17:05.157 --> 17:07.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a partner in Moscow willing to
join him in
this enterprise.

17:07.793 --> 17:11.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, a lot of
big questions,
and we wanted to take a look at
it today,

17:11.597 --> 17:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on this day the president
visited Hiroshima.

17:14.166 --> 17:17.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Stephen Rademaker, we thank you.
Rachel Bronson,
thank you both.

RACHEL BRONSON: Thank you.

17:18.804 --> 17:20.539 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEPHEN RADEMAKER: Thanks.

17:20.573 --> 17:23.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now a
different look at
the aftermath of the Hiroshima
bombing and

17:23.976 --> 17:26.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a story rarely told.

17:26.078 --> 17:28.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has that.

17:28.047 --> 17:32.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Among the thousands
killed at Hiroshima
were 12 American prisoners of
war, the crew

17:32.318 --> 17:36.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of three planes that were shot
down on Hiroshima
area.

17:36.889 --> 17:42.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, President Obama noted
their deaths,
as well as the quiet, diligent,
four-decades-long

17:42.628 --> 17:48.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
effort of one man, Shigeaki
Mori, a survivor
of the bombing, who wanted to
memorialize

17:48.434 --> 17:54.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the 12 Americans. Mori attended
Mr. Obama's
speech, and the two men
embraced.

17:54.140 --> 17:58.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now a new film called "Paper
Lanterns" charts
Mori's quest as he sought
permission from

17:58.844 --> 18:04.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two of the families of the 12
POWs to register
their names for a memorial.

18:04.083 --> 18:08.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here is a clip from the film,
where Ralph
Neal of Kentucky and Susan
Brissette Archinski

18:08.754 --> 18:14.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Massachusetts read the
letters Mori sent
them seven years ago about their
uncles.

18:14.193 --> 18:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN BRISSETTE ARCHINSKI, Niece
of U.S. Veteran:
"Dear Mrs. Susan Brissette
Archinski."

18:20.733 --> 18:25.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RALPH NEAL, Nephew of U.S.
Veteran: "Dear
Mr. Ralph Neal, I hope this
letter finds you

18:25.304 --> 18:32.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well. My name is Shigeaki Mori,
a 72-year-old
A-bomb survivor and a historian
living in

18:32.111 --> 18:33.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Hiroshima, Japan.

18:33.946 --> 18:41.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"For a long time, I have been
reading about
American soldiers killed by the
atomic bomb.

18:41.220 --> 18:47.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have erected a memorial
dedicated to their
unfortunate death. The 64th
anniversary of

18:47.994 --> 18:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the A-bomb of the city is coming
around soon.
On this day every year, memorial
services

18:53.966 --> 18:58.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are held in the Peace Park under
the auspices
of the Hiroshima mayor.

18:58.404 --> 19:04.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"A stone room in the center of
the cenotaph,
a main structure in the center
of the park,

19:04.210 --> 19:11.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contains a list of the domestic
and overseas
victims of the A-bomb, including
those American

19:11.417 --> 19:15.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
soldiers who happened to be in
the city when
the bomb exploded.

19:15.121 --> 19:19.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN BRISSETTE ARCHINSKI AND
RALPH NEAL:
"This is my belief, that names
of all victims

19:19.625 --> 19:23.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should be acknowledged equally,
regardless
of their nationalities."

19:23.429 --> 19:28.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN BRISSETTE ARCHINSKI: "To
have one's
name registered, however, an
application needs

19:28.567 --> 19:31.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be filed by a member of the
deceased's
family."

19:31.270 --> 19:39.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RALPH NEAL: "I have so far
contacted the bereaved
of nine of the 12 Americans
killed by the

19:39.578 --> 19:46.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
bomb and submitted the
applications to the
city on their behalf. And now I
am hoping

19:46.285 --> 19:48.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to have the name of Mr. Ralph
Neal."

SUSAN BRISSETTE ARCHINSKI: "Of
Mr. Normand
Brissette included in the list
before this

19:51.457 --> 19:53.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
year's ceremony."

19:53.292 --> 19:57.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RALPH NEAL: "I am so happy now
that I have
finally found you some 20 years
after I started

19:57.363 --> 20:03.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in my research. I look forward
to hearing
from you. Sincerely yours, Mr.
Mori."

JOHN YANG: We are joined now by
the man who
made this film Barry Frechette.

20:08.641 --> 20:09.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Barry, thanks for joining us.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARRY FRECHETTE, Director,
"Paper Lanterns":
Thank you.

20:11.744 --> 20:14.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: First of all, I have
got to tell
you how really moving and
powerful this movie

20:14.346 --> 20:16.182 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is.

20:16.215 --> 20:19.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, this is a story that
certainly I wasn't
aware of, and I think a lot of
people aren't

20:19.485 --> 20:23.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aware of. How did it come to you
and why did
you want to tell this story?

20:23.355 --> 20:27.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARRY FRECHETTE: Well, it came
to me in a
couple ways.

20:27.126 --> 20:31.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One was, it's -- my great uncle
was Normand
Brissette's great, best friend
growing up

20:31.730 --> 20:36.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in. And so, in our family, we
kind of knew
of it. But to be honest, as a
kid growing

20:36.435 --> 20:38.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up, it really didn't have the
same impact.

20:38.304 --> 20:43.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then through family members,
the Brissette
family, who are all very close
up in Lowell,

20:43.709 --> 20:47.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Massachusetts, made a book just
memorializing
Normand. And it had some paper
-- newspaper

20:47.947 --> 20:49.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
clippings and other things.

20:49.982 --> 20:55.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And made its way into my hands
three, three-and-a-half
years ago now. And it has a
picture of Normand

20:55.921 --> 21:02.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the front, and I was just
captured with
the idea of a 19-year-old kid in
Hiroshima,

21:02.962 --> 21:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so far away from home, and
witnessing something
absolutely terrible. So, I was
captured by

21:07.867 --> 21:09.602 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

21:09.635 --> 21:12.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And the movie builds
to the final
sequence. It takes place in the
same park

21:12.872 --> 21:14.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where President Obama spoke this
morning.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BARRY FRECHETTE: Right.

21:16.342 --> 21:19.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The ceremony of the
paper lanterns,
where families of people who
died in bombings

21:19.078 --> 21:22.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
set off -- set lanterns off into
the river.

21:22.181 --> 21:24.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Was this the first time, though,
Mr. Mori
had gone?

21:24.316 --> 21:28.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BARRY FRECHETTE: It was.

21:28.187 --> 21:32.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We went over with Ralph to visit
with Mr.
Mori during the anniversary of
this past year.

21:32.725 --> 21:36.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think all of us were kind
of assuming
he had been there before. But
you know what?

21:36.829 --> 21:42.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were there that morning, and
his wife had
said he had never gone, and it
was really

21:42.168 --> 21:43.936 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a shocker to us.

21:43.969 --> 21:47.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then upon asking him and
digging a little
deeper, he just didn't really
feel like he

21:47.106 --> 21:52.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had family there, and didn't
have a right
the go. But this time, he did.
He was with

21:52.378 --> 21:57.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Neal family, with Ralph
Neal. And it was
really moving. And it became
much more important,

21:57.516 --> 22:01.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, for us to sort of share
that moment
together and actually place
lanterns in the

22:01.287 --> 22:03.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
water for the airmen and for the
memories.

22:03.756 --> 22:08.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: I should point out
that Mr. Mori
was 8 years old, was in
Hiroshima, witnessed

22:08.694 --> 22:16.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the attack, spent 40 years
researching the
American POWs. Why? Why was he
doing this?

22:16.068 --> 22:21.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRY FRECHETTE: Well, at first,
you know,
we thought he's a historian at
heart, so uncovering

22:21.340 --> 22:26.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these facts and bringing them to
light, and
bringing them to light for a
good reason,

22:26.712 --> 22:28.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that was important.

22:28.480 --> 22:31.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But digging in with him further
and after
three trips, I think he really
opened up to

22:31.450 --> 22:35.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us. And he was supposed to be in
a school
much, much closer to the
epicenter. And for

22:35.955 --> 22:39.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some reason, he was away. He was
just moved
out of the school.

22:39.692 --> 22:44.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he would have been right
where most of
the American POWs died. And I
think, for him,

22:44.263 --> 22:49.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he felt a connection to them
that they were
lost and a long way from home,
and he felt

22:50.002 --> 22:54.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like they were forgotten. And it
was important
for him to kind of tell their
story, and at

22:54.173 --> 22:58.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the very least make sure the
relatives knew
what happened to their loved
ones, and that

22:58.777 --> 23:03.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
put them on this quest and it
brought us to
this moment this morning.

23:03.349 --> 23:08.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: This morning, when
President Obama
spoke, you were up watching, you
told me.

23:08.287 --> 23:13.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRY FRECHETTE: Yes. We -- the
whole paper
lantern family are very well
connected, and

23:13.225 --> 23:16.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of tweets and messages and
postings
going around at the same time.

23:17.029 --> 23:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What was going
through your mind
when you heard first the
president mention

23:21.000 --> 23:26.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Mori, didn't saw him, but
then when you
saw the two speak and embrace?

23:26.405 --> 23:35.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARRY FRECHETTE: It's a moment
that we never
thought would actually happen.

23:35.114 --> 23:41.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have this special place
in our heart
for him, because he's done so
much, and he's

23:41.086 --> 23:47.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a very humble man. And when that
moment happened,
it was really likely like it was
the spirits

23:47.893 --> 23:52.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of everyone. The 12 Americans,
all of us were
there with them, and I think
there was a -- there

23:52.765 --> 23:55.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was a lot of crying and a lot of
emotional
moments.

23:55.334 --> 24:01.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's something none of us
will ever forget,
seeing that, and I'm so happy it
happened.

24:01.940 --> 24:05.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It's -- people see
this movie.
It's called "Paper Lanterns."
It's something

24:05.444 --> 24:06.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people they never forget.

24:06.879 --> 24:08.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Barry Frechette, thanks for
being with us.

24:08.314 --> 24:13.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARRY FRECHETTE: Thank you.
Thank you very
much.

24:13.519 --> 24:22.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

24:22.895 --> 24:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Mark Shields
and David Brooks analyze the
week's news;

24:27.499 --> 24:31.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and how dogs are helping
children to testify
in court.

24:31.804 --> 24:39.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: Roughly 70 billion
pounds of food
is wasted annually in the United
States.

24:39.244 --> 24:43.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s Lisa Desjardins
is back from
maternity leave, and she caught
up this week

24:43.949 --> 24:47.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with chef Tom Colicchio of TV's
"Top Chef."

24:47.920 --> 24:53.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was on Capitol Hill to bring
attention
to the issue of how much is
wasted in American

24:53.559 --> 24:57.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and to represent the group he
co-founded,
Food Policy Action.

24:57.429 --> 25:05.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Many folks in
the food waste
movement say that some 40
percent of our food

25:05.104 --> 25:09.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grown in this country is unused
or wasted.
That's kind of a hard number to
get your head

25:09.575 --> 25:11.276 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
around.

25:11.310 --> 25:13.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM COLICCHIO, Food Policy
Action: Well, actually,
that's the real number, 40
percent.

25:13.445 --> 25:17.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, when I heard that
number about two
years ago, that's what really
brought me to

25:17.449 --> 25:23.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this issue. I was staggered by
the amount
of food that's being wasted.
When you think

25:23.522 --> 25:28.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about what you purchase at home,
you can imagine
throwing 40 percent in the
garbage, and you

25:28.293 --> 25:31.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think about how hard farmers
work, and everything
that goes in.

25:31.597 --> 25:35.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not just the food. It's all
the resources
that go into creating the food.
So it's water,

25:36.001 --> 25:37.870 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's energy, it's people's work.

25:37.903 --> 25:42.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: You know, last
year, NPR
and "NewsHour" teamed up; we
went to the Salinas

25:42.074 --> 25:44.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Valley in California.

25:44.042 --> 25:49.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there, we got these
extraordinary pictures
of dump trucks full of lettuce
and spinach,

25:49.415 --> 25:54.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cartons full of broccoli, that
the producers
were taking to the landfill, not
consumers.

25:54.453 --> 26:00.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We also have a food culture in
this country
that promotes, and to some
degree almost worships,

26:00.159 --> 26:01.960 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
beautiful food.

26:01.994 --> 26:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in your restaurants, you
serve beautiful
food. How do you change that
culture to show

26:07.766 --> 26:09.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Americans that your food can be
imperfect?

26:09.535 --> 26:11.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM COLICCHIO: When people think
of wasted
food, they think of something
that is left

26:11.570 --> 26:15.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the plate. We're not talking
about that.
We're talking about food that is
perfectly

26:15.808 --> 26:17.776 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
good.

26:17.810 --> 26:20.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think, if we're looking at
large supermarkets
that are throwing food out
because it's slightly

26:20.546 --> 26:24.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wilted or there's a little
blemish on it or
it's slightly bruised, I think
the average

26:24.383 --> 26:27.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
person looks at that and goes,
there's nothing
wrong with that. Why are we
throwing this

26:27.853 --> 26:29.621 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
away?

26:29.655 --> 26:33.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But when you see those
truckloads, I think
you look at that and go, we have
to fix this

26:33.325 --> 26:35.227 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
problem.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: We saw this
week the very
first hearing from the House
Agriculture Committee

26:37.129 --> 26:42.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on food waste. This is a time
when politicians
are looking at polls that say
the number one

26:42.201 --> 26:45.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
concern for voters is the
economy. The number
two concern is terrorism.

26:46.004 --> 26:49.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM COLICCHIO: When you have 25
percent of
recruits showing up to fight our
wars that

26:49.341 --> 26:53.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are washing out because of
obesity, when you
have health care costs rising
because of the

26:53.378 --> 26:57.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way we're -- what we're eating
in this country
that's costing us about $200
billion a year.

26:57.483 --> 27:01.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it actually does affect the
economy and
it does affect mission
readiness. So you can

27:01.420 --> 27:06.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually equate food right back
to these issues
that are important, these
issues, economic

27:06.225 --> 27:07.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
issues and issues of national
security.

27:08.026 --> 27:11.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think a lot
of our viewers
would be surprised to know there
are almost

27:11.663 --> 27:16.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no clear national guidelines for
food labeling
and date labeling.

27:16.935 --> 27:19.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM COLICCHIO: Right. Right. And
that's part
of the reason why we're here in
Washington

27:19.071 --> 27:25.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
today. We are supporting
Congresswoman Pingree's
bill, co-sponsored on the Senate
side. Richard

27:25.377 --> 27:27.613 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Blumenthal sponsored it as well.

27:27.646 --> 27:32.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it just really focuses on
date labeling.
Right now, we have sell-by
dates. The sell-by

27:32.718 --> 27:36.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
date doesn't mean that a gallon
of milk is
spoiled. It means that that is
when the manufacturer

27:36.955 --> 27:38.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wants you to sell it by.

27:38.690 --> 27:43.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Typically, it's fine for a good
many days
past that, and yet 80 percent of
the people

27:43.061 --> 27:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will look at that and throw it
out by the
sell-by date. And so a ton of
food is being

27:47.299 --> 27:49.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wasted because things are
improperly labeled.
And this bill will address that.

27:50.002 --> 27:53.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I'm curious. I
always look
in the back of the "Top Chef"
show. You see

27:54.006 --> 27:59.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these beautiful bins of fruits
and vegetables
and meats. What happens to the
food on the

27:59.278 --> 28:00.512 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
show?

28:00.546 --> 28:01.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM COLICCHIO: We have a very
hungry crew
that eats well.

28:01.613 --> 28:02.247 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:02.281 --> 28:04.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOM COLICCHIO: We really do.

28:04.149 --> 28:09.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We -- without giving too much
away, we just
had a challenge where there was
a lot of really

28:09.254 --> 28:12.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
delicious barbecue pig left
over, and every
bit of it went to our crew.

28:12.925 --> 28:17.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: What tips do
you have for
people who want to change this
in their own

28:17.296 --> 28:18.964 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lives?

28:18.997 --> 28:20.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM COLICCHIO: Yes, so, I think,
on the consumer
side, try to shop more
frequently.

28:20.832 --> 28:24.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're somebody who goes and
shops for
your family once a week, you
typically overbuy.

28:24.670 --> 28:28.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Don't ever shop when you're
hungry, because
you definitely overpurchase and
overbuy food.

28:28.407 --> 28:31.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, what I try to do is, on
Friday, that's
when I clean out my
refrigerator.

28:31.610 --> 28:35.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I go in, I look at all the
vegetables,
all the scraps, I chop it up and
it either

28:35.747 --> 28:39.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
goes into a soup or it goes into
a pasta.
I think it's something, when you
start focusing

28:39.451 --> 28:43.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on it, and you start looking at
it and you
start -- people are so focused,
they are so

28:43.155 --> 28:47.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cost-conscious when they're
purchasing food,
but yet, when they come home,
they don't look

28:47.292 --> 28:49.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the price when they are
throwing foods
in the garbage.

28:49.328 --> 28:52.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think that, if you do
that, that
clean-up Friday, where I call it
cleanup Friday,

28:52.965 --> 28:56.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I clean out the refrigerator and
make something
with that, I think that's one
thing that people

28:56.268 --> 28:57.603 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
could do.

28:57.636 --> 28:58.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The New York
Times called
you a citizen chef.

28:58.870 --> 29:05.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tom Colicchio, thank you for
joining us.

29:05.444 --> 29:11.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TOM COLICCHIO: You're welcome.
Thank you.

29:11.950 --> 29:17.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now to the
analysis of
Shields and Brooks. That's
syndicated columnist

29:17.689 --> 29:20.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and New York Times
columnist
David Brooks.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, gentlemen.

29:22.561 --> 29:27.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, let's start with where the
president was
today, Mark, at Hiroshima. Made
a speech,

29:27.633 --> 29:32.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
didn't apologize, but he spoke
of something
that he said changed the world.

29:32.804 --> 29:37.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And it did, and he
reminded
us of how serious.

29:37.142 --> 29:44.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He spoke seriously. He is, at
the core, I
think, quite a serious man, and
reminded that

29:44.716 --> 29:53.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- serious words on a serious
subject, a president
deals in that. And it's a
reminder in the

29:53.725 --> 30:00.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
turmoil and the silliness of
fatuousness of
much of the campaign, that
that's what a president

30:00.666 --> 30:03.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
does. And he addressed it, I
thought, in serious
fashion.

30:03.502 --> 30:05.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What did you make
of the president's
remarks?

30:05.704 --> 30:07.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, first, I
think it was
a beautiful speech.

30:07.439 --> 30:10.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was realistic about our human
nature and
our tendency to get into fights.
And one of

30:10.876 --> 30:14.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the nice little moments in there
was when
he tied the fighting of
hunter-gatherers,

30:15.013 --> 30:19.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fighting of children on the
playground
to a nuclear explosion. It's
just the same

30:19.384 --> 30:22.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
sorts of territoriality,
tribalism, but with
bigger tools.

30:23.021 --> 30:27.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that was a nice tool and
I think a
characteristically Barack
Obama-esque dose

30:27.592 --> 30:31.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of realism. I was glad he didn't
apologize.
I think, on balance, the
decision was the

30:31.596 --> 30:35.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right one. He elliptically
avoided that. He
avoided mention of who actually
started the

30:35.867 --> 30:38.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
war, which was diplomatic.

30:38.103 --> 30:42.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, you know, as we heard
earlier, he
held out the hope of getting rid
of nuclear

30:42.207 --> 30:46.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weapons. I'm glad, as a matter
of policy,
he hasn't done much about it.
He's reduced

30:46.645 --> 30:50.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nuclear stockpiles less than the
two Bush
administrations did. And I think
that's just

30:50.582 --> 30:53.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reflecting of the dangerousness
of the world.

30:53.351 --> 30:57.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to be honest, and this all
goes the way
back to the Cold War, I never
got the whole

30:57.122 --> 31:04.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reducing nuclear numbers thing
entirely. Whether
we have 20,000 or 10,000 or
5,000, one is

31:04.796 --> 31:09.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bad. And so I never felt safer
during the
Cold War when we reduced it from
20 to 10,

31:09.801 --> 31:12.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because if we shoot one, that's
bad.

31:12.337 --> 31:14.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a lot of people put a lot of
energy into
this. I have quite never seen
the point of

31:14.306 --> 31:15.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it, to be honest.

31:15.807 --> 31:18.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: They do. They do.
They do.

31:18.243 --> 31:22.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, in the
proliferation,
I think it was just, more than
anything, the

31:22.047 --> 31:27.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
sense of numbers and the
direction that we're
trying to change in that. I
really do, but

31:27.953 --> 31:29.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by reducing the numbers.

31:29.788 --> 31:35.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We went from having, when Dwight
Eisenhower
was elected, five nuclear
weapons, Hiroshima,

31:35.927 --> 31:41.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nagasaki weapons, to a million
by the time
he ended, the equivalent
thereof.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At the end of the
Cold War.

31:43.502 --> 31:48.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I mean, there is a
limit, I
guess, in how much you have to
destroy the

31:48.106 --> 31:49.875 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
world.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, there was
the long reach
of politics, I guess you could
say, while

31:51.710 --> 31:57.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president was in Japan. He
commented on
Donald Trump. He said that world
leaders tell

31:57.415 --> 32:02.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him they're rattled by some
things Donald
Trump is saying, David.

32:02.521 --> 32:05.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump responded, and
criticized the
president, said he shouldn't
have said that.

32:05.924 --> 32:10.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this all comes, David, as
Donald Trump
is figuring out his relationship
with the

32:10.996 --> 32:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Party. He still
doesn't have an
endorsement from Speaker Ryan.
He criticized

32:15.433 --> 32:18.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Republican governor of New
Mexico.

32:18.603 --> 32:21.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where is he in his relationship
with the Republican
Party?

32:21.139 --> 32:25.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, people are
getting in
line to different degrees.
They're acclimatizing

32:25.343 --> 32:27.279 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
themselves.

32:27.312 --> 32:30.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as I mentioned last week,
they're normalizing
Donald Trump, as if he's a
normal candidate.

32:30.916 --> 32:34.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a lot of them will say,
well, the Supreme
Court is what really matters,
and he will

32:34.252 --> 32:36.021 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pick a better Supreme Court.

32:36.054 --> 32:40.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I -- somebody make a good
point. If David
Duke was the Republican nominee,
would you

32:40.525 --> 32:43.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say the Supreme Court is all
that matters?
Would you support David Duke? At
some point,

32:43.929 --> 32:48.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to my mind, a line has to be
drawn, that you
just won't support a certain
sort of person.

32:48.967 --> 32:54.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I have that a lot of
Republicans are coming
into view just saying, well,
whatever, he's

32:54.739 --> 33:00.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
part of the team. And Marco
Rubio has sort
of slid into that. Ryan and Cruz
are holdouts.

33:00.412 --> 33:06.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Ryan is like -- he's like,
do I really
have to marry Henry VIII?
Because it's bad.

33:06.151 --> 33:09.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then Cruz, it's personal.
Some of the
things Cruz said -- that Trump
said on the

33:09.821 --> 33:14.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign trail just got into
Cruz's -- legitimately
into his heart. And he is just,
I can't go

33:14.926 --> 33:16.695 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

33:16.728 --> 33:20.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so there's a slowly seepage
into Trump
world, but with a few, I would
say, honorable

33:21.032 --> 33:22.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
holdouts.

33:22.601 --> 33:26.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you size
up his -- this
relationship-building exercise?

33:26.271 --> 33:31.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I agree with
David about
Ted Cruz. Donald Trump
gratuitously slanderous

33:31.409 --> 33:39.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ted Cruz's wife. He libeled Ted
Cruz's father
for being potentially part of
Lee Harvey Oswald's

33:39.751 --> 33:45.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
assassination of the president
of the United
States, suggesting that he was
somehow a fellow

33:45.757 --> 33:47.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
traveler in that.

33:47.659 --> 33:57.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a libel. You don't get
over it. But
I -- at the same time, I may not
be the sharpest

33:57.035 --> 34:03.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
knife in the drawer, but I
cannot figure out
any possible advantage to Donald
Trump when

34:03.041 --> 34:08.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's got a problem with Latinos
and with women
to go into New Mexico, where the
nation's

34:08.647 --> 34:15.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only Latina woman Republican
governor sits,
who has not said anything
negative about him,

34:15.153 --> 34:22.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who endorsed one of his
opponents, but has
not been an attack dog on Donald
Trump, and

34:22.127 --> 34:26.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
absolutely goes after her and is
abusive to
her.

34:26.798 --> 34:31.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm just saying to myself,
what is the
advantage to this? And I just --
I think this

34:31.236 --> 34:35.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
man may be addicted to the roar
of the grease
paint and the sound of the
crowd, or however

34:35.607 --> 34:42.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it goes, smell of the crowd. And
those rallies
bring out something in him, and
he just feels

34:42.147 --> 34:44.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that he has to -- and it's all
personal, Judy.

34:44.149 --> 34:47.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it's not a philosophical
difference.
It's not a political difference.
It's all

34:47.886 --> 34:49.287 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
personal.

34:49.321 --> 34:51.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: There is an
undercurrent here
which has been going on.

34:51.156 --> 34:53.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have talked. And I do believe
that a large
part of Trump's support comes
out of economic

34:53.925 --> 34:59.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
distress and social dislocation.
But there
has always been an ethnic
element to it, and

34:59.331 --> 35:03.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how much that plays a role in
Trump's support
is really impossible to measure.

35:03.268 --> 35:09.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His voters are not as poor as we
used to say.
Their incomes are in the 90s,
$90,000s. And

35:09.341 --> 35:12.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so they're a lot of affluent
voters. So, I
not that they're not necessarily
economically

35:12.510 --> 35:16.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hurting. And so maybe -- if
there's a strategy
there -- and I think -- tend to
think there's

35:16.915 --> 35:18.650 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
not.

35:18.683 --> 35:22.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I tend to think he just gets
carried away
by his addiction to insult. And
he just goes

35:22.187 --> 35:26.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after people. But if there's a
strategy, it's
maybe to whip up every white
person in America,

35:26.691 --> 35:28.493 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he think.s

35:28.526 --> 35:31.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just want to mention, one
other episode
this week was the invocation of
Vincent Foster's

35:31.896 --> 35:36.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
suicide, which was another
appalling moment.
And we're...

35:36.067 --> 35:36.901 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

35:36.935 --> 35:38.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Clinton White
House.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: The Clinton White
House. It
was a Clinton friend, friend of
Hillary Clinton

35:40.972 --> 35:43.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back, I think, at the Rose Law
Firm.

35:43.475 --> 35:48.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he came to Washington.
Whatever happened
happened, and he committed
suicide. And just

35:48.413 --> 35:53.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to invoke the conspiracy
theories that still
swirl around that is just -- you
know, the

35:53.218 --> 35:54.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mind boggles, if we weren't used
to it.

35:54.986 --> 35:59.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I was going to
say, yes, he
was critical of Governor
Martinez, but what

35:59.491 --> 36:03.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he had to say about Hillary
Clinton, at one
point, he was holding his hands
over his ears

36:03.428 --> 36:06.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and saying, her scream, I can't
stand it.
He called her a lowlife.

36:06.664 --> 36:11.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I guess, today, he was
saying, "Does she
look like a president?"

36:11.436 --> 36:15.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How does Hillary Clinton, Mark,
how does she
counter that? Does she have a
strategy for

36:15.940 --> 36:20.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coming back at somebody who
every day, it
seems, has a new line of attack?

36:20.512 --> 36:22.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

36:22.313 --> 36:25.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, let me, first of all,
recommend Sheila
Anthony, who is Vince Foster's
sister, had

36:25.984 --> 36:32.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a beautiful piece today in The
Washington
Post asking, is there no limit
to your shame?

36:32.257 --> 36:34.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do you have no sense of
embarrassment?

36:34.125 --> 36:42.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, after five
investigations, the Department
of Justice, the special counsel,
Ken Starr,

36:42.767 --> 36:47.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
all concluded, without a
question, that Vince
Foster committed suicide, and
Donald Trump

36:47.439 --> 36:49.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is saying there is something
fishy here.

36:49.507 --> 36:53.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What Hillary Clinton has going
for her is
a secret weapon, and it's called
Elizabeth

36:53.878 --> 37:01.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Warren. Elizabeth Warren gets
under Donald
Trump's skin. And I think she's
been the most

37:01.119 --> 37:06.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
effective adversary. I think
she's done more
to unite the Democratic Party
than either

37:06.091 --> 37:07.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary Clinton or Bernie
Sanders.

37:07.492 --> 37:09.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Really?

37:09.294 --> 37:13.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I mean, she
obviously -- he
can't stay away from her. He is
tweeting about

37:13.698 --> 37:15.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
her.

37:15.567 --> 37:20.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, she had a line
that absolutely
drove him bats. And, in fact, I
wrote it down,

37:20.705 --> 37:25.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because I knew I would forget
it. "A man who
cares about no one but himself,
a small, insecure

37:25.343 --> 37:29.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
money-grubber who doesn't care
about who gets
hurt, so long as he makes some
money out of

37:29.314 --> 37:33.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it. What kind of a man is that?
A man who
will never be president."

37:33.651 --> 37:37.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the fact that she
hasn't endorsed
Hillary is probably...

37:37.322 --> 37:38.289 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

37:38.323 --> 37:39.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hasn't endorsed
Hillary Clinton.

37:39.224 --> 37:40.492 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

37:40.525 --> 37:42.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Hasn't endorsed
Hillary, hasn't
endorsed Bernie.

37:42.327 --> 37:46.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's interesting. I think --
I don't think
Hillary Clinton's figured it
out. I mean,

37:46.498 --> 37:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary Clinton was playing
defense this week.

37:48.633 --> 37:55.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But whether it's
Elizabeth
Warren or not, doesn't Hillary
Clinton, David,

37:55.240 --> 37:59.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need to come up with some
approach that works,
that is an effective comeback?

38:00.011 --> 38:04.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. Well, I think
she does,
not that anybody else has
managed to do this.

38:04.749 --> 38:08.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Set aside the e-mail thing, but
she's just
had a very bad week. If you
looked at her

38:08.553 --> 38:13.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
communication style, it's gotten
almost soporific.
She just can't do the Christmas.

38:13.958 --> 38:20.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump, for all his moral flaws,
is a marketing
genius. And you look at what he
does. He just

38:20.165 --> 38:25.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
picks a word and he attaches it
to a person.
Little Marco, lyin' Ted, crooked
Hillary.

38:25.270 --> 38:27.005 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Crooked Hillary.

38:27.038 --> 38:29.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And that's a word.
And that's
how marketing works. It's a
simple, blunt

38:29.841 --> 38:31.676 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
message, but it gets under.

38:31.709 --> 38:35.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It sticks, and it diminishes.
And so it has
been super effective for him,
because he knows

38:35.547 --> 38:41.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how to do that. And she just
comes, with oh,
he's divisive. These are words
that are not

38:41.052 --> 38:46.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
exciting people. And her
campaign style has
gotten, if anything, I think a
little more

38:47.025 --> 38:49.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
stagnant and more flat.

38:49.460 --> 38:54.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the tactics, it seems to
me, is either
you do what Elizabeth Warren has
done, like

38:54.199 --> 39:00.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
full-bore negativity, that kind
of under the
skin, or try to ridicule him and
use humor.

39:00.505 --> 39:02.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Humor is not Hillary Clinton's
strongest point.

39:02.540 --> 39:06.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But even without
Donald Trump,
Hillary Clinton has these other
problems.

39:06.477 --> 39:08.213 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
David mentioned the e-mails.

39:08.246 --> 39:12.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much of a problem is that
for Hillary
Clinton, Mark? And then,
meanwhile, Bernie

39:12.717 --> 39:17.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders is still out there
competing hard
in California, trying to debate
Trump. It

39:17.922 --> 39:19.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was on again/off again. It looks
like it's
off.

39:19.791 --> 39:23.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, first of
all, Judy, we
found out that they had not been
candid, they

39:23.628 --> 39:27.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have not been helpful, they have
not been
cooperative, they, the Clinton
-- starting

39:27.365 --> 39:31.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Secretary Clinton and her
staff, with
the inspector general, the State
Department.

39:31.135 --> 39:32.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the e-mail.

39:32.570 --> 39:35.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Said there were no
rules broken.
There were rules broken.

39:35.840 --> 39:42.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, for a candidacy and a
candidate
who has suffered from perceived
problems of

39:42.046 --> 39:47.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lack of transparency and lack of
candor, this
was a compounded act of lack of
candor and

39:47.619 --> 39:50.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lack of transparency and
forthrightness.

39:50.221 --> 39:55.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, yes, it's a problem. It's
probably better
that it happened on Memorial Day
than happen

39:55.426 --> 40:02.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Labor Day or Columbus Day.
But, as far
as California is concerned, we
get conflicting

40:02.500 --> 40:08.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reports that the race has
tightened, 850,000
new voters since the 1st of
January until

40:08.606 --> 40:10.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the 31st of March.

40:10.775 --> 40:15.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It should be a state -- it's a
state she won
against Barack Obama in 2008.
It's a state

40:15.546 --> 40:22.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with a large minority population
of Democrats,
which should be her strong suit.

40:22.220 --> 40:28.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, I don't think
there is any
question that it's a horse race
out there.

40:28.259 --> 40:34.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, don't -- the Democrats
shouldn't get
suicidal. Jimmy Carter lost the
California

40:34.165 --> 40:40.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
primary in 1976 about to be
nominated, eventually
elected, by 1.3 million votes to
Jerry Brown.

40:40.505 --> 40:42.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thirty seconds.

40:42.607 --> 40:44.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What does Bernie Sanders want,
David?

40:44.609 --> 40:46.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, he's
winning. I mean,
he's rising.

40:47.011 --> 40:51.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I don't -- you go to the
rallies, he must
feel good. The numbers are
swinging in his

40:51.382 --> 40:54.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
direction. And he believes in a
cause, he
believes in a mission. It's also
psychologically

40:54.686 --> 40:58.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
super hard, especially if you're
winning,
to walk away from this thing.

40:58.156 --> 41:02.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I understand why he's still
going. I think
he wants to change the country
and change

41:02.093 --> 41:06.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the party. And it's working, so
why should
he quit, frankly?

41:06.197 --> 41:14.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But we will see
about California,
10 more days.

41:14.105 --> 41:21.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
David Brooks, Mark Shields,
thank you both.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Dogs have long
been used in
classrooms for children with
special needs,

41:28.152 --> 41:33.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as visitors in senior citizens'
homes, and
as comfort for patients in
hospitals.

41:33.391 --> 41:39.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now canine companions are being
used to help
crime victims cope with the
aftermath of violence

41:39.630 --> 41:40.965 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and abuse.

41:40.998 --> 41:43.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Kathleen
McCleery has
our story.

41:43.468 --> 41:48.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL Ramos, District
Attorney, San Bernardino
County: Hey, you're here, too?
Wow, OK. Come

41:48.206 --> 41:52.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here, buddy. How are you? I hear
you have
been busy in court, huh?

41:52.110 --> 41:56.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: In San
Bernardino, California,
two black Labradors are regulars
in the district

41:56.914 --> 41:58.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
attorney's office.

41:58.816 --> 42:05.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Three-year-old Dozer and
2.5-year-old Lupe
are among DA Michael Ramos'
newest staff members,

42:05.623 --> 42:11.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
part of a special victims canine
unit. Last
August, they were officially
sworn in, paws

42:11.529 --> 42:14.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on a California criminal law
book.

42:14.699 --> 42:19.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The dogs' job is to reduce fear
and help some
of the most vulnerable victims,
many of them

42:20.004 --> 42:22.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
children, feel comfortable in
court.

42:22.039 --> 42:28.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL RAMOS: They have never
been in a courtroom,
you know, in their lives, and
add on top of

42:28.112 --> 42:35.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, they're going to have to
discuss, and
tell a jury about how they were
either physically

42:35.253 --> 42:44.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
abused, sexually abused, and
have to relive
those horrible moments in their
lives.

42:44.195 --> 42:48.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Dozer was
detailed to a
case in juvenile court late last
year.

42:48.266 --> 42:52.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PEARL CURIEL, Mother: My
daughters were a
victim of abuse.

42:52.603 --> 42:55.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Pearl
Curiel's daughters
had to testify.

42:55.506 --> 43:04.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GIRL: I felt nervous, because
the judge is
like right there, and you just
look up at

43:04.449 --> 43:10.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the judge and you think, I'm
going to freak
out.

43:10.154 --> 43:17.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GIRL: I felt kind of scared, but
once I saw
Dozer with me, I wasn't scared
anymore.

43:17.128 --> 43:22.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PEARL CURIEL: I couldn't be
right there, where
the mom is supposed to be. I
couldn't hold

43:22.900 --> 43:29.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my daughter and rub her back
while she talked,
you know? But he was. He was
able to say,

43:29.540 --> 43:33.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know what, I'm not going to
leave you.
And I'm going to sit right next
to you, and

43:33.811 --> 43:36.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you can pet me, and you can talk
to me, you
know?

43:36.314 --> 43:40.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know if they would have
made it through
without him. It's so silly,
because it's like

43:40.751 --> 43:44.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's just a dog, you know, it's
just -- but
he is a superhero. Like, for my
girls, I know

43:45.022 --> 43:46.724 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
he is.

43:46.757 --> 43:49.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Dozer's
handler, child
advocate Yesica Cioli, believes
the dog's

43:49.894 --> 43:51.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
support will have a long-term
effect.

43:51.762 --> 43:54.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YESICA CIOLI, Child Advocate,
San Bernardino
County: Whenever a victim gives
their testimony,

43:54.499 --> 43:59.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they feel empowered. So I think
the girls
getting up there, and telling
their story,

43:59.937 --> 44:06.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and telling what happened is the
first step
in them being able to overcome
the situation

44:06.944 --> 44:08.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and become survivors.

44:08.880 --> 44:14.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: The other
lab, Lupe, was
tasked with calming two young
boys, one allegedly

44:14.252 --> 44:20.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
abused by a relative. In April,
the dog accompanied
them on a mock run-through ahead
of the actual

44:20.358 --> 44:22.059 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
trial.

44:22.093 --> 44:24.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
D.J. ROSS, Child Advocate, San
Bernardino
County: I had a rape case for a
child that

44:24.395 --> 44:30.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was raped from the time he was 4
to 10, and
was all alone and couldn't tell
anybody. It

44:30.835 --> 44:35.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was very difficult for him to
have to describe
what he went through.

44:35.106 --> 44:42.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL RAMOS: The young victim
was really
nervous, really stressed. And
Lupe, our dog,

44:42.747 --> 44:49.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
picked up on it, and went up to
him and nudged
the young victim on the leg. The
young victim

44:49.620 --> 44:57.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
started to pet the dog, rubbing
his ears,
and Lupe is on him. And he was
able to relax,

44:57.962 --> 45:01.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
didn't have the anxiety, and he
was able to
tell what happened to him.

45:02.033 --> 45:06.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: The dogs have
their own
office. Like humans here, they
work a nine-hour

45:06.203 --> 45:12.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
day, and then go home with their
handlers.
It cost about $80,000 to start
up the facility

45:12.243 --> 45:15.346 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dog program in San Bernardino.

45:15.379 --> 45:19.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That includes a specially
equipped van with
windows that roll down if the
temperature

45:19.750 --> 45:26.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inside gets too hot and water
bowls that won't
tip over. Officials expect the
dogs to remain

45:26.190 --> 45:28.960 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on the job for about nine years.

45:28.993 --> 45:33.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judges have to approve before a
dog can come
to court. The jury is told in
advance that

45:33.731 --> 45:39.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the dog will be sitting here in
the witness
box, sight unseen. And defense
attorneys have

45:39.403 --> 45:41.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the chance to object.

45:41.272 --> 45:45.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you ever hear that the dog
might be able
to create some sort of sympathy
for the victim?

45:45.042 --> 45:46.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that a concern?

45:46.877 --> 45:49.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL RAMOS: You know, that
was a concern.
In fact, there have been briefs
written and

45:49.513 --> 45:55.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
motions written by attorneys, by
district
attorney's offices when that
issue comes up.

45:55.086 --> 45:59.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once everybody gets comfortable
with this
whole new process, I don't think
you're going

45:59.123 --> 46:04.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have that issue, because even
the defense
bar, all they want is the truth
as well, and

46:04.428 --> 46:06.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
so do the courts.

46:06.297 --> 46:09.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Last year,
Dozer and Lupe
were deployed to the scene of
the terrorist

46:09.500 --> 46:14.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attacks in San Bernardino, along
with two
English Labrador retrievers.

46:14.338 --> 46:20.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wally and Giovanni had recently
joined the
FBI as the bureau's first crisis
response

46:20.378 --> 46:26.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
canines. They comforted victims
and families,
and helped relieve stress when
employees returned

46:26.751 --> 46:29.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to work a month later.

46:29.720 --> 46:34.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Assistance Dogs of the West in
Santa Fe, New
Mexico, breeds and trains the
dogs. They have

46:34.792 --> 46:39.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
placed 15 in judicial districts,
and have
at least eight more in the
pipeline. They

46:39.864 --> 46:45.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also provide dogs to individuals
and organizations,
but courthouse work is growing,
says executive

46:45.803 --> 46:47.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
director Linda Milanesi.

46:47.705 --> 46:49.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDA MILANESI, Executive
Director, Assistance
Dogs of the West: We realized
that this was

46:49.507 --> 46:55.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
an area that was really
exploring something
new, that had the potential to
reach a lot

46:55.913 --> 47:01.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of people, and that was really
making a new
map in the world, in the world,
in the judicial

47:01.919 --> 47:03.587 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
system.

47:03.621 --> 47:07.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Most
courthouse dogs are
labs and golden retrievers, bred
for good

47:07.458 --> 47:13.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health and an even temperament.
Intensive
training starts early with lots
of hands-on

47:13.197 --> 47:14.899 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
attention.

47:14.932 --> 47:19.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Professionals work with them one
on one, often
in public places. The dogs learn
about 90

47:19.670 --> 47:27.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
complex tasks. Children ages
8-18 teach them
commands, too. High school
sophomore Natalie

47:27.311 --> 47:30.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Longmire-Kulis has been training
dogs since
she was 9.

47:30.748 --> 47:33.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATALIE LONGMIRE-KULIS, Dog
Trainer: The dog
learns patience. They also learn
how to be

47:33.551 --> 47:38.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
touched in different ways,
because, obviously,
9-year-old hands are different
from 18-year-old

47:38.089 --> 47:42.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hands, and so they pet different
ways, and
they cuddle different ways, and
their bodies

47:43.027 --> 47:44.795 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are different.

47:44.829 --> 47:47.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it really just allows the
dogs to get used
to different body types and
different ways

47:47.498 --> 47:49.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of handling.

47:49.400 --> 47:52.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JILL FELICE, Founder, Assistance
Dogs of the
West: Having the dogs being
trained by students,

47:52.803 --> 47:56.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of the outcomes is they all
learn to listen
to little voices.

47:56.640 --> 48:03.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Jill Felice
founded Assistance
Dogs of the West. She says the
key to instilling

48:03.114 --> 48:05.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
calm and trust is simple
science.

48:05.516 --> 48:10.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JILL FELICE: Dogs actually help
us release
oxytocin, which is the calming
hormone and

48:10.955 --> 48:17.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the bonding hormone, and when
you are able
to have that hormone going
through your body,

48:17.795 --> 48:22.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as opposed to the stress
hormone, cortisol,
it's much easier to tell your
story.

48:22.299 --> 48:26.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: After nearly
two years
of study, the dogs move on.

48:26.403 --> 48:32.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Love Story" actress and animal
lover Ali
MacGraw presided over this
year's commencement

48:32.243 --> 48:38.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ceremony celebrating 12
four-legged graduates.
Among them were FBI dogs, Wally
and Giovanni,

48:38.816 --> 48:43.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who flew in from Washington for
the festivities,
and a labradoodle named Zeus who
is headed

48:43.854 --> 48:48.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to veterans court in Albuquerque
to work with
vets with combat injuries.

48:48.392 --> 48:52.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MacGraw believes the courthouse
dog program
uses compassion to promote
justice.

48:52.463 --> 49:00.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALI MACGRAW, Actress: I'm so
moved, especially
in this crazy, often
negative-sounding world

49:00.137 --> 49:06.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we -- fear-driven that
we're in now,
when I see that a few people can
change the

49:06.944 --> 49:12.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lives for the good of everybody
involved,
and I think it gives me hope.

49:12.616 --> 49:22.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: For the "PBS
NewsHour,"
I'm Kathleen McCleery in Santa
Fe, New Mexico.

49:22.259 --> 49:32.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now some very
good news: After
more than a month away, my
partner, Gwen Ifill,

49:32.203 --> 49:35.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will be rejoining the "NewsHour"
next week.

49:35.239 --> 49:40.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she will be, you will be on
PBS tonight
with your Friday show,
"Washington Week."

49:40.744 --> 49:42.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are so excited to have you
back.

49:42.580 --> 49:47.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I'm thrilled to be
back. And I
really missed you, Judy,
especially, everybody

49:47.551 --> 49:49.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
else, but really you.

49:49.286 --> 49:51.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We missed you. We
all missed
you. If you could see a chorus,
you would

49:51.989 --> 49:52.756 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
see.

49:52.790 --> 49:54.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: OK, back to
business.

49:54.558 --> 49:57.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On "Washington Week" tonight, we
look at the
upsides, the downsides and the
challenges

49:57.862 --> 50:02.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
awaiting the three remaining
candidates for
president. Plus, we assess the
current president's

50:02.433 --> 50:04.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
long-awaited Asia pivot.

50:04.301 --> 50:08.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, so Gwen, we
are putting
you to work as soon as you're
back next week.

50:08.205 --> 50:10.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're going to sit down with
the president

GWEN IFILL: Yes. We're going to
talk to the
people of Elkhart, Indiana, ask
them what

50:14.945 --> 50:18.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
questions they have for the
president. And
we may have a few of our own as
well, Judy.

50:18.349 --> 50:20.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We can't wait.

50:20.251 --> 50:21.318 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
She's back.

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online: Today,
four poets share their memories
and perspective

50:29.627 --> 50:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Hiroshima. All that and more
is on our
Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

50:36.567 --> 50:41.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on "PBS NewsHour Weekend,"
rural America
facing a shortage of lawyers.

NARRATOR: Attorney Kristen
Kochekian (ph)
is spending her morning with the
mayor of

50:45.109 --> 50:49.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Doland, South Dakota, discussing
how, legally,
the rural ranching community can
address a

50:49.580 --> 50:53.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
local rat infestation and a dog
wreaking havoc
on the town.

50:53.450 --> 50:57.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Such legal counsel is hard to
come by in Doland
and the nine surrounding
communities in Spink

50:57.788 --> 51:02.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
County. Until last year, there
were only two
attorneys with private practices
serving the

51:02.493 --> 51:04.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
county's 6,000 residents.

51:04.295 --> 51:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID GILBERTSON, Chief Justice:
South Dakota
has 66 counties; 64 of them have
courthouses.

51:08.799 --> 51:13.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are not going to function
without attorneys
there. It's the same as a
hospital with no

51:13.070 --> 51:15.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nurses. Nothing's going to
happen.

51:15.639 --> 51:21.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And before we go,
we want to
remember a longtime contributor
to the "NewsHour."

51:21.679 --> 51:26.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Producer and editor David Wald
died today.
You didn't see him on camera,
but he was a

51:26.216 --> 51:32.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gentle and smart force behind
the scenes on
dozens of education stories. He
worked closely

51:32.056 --> 51:37.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with correspondents John Merrow
and John Tulenko
for more than a decade. He had
recently joined

51:37.428 --> 51:41.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the Education Week team,
producing reports
for us as well.

51:41.865 --> 51:47.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His wide-ranging coverage ran
from the transformation
of New Orleans schools, to the
battle over

51:47.304 --> 51:52.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Common Core, to a New Jersey
school providing
relief after Superstorm Sandy.

51:52.743 --> 51:57.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David was a great colleague and
friend, a
producer who frequently came up
with the best

51:57.147 --> 52:00.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ideas, and yet rarely took the
credit.

52:00.117 --> 52:05.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
David Wald was 61 years old.

52:05.789 --> 52:08.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

52:08.692 --> 52:14.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Monday, we will be back with
a look at
the economic power of Latinos in
the U.S.

52:14.298 --> 52:24.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm Judy Woodruff. We hope you
have a great
Memorial Day weekend. Thank you,
and good
