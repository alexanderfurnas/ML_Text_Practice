JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: a sexual
assault scandal that has rocked
Baylor University, and ignited

00:05.900 --> 00:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
questions over whether
the university ignored
the complaints of victims.

00:10.133 --> 00:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The school confirmed in
recent days that it is
also the subject of an
ongoing NCAA investigation.

00:16.533 --> 00:20.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the focus of our weekly
segment Making the Grade.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang has the latest.

00:22.100 --> 00:26.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: More than a
dozen women have filed
lawsuits against Baylor,
the country's largest

00:26.100 --> 00:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Baptist university, saying the
school ignored or mishandled
their claims going back several

00:31.766 --> 00:34.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The school's Board of
Regents has acknowledged
that 19 football players
were accused of criminal,

00:39.000 --> 00:41.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sexual or physical
assault at one point.

00:41.366 --> 00:45.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of them, Tevin Elliot,
was convicted and sentenced
to 20 years in prison.

00:45.833 --> 00:50.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The head football coach,
Art Briles, was fired,
and the president, Ken
Starr, quit after he

00:51.466 --> 00:53.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was demoted.

00:53.100 --> 00:55.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Paula Lavigne is a
reporter with ESPN.

00:55.233 --> 00:57.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She's been investigating
the Baylor case.

00:57.500 --> 01:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's the co-author of a
forthcoming book on the case
called "Violated: Exposing Rape

01:04.100 --> 01:07.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
at Baylor University
Amid College Football's
Sexual Assault Crisis."

01:07.633 --> 01:09.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Paula, thanks for joining us.

01:09.966 --> 01:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Remind us of these allegations.

01:11.966 --> 01:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have been around for a
while, but remind us of the
scope, how far back they go, the

01:17.433 --> 01:18.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
nature of the
allegations at Baylor.

01:18.433 --> 01:20.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAULA LAVIGNE, ESPN: Right.

01:20.400 --> 01:23.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The allegations go back
for more than a decade.

01:23.100 --> 01:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And right now, in court cases
alone, you have 15 different
women filing Title IX federal

01:30.633 --> 01:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lawsuits against the school
in cases involving domestic
violence, sexual assault.

01:35.233 --> 01:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But depending on who you talk
to, there are hundreds of cases.

01:42.233 --> 01:45.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And many of them involve
football players, but actually
this is a much larger problem.

01:47.400 --> 01:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They involve regular
students, fraternity
members, I mean, you name it.

01:52.733 --> 01:55.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It is a huge problem
at the school.

01:55.900 --> 02:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And another sort of interesting
layer to it is the fact that
we're talking about the world's

02:00.133 --> 02:05.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
largest Baptist university, and
a lot of these women are saying,
you know, part of the problem

02:07.066 --> 02:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here was that the school's
Christian values really didn't
foster an environment in which

02:12.900 --> 02:17.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
women were encouraged to come
forward or in which their
cases were taken seriously.

02:19.466 --> 02:22.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you compound that on
top of the issues with the
prominent football team.

02:22.400 --> 02:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, yes, the scope, it just
touches all aspects of higher
education and of sexual assault

02:30.166 --> 02:32.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on campus.

02:32.200 --> 02:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And what can the
NCAA do, and what can it
not do in cases like this?

02:35.966 --> 02:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAULA LAVIGNE: So, that's
a really good question.

02:38.400 --> 02:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, a lot of people -- if
you're not familiar with college
sports, it's important to know

02:41.700 --> 02:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the NCAA is sort of
the arbiter over amateur
college athletics, right?

02:48.400 --> 02:53.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And their purpose is to
ensure fair competition
and amateurism, OK?

02:55.733 --> 03:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, a lot of people think
They want the NCAA to
do something about this.

03:01.333 --> 03:02.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

03:02.833 --> 03:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is a huge call for
the NCAA to address this.

03:05.200 --> 03:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the issue is
that sexual violence,
addressing sexual violence,
addressing just criminal

03:12.100 --> 03:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
behavior on behalf of athletes
really isn't something that's
technically in the NCAA's

03:16.166 --> 03:18.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wheelhouse.

03:18.700 --> 03:22.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so for people to
understand what their
scope is, it's important
to understand a particular

03:23.566 --> 03:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
term that the NCAA uses,
which is extra benefit, OK?

03:30.433 --> 03:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, and when we think of extra
benefits, we often think of
student athletes being given

03:35.800 --> 03:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
money from boosters or fancy
cars or allowed to basically
skate on a class, OK?

03:41.000 --> 03:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The NCAA, in this case, for
people who are - - people on
the outside who are familiar

03:47.533 --> 03:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the investigation and
people who are familiar with
the NCAA are saying, well, one

03:50.533 --> 03:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way they can get enforcement in
a case involving sexual violence
is to say, OK, are these student

03:57.433 --> 04:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
athletes getting an extra
benefit if they are being
diverted from judicial affairs,

04:03.966 --> 04:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if they are getting a pass
from local law enforcement,
if coaches or administrators

04:11.000 --> 04:14.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are hooking them up with legal
counsel and maybe they're not
paying what a regular student

04:16.533 --> 04:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would be paying for that legal
counsel, all of those sort of
things that a regular student

04:19.800 --> 04:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
might -- who gets in trouble
might not be afforded?

04:22.433 --> 04:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're saying, well, maybe the
NCAA can consider that an extra
benefit, and, in that sense,

04:29.100 --> 04:31.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it could come in and take
some enforcement action.

04:31.066 --> 04:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The issue of sexual
assaults on - - sexual violence
on college campuses has

04:35.733 --> 04:38.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
gotten a lot of discussion.

04:38.466 --> 04:43.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Talk about sort of the bigger
issue here of how colleges
even outside athletic programs

04:45.233 --> 04:46.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are dealing with that.

04:46.633 --> 04:49.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAULA LAVIGNE: It
is a huge issue.

04:49.466 --> 04:54.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's been statistics that
have been backed up by numerous
research that one in five women

04:56.366 --> 05:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will experience some
sort of type of sexual
assault while in college.

05:00.300 --> 05:04.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And right now, there's more than
200 colleges and universities
under investigation by the

05:04.666 --> 05:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. Department of Education.

05:07.266 --> 05:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, this is a perfect
time to be talking about
this, because a lot of
the federal government's

05:13.966 --> 05:17.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
civil rights enforcement
actions are being called into
question right now, and one of

05:18.166 --> 05:20.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
those deals specifically
with Title IX.

05:20.566 --> 05:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Title IX is the venue that
the U.S. Department of Education
uses to enforce how colleges

05:28.233 --> 05:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and universities are
addressing sexual violence.

05:31.200 --> 05:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there are a lot of people
who are saying schools shouldn't
be involved in what is seen

05:37.133 --> 05:39.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as a criminal matter.

05:39.133 --> 05:43.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a problem with that is that
that's pretty short-sighted,
because Title IX does a lot

05:46.433 --> 05:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more in addressing
sexual violence than just
determining whether or
not an alleged perpetrator

05:51.100 --> 05:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is responsible for the act.

05:53.233 --> 05:57.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I mean, one of the --
you mentioned the case
involving Tevin Elliot.

05:57.500 --> 06:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The young woman in that
case, I mean, she saw her
accused perpetrator convicted.

06:04.500 --> 06:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
However, her biggest issue was
the fact that she didn't get
the counseling services, she

06:09.933 --> 06:12.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
didn't get the
academic services.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She was basically sort
of left floundering.

06:14.533 --> 06:19.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She ends up dropping out,
doesn't get to pursue
her dream, and has to
transfer and move back

06:19.633 --> 06:21.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
home.

06:21.700 --> 06:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is nothing in the criminal
justice system that provides
that sort of remedy, and that's

06:24.300 --> 06:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what Title IX is designed to do.

06:26.366 --> 06:31.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's designed to force
these schools to address
specific cases of
sexual violence, in part

06:32.766 --> 06:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to determine whether or
not someone is responsible.

06:34.900 --> 06:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the bigger part, the part
that's often ignored, is by
providing a safe campus for

06:41.866 --> 06:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these women to attend, providing
counseling services if they
need them, providing academic

06:45.100 --> 06:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
services to make them
whole again, so they can
continue their education.

06:48.933 --> 06:52.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Paula Lavigne
of ESPN, thanks so
much for joining us.

06:52.500 --> 06:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAULA LAVIGNE: You're welcome.
