BY A POLICE OFFICER ONE YEAR AGO

00:18.185 --> 00:19.253

THE FORCEFUL POLICE RESPONSE,

00:22.789 --> 00:24.591
HAVE AFFECTED POLICE TACTICS

00:41.441 --> 00:42.442
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING AND

00:42.442 --> 00:43.343
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:43.343 --> 00:44.645
FERGUSON, MISSOURI, IS MARKING A

00:44.645 --> 00:46.380
SOMBER ANNIVERSARY TODAY.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.614
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE MARCHED

00:47.614 --> 00:49.016
PEACEFULLY IN THE ST. LOUIS

00:49.016 --> 00:51.018
SUBURB, ONE YEAR AFTER UNARMED

00:51.018 --> 00:52.552
BLACK TEENAGER MICHAEL BROWN WAS

00:52.552 --> 00:53.687
SHOT DEAD BY A WHITE POLICE

00:53.687 --> 00:55.055
OFFICER.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.256
THE MARCHERS FIRST GATHERED AT

00:56.256 --> 00:57.658
THE SPOT WHERE BROWN WAS KILLED,

00:57.658 --> 00:59.059
AND THEY STOOD IN SILENCE FOR

00:59.059 --> 01:00.594
FOUR AND A HALF MINUTES TO

01:00.594 --> 01:01.561
REPRESENT THE FOUR AND A HALF

01:01.561 --> 01:03.297
HOURS THAT BROWN'S UNATTENDED

01:03.297 --> 01:05.265
BODY LAY IN THE STREET.

01:05.265 --> 01:06.333
AFTER THE MOMENT OF SILENCE,

01:06.333 --> 01:08.035
ORGANIZERS RELEASED TWO DOVES.

01:08.035 --> 01:09.536
FEDERAL AND STATE PROSECUTORS

01:09.536 --> 01:11.271
CLEARED OFFICER DARREN WILSON OF

01:11.271 --> 01:12.239
CRIMINAL WRONG-DOING IN THE

01:12.239 --> 01:13.540
SHOOTING, BUT HE IS NO LONGER

01:13.540 --> 01:15.108
WITH THE POLICE FORCE.

01:15.108 --> 01:16.777
WILSON HAD CONFRONTED BROWN AS A

01:16.777 --> 01:18.278
SUSPECT IN A CONVENIENCE STORE

01:18.278 --> 01:19.179
ROBBERY.

01:19.179 --> 01:20.480
THE SHOOTING TOUCHED OFF WEEKS

01:20.480 --> 01:22.015
OF PROTESTS AND GALVANIZED THE

01:22.015 --> 01:23.817
BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.619
AMONG THE CHANGES IN FERGUSON IN

01:25.619 --> 01:27.254
THE PAST YEAR-- MORE DIVERSE

01:27.254 --> 01:29.222
LEADERSHIP: A NEW INTERIM POLICE

01:29.222 --> 01:30.724
CHIEF AND CITY MANAGER, WHO ARE

01:30.724 --> 01:31.558
BLACK.

01:31.558 --> 01:33.026
A NEW PRESIDING JUDGE FOR ITS

01:33.026 --> 01:34.895
MUNICIPAL COURT, AND TWO NEW,

01:34.895 --> 01:36.163
BLACK REPRESENTATIVES ELECTED TO

01:36.163 --> 01:37.364
THE CITY COUNCIL.

01:37.364 --> 01:38.699
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A CITY

01:38.699 --> 01:40.334
THAT IS TWO-THIRDS BLACK,

01:40.334 --> 01:41.735
AFRICAN AMERICANS HOLD HALF THE

01:41.735 --> 01:43.003
SEATS IN THE CITY COUNCIL.

01:43.003 --> 01:44.271
EARLIER, I SPOKE WITH ONE OF

01:44.271 --> 01:45.706
THOSE NEW MEMBERS, WESLEY BELL,

01:45.706 --> 01:47.240
ABOUT CHANGES IN FERGUSON OVER

01:47.240 --> 01:48.608
THE PAST YEAR, AND CHANGES STILL

01:48.608 --> 01:49.776
TO COME.

01:49.776 --> 01:50.844
>> COUNCILMAN BELL WHAT'S

01:50.844 --> 01:53.480
CHANGED IN THE LAST YEAR?

01:53.480 --> 01:55.315
>> A LOT OF THINGS.

01:55.315 --> 01:56.984
ONE, I THINK THERE'S AN

01:56.984 --> 01:59.753
AWARENESS OF THESE ISSUES.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.455
A LOT OF THESE SOCIAL ISSUES

02:01.455 --> 02:04.758
THAT PREDATED FERGUSON.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.460
THAT ARE REGIONAL THAT

02:06.460 --> 02:08.228
THEY'RE -- THAT ARE NATIONAL AND

02:08.228 --> 02:09.730
WE'RE HAVING MORE CONVERSATIONS

02:09.730 --> 02:12.399
ABOUT -- ABOUT PRIVILEGE AND

02:12.399 --> 02:14.601
TENSIONS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:14.601 --> 02:16.236
AND SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES,

02:16.236 --> 02:17.704
PARTICULARLY OUR YOUNG PEOPLE.

02:17.704 --> 02:18.872
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS TO BE

02:18.872 --> 02:20.440
ENCOURAGED ABOUT AS WELL.

02:20.440 --> 02:21.541
>> YOU HAVE BEEN ON THE JOB FOR

02:21.541 --> 02:22.943
A LITTLE MORE THAN 100 DAYS OR

02:22.943 --> 02:24.611
SO NOW MORE THAN TWICE THE

02:24.611 --> 02:26.546
NUMBER OF AVERAGE VOTERS SHOWED

02:26.546 --> 02:28.548
UP TO HELP YOU GET INTO THIS

02:28.548 --> 02:29.950
ELECTION CYCLE.

02:29.950 --> 02:32.185
WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED WILLIAM.

02:32.185 --> 02:33.854
>> I HAVE -- LEARNED?

02:33.854 --> 02:35.889
>> YOU HAVE TO ENGAGE THE

02:35.889 --> 02:38.425
RESIDENTS, YOU HAVE TO GET

02:38.425 --> 02:39.693
INVOLVED BECAUSE YOU NEED TO GET

02:39.693 --> 02:42.129
THE RESIDENTS INVOLVED.

02:42.129 --> 02:44.931
A COMMUNITY THAT'S ENGAGED CAN

02:44.931 --> 02:47.834
ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING AND KEEP IN

02:47.834 --> 02:49.503
MIND: WITH THE WORLD WATCHING

02:49.503 --> 02:51.905
IN FERGUSON, IF WE GET IT RIGHT

02:51.905 --> 02:56.576
HERE, WE CAN SET A BROAD EXAMPLE

02:56.576 --> 02:57.577
NATIONALLY AND EVEN

02:57.577 --> 02:59.513
INTERNATIONALLY OF WHAT CHANGE

02:59.513 --> 03:00.447
CAN LOOK LIKE.

03:00.447 --> 03:02.349
>> WHAT HAS BEEN DONE OVER THE

03:02.349 --> 03:04.418
PAST YEAR TO PREVENT ANOTHER

03:04.418 --> 03:05.919
MICHAEL BROWN-TYPE SITUATION

03:05.919 --> 03:06.820
FROM HAPPENING IN THIS

03:06.820 --> 03:08.221
COMMUNITY?

03:08.221 --> 03:09.156
>> WELL, I

03:09.156 --> 03:11.658
THINK WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE

03:11.658 --> 03:14.194
HAVING THESE HARD CONVERSATIONS.

03:14.194 --> 03:18.565
WE'VE IMPLEMENTED COMMUNITY

03:18.565 --> 03:20.233
POLICING WHICH I'VE BEEN

03:20.233 --> 03:23.870
SCREAMING FROM THE HILLS FOR A

03:23.870 --> 03:25.439
WHILE NOW.

03:25.439 --> 03:28.675
WE HAVE BROUGHT EXPERTS IN TO

03:28.675 --> 03:31.711
HELP US WITH THAT FOR OUR --

03:31.711 --> 03:35.215
HELP US CREATE A MODEL THAT IS

03:35.215 --> 03:37.584
APPROPRIATE FOR OUR CITY.

03:37.584 --> 03:39.719
WE'VE ALSO HIRED OUR NEW CHIEF,

03:39.719 --> 03:41.254
HE IS THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN

03:41.254 --> 03:43.390
CHIEF IN FERGUSON'S HISTORY.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.624
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY HE HAS A

03:44.624 --> 03:46.693
BACKGROUND IN COMMUNITY POLICING

03:46.693 --> 03:51.231
AS WELL AS WITH OTHER TRAINEES,

03:51.231 --> 03:53.133
ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND THINGS

03:53.133 --> 03:54.534
OF THAT NATURE.

03:54.534 --> 03:55.902
ALSO WITH OUR COURTS WE HAVE ONE

03:55.902 --> 03:58.338
OF THE BEST JUDGES IN THE STATE

03:58.338 --> 03:59.906
IN JUDGE DONALD McCULLEN.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.609
WHO IS HEADING OUR COURTS RIGHT

04:02.609 --> 04:03.410
NOW.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.245
AND MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE IS

04:05.245 --> 04:06.246
TREATED FAIRLY.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.747
WE'VE REPEALED A LOT OF THE

04:07.747 --> 04:09.216
ORDINANCES, PARTICULARLY THE

04:09.216 --> 04:10.383
FAILURE TO APPEAR ORDINANCES

04:10.383 --> 04:12.819
THAT WERE CAUSING A LOT OF

04:12.819 --> 04:16.056
EXCESSIVE FINES.

04:16.056 --> 04:17.257
SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT GOING

04:17.257 --> 04:20.026
ON, AND LET ME BE CLEAR:

04:20.026 --> 04:22.629
THERE'S NO DENYING THE CHANGE.

04:22.629 --> 04:23.563
ALL RIGHT?

04:23.563 --> 04:24.664
THERE'S NO DENYING THE PROGRESS

04:24.664 --> 04:26.766
I SHOULD SAY.

04:26.766 --> 04:27.834
NOW, HAVING SAID THAT WE STILL

04:27.834 --> 04:28.869
HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.971
Sreenivasan: SO THE DEPARTMENT

04:30.971 --> 04:33.039
OF JUSTICE IN THAT REPORT WHICH

04:33.039 --> 04:35.709
I'M SURE YOU'VE READ, POINTED TO

04:35.709 --> 04:39.446
SYSTEMIC ISSUES, BETWEEN 2012

04:39.446 --> 04:43.049
AND 2014 EVERY TIME SOMEONE WAS

04:43.049 --> 04:45.719
ARRESTED FOR SOMETHING, THEY

04:45.719 --> 04:46.586
WERE BLACK.

04:46.586 --> 04:48.288
NOW EVEN WITH THE CHANGES YOU'VE

04:48.288 --> 04:50.357
MADE SO FAR ONLY FIVE OF THE 50

04:50.357 --> 04:52.726
OFFICERS ON YOUR FORCE ARE

04:52.726 --> 04:53.660
AFRICAN AMERICAN.

04:53.660 --> 04:56.296
HOW CAN YOU DEAL WITH WHAT MIGHT

04:56.296 --> 04:57.831
BE A MUCH DEEPER PROBLEM IN THE

04:57.831 --> 04:59.199
POLICE DEPARTMENT?

04:59.199 --> 05:00.700
>> WELL, AS FAR AS THE NUMBER OF

05:00.700 --> 05:04.037
POLICE, WE CAN'T JUST FIRE

05:04.037 --> 05:04.971
OFFICERS.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.207
ESPECIALLY THE OVERWHELMING

05:07.207 --> 05:08.475
MAJORITY OF OFFICERS WHO ARE

05:08.475 --> 05:10.944
HONEST AND HARD-WORKING.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.380
BUT I THINK GOAL IS TO RECRUIT

05:13.380 --> 05:15.215
AND LOOKING -- AND LOOK OUTSIDE

05:15.215 --> 05:16.583
OF THE TRADITIONAL WAYS OF

05:16.583 --> 05:18.151
RECRUITING SO WE DO GIVE

05:18.151 --> 05:19.786
EVERYONE AN OPPORTUNITY WHICH WE

05:19.786 --> 05:20.654
HAVE.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.522
AND THE COUNCIL SINCE I'VE BEEN

05:22.522 --> 05:25.225
ON HAS APPROVED FUNDING FOR

05:25.225 --> 05:27.494
SCHOLARSHIPS TO SPONSOR

05:27.494 --> 05:29.763
OFFICERS, PREFERABLY MINORITY

05:29.763 --> 05:31.364
OFFICERS THROUGH OUR DEPARTMENT.

05:31.364 --> 05:32.632
BECAUSE AGAIN IT IS IMPORTANT

05:32.632 --> 05:35.001
THAT THE DEPARTMENT BETTER

05:35.001 --> 05:36.403
REPRESENT THE COMMUNITY.

05:36.403 --> 05:38.205
HAVING SAID THAT, WE'RE NOT

05:38.205 --> 05:40.073
LOOKING TO BRING IN OFFICERS

05:40.073 --> 05:42.375
JUST FOR SAKE OF DIVERSITY.

05:42.375 --> 05:43.910
IT'S IMPORTANT, WE'RE NOT GOING

05:43.910 --> 05:45.345
TO -- IT IS IMPORTANT WE DON'T

05:45.345 --> 05:46.947
COMPROMISE BRINGING IN QUALITY

05:46.947 --> 05:48.448
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE THE

05:48.448 --> 05:49.583
COMMUNITY'S BEST INTERESTS AT

05:49.583 --> 05:50.350
HEART.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.351
>> Sreenivasan: YOU SAID YOU

05:51.351 --> 05:52.852
STILL HAVE SOME WORK LEFT TO DO.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.020
SO WHAT WOULD YOUR CONSTITUENTS

05:54.020 --> 05:56.389
SAY STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE?

05:56.389 --> 05:58.558
>> I THINK TRUST NEEDS TO BE

05:58.558 --> 05:59.693
EARNED.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.861
SO AS A RESULT NO MATTER WHAT

06:01.861 --> 06:03.730
CHANGES WE DO IN A COUPLE MONTHS

06:03.730 --> 06:06.099
SINCE I'VE BEEN ON THE COUNCIL,

06:06.099 --> 06:08.034
YOU KNOW I WOULD, EVEN IF I WAS

06:08.034 --> 06:10.503
JUST -- IF I WASN'T AN ELECTED

06:10.503 --> 06:11.671
OFFICIAL I WOULD STILL WANT TO

06:11.671 --> 06:13.139
SEE A LONGER SAMPLE SIZE IF YOU

06:13.139 --> 06:14.474
WILL.

06:14.474 --> 06:16.576
SO I THINK A LOT OF RESIDENTS DO

06:16.576 --> 06:18.712
SEE THE CHANGE AND SEE THE

06:18.712 --> 06:20.380
PROGRESS.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.548
BUT, YOU KNOW, FOR THOSE WHO

06:21.548 --> 06:22.716
DON'T, HEY, WE'RE GOING TO KEEP

06:22.716 --> 06:24.584
TRYING TO BRING YOU OVER TO OUR

06:24.584 --> 06:25.619
SIDE AND SHOW YOU WHAT WE'RE

06:25.619 --> 06:26.653
DOING.

06:26.653 --> 06:27.887
WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED

06:27.887 --> 06:29.689
JUST A YEAR AGO, IT WOULD BE

06:29.689 --> 06:31.324
NAIVE OF US TO THINK THAT

06:31.324 --> 06:35.328
EVERYTHING WILL BE WELL AND THE

06:35.328 --> 06:36.329
SLATE WILL BE CLEAN.

06:36.329 --> 06:38.265
WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO,

06:38.265 --> 06:39.566
THAT'S WHY I RAN, I WANTED TO BE

06:39.566 --> 06:41.868
PART OF THAT HUMAN PROCESS AND

06:41.868 --> 06:43.470
PART OF THE SOLUTION.

06:43.470 --> 06:45.905
>> WESLEY BELL OF FERGUSON,

06:45.905 --> 06:47.107
MISSOURI THANKS FOR JOINING US.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.342
>> THANKS TO HAVING ME.

06:49.342 --> 06:50.243
>> Sreenivasan: DURING THE

06:50.243 --> 06:51.311
PROTESTS THAT FOLLOWED THE

06:51.311 --> 06:52.646
EXTRA-JUDICIAL SHOOTING OF

06:52.646 --> 06:54.314
MICHAEL BROWN, THE SPECTACLE OF

06:54.314 --> 06:56.082
FERGUSON POLICE PATROLLING THE

06:56.082 --> 06:57.984
STREETS IN COMBAT GEAR WITH

06:57.984 --> 06:59.185
MACHINE GUNS AND ARMORED

06:59.185 --> 07:00.687
VEHICLES SPARKED ANOTHER

07:00.687 --> 07:02.055
CONVERSATION.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.223
LIKE A LOT OF POLICE

07:03.223 --> 07:04.524
DEPARTMENTS, FERGUSON'S HAD BEEN

07:04.524 --> 07:06.426
EQUIPPED WITH MILITARY SURPLUS

07:06.426 --> 07:08.194
PROVIDED BY THE PENTAGON, AND

07:08.194 --> 07:09.696
GEAR PURCHASED WITH DEPARTMENT

07:09.696 --> 07:11.731
OF HOMELAND SECURITY GRANTS.

07:11.731 --> 07:12.732
BUT THIS YEAR, THE OBAMA

07:12.732 --> 07:13.900
ADMINISTRATION HAS CURTAILED

07:13.900 --> 07:15.402
THOSE MILITARY SUPPLIES."

07:15.402 --> 07:16.836
NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTER MATT

07:16.836 --> 07:18.104
APUZZO HAS COVERED THIS ISSUE

07:18.104 --> 07:18.838
AND JOINS ME NOW FROM

07:18.838 --> 07:19.606
WASHINGTON.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.541
>> FIRST OF ALL, HOW PREVALENT

07:21.541 --> 07:23.109
IS IT THAT POLICE DEPARTMENTS

07:23.109 --> 07:24.010
GET THIS MILITARY SURPLUS

07:24.010 --> 07:26.112
EQUIPMENT?

07:26.112 --> 07:27.280
>> WELL, I MEAN IT'S VERY, VERY

07:27.280 --> 07:28.415
PREVALENT.

07:28.415 --> 07:30.417
I MEAN THIS PROGRAM, THIS IDEA

07:30.417 --> 07:32.652
OF MILITARY SURPLUS GOES BACK TO

07:32.652 --> 07:33.787
REALLY THE HEIGHT OF THE DRUG

07:33.787 --> 07:36.589
WAR, WHEN THE IDEA WAS THAT

07:36.589 --> 07:38.191
LOCAL POLICE WERE BASICALLY

07:38.191 --> 07:40.493
OUTGUNNED BY DRUG GANGS.

07:40.493 --> 07:41.928
AND SO THE THINKING IN

07:41.928 --> 07:43.763
WASHINGTON WAS, WELL WE CAN TAKE

07:43.763 --> 07:45.899
THIS EXTRA MILITARY EQUIPMENT

07:45.899 --> 07:48.068
AND PROVIDE IT TO LOCAL POLICE

07:48.068 --> 07:49.736
DEPARTMENTS TO HELP FIGHT THE

07:49.736 --> 07:50.870
DRUG WAR.

07:50.870 --> 07:51.905
AND OBVIOUSLY LIKE A LOT OF

07:51.905 --> 07:53.773
PROGRAMS IT KIND OF RAMPED UP

07:53.773 --> 07:55.842
EVEN MORE AFTER 9/11, AND THE

07:55.842 --> 07:57.610
FOCUS BECAME, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF

07:57.610 --> 07:58.978
COUNTERTERRORISM KIND OF STUFF.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.013
YOU TEND TO SEE

08:00.013 --> 08:05.652
HUMVEES NIGHT VISION GOGGLES AND

08:05.652 --> 08:06.653
THE LIKE.

08:06.653 --> 08:07.987
>> WHAT IS THE CHANGE NOW, WHAT

08:07.987 --> 08:10.724
IS THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSING?

08:10.724 --> 08:12.659
>> OVER EXECUTIVE OWED THAT WENT

08:12.659 --> 08:14.527
THROUGH IN JANUARY, WHAT THE

08:14.527 --> 08:18.098
PRESIDENT IS SAYING THERE'S NOW

08:18.098 --> 08:20.800
A RESTRICTED GROUP OF EQUIPMENT.

08:20.800 --> 08:21.935
THAT WOULD BE INCLUDING

08:21.935 --> 08:24.437
BAYONETS, HIGH CALIBER RIFLES,

08:24.437 --> 08:27.774
TRACKED TRUCKS.

08:27.774 --> 08:29.442
THESE ARE THESE BIG TROOP

08:29.442 --> 08:30.543
TRANSPORTERS THAT LOOK LIKE

08:30.543 --> 08:32.879
TANKS, OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE THE

08:32.879 --> 08:34.314
CANNON MOUNT ON THEM THAT RUN ON

08:34.314 --> 08:36.015
TRACKS.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.585
THOSE ARE THE PROHIBITED ITEMS.

08:38.585 --> 08:45.191
MINE RESISTANT VEHICLES YOU CAN

08:45.191 --> 08:46.693
GET BUT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH

08:46.693 --> 08:47.894
ALL THESE HOOPS AND YOU HAVE TO

08:47.894 --> 08:48.862
PROVE YOU'VE TRAINED ON IT AND

08:48.862 --> 08:50.663
HAVE POLICIES ON HOW TO USE IT.

08:50.663 --> 08:53.433
AND YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY YOU

08:53.433 --> 08:54.734
HAVE A NEED TO HAVE IT.

08:54.734 --> 08:55.568
>> Sreenivasan: AND IN ADDITION

08:55.568 --> 08:57.170
TO SOME SORT OF OVERSIGHT THAT

08:57.170 --> 08:58.438
TAKES A LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE

08:58.438 --> 08:59.305
DOING IN YOUR POLICE FORCE,

08:59.305 --> 09:00.740
RIGHT?

09:00.740 --> 09:02.041
>> EXACTLY RIGHT.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.811
YOU KNOW WHAT WE SAW JUST A FEW

09:04.811 --> 09:06.179
MONTHS AGO, THE JUSTICE

09:06.179 --> 09:08.915
DEPARTMENT DID A REVIEW OF

09:08.915 --> 09:11.017
FERGUSON'S RESPONSE AND THE SORT

09:11.017 --> 09:12.819
OF ST. LOUIS REGION'S RESPONSE

09:12.819 --> 09:15.422
TO THE PROTESTS AND RIOTS AFTER

09:15.422 --> 09:17.157
THE BROWN SHOOTING.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.092
AND WHAT THEY SAID WAS, YOU KNOW

09:19.092 --> 09:20.393
WHILE SOME OF THE EQUIPMENT WAS

09:20.393 --> 09:21.895
USED APPROPRIATELY A LOT OF IT

09:21.895 --> 09:23.897
WAS JUST USED INAPPROPRIATELY

09:23.897 --> 09:25.465
AND UNNECESSARILY.

09:25.465 --> 09:27.267
AND POLICE OFFICERS DIDN'T KNOW

09:27.267 --> 09:28.535
WHO WAS IN CHARGE.

09:28.535 --> 09:31.805
AND YOU HAD THIS ARMORED CAR,

09:31.805 --> 09:33.506
ARMORED TRUCK GOING AROUND WITH

09:33.506 --> 09:37.010
SNIPERS POISED ON THE ROOF OF

09:37.010 --> 09:38.611
THE CAR POINTING THEIR WEAPONS

09:38.611 --> 09:39.813
AT CIVILIANS.

09:39.813 --> 09:42.215
AND THAT IT ONLY SERVED TO

09:42.215 --> 09:45.051
REALLY HEIGHTEN TENSIONS AND

09:45.051 --> 09:46.753
ACTUALLY JUST MADE THINGS WORSE.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.188
Sreenivasan: AND INTERESTINGLY

09:48.188 --> 09:50.056
THERE HAS BEEN PUSH BACK ABOUT

09:50.056 --> 09:51.858
THIS SHOW OF FORCE THIS

09:51.858 --> 09:53.726
MILITARIZATION OR THIS POSTURE

09:53.726 --> 09:55.361
BUT IT REALLY TOOK THE DEATH OF

09:55.361 --> 09:56.796
MICHAEL BROWN THE REACTION IN

09:56.796 --> 09:58.264
FERGUSON TO DO THINGS THAT

09:58.264 --> 09:59.933
LEGISLATORS AND ACTIVISTS COULD

09:59.933 --> 10:02.135
NOT DO.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.670
>> SURE I MEAN, FORGET COULD NOT

10:03.670 --> 10:04.471
DO.

10:04.471 --> 10:05.738
IT WAS ALMOST NO INTEREST IN

10:05.738 --> 10:06.439
DOING IT.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.207
THIS IS WHAT WAS REALLY

10:07.207 --> 10:08.942
REMARKABLE IS, THINK ABOUT IT

10:08.942 --> 10:09.943
FOR A SECOND.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.145
THIS IDEA OF BEEFING UP LOCAL

10:12.145 --> 10:13.980
POLICE DEPARTMENTS, TO FIGHT

10:13.980 --> 10:16.416
TERRORISM, IS KIND OF THE

10:16.416 --> 10:18.017
CORNERSTONE OF OUR DOMESTIC

10:18.017 --> 10:20.453
POST-9/11 RESPONSE.

10:20.453 --> 10:25.258
SO THE FACT THAT IT TOOK A DEATH

10:25.258 --> 10:27.560
OF A YOUNG AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN

10:27.560 --> 10:31.064
IN ST. LOUIS COUNTY TO FORCE

10:31.064 --> 10:33.533
UPON THE COUNTRY A HUGE

10:33.533 --> 10:36.202
RECONSIDERATION OF THE THINKING

10:36.202 --> 10:37.670
OF, THAT WE NEED TO HEAVILY ARM

10:37.670 --> 10:38.738
POLICE DEPARTMENTS TO FIGHT

10:38.738 --> 10:39.706
TERRORISM.

10:39.706 --> 10:41.040
IT'S JUST SORT OF REMARKABLE.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.276
BECAUSE UNTIL RECENTLY, THE ONLY

10:43.276 --> 10:45.912
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THESE TYPES OF

10:45.912 --> 10:47.947
PROGRAMS WERE, IS MY POLICE

10:47.947 --> 10:49.449
DEPARTMENT GETTING ENOUGH?

10:49.449 --> 10:50.683
HOW COME HE -- HOW COME THAT

10:50.683 --> 10:52.018
CITY GOT MORE THAN MY CITY?

10:52.018 --> 10:52.952
THOSE WERE THE DEBATES THAT WERE

10:52.952 --> 10:53.853
GOING ON IN WASHINGTON.

10:53.853 --> 10:55.121
NOBODY WAS SAYING, HEY DO WE

10:55.121 --> 10:57.357
REALLY NEED TO HAVE ARMORED

10:57.357 --> 10:58.625
TROOP TRANSPORTERS IN LOCAL

10:58.625 --> 10:59.559
POLICE DEPARTMENTS?

NOBODY WAS SAYING THAT UNTIL

11:00.927 --> 11:02.128

>> THE GERMAN ELECTORATE ARE

16:26.619 --> 16:29.055
PRETTY PHILOSOPHICAL RIGHT NOW,

16:29.055 --> 16:30.389
BUT ONLY IF THE SYSTEM IS

16:30.389 --> 16:31.524
WORKING.

16:31.524 --> 16:32.792
IF IT STARTS TO BUCKLE UNDER THE

16:32.792 --> 16:34.760
NUMBERS, GERMAN POLITICIAN HE

16:34.760 --> 16:36.028
ARE ACUTELY AWARE THAT THAT

16:36.028 --> 16:37.663
COULD CHANGE.

16:37.663 --> 16:41.167
IN THE MEANTIME, PREPARING FOR A

16:41.167 --> 16:43.002
THOUSAND NEW MIGRANTS.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.503
TONY SMITH USED TO BE IN CHARGE

16:44.503 --> 16:46.706
OF THE U.K.'S NEW BORDER AGENCY.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.642
HE'S NOW RETURNED FROM TURKEY.

16:49.642 --> 16:52.678
>> 1.7 IMMIGRANTS IN TURKEY.

16:52.678 --> 16:55.948
NOW IF YOU ARRIVE IN TURKEY FROM

16:55.948 --> 16:59.685
SYRIA, WILL BE IN 2023.

16:59.685 --> 17:00.653
YOU'RE LOOKING AT EIGHT YEARS OF

17:00.653 --> 17:02.188
LIMBO.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.189
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

17:03.189 --> 17:04.223
TRYING TO STOP ESTABLISH

17:04.223 --> 17:10.096
YOURSELF SOMEWHERE ELSE?

17:10.096 --> 17:11.464
>> WHICH IS WHAT THESE FAMILIES

17:11.464 --> 17:12.865
WERE DOING.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.635
IN AUSTRIA 86 PEOPLE INCLUDING

17:15.635 --> 17:17.837
16 CHILDREN FOUND IN THE BACK OF

17:17.837 --> 17:19.372
A VAN.

17:19.372 --> 17:24.610
HOLES CUT IN THE ROOF FOR AIR.

17:24.610 --> 17:25.645
CALAIS, PRO-MIGRANT

17:25.645 --> 17:27.413
DEMONSTRATION.

17:27.413 --> 17:28.814
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CALAIS

17:28.814 --> 17:30.316
AND HAMBURG LET'S SAY, THE

17:30.316 --> 17:33.052
MIGRANTS WANT TO GET OUT.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.288
THE ONE IN GERMANY BY AND LARGE

17:35.288 --> 17:37.556
WANT TO STAY.

17:47.099 --> 17:48.067
>> Sreenivasan: A HUGE SWATH OF

17:48.067 --> 17:49.869
WILDERNESS IN IDAHO WILL NOW BE

17:49.869 --> 17:51.637
PROTECTED FROM DEVELOPMENT, DUE

17:51.637 --> 17:52.939
TO LEGISLATION PASSED BY

17:52.939 --> 17:54.473
CONGRESS AND SIGNED BY PRESIDENT

17:54.473 --> 17:55.908
OBAMA ON FRIDAY.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.511
THE DESIGNATION FOR 275,000

17:58.511 --> 18:00.212
ACRES OF PUBLIC LAND IN THE

18:00.212 --> 18:02.515
BOULDER-WHITE CLOUDS MOUNTAINS

18:02.515 --> 18:04.750
ENDS A FOUR-DECADE PUSH BY

18:04.750 --> 18:06.352
ENVIRONMENTALISTS, RANCHERS, AND

18:06.352 --> 18:07.653
RECREATION GROUPS.

18:07.653 --> 18:08.955
IT ALSO MARKS A MOMENT OF

18:08.955 --> 18:10.656
BIPARTISAN COOPERATION BETWEEN A

18:10.656 --> 18:12.058
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL

18:12.058 --> 18:13.592
DELEGATION AND A DEMOCRATIC

18:13.592 --> 18:14.994
ADMINISTRATION.

18:14.994 --> 18:16.495
ROCKY BARKER OF "THE IDAHO

18:16.495 --> 18:18.130
STATESMAN" AND OUR COLLEAGUES AT

18:18.130 --> 18:19.832
IDAHO PUBLIC TELEVISION ALONG

18:19.832 --> 18:23.135
WITH EARTHFIX HAS THE STORY.

18:23.135 --> 18:24.036
>> Reporter: THE BOULDER-WHITE

18:24.036 --> 18:25.638
CLOUDS MOUNTAINS IN CENTRAL

18:25.638 --> 18:27.506
IDAHO ARE A SCENIC LANDSCAPE OF

18:27.506 --> 18:29.642
SOARING MOUNTAIN PEAKS, LUSH

18:29.642 --> 18:31.944
FORESTS, AND PRISTINE LAKES AND

18:31.944 --> 18:34.180
RIVERS.

18:34.180 --> 18:36.582
275,000 ACRES OF THIS PUBLIC

18:36.582 --> 18:38.117
LAND IS NOW A FEDERALLY-

18:38.117 --> 18:40.186
PROTECTED WILDERNESS AREA, WHICH

18:40.186 --> 18:41.687
MEANS IT WILL REMAIN OPEN TO

18:41.687 --> 18:43.556
RECREATION AND CLOSED TO

18:43.556 --> 18:48.427
DEVELOPMENT.

18:48.427 --> 18:49.729
WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED THE

18:49.729 --> 18:51.931
WILDERNESS BILL INTO LAW, IT WAS

18:51.931 --> 18:53.532
A PERSONAL VICTORY FOR IDAHO

18:53.532 --> 18:55.534
CONGRESSMAN MIKE SIMPSON, WHO

18:55.534 --> 18:58.237
BACKED THE IDEA FOR 15 YEARS.

18:58.237 --> 18:59.739
SIMPSON'S EFFORTS ACCELERATED

18:59.739 --> 19:01.607
EARLIER AFTER MEETING OBAMA

19:01.607 --> 19:04.343
ADVISER JOHN PODESTA LAST YEAR.

19:04.343 --> 19:05.945
>> I SAID, "LISTEN, I'D LIKE SIX

19:05.945 --> 19:07.546
MONTHS TO SEE IF WE COULD GET A

19:07.546 --> 19:09.281
BILL MOVING IN CONGRESS," AND HE

19:09.281 --> 19:10.783
SAID "GO FOR IT."

19:10.783 --> 19:11.817
>> Reporter: DECLARING THESE

19:11.817 --> 19:13.119
MOUNTAINS A NATIONAL MONUMENT

19:13.119 --> 19:14.820
WOULD HAVE PROTECTED THEM, BUT

19:14.820 --> 19:16.055
WOULD HAVE LEFT MANY DETAILS

19:16.055 --> 19:17.289
UNRESOLVED.

19:17.289 --> 19:18.824
AS A WILDERNESSES AREA, THE USES

19:18.824 --> 19:20.126
OF THE LAND ARE MORE STRICTLY

19:20.126 --> 19:21.761
DEFINED.

19:21.761 --> 19:22.661
THE BOULDER-WHITE CLOUDS

19:22.661 --> 19:24.363
MOUNTAINS HAVE HAD SOME FEDERAL

19:24.363 --> 19:27.066
PROTECTION SINCE 1972, WHEN

19:27.066 --> 19:28.901
THEN-GOVERNOR CECIL ANDRUS

19:28.901 --> 19:30.436
STOPPED A MOLYBDENUM MINE FROM

19:30.436 --> 19:31.404
BEING BUILT AT THE BASE OF

19:31.404 --> 19:33.139
CASTLE PEAK MOUNTAIN.

19:33.139 --> 19:35.307
ANDRUS, WHO ALSO SERVED AS

19:35.307 --> 19:36.742
INTERIOR SECRETARY UNDER

19:36.742 --> 19:38.344
PRESIDENT CARTER, INITIALLY

19:38.344 --> 19:40.880
URGED PRESIDENT OBAMA TO USE HIS

19:40.880 --> 19:42.615
EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY TO PROTECT

19:42.615 --> 19:44.417
THE BOULDER WHITE CLOUDS BY

19:44.417 --> 19:45.418
DECLARING THEM A NATIONAL

19:45.418 --> 19:46.952
MONUMENT.

19:46.952 --> 19:48.421
CRAIG GEHRKE IS THE IDAHO

19:48.421 --> 19:49.855
DIRECTOR OF THE WILDERNESS

19:49.855 --> 19:51.023
SOCIETY.

19:51.023 --> 19:51.924
>> THERE WAS STILL A BIG

19:51.924 --> 19:53.359
QUESTION IN OUR MIND WHETHER OR

19:53.359 --> 19:54.660
NOT A CONGRESS COULD REALLY DO

19:54.660 --> 19:55.795
ANYTHING ANYMORE.

19:55.795 --> 19:56.595
SO WE CONTINUED WITH OUR

19:56.595 --> 19:58.130
MONUMENT EFFORT,

19:58.130 --> 19:58.931
>> Reporter: BUT CONGRESSMAN

19:58.931 --> 20:00.232
SIMPSON DECIDED TO MAKE ANOTHER

20:00.232 --> 20:01.934
RUN AT DECLARING THE MOUNTAINS A

20:01.934 --> 20:03.836
WILDERNESS AREA AND GOT HIS BILL

20:03.836 --> 20:05.805
THROUGH THE HOUSE IN JULY.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.240
IDAHO SENATOR JAMES RISCH, WHO

20:08.240 --> 20:09.975
PREVIOUSLY OPPOSED THE BILL,

20:09.975 --> 20:11.811
AGREED TO SPONSOR THE SENATE

20:11.811 --> 20:12.778
VERSION.

20:12.778 --> 20:13.779
>> WHAT CONGRESSMAN SIMPSON WAS

20:13.779 --> 20:14.947
ABLE TO DO IS TO GET EVERYBODY

20:14.947 --> 20:15.915
TO THE TABLE.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.650
HE GOT THE WILDERNESS

20:17.650 --> 20:19.452
PRESERVATIONISTS, THE HIKERS,

20:19.452 --> 20:21.253
THE BACKPACKERS, THE HORSE

20:21.253 --> 20:23.189
PEOPLE, THE MOTORIZED USERS,

20:23.189 --> 20:24.824
INCLUDING BOTH SNOWMOBILES AND

20:24.824 --> 20:27.460
ATV AND MOTORCYCLE PEOPLE TO ALL

20:27.460 --> 20:30.996
AGREE AS TO A MANAGEMENT PLAN

20:30.996 --> 20:32.131
>> Reporter: IDAHO CONSERVATION

20:32.131 --> 20:34.100
LEAGUE DIRECTOR RICK JOHNSON

20:34.100 --> 20:35.734
TOLD A SENATE COMMITTEE HEARING

20:35.734 --> 20:37.169
WHY THE LANDSCAPE NEEDED

20:37.169 --> 20:38.404
PROTECTING.

20:38.404 --> 20:39.705
>> THESE MOUNTAIN RANGES CONTAIN

20:39.705 --> 20:41.240
THE HEADWATERS OF FOUR MAJOR

20:41.240 --> 20:42.942
RIVERS AND ARE HOME TO SOME OF

20:42.942 --> 20:44.543
THE HIGHEST ELEVATION SALMON

20:44.543 --> 20:46.445
HABITAT ON EARTH.

20:46.445 --> 20:47.813
THIS IS A LANDSCAPE OF SUMMER

20:47.813 --> 20:49.548
AND WINTER RANGE FOR BIG GAME

20:49.548 --> 20:51.283
AND CRITICAL HABITAT FOR

20:51.283 --> 20:52.818
ENDANGERED AND ELUSIVE SPECIES

20:52.818 --> 20:54.220
LIKE WOLVERINE.

20:54.220 --> 20:55.421
IT IS ALSO AN UNPARALLELED

20:55.421 --> 20:57.223
RESOURCE FOR MANY DIFFERENT

20:57.223 --> 20:59.892
RECREATIONAL PURSUITS.

20:59.892 --> 21:00.893
>> Reporter: SANDRA MITCHELL,

21:00.893 --> 21:02.194
WHO REPRESENTS SNOWMOBILERS AND

21:02.194 --> 21:03.829
MOTORCYCLISTS, FAVORED THE

21:03.829 --> 21:05.664
CREATION OF A WILDERNESS AREA

21:05.664 --> 21:07.433
BECAUSE THE DESIGNATION CLEARLY

21:07.433 --> 21:09.034
SPELLS OUT HOW THE MOUNTAIN

21:09.034 --> 21:12.204
TRAILS AROUND IT CAN BE USED.

21:12.204 --> 21:13.606
>> THE CHOICE WAS THE NATIONAL

21:13.606 --> 21:15.508
MONUMENT OR THE WILDERNESS AND

21:15.508 --> 21:16.308
WE CAME DOWN ON THE

21:16.308 --> 21:17.977
WILDERNESS BILL IS THE BEST, AND

21:17.977 --> 21:19.979
THEN WE PUT 100% OF OUR SUPPORT

21:19.979 --> 21:21.514
BEHIND IT AND DID EVERYTHING WE

21:21.514 --> 21:23.048
COULD TO PASS IT.

21:23.048 --> 21:23.816
>> Reporter: THE CREATION OF

21:23.816 --> 21:25.117
THIS NEW WILDERNESS AREA IS A

21:25.117 --> 21:26.619
BIG LAW FOR A SMALL WESTERN

21:26.619 --> 21:28.721
STATE THAT ALSO SHOWS EVEN IN

21:28.721 --> 21:30.556
THESE POLITICALLY CHARGED TIMES,

21:30.556 --> 21:32.625
CONGRESS CAN SOMETIMES WORK

21:32.625 --> 21:35.528
QUICKLY TO GET SOMETHING DONE.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.604
>> Sreenivasan: FINALLY, KIM

21:48.674 --> 21:49.942

21:49.942 --> 21:52.578
GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE.

21:52.578 --> 21:56.348
IT TOOK THE WOMAN 17 HOURS AND

21:56.348 --> 21:58.517
12 MINUTES TO NAVIGATE THE SHARK

22:16.268 --> 22:17.536

22:19.772 --> 22:20.873
AT HIS HOME IN CONNECTICUT, HE
