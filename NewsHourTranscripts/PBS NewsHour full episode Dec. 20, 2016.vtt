JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.439 --> 00:06.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
after the attack.

00:09.810 --> 00:13.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We report from Berlin as a
manhunt continues.

00:13.113 --> 00:17.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Then: one
outcome of the
election, a rise of women
seeking long-term

00:17.618 --> 00:22.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contraceptive care, fearing
restrictions on
birth control coverage in the
new political

00:22.956 --> 00:24.258 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
climate.

00:24.291 --> 00:27.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus: part two of
our Bruce
Springsteen profile.

00:27.194 --> 00:30.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The rock legend opens up about
depression
and the joy of performing.

00:30.931 --> 00:36.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, Musician: I
walk on stage,
I play, I perform, I create, I
write.

00:36.603 --> 00:38.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's where sort of that
peace comes
over me.

00:38.672 --> 00:45.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:45.746 --> 00:48.448 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:48.482 --> 00:57.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Islamic State
group has
claimed responsibility tonight
for the Berlin

00:57.824 --> 01:01.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
truck attack that killed a dozen
people and
injured 50.

01:02.029 --> 01:07.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That word came hours after
German police let
their main suspect go.

01:07.167 --> 01:10.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant reports
from Berlin.

01:10.237 --> 01:16.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This normally
bustling Christmas
market was eerily quiet today,
as investigators

01:16.276 --> 01:18.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
searched for clues.

01:18.145 --> 01:22.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Swathed in fog, and with armed
guards sealing
off the area, Berlin was coming
to terms with

01:22.649 --> 01:28.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
its new status as a victim of
terrorism, after
Paris, Brussels and Nice.

01:28.322 --> 01:30.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
German Chancellor Angela Merkel
spoke at a
morning news conference.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA MERKEL, German Chancellor
(through
translator): There is still a
lot that we

01:33.927 --> 01:39.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't know about this act with
sufficient
certainty, but we must, as
things stand, assume

01:39.166 --> 01:40.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it was a terrorist attack.

01:40.968 --> 01:45.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Police detained
a Pakistani
asylum-seeker shortly after the
truck rammed

01:45.505 --> 01:47.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into a crowd of people on
Monday.

01:47.274 --> 01:52.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, today, he was released, due
to insufficient
evidence.

01:52.145 --> 01:55.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prosecutors said he matched a
description
of the suspected attacker, but
he denied any

01:55.248 --> 01:56.984 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
involvement.

01:57.017 --> 02:02.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The truck, which had been
carrying steel beams,
was towed away earlier this
morning.

02:02.556 --> 02:06.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The body of a Polish truck
driver was found
inside the cabin.

02:06.126 --> 02:09.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He had been stabbed and shot
after being hijacked.

02:09.162 --> 02:10.964 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The gun used to kill him has yet
to be found.

02:10.998 --> 02:11.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PETER NEUMANN, Director,
International Center
for the Study of Radicalization,
King's College:

02:12.032 --> 02:13.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was waiting to happen, no?

02:13.967 --> 02:15.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm not, like, totally
surprised.

02:16.003 --> 02:19.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Berlin is the
hometown of
terrorism expert Peter Neumann.

02:19.639 --> 02:24.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He believes German authorities
were too complacent
about the possibility of an
attack and didn't

02:24.978 --> 02:27.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
offer sufficient protection to
the Christmas
markets.

02:27.681 --> 02:32.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER NEUMANN: I think, in
Germany, people
have been very blessed with the
idea that

02:32.686 --> 02:35.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they would be spared this kind
of attack.

02:35.389 --> 02:39.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I don't think that German
authorities
were thinking as systematically
about the

02:39.559 --> 02:44.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
threat from terrorism as
authorities in Britain
have or authorities in other
countries.

02:44.464 --> 02:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This will have to change.

02:46.266 --> 02:51.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there will be a very
uncomfortable discussion
in Germany about anti-terrorism
measures,

02:51.238 --> 02:56.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but also, of course, about the
relationship
with Muslim communities and with
refugees.

02:56.643 --> 03:01.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The chancellor
and other
senior officials laid white
roses at a makeshift

03:01.348 --> 03:03.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
memorial to the victims.

03:03.383 --> 03:07.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They toured the market and were
briefed by
senior police officers.

03:07.254 --> 03:12.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ordinary Berliners paid their
respects, laying
candles, flowers and messages of
sympathy.

03:12.559 --> 03:17.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many said they believe this
attack marked
a turning point for Germany,
especially as,

03:17.197 --> 03:21.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for most of the past 24 hours,
they were under
the impression that the massacre
had been

03:21.601 --> 03:27.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
perpetrated by an asylum-seeker
admitted under
Chancellor Merkel's open-door
refugee policy.

03:27.707 --> 03:33.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I definitely want to see
stricter border
control in Germany and in the
European Union.

03:33.580 --> 03:39.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think I want to see more
cooperation between
the countries of the European
Union and regarding

03:39.853 --> 03:42.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
refugee policy, because, at the
moment, it's
out of control.

03:42.689 --> 03:50.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I think it's not yet today
the time to
think about the consequences for
the refugee

03:50.363 --> 03:52.199 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
politics.

03:52.232 --> 04:01.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think today it's a question of
sadness and
come here, see people come
together, and bring

04:01.975 --> 04:02.943 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
flowers.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's most important.

04:04.111 --> 04:08.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think we have a good
system of asylum-seekers.

04:08.448 --> 04:12.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Chancellor
Merkel warned
against letting the attack
change Germans'

04:12.686 --> 04:16.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
way of life, but she
acknowledged her policies
were under new pressure.

04:16.923 --> 04:21.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANGELA MERKEL (through
translator): I know
that it would be particularly
hard for us

04:21.261 --> 04:25.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all to bear it if it were to be
confirmed
that a person committed this
crime who sought

04:25.866 --> 04:28.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
protection and asylum in
Germany.

04:28.502 --> 04:33.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This would be particularly
sickening for the
many, many Germans who work to
help refugees

04:33.039 --> 04:37.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every day and for the many
people who really
need our help and are making an
effort to

04:37.777 --> 04:39.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
integrate in our country.

04:39.679 --> 04:43.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: At the Berlin
State Parliament,
where flags were lowered to
half-mast, the

04:43.817 --> 04:49.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anti-immigrant Alternative for
Germany Party
and its regional deputy leader,
Ronald Glaser,

04:49.356 --> 04:51.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
offered a harsher appraisal.

04:51.191 --> 04:52.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RONALD GLASER, Alternative for
Germany Party:
First of all, the terrorist is
to blame for

04:52.826 --> 04:54.628 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what happened.

04:54.661 --> 05:01.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, Angela Merkel
and her welcome
culture made all these refugees
come to our

05:01.101 --> 05:02.235 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

05:02.269 --> 05:04.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And among them were a lot of
fanatics and
criminals.

05:04.571 --> 05:10.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's not going to accept that
her policy
was wrong, but, of course, the
German people

05:10.277 --> 05:14.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is awakening and they maybe will
force her
to do so.

05:14.548 --> 05:18.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Just outside
the regional
parliament is the largest
remaining section

05:18.418 --> 05:23.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Berlin Wall, whose demise
27 years
ago led to Europe's open
borders.

05:23.256 --> 05:28.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There could not be a more
poignant reminder
of what's at stake as Europe
grapples with

05:28.261 --> 05:31.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terrorism and the wave of
migration across
the Mediterranean.

05:31.531 --> 05:35.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the meantime, the German
capital remains
on high alert.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KLAUS KANDT, Berlin Police Chief
(through
translator): Of course people
are worried.

05:37.871 --> 05:40.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I believe people who live in the
city should
be vigilant.

05:40.373 --> 05:44.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Security has
also been tightened
at Christmas markets and other
outdoor venues

05:44.811 --> 05:48.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all across Europe, out of an
abundance of
caution.

05:48.648 --> 05:52.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in Berlin this evening,
mourners gathered
for a candlelight vigil in the
same square

05:53.019 --> 05:58.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where the tragedy took place, as
Germany's
leaders attended a solemn
memorial service

05:58.425 --> 06:00.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at a nearby church.

06:00.293 --> 06:05.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The iconic Brandenburg Gate was
illuminated
with the images of both the
German and Berlin

06:05.699 --> 06:06.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
flags.

06:06.833 --> 06:10.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Malcolm joins
me now from
Berlin.

06:10.270 --> 06:16.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Malcolm, now that ISIS has
claimed responsibility,
how is that affecting thinking
there?

06:16.610 --> 06:22.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: It's not really
made that
much of an impact, to be honest.

06:22.048 --> 06:27.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The German interior minister
acknowledged
that ISIS had made this claim,
but he didn't

06:27.153 --> 06:28.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
really react to it.

06:28.488 --> 06:30.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't think anybody is
particularly surprised.

06:30.624 --> 06:34.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This attack was right out of the
jihadist
playbook.

06:34.427 --> 06:37.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the sort of language in the
claim that
they have made that they have
used before.

06:38.031 --> 06:45.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what, I think, ISIS has
achieved by saying
what they have done is that they
have perhaps

06:45.538 --> 06:47.440 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
helped to polarize Germany.

06:47.474 --> 06:54.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have helped to perhaps
drive people into
the arms of the Alternative for
Germany Party,

06:54.681 --> 06:56.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the right-wing anti-immigrant
party.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they're going to create
hatred.

06:58.685 --> 07:01.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's really what their
main objective
is.

07:01.321 --> 07:05.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, the
perpetrator is still
on the loose.

07:05.925 --> 07:09.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is there fear that he or she may
strike again?

07:09.796 --> 07:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: That certainly
is the worry.

07:13.266 --> 07:16.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And people are being advised to
stay indoors.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The police are very much
concerned.

07:18.672 --> 07:22.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The interior minister did say
that they do
have some leads and that the
police are following

07:22.776 --> 07:24.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
up on those leads.

07:24.611 --> 07:30.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they thought that they
actually had their
man in their sights, because the
person they

07:30.083 --> 07:37.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
described as a brave witness to
the attacks
said that he followed the person
that he thought

07:37.557 --> 07:39.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was the truck driver.

07:39.359 --> 07:43.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had driven through the
Christmas market,
and was in touch with police all
the time.

07:43.897 --> 07:48.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it now appears that he may
have actually
lost sight of the target during
that particular

07:48.568 --> 07:51.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time, which is perhaps why the
wrong man was
arrested.

07:51.938 --> 07:55.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are certainly fears
that there will
be attacks again, and there are
armed police

07:56.009 --> 07:58.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at other Christmas markets
around there.

07:58.645 --> 08:04.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One pretty good indication of
just how tense
things are, there was a federal
prosecutor

08:04.818 --> 08:08.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who was giving a press
conference in Germany
earlier today, and he said that
he certainly

08:08.822 --> 08:13.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wouldn't go to any Christmas
markets, which
is hardly an endorsement of the
state of security

08:13.660 --> 08:14.627 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

08:14.661 --> 08:15.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: No, it isn't.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

after a memorial ceremony.

08:32.212 --> 08:36.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey's deputy prime minister
insisted the
killing won't damage relations
with Russia.

08:36.883 --> 08:41.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TUGRUL TURKES, Turkish Deputy
Prime Minister
(through translator): Those who
ordered and

08:41.321 --> 08:45.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
carried out this attack didn't
kill Ambassador
Andrey Karlov.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They created a new place for him
in history.

08:47.394 --> 08:52.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ambassador Andrey Karlov has
become an eternal
symbol for Turkish-Russian
friendship.

08:52.265 --> 08:54.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The gunman was
a police
officer.

08:54.501 --> 08:59.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He shouted slogans about Aleppo
in Syria and
about jihad before being killed
by security

08:59.606 --> 09:00.573 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forces.

09:00.607 --> 09:02.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So far, there's been no claim of
responsibility.

09:02.442 --> 09:07.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Syria, buses
evacuated more
people from East Aleppo, as the
Syrian army

09:07.247 --> 09:11.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
warned that it's about to enter
the last rebel
enclave.

09:11.151 --> 09:17.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Estimates of how many people
have left the
city varied from 19,000 to more
than 37,000.

09:17.090 --> 09:20.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But rebels said thousands are
still waiting
for transport.

09:20.560 --> 09:26.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, in Moscow, Russia,

broker a final

09:26.299 --> 09:30.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syrian peace, leaving President

in power.

09:30.804 --> 09:35.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SERGEI LAVROV, Russian Foreign
Minister (through
translator): Our main priority
shouldn't be

09:35.275 --> 09:38.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the regime change, but defeating
terrorist
threats.

09:38.244 --> 09:42.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am sure that we will be able
to formulate
our common approaches, based on
the goals

09:42.515 --> 09:48.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have declared, to win over
terrorism, to
restore territorial integrity,
sovereignty,

09:48.254 --> 09:51.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
independence and unity of the
Syrian Arab
republic.

09:51.291 --> 09:52.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We are united in that.

09:53.026 --> 09:57.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The talks were
held without
the U.S. or the U.N. being
represented.

09:57.497 --> 10:01.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Security

today and

10:01.267 --> 10:02.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
arrested dozens more.

10:02.769 --> 10:06.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were opposing President
Joseph Kabila's
decision to stay in office.

10:06.372 --> 10:10.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His term ended overnight, but
new elections
have been delayed indefinitely.

10:10.543 --> 10:15.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police and troops used live fire
and tear
gas against protesters who took
to the streets

10:15.148 --> 10:16.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the capital city, Kinshasa.

10:16.916 --> 10:20.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

in the South China Sea.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was handed back to the U.S.
Navy today.

10:30.230 --> 10:34.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Pentagon called it an
illegal seizure
in international waters.

10:34.200 --> 10:37.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Beijing blamed U.S. surveillance
in waters
facing China.

10:37.670 --> 10:41.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Back in this
country, president-elect
Trump interviewed more job
candidates and

10:41.674 --> 10:44.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
took time to confront former
President Clinton.

10:44.477 --> 10:48.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A suburban New York City
newspaper had quoted
Mr. Clinton as saying the
incoming president

10:48.815 --> 10:52.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- quote -- "doesn't know much
besides how
to get angry white men to vote."

10:52.886 --> 10:57.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump tweeted back that
President Clinton
didn't even know how to turn out
voters and

10:57.857 --> 10:59.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- quote -- "focused on the
wrong states."

10:59.893 --> 11:01.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: First lady
Michelle Obama says
watching the election was --
quote -- "painful,"

11:01.194 --> 11:02.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but that she and the president
are supporting
the transition.

11:02.595 --> 11:03.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She spoke to Oprah Winfrey in
her final interview
as first lady.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was broadcast Monday on CBS.

11:05.198 --> 11:05.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE OBAMA, First Lady: It
is important
for the health of this nation
that we support

11:05.765 --> 11:07.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the commander in chief.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It wasn't done when my husband
took office,
but we're going high.

11:08.034 --> 11:09.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this is what's best for the
country.

11:09.769 --> 11:10.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Obama family
officially
moves out of the White House one
month from

11:10.069 --> 11:11.871 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Senate
majority leader
has again rejected calls for a
select committee

11:13.106 --> 11:14.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to investigate Russian
interference in the
election.

11:14.874 --> 11:15.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mitch McConnell says he still
believes the
standing Intelligence Committee
can do the

11:15.141 --> 11:16.776 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
job.

11:16.809 --> 11:18.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Several Republicans and
Democrats have called
for a special panel to be
created.

11:18.645 --> 11:19.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Volkswagen
reached a settlement
today with regulators and owners
of another

11:19.746 --> 11:22.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
80,000 vehicles in its
emissions-cheating
scandal.

11:22.949 --> 11:27.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Under the terms, V.W. agrees to
buy back some
vehicles and fix others.

11:27.420 --> 11:33.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The company previously reached a
deal affecting
475,000 other cars, but it could
still face

11:33.693 --> 11:35.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
criminal charges.

11:35.595 --> 11:38.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The state of
Michigan has
filed more criminal charges in
the investigation

11:38.298 --> 11:40.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of lead-tainted water in Flint.

11:40.133 --> 11:44.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two former emergency managers of
the city
and two other former city
workers were charged

11:44.537 --> 11:47.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today with conspiracy and other
crimes.

11:47.140 --> 11:51.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State Attorney General Bill
Schuette said
the investigation isn't over,
and he vowed

11:51.044 --> 11:52.845 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to get justice.

11:52.879 --> 11:57.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL SCHUETTE (R), Michigan
Attorney General:
Flint was a casualty of
arrogance, disdain

11:57.684 --> 12:07.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a failure of management, an
absence of
accountability, shirking
responsibility.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Flint deserves better.

12:09.963 --> 12:12.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The people of Flint are not
expendable.

12:12.632 --> 12:14.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, to move on is unacceptable.

12:14.767 --> 12:18.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All told, 13
people have
been charged in the ongoing
investigation.

12:18.972 --> 12:23.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
today banned
future oil and gas drilling in
most federal

12:23.743 --> 12:26.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
waters of the Atlantic and
Arctic oceans.

12:26.646 --> 12:29.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's one of his last major
environmental moves.

12:29.749 --> 12:33.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President-elect Trump has called
for more
offshore drilling, but it's not
clear if he

12:33.786 --> 12:36.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can reverse today's action
without going to
court.

12:36.623 --> 12:40.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: On Wall
Street, the rally
resumed as bank stocks surged.

The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 91
points to close at 19974.

The Nasdaq rose 26 points, and

12:49.902 --> 12:54.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

12:54.641 --> 13:00.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They include the late rapper

unsolved, the Seattle

grunge rock
in the '90s, and Joan Baez,
political activist

13:07.553 --> 13:09.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and mainstay of the folk
movement.

13:09.689 --> 13:11.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The formal induction is next
April.

13:11.557 --> 13:15.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Still to come
on the "NewsHour":
we speak with Donald Trump
senior adviser

13:15.461 --> 13:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kellyanne Conway; President
Obama's final
push to transfer Guantanamo Bay
prisoners;

13:21.034 --> 13:28.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
women scramble for
contraceptives as access
hangs in the balance; and much
more.

13:28.841 --> 13:38.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we turn now
to the Trump
transition.

13:38.184 --> 13:42.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kellyanne Conway is senior
adviser to the
president-elect.

13:42.722 --> 13:45.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kellyanne Kellyanne Conway,
thank you for
talking with us.

13:45.091 --> 13:50.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump has now been certified
the winner
by the Electoral College, but,
as you know,

13:50.263 --> 13:55.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are still questions out
there about
the Russian government's role
and whether

13:55.168 --> 14:00.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it influenced the outcome of
this election
in favor of Mr. Trump.

14:00.473 --> 14:05.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My question to you is, since we
now have this
joint -- or what appears to be
agreement by

14:05.712 --> 14:10.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the intelligence community that
the Russian
government was involved and they
were trying

14:10.149 --> 14:15.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to help Mr. Trump, is he going
to ask for
this information that they have,
so he can

14:15.922 --> 14:17.690 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
satisfy himself?

14:17.724 --> 14:20.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY, Trump Senior
Adviser: Well,
I don't really agree with that
premise in

14:20.259 --> 14:26.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
full, Judy, only because we have
leaks to
the media, rather than CIA
officials showing

14:26.566 --> 14:29.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
up at closed-door House
Intelligence Committee
briefings, where they were
invited.

14:29.936 --> 14:33.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And instead of doing that, they
went and talked
to the media.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have not seen a report.

14:34.741 --> 14:38.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have not seen the evidence
that they were
trying the influence the
election.

14:38.478 --> 14:41.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what everybody is doing
to confuse
and conflate here.

14:41.147 --> 14:46.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, I would just point out
very logically
that I don't remember the
Clinton team in

14:46.719 --> 14:51.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those last days before the
election having
Jay-Z or Beyonce or President
Obama or President

14:51.457 --> 14:55.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bill Clinton out there saying,
look, we want
to warn you all that there is a
chance Hillary

14:55.828 --> 14:59.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton is actually going to
lose because
of Russian hacking and they're
trying to influence

14:59.499 --> 15:00.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the election.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is just not true.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They weren't saying that.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were pretty confident it
was going to
be a blowout and that they were
going to take

15:05.271 --> 15:07.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the House and Senate with them.

15:07.039 --> 15:11.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So I understand the
hand-wringing and the
breast-beating continues on the
left, but

15:11.244 --> 15:12.945 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
let's be fair.

15:12.979 --> 15:15.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're not going to interfere
with anything
the legislature wants to do,
certainly.

15:15.581 --> 15:18.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, secondly, let's be clear as
to what this
really is.

15:18.484 --> 15:20.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's pure politics.

15:20.319 --> 15:23.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you even have the president
of the United
States, President Obama, in his
final press

15:23.256 --> 15:28.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conference last Friday, Judy,
not going as
far as saying he believes that
the Russians

15:28.394 --> 15:30.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hacked in and tried to interfere
with the
elections.

15:30.830 --> 15:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, he said when he told
Putin to -- quote
-- "cut it out," that Putin did.

15:33.699 --> 15:38.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, my
question, though,
is, since Mr. Trump has access
now to pretty

15:39.005 --> 15:44.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much any intelligence he wants,
can he simply
just get this information and
satisfy himself

15:44.677 --> 15:46.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
once and for all whether it's
true?

15:46.412 --> 15:47.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Perhaps.

15:47.513 --> 15:49.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And perhaps he has.

15:49.282 --> 15:53.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, again, everybody wants to
will litigate
this in the media.

15:53.152 --> 15:54.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's the president-elect of
the United
States.

15:54.987 --> 15:57.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Barack Obama is the president of
the United
States until January 20.

15:57.990 --> 15:59.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we're respectful of that.

15:59.692 --> 16:03.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we all must be respectful of
the fact
that those two gentlemen and
others are going

16:03.462 --> 16:06.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to have information that the
rest of us don't.

16:06.232 --> 16:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that's not what this is
about.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is about -- some of them
think it's Jim
Comey's fault.

16:09.902 --> 16:11.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The others blame the movement.

16:11.604 --> 16:14.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The others blame Bernie Sanders:
How dare
he run in the first place?

16:14.707 --> 16:18.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The guy won 22 states and over
13 million
voters, and, of course, Russian
hacking.

16:18.244 --> 16:22.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me ask
you -- let
me turn you to what Mr. Trump
tweeted yesterday

16:22.081 --> 16:23.816 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
after the incidents in Europe.

16:23.850 --> 16:28.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among other things, he said --
he referred
to terror attacks in Turkey,
Switzerland,

16:28.487 --> 16:29.622 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Germany.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He issued statements about
Islamist terrorists.

16:32.558 --> 16:36.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we now know German and
Turkish officials
say they don't have all the
information.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't know the genesis of
what happened.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we know what happened in
Switzerland.

16:41.367 --> 16:46.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're saying this is someone
who was obsessed
with the occult, had killed a
friend of his

16:46.272 --> 16:48.074 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
before he committed suicide.

16:48.107 --> 16:53.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, my question is, should Mr.
Trump have
waited for more information
before he tweeted

16:53.045 --> 16:54.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and made a statement?

16:54.814 --> 16:58.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: What the
president-elect
knows is that people across this
country and

16:58.384 --> 17:02.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
indeed world are afraid of
terrorism, and
they have a reason to.

17:02.288 --> 17:06.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most predominantly, in the last
couple years,
Judy, it has been radical
Islamic terrorism

17:06.125 --> 17:11.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- terrorists who have done
their massacre,
certainly in Europe and, of
course, the United

17:11.597 --> 17:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
States, in Orlando and in San
Bernardino.

17:14.433 --> 17:20.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the fact is that he will
continue to denounce
these acts of terror.

17:20.206 --> 17:23.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He will continue to send
condolences to the
families of those who have lost.

17:23.342 --> 17:25.044 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

17:25.077 --> 17:28.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But my question
is, should
he be making public statements
before the

17:28.481 --> 17:30.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
information is in?

17:30.216 --> 17:34.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Does he not have a
responsibility to wait
until the authorities have
looked into it?

17:34.487 --> 17:36.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Well, he's
very responsible.

17:36.289 --> 17:40.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would point out I remember
-- I believe
it was during Orlando or San
Bernardino -- we

17:40.626 --> 17:45.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will have to look -- but he
blamed radical
Islamic terrorism then, and
people attacked

17:45.164 --> 17:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him for doing that before he had
all the information.

17:47.833 --> 17:49.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Of course, he was correct.

17:49.402 --> 17:54.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I don't remember people
apologizing or saying,
gee, you're even ahead of it.

17:54.206 --> 17:55.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You're always ahead of it.

17:55.207 --> 17:57.009 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Your instincts are right.

17:57.043 --> 18:03.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the fact remains that this
president-elect
and this future commander in
chief is much

18:03.282 --> 18:10.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more serious about stopping and
eradicating,
as he says, radical terrorists
of all strains.

18:10.323 --> 18:13.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we know that ISIS is really
on the advance.

18:13.793 --> 18:17.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that it's just false
when people call
them the J.V. team and that
they're not on

18:17.096 --> 18:18.064 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the advance.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.065 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And we will see.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will see what the authorities
end up saying.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it doesn't change the fact
that, because
we're not as serious about
terrorism as we

18:23.669 --> 18:28.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can be, that people all across
the globe feel
like they can just murder
innocent people.

18:28.107 --> 18:31.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask you
about something
that President Obama said in his
news conference

18:31.577 --> 18:33.346 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on Friday.

18:33.379 --> 18:37.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said: "By so many measures,
our country
is stronger and more prosperous
than it was

18:37.116 --> 18:38.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
when we started."

18:38.484 --> 18:41.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said: "It's a situation I'm
proud to leave
for my successor.

18:41.721 --> 18:45.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's thanks to the American
people, to the
work you have put in, the
sacrifices you have

18:45.758 --> 18:47.560 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
made."

18:47.593 --> 18:52.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does Mr. Trump believe what Mr.
Obama said,
that the country is stronger and
more prosperous

18:52.431 --> 18:55.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as a result or at the end of the
Obama presidency?

18:55.568 --> 18:58.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Well, by some
measures,
we are.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if you look at the polls,
Americans don't
feel that way.

19:00.406 --> 19:03.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they felt that way, they
would have given
Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama
a third term.

19:03.909 --> 19:10.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He himself campaigned mightily
across the
country for her, basically
making that case.

19:10.216 --> 19:14.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said to people, I will take
it personally,
this is my legacy on the line.

19:14.220 --> 19:15.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And people rejected that call.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think people feel like there
is a little
bit of unfinished business,
Judy.

19:18.624 --> 19:21.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is no question that you
have millions
of Americans still lacking
health insurance.

19:21.994 --> 19:25.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have millions of Americans,
particularly
women and children, in poverty
as you and

19:25.998 --> 19:27.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I speak tonight.

19:27.933 --> 19:32.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have a lot of unfinished
business, but
obviously every president who
leaves, particularly

19:32.405 --> 19:36.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after two terms, can point to
many different
areas where there has been
progress and there

19:36.175 --> 19:37.943 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has been change.

19:37.977 --> 19:40.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would expect President
Obama to do what
President George W. Bush did
when he left,

19:40.679 --> 19:44.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and President Bill Clinton when
he left, which
is to point to those numbers of
improvement.

19:44.650 --> 19:47.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me finally
ask you about
what President Obama did today.

19:47.853 --> 19:52.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He announced a ban on new oil
and gas drilling
on the Atlantic Coast from New
England to

19:52.925 --> 19:54.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Chesapeake Bay.

19:54.226 --> 19:56.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Canada announced something in
conjunction
with this.

19:56.529 --> 20:00.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this something that Mr. Trump
is going
to let stand?

20:00.099 --> 20:03.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Well, I would
need to discuss
that with him, and he will make
those decisions

20:03.736 --> 20:05.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as the president.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I will remind us all what
his policy towards
energy is.

20:07.306 --> 20:09.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's basically -- and everybody
can read it
for themselves.

20:09.575 --> 20:14.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As part of his 100-day plan,
Judy, president-elect
Trump has made very clear that
unleashing

20:14.346 --> 20:19.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our energy sources here at home
is an incredibly
important aspect of that.

20:19.351 --> 20:20.820 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

20:20.853 --> 20:25.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because we need to invest in all
energy sources,
including coal and shale.

20:25.691 --> 20:28.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have energy literally off our
shores and
under our feet.

20:28.394 --> 20:31.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it sounds
like he's going
to reverse it, from what you're
saying.

20:31.363 --> 20:33.199 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

20:33.232 --> 20:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Well, it makes
us more -- well,
you're asking me about a
specific policy move,

20:34.266 --> 20:35.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and I can't comment on that.

20:35.501 --> 20:37.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It would be unfair to the
president-elect.

20:37.336 --> 20:41.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I will tell you, if you look
at his plan,
he's going to go farther than
other presidents

20:41.173 --> 20:47.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have gone in terms of making us
more dependent
on ourselves energy-wise, and to
create billions

20:47.379 --> 20:51.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of dollars in revenue, millions
of jobs, some
people project, over time.

20:51.917 --> 20:56.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it also means that we're
less dependent
on some of these foreign powers
for our energy

20:56.922 --> 20:59.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sources, which I know many
Americans would
appreciate.

20:59.692 --> 21:04.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's a major concern that
people, major
grievance Americans lodge, Judy?

21:04.196 --> 21:05.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's, we don't make anything in
America anymore.

21:05.831 --> 21:06.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Well, you know what?

21:06.832 --> 21:08.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Energy is in America.

21:08.868 --> 21:14.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if we can tap into that
safely and appropriately,
I guarantee that is something
that President

21:14.340 --> 21:18.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump will certainly look into
in a very serious
way.

21:18.644 --> 21:22.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kellyanne Conway,
adviser to
the president-elect, we thank
you.

21:22.248 --> 21:23.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Thank you,
Judy.

21:23.782 --> 21:28.120 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
All the best.

21:28.154 --> 21:38.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And in other
White House
news, according to a New York
Times report,

21:38.931 --> 21:44.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Obama administration has
notified Congress
it plans to transfer 17 or 18
prisoners from

21:44.937 --> 21:50.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the detention center at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
before president-elect Trump
takes office.

21:50.276 --> 21:54.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In all, the military prison has
housed nearly
780 detainees.

21:54.747 --> 21:58.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That number was down to 242 by
time President
Obama took office.

21:58.551 --> 22:04.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, there are 59 remaining,
including 22
who have been approved for
transfer to other

22:04.857 --> 22:05.991 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
countries.

22:06.025 --> 22:09.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's if certain security
conditions were
met there.

22:09.261 --> 22:14.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After this latest batch of
transfers, 41 or
42 prisoners would be left at
Guantanamo Bay

22:14.600 --> 22:17.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for Mr. Trump's administration
to handle.

22:17.937 --> 22:20.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joining me now for more on this
process is
Charlie Savage.

22:20.139 --> 22:24.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a Washington correspondent
at The New
York Times and author of "Power
Wars: Inside

22:24.610 --> 22:25.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Obama's Post-9/11 Presidency."

22:25.945 --> 22:28.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for joining us.

22:28.080 --> 22:31.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, who are these batch of
prisoners that
are being transferred?

22:31.317 --> 22:32.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why them and why not the rest of
them?

22:32.851 --> 22:34.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLIE SAVAGE, The New York
Times: Right.

22:34.553 --> 22:39.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, of the men at Guantanamo,
not all of them
are cleared for transfer.

22:39.558 --> 22:43.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's 10 that are facing
charges before
a military commission, and
there's about just

22:44.029 --> 22:49.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
under 30 who the government has
not charged
with a crime, but officials
believe they are

22:49.768 --> 22:51.403 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
still too dangerous to release.

22:51.437 --> 22:55.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so they continue to be held
as wartime
detainees, essentially.

22:55.407 --> 22:58.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then there are these lists
you mentioned
of about 22 men.

22:58.110 --> 23:03.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the remnants of what used
to be a very
long list of people who six
agencies looked

23:03.549 --> 23:08.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at and decided could be safely
released, as
long as they went to a country
that could

23:08.287 --> 23:12.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
provide certain security
assurances, like
monitoring them and preventing
them from travel

23:12.958 --> 23:14.760 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and so forth.

23:14.793 --> 23:19.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In his last sort of second part
of his second
term, Obama has made a big push
to get that

23:19.632 --> 23:24.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
list down as close to zero as he
can before
he leaves office, even if he
fails to close

23:24.470 --> 23:26.205 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the prison.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, closing
the prison
was something the president
wanted, but it

23:28.207 --> 23:29.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
also had bipartisan support.

23:29.808 --> 23:30.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why didn't it happen?

23:30.809 --> 23:33.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLIE SAVAGE: So, you're
right.

23:33.379 --> 23:37.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Bush administration in its
second term
wanted to close Guantanamo.

23:37.616 --> 23:43.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the 2008 presidential
election, both
Obama and his Republican
opponent, John McCain,

23:43.155 --> 23:45.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said that they would close
Guantanamo.

23:45.391 --> 23:50.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when Obama came in and said
he would close
the prison within a year, it
looked like it

23:50.462 --> 23:55.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
wasn't a partisan or a
controversial policy
to be working towards.

23:55.968 --> 24:02.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the politics shifted under
his feet over
the course of 2009-2010.

24:02.474 --> 24:08.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, at that point, Congress
started imposing
restrictions on the transfers of
detainees,

24:08.247 --> 24:12.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including eventually banning
them and their
transfer to the United States
for any purpose.

24:12.718 --> 24:17.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And President Obama's plan,
often overlooked,
for closing Guantanamo wasn't to
release every

24:18.023 --> 24:21.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
detainee who could not be
charged with a crime.

24:21.593 --> 24:26.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was that group of two or
three dozen
who the administration itself
thought was

24:26.999 --> 24:28.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
too dangerous to release, but
could not be
charged.

24:28.834 --> 24:33.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his plans, then, to close
the prison as
to move them to a different
prison in the

24:33.472 --> 24:39.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States, where they would
be cheaper
to house and where the symbolic
sort of notoriety

24:39.778 --> 24:44.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Guantanamo, the location the
Bush administration
had used, would go away.

24:44.650 --> 24:48.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, once Congress banned him
from bringing
prisoners into the United
States, that plan

24:48.487 --> 24:49.688 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
could not work.

24:49.722 --> 24:52.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, therefore, basically, he
wasn't going
to close it.

24:52.324 --> 24:55.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the only question was, would
the U.S.
get rid of the people at least
that it didn't

24:55.994 --> 25:00.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually want to hold, this long
list of detainees
approved for transfer?

25:00.099 --> 25:02.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What about
concerns about
recidivism?

25:02.201 --> 25:07.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLIE SAVAGE: The reengagement
rate of detainees
who were released in the Bush
administration

25:07.339 --> 25:11.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is about 30 percent, suspected
or confirmed,
a little over 30 percent.

25:11.610 --> 25:15.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's because, during the
Bush years,
large numbers of detainees were
sent home

25:15.581 --> 25:21.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to places like Afghanistan and
Saudi Arabia
in bulk transfers after
President Bush decided

25:21.220 --> 25:23.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to start trying to close the
prison.

25:23.756 --> 25:27.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Obama administration has
pursued a different
approach, an individualized
approach.

25:27.826 --> 25:33.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has a process where six
national security
agencies look at individual
detainees and

25:33.465 --> 25:35.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have to agree that that person
is releasable.

25:35.801 --> 25:39.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's a lot more planning
for where
they're going to go and what
kind of sort

25:40.005 --> 25:45.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of reentry into society,
monitoring, travel
restrictions and so forth
they're going to

25:45.310 --> 25:47.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
encounter once they get out.

25:47.546 --> 25:52.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that has brought down the
recidivism rate
for Obama era transfers to about
12 percent,

25:52.584 --> 25:54.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
confirmed or suspected.

25:54.353 --> 25:57.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What do we
know about the
Trump administration's plans for
Guantanamo

25:57.322 --> 25:59.091 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Bay?

25:59.124 --> 26:00.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLIE SAVAGE: President Trump
has said he
will keep Guantanamo open and
that he will

26:00.893 --> 26:02.327 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bring new detainees there.

26:02.361 --> 26:05.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He famously said he would load
it up with
some bad dudes.

26:05.364 --> 26:09.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama, of course, was trying to
close it and
failed, but didn't bring anyone
new there

26:09.735 --> 26:14.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in his entire eight years as
president, and
chipped away at the detainee
population.

26:14.473 --> 26:19.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think we can safely
predict that, sooner
or later, in the Trump
administration, the

26:19.411 --> 26:23.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States government will
capture a terrorism
suspect and bring him to
Guantanamo.

26:23.749 --> 26:28.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he will be the first new
prisoner there
in quite a long time.

26:28.620 --> 26:33.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we don't know is whether
president-elect
Trump intends to shut down all
transfers of

26:33.826 --> 26:39.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lower-level detainees to get rid
of the six-agency
review kind of parole board-like
process,

26:39.832 --> 26:45.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or whether he will continue that
process,
just without -- not using it
very often.

26:45.204 --> 26:47.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How much does
it cost to
keep Guantanamo running?

26:48.006 --> 26:55.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLIE SAVAGE: The operating
cost of Guantanamo
in 2015 was $450 million.

26:55.414 --> 27:01.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so if the Obama
administration does succeed
in getting roughly 18, plus or
minus, detainees

27:01.153 --> 27:09.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out, that would break down to a
ratio of about
$10 million per detainee per
year to house

27:09.161 --> 27:10.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
them at Guantanamo.

27:10.963 --> 27:15.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are some asterisks to
that, because
that figure includes the cost of
the military

27:15.367 --> 27:18.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
commission system as well, which
is not cheap
at all.

27:18.737 --> 27:20.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Charlie Savage
of The New
York Times, thanks so much.

27:20.472 --> 27:24.643 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHARLIE SAVAGE: Thank you.

27:24.676 --> 27:36.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we have a
story about possible
changes as a result of the
election.

27:36.955 --> 27:42.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some American women say they
fear they could
lose their access to birth
control once president-elect

27:42.461 --> 27:44.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump takes office.

27:44.263 --> 27:49.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump has pledged to repeal the
Affordable
Care Act, which includes free
contraceptives.

27:49.668 --> 27:54.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He hasn't said what would
replace it, and
that's why the women in this
story are taking

27:54.273 --> 27:55.440 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
action.

27:55.474 --> 27:58.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Correspondent Lisa Desjardins
has the story.

27:58.377 --> 28:04.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Morning in
Baltimore, oven-baked
biscuits and a warm moment for
Victoria Cross

28:04.516 --> 28:07.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and fiance Cameron Okeke (ph).

28:07.419 --> 28:13.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Victoria's getting an
IUD, or intrauterine
device, a form of birth control
that works

28:13.258 --> 28:14.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for several years.

28:14.993 --> 28:17.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The young couple isn't shy about
their family
planning.

28:17.763 --> 28:19.531 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They can't be.

28:19.565 --> 28:23.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Twenty-three-year-old Victoria
is at high
risk for miscarriages due to a
genetic tissue

28:23.969 --> 28:25.704 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
disorder.

28:25.737 --> 28:30.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's used monthly birth control
pills for
years, but something changed
election night.

28:30.542 --> 28:34.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VICTORIA CROSS, Baltimore: Yes,
thought immediately
about abortion access,
immediately about birth

28:34.313 --> 28:36.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
control access and how expensive
birth control
was when.

28:37.015 --> 28:42.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I pretty immediately called
my gynecologist
and: I want to talk to you.

28:42.087 --> 28:43.889 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Help.

28:43.922 --> 28:48.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Dr. Stacey
Leigh Rubin of
Johns Hopkins, Victoria's
gynecologist, says

28:48.460 --> 28:51.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many patients and non-patients
have reached
out.

28:51.697 --> 28:53.398 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

28:53.432 --> 28:56.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STACEY LEIGH RUBIN, Johns
Hopkins: Distant
acquaintances and old classmates
contacting

28:56.868 --> 29:01.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me on Facebook with concerns and
questions
about what IUDs are and how they
can get them.

29:01.473 --> 29:02.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It's a real
surge in interest.

29:02.774 --> 29:03.842 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

29:03.875 --> 29:05.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STACEY LEIGH RUBIN: It is a real
surge in
interest.

29:05.744 --> 29:10.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: An IUD is
usually plastic
and inserted in the uterus to
prevent pregnancy.

29:10.248 --> 29:15.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IUDs are considered among the
most effective
birth control methods, but
they're not cheap,

29:15.287 --> 29:16.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
running up to $1,000.

29:16.288 --> 29:18.023 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

29:18.056 --> 29:20.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STACEY LEIGH RUBIN: So, what
questions do
you have about these different
methods and

29:20.258 --> 29:21.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what do you think you're leaning
towards?

29:22.027 --> 29:27.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right now, for
Victoria and
other women, IUDs and all birth
control is

29:27.566 --> 29:32.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
free, because the Obama
administration considers
it a preventative procedure, a
category that

29:32.971 --> 29:37.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Affordable Care Act says
must be cost-free
to the patient.

29:37.909 --> 29:39.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Enter a new White House.

29:39.778 --> 29:43.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: Repealing
Obamacare is one of the single
most important

29:43.849 --> 29:46.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reasons we must win on November
8.

29:46.652 --> 29:50.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: President-elect
Donald Trump
campaigned on repealing and
replacing the

29:50.756 --> 29:52.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Affordable Care Act.

29:52.324 --> 29:57.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He notably has not said exactly
how he will
handle the contraceptive
benefit.

29:57.262 --> 30:00.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But others close to him have

in October,

30:09.608 --> 30:14.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
highlighted religious groups
opposed to contraception,
and their religious freedom.

30:14.312 --> 30:17.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE PENCE: Our administration
is going to
err on the side of freedom.

We are going to err on the side

30:29.961 --> 30:35.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%

contraceptive costs

30:35.567 --> 30:36.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
were an issue for women.

Bring me one.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.441 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
There's not one.

30:42.474 --> 30:46.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact of the matter is, this
is a trampling
on religious freedom and
religious liberty

30:46.244 --> 30:47.746 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this country.

30:47.779 --> 30:51.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

comment struck
an already watchful Internet.

30:51.717 --> 30:56.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Immediately after the election,
Google searches
for IUD spiked and Twitter saw
phrases like

30:57.022 --> 31:00.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"get an IUD" jump in popularity.

31:00.358 --> 31:02.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What are the wallet
implications?

31:02.194 --> 31:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A University of Pennsylvania
study found that
the Obama contraception policy
saved IUD and

31:08.166 --> 31:12.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
birth control pill users an
average of roughly
$250 a year.

birth control
has been a game-changer for
women.

31:16.308 --> 31:22.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the idea of going back to
high out-of-pocket
costs for contraception is
distressing.

31:22.881 --> 31:26.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But will Trump
change those
costs?

31:26.918 --> 31:29.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Someone with insight is Marjorie
Dannenfelser.

31:29.721 --> 31:34.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She led what Trump called his
Pro-Life Coalition,
and runs the anti- abortion
group the Susan

31:35.026 --> 31:36.862 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
B. Anthony List.

31:36.895 --> 31:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dannenfelser says neither she
nor Trump want
to weigh in on the morality of
contraception,

31:41.967 --> 31:44.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but when it comes to the no-cost
mandate:

31:44.035 --> 31:46.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARJORIE DANNENFELSER,
President, Susan B.
Anthony List: He and I also
agree that religious

31:46.872 --> 31:52.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and any individual deserves the
right to a
conscience, and they shouldn't
be forced to

31:52.077 --> 31:54.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pay for things that they find
are undermining
of that conscience.

31:55.013 --> 31:59.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, yes, I believe that he will
undo that
mandate, and he will be right to
do so.

31:59.584 --> 32:04.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That leads to
another question
about the president-elect: How
quickly could

32:04.322 --> 32:09.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a President Trump change
contraception coverage,
and therefore out-of-pocket
cost?

32:09.127 --> 32:10.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Relatively quickly.

32:10.228 --> 32:13.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You see, the contraception
mandate is not
a law.

32:13.131 --> 32:15.534 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a rule put in place by HHS.

32:15.567 --> 32:22.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And HHS, under a Trump White
House, could
change that rule without input
from Congress.

where do we go

32:32.050 --> 32:36.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

for this new
administration, where our access
may go away?

32:36.755 --> 32:41.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

birth control
will last up to five years.

32:41.626 --> 32:46.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's one year longer than the

high levels of lead were found
in Flint's

33:30.308 --> 33:35.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
water supply, the city has
opened a free all-day
early childhood center for
children 2 months

33:35.981 --> 33:37.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to 5 years of age.

for any children currently
living in Flint

33:39.985 --> 33:45.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or were living in Flint when
lead exposure
was at its worst.

HARI SREENIVASAN: Bob Barnett, a

33:50.562 --> 33:52.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
create the new early learning
program.

33:52.430 --> 33:53.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BOB BARNETT: We made phone
calls.

33:53.999 --> 33:57.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We went door to door to every
single neighborhood
in the city.

mission, to
reach families with the youngest
children.

34:02.540 --> 34:05.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That's because lead is a
neurotoxin that targets
the developing brain.

A child's brain doubles in size
from zero

34:10.015 --> 34:11.917 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to 2.

34:11.950 --> 34:18.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you have these insults
to the developing
brain at such a young age, it
really impacts

34:18.623 --> 34:21.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that entire trajectory of
learning.

34:21.126 --> 34:26.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mona
Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician
who discovered elevated lead
levels in Flint's

34:26.831 --> 34:31.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
children, says there's a
well-established
link between lead exposure and
learning disabilities.

DR.

34:33.271 --> 34:37.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MONA HANNA-ATTISHA: Lead has
been shown to
drop children's I.Q., so it
impacts how they

34:37.108 --> 34:39.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think, and it impacts how they
act.

34:39.377 --> 34:46.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It has been linked to
attention-deficit disorder,
impulsivity, many other
developmental delays.

34:46.785 --> 34:52.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so it has these
life-course-altering
consequences.

34:52.257 --> 34:58.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: More than
5,000 of Flint's
youngest children were put in
danger when

34:58.063 --> 35:03.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the city switched to a new water
source, the
Flint River, in the spring of
2014, causing

35:03.234 --> 35:07.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lead from aging pipes to leach
into the system.

35:07.238 --> 35:11.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since then, Flint officials have
switched
back to Lake Huron for their
water supply,

35:11.710 --> 35:16.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and although lead levels have
been dramatically
reduced, residents are still
urged to use

35:16.948 --> 35:21.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bottled or filtered water for
everything from
drinking to bathing.

35:21.086 --> 35:27.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The lead exposure lasted only 18
months, but

still exists.

that I can prescribe to our
Flint kids is

35:46.644 --> 35:47.612 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
early education.

35:47.645 --> 35:48.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

35:50.181 --> 35:52.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm like, no, I want early
education.

35:52.083 --> 35:57.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The center is

in Flint.

36:00.492 --> 36:07.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB BARNETT: We know that lead
exposure, especially
in our youngest children, birth
to 5, affects

36:07.265 --> 36:09.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their cognition and their
behavior.

36:09.801 --> 36:15.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We also know that the impact of
early childhood
education and intervention can
counter that.

36:15.740 --> 36:20.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The free
program has been
able to accommodate 240
children.

36:20.278 --> 36:26.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Another 220 families remain on

Major donations from 10
foundations, as well

not have afforded the program
for their 3-year-old

36:41.966 --> 36:46.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
daughter, Nyla (ph).

36:46.538 --> 36:49.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sanders is anxious to protect
her child's
ability to learn.

36:49.574 --> 36:52.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOYCE SANDERS, Mother: She's so
incredibly
bright.

36:52.911 --> 37:00.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's terrifying to think
that this exposure
could take that away from her.

37:00.819 --> 37:03.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is terrifying.

37:03.621 --> 37:08.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm trying to do everything
I can to give
her the resources, so that she
can hold on

37:08.326 --> 37:10.061 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to that.

37:10.095 --> 37:13.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Nyla and her
5-year-old
sister, Kaia (ph), both tested
positive for

37:13.965 --> 37:16.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
low levels of lead in their
blood.

37:16.568 --> 37:22.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But because lead has a short
window of detection
in the bloodstream, Sanders is
unsure how

37:22.207 --> 37:23.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
much her children ingested.

37:23.575 --> 37:26.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOYCE SANDERS: I don't really
know what their
exposure level is.

37:26.177 --> 37:32.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every time they get anything,
I'm worried:
Is this something that I'm
missing?

37:32.217 --> 37:37.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Like many
parents in Flint,
the experience has left Sanders
feeling uneasy.

37:37.155 --> 37:43.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOYCE SANDERS: I have noticed
with my daughter
Nyla, she can sometimes get
upset, and it's

37:43.094 --> 37:45.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very, very hard to calm her
down.

37:45.096 --> 37:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that just may be one of
those quirky things,
or it could mean something.

37:49.134 --> 37:51.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And if it means something,
that's huge.

37:51.302 --> 37:58.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so those type of things are
always in
the back of my mind.

HARI SREENIVASAN: Great
Expectations uses
the Reggio Emilia teaching
approach, which

38:04.916 --> 38:09.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
emphasizes emotional well-being,
something
educators believe is a good fit
for kids with

38:09.954 --> 38:11.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
possible lead exposure.

KATIE MCCORMACK, Great
Expectations: We're
working a lot with impulse
control, so everyone

38:16.094 --> 38:19.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can listen, everyone can take
turns and pay
attention.

38:19.130 --> 38:22.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We really want to just see where
they are
at developmentally.

38:22.667 --> 38:24.335 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

MONA HANNA-ATTISHA: These early
childhood
teachers are actually brain
builders.

38:27.338 --> 38:29.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're building these kids'
neural connections.

38:29.474 --> 38:35.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is unethical for us to sit
back and wait
and study these kids in five, 10
years, and

38:35.647 --> 38:37.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say, oh, look at the impact of
lead exposure.

38:37.715 --> 38:39.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We must be proactive.

38:39.817 --> 38:41.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We must be preventative.

38:41.686 --> 38:45.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The new center
is housed
in one of Flint's shuttered
elementary schools.

38:45.390 --> 38:50.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The city's school enrollment has
declined
dramatically since the 1980s,
when car manufacturing

38:50.361 --> 38:52.630 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
jobs started disappearing.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Flint school's superintendent,
Bilal Tawwab.

38:54.465 --> 38:58.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILAL TAWWAB, Superintendent,
Flint Community
School: Right now, we have only
5,000 kids

38:58.770 --> 39:00.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in Flint Community Schools.

39:00.672 --> 39:03.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At one time, there was about
50,000 kids.

39:03.274 --> 39:06.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Actually, we have more closed
buildings than
open buildings.

39:06.511 --> 39:12.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: More than 40
percent of
Flint's residents live below the
poverty line.

39:12.750 --> 39:16.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Superintendent Tawwab says
using vacant
buildings for early education
coupled with

39:17.021 --> 39:19.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
good nutrition will better
prepare Flint's
children.

39:19.924 --> 39:26.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILAL TAWWAB: I would like to
believe this
is just the start of some very,
very important

39:26.631 --> 39:28.399 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
work.

39:28.433 --> 39:30.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But while
educators hope
to expand the program, there's
only enough

39:31.002 --> 39:35.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
money to serve 240 of the 5,000
to 6,000 children
in the city.

39:35.974 --> 39:39.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And even those slots are
operating on limited
three-years grants.

39:39.744 --> 39:42.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

39:42.480 --> 39:47.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As we reported
earlier, Michigan's
attorney general filed criminal
charges against

39:47.919 --> 39:53.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
city officials in Flint for
operating that
city's water systems in an
unsafe manner.

39:53.157 --> 39:57.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, it turns out Flint is not
alone in having
a lead contamination problem.

39:57.929 --> 40:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two recent news investigation
find two startling
numbers.

40:01.966 --> 40:08.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A Reuters investigation of lead
levels in
blood found nearly 3,000 areas
in the country

40:08.940 --> 40:13.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with contamination levels higher
than those
in Flint.

40:13.211 --> 40:19.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a USA Today report found
that some four
million Americans get water from
utilities

40:19.050 --> 40:23.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that do not meet federal safe
drinking water
standards.

40:23.187 --> 40:26.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Laura Ungar was a lead reporter
on the USA
Today investigation.

40:26.991 --> 40:28.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And she joins me now.

40:28.726 --> 40:30.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Laura Ungar, welcome to the
program.

40:30.695 --> 40:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You and your colleagues focused
on smaller
communities around the country.

40:34.799 --> 40:36.434 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

40:36.467 --> 40:41.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURA UNGAR, USA Today: Well, we
wanted to
look at the problem beyond Flint
and look

40:41.072 --> 40:44.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to see just how big the scope
was.

40:44.275 --> 40:50.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, basically, we looked at
where the
problem was the worst, and we
found that,

40:50.782 --> 40:59.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in these small water systems,
which are generally
located in rural areas, small,
remote communities,

40:59.290 --> 41:02.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the problem was worse in those
communities.

41:02.193 --> 41:05.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And give us an
example of what
you found.

41:05.496 --> 41:09.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You got a number of families you
write about
in this series.

41:09.667 --> 41:12.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LAURA UNGAR: Yes.

41:12.136 --> 41:18.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, one family in
Ranger, Texas,
they have a situation where
their 2-year-old

41:18.543 --> 41:22.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
son has high levels of lead in
his blood.

41:22.814 --> 41:29.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they lived there for about a
year, almost
a year, before finding out from
a citywide

41:29.354 --> 41:36.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
letter that they had high lead
in their city,
in their city's water supply.

41:36.728 --> 41:44.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then they -- actually, their
tap was tested,
and they didn't find out the
results of that

41:44.102 --> 41:45.169 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from the city.

41:45.203 --> 41:47.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They found it out from me,
actually.

41:47.238 --> 41:51.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I told them the levels that were
found in
their own tap.

41:51.976 --> 41:56.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So -- and they were very upset
about that
situation, because, you know,
their son is

41:56.447 --> 42:03.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2, and he's facing high lead,
which, as you
know, just causes all sorts of
problems with

42:03.421 --> 42:04.856 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
children.

42:04.889 --> 42:07.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, again, it
wasn't just
this one small community.

42:07.158 --> 42:09.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You found something like four
million Americans
affected.

42:09.961 --> 42:13.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LAURA UNGAR: Yes, it's more than
four million.

42:13.097 --> 42:23.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That four million is places
where -- or people
affected by places that either
tested improperly

42:23.408 --> 42:25.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or skipped tests.

42:25.343 --> 42:31.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are even more than that
when you talk
about where high lead has been
found and,

42:31.149 --> 42:33.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in some cases, has not been
fixed.

42:33.251 --> 42:34.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why...

42:34.252 --> 42:35.219 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

42:35.253 --> 42:36.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sorry.

42:36.254 --> 42:38.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Didn't mean to interrupt.

42:38.089 --> 42:42.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But why is it that some of these
smaller communities
don't have the stringent
regulations that

42:42.894 --> 42:45.763 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
larger population areas do?

42:45.797 --> 42:52.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LAURA UNGAR: What -- the
rationale that I
have heard for the difference in
the rules

42:52.637 --> 42:55.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is the resource difference.

42:55.039 --> 43:02.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a vastly different --
vastly different
resources between the large
water systems

43:02.213 --> 43:07.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in big cities and these small
water systems
which only serve a few thousand
people.

43:07.585 --> 43:13.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, some of them are run by
folks who
may have another full-time job.

43:13.591 --> 43:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We found one place where, for
example, a farmer/rancher
ran a water system in his spare
time.

43:22.567 --> 43:24.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he tried his best, but it's
part-time
thing.

43:24.969 --> 43:30.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's a much different
situation than
in a large water system, where
you might have

43:30.107 --> 43:36.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very educated folks and large
staffs dealing
with water quality.

43:36.881 --> 43:38.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, finally, who
is responsible?

43:38.249 --> 43:42.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Environmental Protection
Agency, I know
you talked to them.

43:43.020 --> 43:43.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do they say?

43:44.021 --> 43:45.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do they explain it?

43:45.189 --> 43:49.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LAURA UNGAR: They -- there's
layers of responsibility.

43:49.193 --> 43:51.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First of all, there's the
utility.

43:51.095 --> 43:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's the states that are
supposed to be
enforcing those federal safe
drinking water

43:55.533 --> 43:56.601 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
standards.

43:56.634 --> 44:00.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, ultimately, the buck
stops at the
EPA.

44:00.037 --> 44:05.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The EPA does tell me that they
are focusing
on these small water systems,
that they do

44:05.176 --> 44:09.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hope to make improvements in
this area.

44:09.547 --> 44:14.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's a multifaceted problem,
and with
no easy answers at all.

44:14.619 --> 44:16.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, some
excellent reporting.

44:17.021 --> 44:18.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know you are going to be
following up
on that.

44:18.956 --> 44:21.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Laura Ungar with USA Today,
thank you.

44:21.125 --> 44:25.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LAURA UNGAR: Thank you.

44:25.396 --> 44:36.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
part two of
Jeffrey Brown's conversation
with Bruce Springsteen.

44:36.741 --> 44:41.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The working-class rock 'n' roll
hero talks
about his lifelong bouts of
depression, his

44:41.779 --> 44:44.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
love of reading, and the
election of Donald
Trump.

44:44.949 --> 44:50.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: On a visit with
Bruce Springsteen
at his home in rural New Jersey,
most of the

44:50.254 --> 44:54.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talk, of course, was about
music, the core
of his life and career.

44:54.825 --> 45:00.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But part of the story he tells
about his rise
to the world stage also involved
books, what

45:00.398 --> 45:03.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he describes in his memoir as
his self-education.

45:03.401 --> 45:06.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, Musician: I
think, when
I discovered the Russian guys,
they were -- that

45:06.237 --> 45:07.204 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
was...

45:07.238 --> 45:08.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The Russians did
it?

45:08.239 --> 45:09.206 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

45:09.240 --> 45:11.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: That was the
big thing.

45:11.042 --> 45:12.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You mean like the
big hitters,
like Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy and
those guys?

45:12.643 --> 45:14.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: The big
hitters, yes.

45:14.579 --> 45:18.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, when I got into "Anna
Karenina" and "Brothers
Karamazov" and "Crime and
Punishment," that

45:18.849 --> 45:22.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was the stuff that -- that had a
big effect
on me, because it was so
psychological.

45:22.420 --> 45:25.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Does your reading
affect your
writing as a songwriter?

45:25.156 --> 45:31.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: I think it
affects you
internally in a way that's not
immediately

45:31.829 --> 45:36.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
evident, but that it simply
increases your
frame of reference.

45:36.734 --> 45:44.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You learn more about the craft
of writing,
what good writing feels like.

45:44.308 --> 45:47.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, mostly, it just enlarges
you as an individual.

45:47.912 --> 45:52.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The one thing I wished for my
children is
that they'd be readers.

45:52.249 --> 45:54.051 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
And...

45:54.085 --> 45:56.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, and are
they, because
that's what I was going to ask
you, because,

45:56.187 --> 45:57.154 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nowadays..

45:57.188 --> 45:58.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: No.

45:58.189 --> 45:59.156 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

45:59.190 --> 46:00.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: They're not.

46:00.191 --> 46:01.959 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:01.993 --> 46:02.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Their father
didn't make himself
a reader until around 30, so the
kids, in

46:02.693 --> 46:09.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their 20s, still have time.

46:09.500 --> 46:13.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
By that point, Springsteen had
become a major
rock star.

46:14.005 --> 46:19.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, in his 30s, he also
suffered a serious
bout of depression, something he
would struggle

46:19.443 --> 46:25.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with throughout his life,
including an episode
as recently as his early 60s,
all while keeping

46:25.950 --> 46:29.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up a rigorous touring and
recording career.

46:29.053 --> 46:35.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Springsteen, now 67, credits his
wife, Patti,
and years of counseling and
antidepressants

46:35.760 --> 46:37.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with getting him through.

46:37.595 --> 46:40.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He writes candidly of these
struggles in his
new memoir.

46:40.364 --> 46:44.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: It was a big
enough part
of my life to where it felt like
it needed

46:44.468 --> 46:46.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be included in the book, you
know?

46:46.871 --> 46:54.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, also, I think it was an
insight into
some of your creative fire,
where it comes

46:54.745 --> 46:56.547 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
from.

46:56.580 --> 47:02.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wrote -- the premise of the
book was to
give my audience an insight into
how I created,

47:02.153 --> 47:06.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and what were -- what's the fuel
for the fire.

47:06.157 --> 47:10.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You see them as
combined, twined.

47:10.061 --> 47:13.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a kind of trope of many
artists of
creativity and madness.

47:13.664 --> 47:18.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: Mental
illness and creativity
are -- it's a thin line in
between the two.

47:18.035 --> 47:20.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I tend to believe that.

47:20.471 --> 47:22.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't know many artists who
are not crazy.

47:22.540 --> 47:26.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most of the artists I know are
crazy in one
way or another.

47:26.310 --> 47:28.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that's why you get into
it.

47:28.112 --> 47:32.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're in pursuit of a certain
sort of peace
that's very, very, very
difficult to come

47:32.850 --> 47:34.719 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
by.

47:34.752 --> 47:45.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I realized the only time I
felt complete
and peaceful was while I was
playing or shortly

47:45.062 --> 47:55.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
afterwards, even though it was
in front of
thousands of other people, which
most people

47:55.139 --> 47:56.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wouldn't consider to be a safe
place.

47:56.574 --> 47:57.541 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
For me...

47:57.575 --> 47:58.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: No, they
wouldn't.

47:58.576 --> 47:59.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, why is that a safe place?

47:59.577 --> 48:01.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: For me, it's
always been.

48:01.412 --> 48:11.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For me, once I count the band
in, and I delve
deep into my song, I feel a
certain sort of

48:11.055 --> 48:17.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
integrity and integration that I
rarely find
in my daily life.

48:17.828 --> 48:22.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's better now than it used to
be, but it's
still something that, if I want
to deeply

48:22.800 --> 48:29.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
experience it, I walk on stage,
I play, I
perform, I create, I write.

48:29.173 --> 48:33.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's where sort of that
peace comes
over me.

48:33.644 --> 48:40.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: As he matured as
an artist,
Springsteen's music took on
issues of the

48:40.317 --> 48:49.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
political culture, Vietnam,
poverty, those
left behind in the 2008
recession.

48:49.360 --> 48:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: I integrated
it because
politics and life go hand in
hand.

48:56.367 --> 48:58.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so it needed to be a part of
my music.

48:59.003 --> 49:03.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thus, the different social
forces that affected
my parents' lives or my friends'
lives or

49:03.374 --> 49:08.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I saw around me became essential
for me to
write about.

49:08.512 --> 49:13.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He also became
more up front
in his own politics, joining
Barack Obama

49:13.851 --> 49:18.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the campaign trail, and, in
the recent
election, supporting Hillary
Clinton.

49:18.489 --> 49:23.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: I was going
around the
world swearing -- I was betting
on Hillary,

49:23.160 --> 49:26.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going around the world,
interview after interview.

49:26.230 --> 49:29.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And you were
wrong, like many
people.

49:29.300 --> 49:30.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: Yes.

49:30.301 --> 49:31.268 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

49:31.302 --> 49:32.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But what explains
it?

49:32.269 --> 49:34.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: I think a lot
of things.

49:34.071 --> 49:36.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think that people with
legitimate concerns
about how -- how are you going
to live, how

49:36.540 --> 49:40.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are you going to -- where are
you going to
find your jobs?

49:40.077 --> 49:46.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Deindustrialization that I have
written about
for 40 years left a good part of
the American

49:46.116 --> 49:47.318 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
public behind.

49:47.351 --> 49:50.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think if somebody comes up
and simply
says, your jobs?

49:50.821 --> 49:52.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm going to bring them back.

49:52.289 --> 49:54.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're not comfortable with the
browning of
America?

49:54.124 --> 49:55.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm going to build a wall.

49:55.793 --> 49:58.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISIS, I'm going to defeat them.

49:59.029 --> 50:06.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are very -- it's a simple,
but it was
a compelling message for a lot
of people.

50:06.136 --> 50:07.872 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
And...

50:07.905 --> 50:09.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But these are the
people that
you have been writing about for
all those

50:09.206 --> 50:10.174 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

50:10.207 --> 50:11.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: Yes, that's
true.

50:11.308 --> 50:13.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, did you lose
touch with
them?

50:13.110 --> 50:14.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Did they lose touch with you?

50:14.879 --> 50:20.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: It was just a
very divided
country, you know, a very
divided country.

50:20.551 --> 50:24.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't really know another
way to explain
it.

50:25.022 --> 50:33.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While I didn't think that Donald
Trump's message
was credible enough to affect
the vote to

50:33.697 --> 50:38.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that degree, I was wrong, and it
was.

50:38.969 --> 50:45.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In this book, you
often talk
about telling your story, but
also telling

50:45.175 --> 50:49.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our story, which has come
through in your
music, right, telling a story of
this country.

50:49.446 --> 50:50.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: Yes.

50:50.447 --> 50:51.649 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

50:51.682 --> 50:53.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: How do we bridge
divides in
this country?

50:53.651 --> 50:59.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: I think you
can't demonize
somebody that's on the other
side of the political

50:59.390 --> 51:03.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
spectrum, or you can't
generalize about them.

51:03.294 --> 51:09.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know people on both sides of
that particular
divide.

51:09.500 --> 51:12.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they just have a different
opinion about
it.

51:12.536 --> 51:18.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think that maybe look
outside your own
daily experience also, which is
something

51:18.809 --> 51:25.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, as a writer, that was sort
of something
that meant a great deal to me.

51:26.016 --> 51:32.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's probably -- I mean,
that's been my
story over -- to tell over the
past 40 years.

51:32.423 --> 51:34.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And there's common ground in it.

51:34.925 --> 51:40.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's going to take a while
to see where
it goes.

51:40.531 --> 51:46.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In the meantime,
the music
continues.

51:46.537 --> 51:50.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bruce Springsteen and The E
Street Band head
to Australia and New Zealand at
the beginning

51:50.841 --> 51:54.945 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
