05:57.623 --> 05:58.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FLEEING.

05:58.691 --> 06:02.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

06:02.662 --> 06:04.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE GRAND MOSQUE IN THE HEART OF

06:04.997 --> 06:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

06:07.600 --> 06:09.402 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISLAMIC STATE LEADER, ABU BAKR

06:09.402 --> 06:11.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AL-BAGHDADI, MADE HIS APPEARANCE

06:11.471 --> 06:12.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THREE YEARS AGO.

06:12.505 --> 06:13.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THIS IS WHERE WE SAW

06:13.673 --> 06:15.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CIVILIANS STREAMING OUT.

06:15.441 --> 06:17.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS A FEW DOZEN THAT WE SAW,

06:17.543 --> 06:19.245 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT I LATER HEARD THAT IT WAS

06:19.245 --> 06:21.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY 3,000 OVERALL YESTERDAY

06:21.381 --> 06:22.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT... THAT LEFT THE OLD CITY.

06:22.782 --> 06:24.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY WERE COMING OUT IN A

06:24.917 --> 06:27.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY DESPERATE STATE.

06:27.253 --> 06:28.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'VE SEEN THOUSANDS AND

06:28.955 --> 06:30.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS FLEEING

06:30.723 --> 06:31.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOSUL FOR THE PAST EIGHT MONTHS,

06:31.891 --> 06:34.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THESE WERE BY FAR THE

06:34.794 --> 06:36.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORST...IN WORST CONDITION.

06:36.929 --> 06:37.630 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHY WOULD THEY

06:37.630 --> 06:39.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STAY THERE AS LONG AS THEY DID?

06:39.065 --> 06:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, WERE SOME OF THEM BEING

06:40.333 --> 06:42.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HELD AGAINST THEIR WILL AS HUMAN

06:42.034 --> 06:43.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHIELDS?

06:43.102 --> 06:43.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THE ISLAMIC STATE HAS

06:43.836 --> 06:45.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN USING CIVILIANS AS... AS

06:45.104 --> 06:46.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HUMAN SHIELDS THIS ENTIRE TIME,

06:46.906 --> 06:48.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THE ENTIRE BATTLE.

06:48.975 --> 06:51.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THE IRAQI

06:51.778 --> 06:52.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORCES-- AND ESPECIALLY THE

06:52.912 --> 06:53.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERNATIONAL COALITION BACKING

06:53.946 --> 06:55.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEM-- IS DOING EVERYTHING THEY

06:55.481 --> 06:57.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN TO PREVENT CIVILIAN

06:57.083 --> 06:59.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASUALTIES, SO THEY'LL OFTEN

06:59.619 --> 07:01.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORCE CIVILIANS TO STAY IN THE

07:01.354 --> 07:02.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOWER GROUNDS OF A BUILDING AND

07:02.555 --> 07:04.824 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEN PUT A SNIPER ON TOP SO THAT

07:04.824 --> 07:06.692 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT SNIPER IS... IS IN SOME

07:06.692 --> 07:08.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAYS PROTECTED FROM MORTAR

07:08.661 --> 07:09.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTACKS OR AIR STRIKES.

07:09.729 --> 07:10.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: TELL US A LITTLE

07:10.463 --> 07:12.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIT ABOUT THIS MOSQUE AND WHY

07:12.064 --> 07:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT SYMBOL

07:13.833 --> 07:14.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE.

07:14.667 --> 07:16.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE GRAND NURI MOSQUE IS AT

07:16.169 --> 07:17.403 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CENTER OF THE OLD CITY,AND

07:17.403 --> 07:18.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT HAS BEEN AROUND... WHICH IS

07:18.704 --> 07:21.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
840 YEARS OLD, WHICH IS... IS

07:21.174 --> 07:22.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEANING, SORT OF LIKE THE

07:22.308 --> 07:23.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEANING TOWER OF PISA.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DUE TO, WE THINK, STRUCTURAL

07:26.145 --> 07:29.749 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBLEMS, IT BEGAN LEANING VERY

07:29.749 --> 07:30.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOON AFTER CONSTRUCTION.

07:30.683 --> 07:32.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THIS IS AN ICONIC SITE IN

07:32.418 --> 07:33.252 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOSUL.

07:33.252 --> 07:36.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT IS ALSO WHERE ISLAMIC STATE

07:36.088 --> 07:39.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEADER ABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADI CAME

07:39.325 --> 07:42.462 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN JULY 2014 AND MADE THIS...

07:42.462 --> 07:43.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY THE ONLY PUBLIC

07:43.229 --> 07:44.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APPEARANCE THAT WE KNOW OF,

07:44.597 --> 07:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONFIRMED PUBLIC APPEARANCE, AND

07:46.766 --> 07:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROCLAIMED HIMSELF THE CALIPH,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LEADER OF THE ISLAMIC STATE.

07:50.436 --> 07:51.771 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE HE CAME.

07:51.771 --> 07:53.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE IRAQI FORCES WERE HOPING

07:53.906 --> 07:55.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO GET TO THIS SITE, TAKE DOWN

07:55.942 --> 07:57.743 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE... THE BLACK ISIS FLAG THAT

07:57.743 --> 07:58.644 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS BEEN HANGING THERE FOR THE

07:58.644 --> 08:00.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAST THREE YEARS, AND STRING UP

08:00.079 --> 08:02.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE... THE TRI-COLOR IRAQI FLAG

08:02.782 --> 08:05.351 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS A REALLY SYMBOLIC SIGN OF

08:05.351 --> 08:06.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VICTORY.

08:06.085 --> 08:07.286 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO DO THAT

08:07.286 --> 08:08.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE, JUST OVER A WEEK AGO

08:08.921 --> 08:10.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, THE ISLAMIC STATE RIGGED

08:10.957 --> 08:12.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE... THE ENTIRE COMPLEX WITH

08:12.358 --> 08:14.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPLOSIVES AND BLEW IT UP.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.295 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ONLY PART OF THE MOSQUE THAT

08:16.295 --> 08:18.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS STILL INTACT WAS THE... THE

08:18.030 --> 08:21.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOME UNDER WHICH BAGHDADI STOOD

08:21.067 --> 08:22.568 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND MADE THAT MESSAGE THREE

08:22.568 --> 08:23.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARS AGO.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: NOW, THE IRAQI

08:24.036 --> 08:25.972 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORCES THAT YOU SPEAK TO, WHAT'S

08:25.972 --> 08:27.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NEXT STEP?

08:27.573 --> 08:28.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LET'S SAY, BEST-CASE SCENARIO,

08:28.674 --> 08:30.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY RETAKE THE CITY; IT'S IN

08:30.543 --> 08:31.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUINS RIGHT NOW.

08:31.878 --> 08:34.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN MOSUL IS

08:35.448 --> 08:37.016 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY HEAVILY DAMAGED.

08:37.016 --> 08:38.684 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE THERE IS ELECTRICITY AND

08:38.684 --> 08:41.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WATER, IT'S USUALLY PROVIDED BY

08:41.821 --> 08:45.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GENERATORS OR WATER TRUCKS.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.125 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT

08:46.125 --> 08:47.059 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE.

08:47.059 --> 08:48.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THE BATTLE CONTINUES, AND

08:48.995 --> 08:51.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECURITY AND STABILITY--

08:51.097 --> 08:52.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAINTAINING THAT-- REALLY, IS

08:52.765 --> 08:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO BE A... A TRICK FOR THE

08:54.400 --> 08:56.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECURITY FORCES, AS WELL.

08:56.469 --> 09:00.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE ALMOST 100% SURE THAT THE

09:00.439 --> 09:02.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISLAMIC STATE HAS LEFT SLEEPER

09:02.842 --> 09:03.743 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CELLS, THAT... THAT SOME OF

09:03.743 --> 09:05.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR FIGHTERS HAVE BLENDED IN

09:05.111 --> 09:06.879 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO, WE EXPECT THAT, YOU

09:08.514 --> 09:09.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW, THERE WILL BE SOME SORT OF

09:09.582 --> 09:11.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A... OF A RETURN TO INSURGENT

09:11.951 --> 09:14.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTACKS, AND THAT'LL BE TASK

09:14.086 --> 09:15.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NUMBER ONE FOR THE SECURITY

09:15.488 --> 09:16.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORCES TO... TO HANDLE.

09:16.822 --> 09:17.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

US VIA SKYPE FROM IRBIL TONIGHT.

09:20.226 --> 09:22.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THANKS SO MUCH.

09:20.693 --> 09:35.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

>> Sreenivasan: GLOBAL SEA LEVEL

09:36.242 --> 09:38.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RISE WENT UP 50% BETWEEN 1994

09:38.978 --> 09:40.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND 2014, ACCORDING TO A STUDY

09:40.880 --> 09:42.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUBLISHED THIS WEEK IN THE

09:42.114 --> 09:44.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOURNAL "NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE."

09:44.216 --> 09:45.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN 2014 ALONE, IT WENT UP AN

09:45.918 --> 09:47.186 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EIGHTH OF AN INCH.

09:47.186 --> 09:48.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT

09:48.120 --> 09:49.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE NUMBERS ACTUALLY MEAN,

09:49.388 --> 09:50.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKE A LOOK AT THE INCREASING

09:50.690 --> 09:51.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NUMBER OF FLOODING EVENTS ALONG

09:51.991 --> 09:53.225 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE EAST COAST OF THE UNITED

09:53.225 --> 09:54.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES.

09:54.026 --> 09:55.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NONPROFIT CLIMATE CENTRAL

09:55.461 --> 09:56.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOKED AT 90 CITIES FROM

09:56.996 --> 09:58.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MASSACHUSETTS TO FLORIDA.

09:58.664 --> 09:59.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCLUDED IN THAT LIST ARE

09:59.765 --> 10:01.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATLANTIC CITY AND OTHER TOWNS ON

10:01.267 --> 10:02.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NEW JERSEY SHORE.

10:02.668 --> 10:03.669 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I RECENTLY SPOKE TO THE REPORTER

10:03.669 --> 10:06.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THAT STORY, JOHN UPTON.

10:06.138 --> 10:06.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU WORKED ON THIS FOR SIX

10:06.939 --> 10:08.341 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MONTHS; WHY FOCUS ON ATLANTIC

10:08.341 --> 10:08.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITY?

10:08.774 --> 10:09.742 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, ATLANTIC CITY, TO A LOT

10:09.742 --> 10:10.676 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF US, THINK... WE THINK

10:10.676 --> 10:12.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASINOS, THE TRUMP TAJ MAHAL, ET

10:12.979 --> 10:13.879 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CETERA, ET CETERA.

10:13.879 --> 10:15.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE PEOPLE

10:15.147 --> 10:16.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT LIVE THERE.

10:16.182 --> 10:16.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO, THE CLIMATE CENTRAL

10:16.916 --> 10:18.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCIENTISTS ACTUALLY CONDUCTED

10:18.451 --> 10:19.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANALYSIS.

10:19.085 --> 10:20.252 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY LOOKED AT HUNDREDS OF U.S.

10:20.252 --> 10:23.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COASTAL CITIES AND EXAMINED THE

10:23.055 --> 10:24.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCREASE THAT ARE EXPECTED AND

10:24.390 --> 10:25.224 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FLOOD RISKS IN EACH OF

10:25.224 --> 10:25.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE.

10:25.958 --> 10:28.027 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY IDENTIFIED ABOUT 90 THAT

10:28.027 --> 10:29.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACE VERY SHARP INCREASES IN...

10:29.495 --> 10:30.763 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN FLOODING RISKS.

10:30.763 --> 10:31.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LOT OF THESE CITIES TEND TO BE

10:31.931 --> 10:33.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUILT ALONG BAYS, ALONG RIVERS,

10:33.199 --> 10:35.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEAR THE MOUTHS OF ESTUARIES, SO

10:35.001 --> 10:36.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY HAVE A VERY LOW TOPOGRAPHY.

10:36.869 --> 10:39.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE HIGHEST-RISK ONES TEND

10:39.271 --> 10:40.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE CLUSTERED ALONG THE MID-

10:40.506 --> 10:41.440 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATLANTIC.

10:41.440 --> 10:42.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ATLANTIC CITY SIMPLY SHOWED

10:42.575 --> 10:43.843 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UP AS BEING ONE OF THE CITIES

10:43.843 --> 10:46.278 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT FACES THE GREATEST RISKS.

10:46.278 --> 10:47.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT, IT ALSO

10:47.913 --> 10:50.016 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS THIS GREAT INEQUITY AMONG

10:50.016 --> 10:51.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RICH AND THE POOR THAT...

10:51.550 --> 10:52.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S A CITY THAT'S IN ECONOMIC

10:52.685 --> 10:54.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECLINE RIGHT NOW, SO I WANTED

10:54.253 --> 10:55.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO EXAMINE HOW... HOW THEY'RE

10:55.821 --> 10:57.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADAPTING TO... TO THE CHANGES

10:57.123 --> 10:58.224 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN... IN SEA LEVEL THERE.

10:58.224 --> 10:58.924 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: YOU ALSO TOOK

10:58.924 --> 10:59.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIDEO IN YOUR ARTICLE.

10:59.825 --> 11:00.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I KNOW YOU SPENT SIX MONTHS

11:00.860 --> 11:01.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORKING ON THIS PROJECT.

11:01.727 --> 11:03.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S A PIECE OF SOUND THAT WE

11:03.396 --> 11:04.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE FROM ONE OF THE RESIDENTS

11:04.263 --> 11:04.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE.

11:04.797 --> 11:06.198 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LET'S TAKE A LISTEN TO HER.

11:06.198 --> 11:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT WASN'T THAT BAD.

11:07.266 --> 11:08.334 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WASN'T BAD WHEN YOU FIRST

11:08.334 --> 11:11.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOVED IN HERE.

11:11.203 --> 11:12.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS EIGHT INCHES BEFORE.

11:12.571 --> 11:13.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANOTHER TEN INCHES, IT'S GOING

11:13.406 --> 11:15.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE IN THE HOUSE.

11:15.041 --> 11:16.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO

11:16.008 --> 11:18.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUT A WASHER AND DRIER UP.

11:18.577 --> 11:19.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S ALL REPLACEABLE, BUT IT'S

11:19.679 --> 11:21.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY HARD AND VERY INCONVENIENT.

11:21.981 --> 11:24.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND MONEY, YOU KNOW.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: THIS IS NOT

11:25.051 --> 11:26.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFTER HURRICANE SANDY.

11:26.786 --> 11:27.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS WAS AFTER WHAT KIND OF

11:27.987 --> 11:28.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEATHER?

11:28.621 --> 11:30.356 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THIS... WHEN THERE'S A... A

11:30.356 --> 11:31.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FULL MOON OR A NEW MOON, YOU GET

11:31.957 --> 11:32.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIGHER TIDES THAN AT NORMAL

11:32.892 --> 11:34.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIMES.

11:34.026 --> 11:35.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST YESTERDAY, I WAS RETWEETING

11:35.561 --> 11:36.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME PICTURES FROM THIS STREET,

11:36.662 --> 11:38.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARIZONA AVENUE, ATLANTIC AVENUE,

11:38.197 --> 11:39.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WERE FLOODING SIMPLY

11:39.131 --> 11:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THERE WAS A HIGH TIDE

11:40.700 --> 11:42.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASSOCIATED WITH A FULL MOON.

11:42.635 --> 11:43.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THE SAME TIME, THERE WAS A

11:43.335 --> 11:44.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STORM.

11:44.603 --> 11:46.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE STORMS PUSH WATER FROM THE

11:46.639 --> 11:48.207 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COAST TOWARDS THE LAND.

11:48.207 --> 11:49.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, YOU HAVE THE TIDE ACTUALLY

11:49.408 --> 11:51.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RISING UP IN THE STREET, COMING

11:51.143 --> 11:52.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGH THE STORM WATER DRAINS.

11:52.678 --> 11:53.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THE SAME TIME AS THAT, YOU

11:53.612 --> 11:55.347 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE HEAVY RAIN-- OR EVEN ANY

11:55.347 --> 11:56.982 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RAIN-- AND THE RAIN CAN'T DRAIN

11:56.982 --> 11:57.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AWAY.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, WHAT YOU GET IS VERY

11:58.718 --> 12:00.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUBSTANTIAL FLOODING IN SOME OF

12:00.486 --> 12:01.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE

12:01.387 --> 12:02.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

12:03.189 --> 12:04.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT WAS THE CASE IN THE

12:04.056 --> 12:04.890 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

12:05.624 --> 12:06.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE GETTING USED TO THIS AS A

12:06.859 --> 12:08.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACT OF LIFE ON-- IF THE

12:08.861 --> 12:10.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CIRCUMSTANCES ARE RIGHT,

12:10.296 --> 12:11.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASICALLY A FULL MOON AND A

12:11.297 --> 12:12.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEAVY RAIN OR STORM, AND IT'S

12:12.631 --> 12:13.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVER.

12:13.432 --> 12:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THIS CAN HAPPEN... THIS IS

12:14.200 --> 12:15.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENING MONTHLY.

12:15.401 --> 12:16.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS HAPPENING ALL THE TIME.

12:16.435 --> 12:17.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RESIDENTS HAVE THEIR OWN

12:17.336 --> 12:18.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYSTEMS FOR DEALING WITH IT.

12:18.537 --> 12:19.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ALERT EACH OTHER WHEN THEY

12:19.905 --> 12:20.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEE THE WATERS RISING.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY... THEY'VE ALL LOST CARS.

12:22.508 --> 12:23.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY... THEY MOVE THEIR CARS.

12:23.542 --> 12:24.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY PARK THEM IN A GARAGE IN

12:24.844 --> 12:27.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DOWNTOWN AREA OR ON HIGHER

12:27.379 --> 12:28.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAND.

12:28.681 --> 12:30.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY PUT THEIR FURNITURE UP ON

12:30.716 --> 12:31.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON BLOCKS.

12:31.350 --> 12:32.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY TAKE PRECAUTIONS BECAUSE

12:32.718 --> 12:34.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'VE ALL EXPERIENCED SERIOUS

12:34.019 --> 12:35.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FLOODS, AND SO THEY JUST TAKE

12:35.621 --> 12:36.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEASURES TO... TO MINIMIZE

12:36.555 --> 12:38.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE... THE IMPACT EACH TIME IT

12:38.624 --> 12:39.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FLOODS.

12:39.191 --> 12:39.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT DOES

12:39.825 --> 12:40.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS DO TO THE PROPERTY VALUE?

12:40.659 --> 12:41.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'M IMAGINING RIGHT NOW, AFTER I

12:41.961 --> 12:42.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEE THIS STORY, OR AT LEAST

12:42.995 --> 12:44.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE

12:44.063 --> 12:45.464 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOKING FOR, I'M NOT GOING TO

12:45.464 --> 12:46.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUY A HOUSE THAT'S ON THAT

12:46.565 --> 12:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STREET.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO, THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

12:48.033 --> 12:49.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE, IF THEY CAN'T SELL IT...

12:49.802 --> 12:51.370 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> AND SO, IT'S NOT ONLY THAT

12:51.370 --> 12:52.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S UNAPPEALING BECAUSE IT'S

12:52.338 --> 12:53.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FLOODING, BUT ATLANTIC CITY IS

12:53.939 --> 12:55.274 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN SUCH SERIOUS ECONOMIC

12:55.274 --> 12:55.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECLINE.

12:55.708 --> 12:56.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT HAD 5% OF THE POPULATION

12:56.942 --> 12:59.879 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEAVE JUST OVER THE LAST DECADE.

12:59.879 --> 13:01.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL OF THE JOBS ARE DRYING UP.

13:01.380 --> 13:02.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TECH SPACE IS DRYING UP.

13:02.481 --> 13:03.749 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOBODY WANTS TO BE BUYING

13:03.749 --> 13:05.251 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROPERTY IN ATLANTIC CITY, LET

13:05.251 --> 13:06.552 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALONE IN THESE REALLY VULNERABLE

13:06.552 --> 13:07.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AREAS.

13:07.553 --> 13:09.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND OVER THE LAST 12 MONTHS, TWO

13:09.789 --> 13:10.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOUSES IN THIS ONE-BLOCK

13:10.723 --> 13:12.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STREET THAT I WENT TO, ARIZONA

13:12.258 --> 13:13.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AVENUE, TWO OF THEM HAVE SOLD

13:13.859 --> 13:15.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR LESS THAN $35,000 EACH.

13:15.895 --> 13:16.962 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT

13:16.962 --> 13:18.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESIDENTS WHO ARE SOME OUT OF

13:18.030 --> 13:20.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORK, ALL OF THEIR EQUITY IS

13:20.132 --> 13:21.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIED UP IN THEIR HOUSE.

13:21.167 --> 13:23.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY NOW HAVE NO EQUITY LEFT.

13:23.035 --> 13:24.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY CAN'T SELL THEIR HOUSE.

13:24.436 --> 13:25.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DON'T HAVE WORK IN ATLANTIC

13:25.337 --> 13:25.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITY.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WANT TO MOVE, BUT THEY

13:27.006 --> 13:27.840 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN'T SELL THEIR PROPERTY.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY... THEY FEEL VERY TRAPPED.

13:29.875 --> 13:31.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME OF THEM REALLY EXPRESSED

13:31.977 --> 13:33.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME VERY STRONG EMOTIONS TO ME.

13:33.512 --> 13:34.346 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY FEEL STUCK.

13:34.346 --> 13:35.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: ISN'T THE ARMY

13:36.515 --> 13:37.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENT PART OF THE SAME TOWN

13:37.850 --> 13:39.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR THE SAME CITY TO TRY TO SHORE

13:39.151 --> 13:40.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UP THE DEFENSES TO DOWNTOWN?

13:40.619 --> 13:41.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SURE.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, USING SANDY RECOVERY FUNDS,

13:44.623 --> 13:46.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ARMY CORPS IS ENGAGING TWO

13:46.492 --> 13:47.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

CITY.

13:53.599 --> 13:55.334 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE IS IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S A BIG SEAWALL THAT'S

13:56.368 --> 13:57.870 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEING BUILT TO PROTECT THE

13:57.870 --> 13:59.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASINOS AND THE DOWNTOWN AREA.

13:59.471 --> 14:02.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE ALSO ABOUT TO SPEND TENS

14:02.241 --> 14:03.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON SAND

MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, OFTEN

14:09.348 --> 14:10.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OCCUPIED ONLY DURING THE SUMMER.

14:10.916 --> 14:12.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE ARE HOLIDAY HOUSES.

14:12.585 --> 14:13.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THEY'RE GETTING PROTECTIONS

14:13.619 --> 14:14.420 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE ACTUALLY

14:14.420 --> 14:15.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUED TO TRY TO PREVENT THE

14:15.454 --> 14:16.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROJECT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT

14:16.856 --> 14:18.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO LOSE THEIR VIEWS.

14:18.157 --> 14:19.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, ALL AROUND THESE RESIDENTS,

14:19.458 --> 14:20.626 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY CAN SEE THE FEDERAL

RESIDENTS OF... OF ATLANTIC CITY

14:25.931 --> 14:27.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE GETTING NOTHING.

HAVE AN INTERACTIVE MAP ON THE

SITE-- JUST VERY INTERESTING--

14:32.705 --> 14:34.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT POINTS OUT HOW THIS IS

14:34.506 --> 14:35.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENING IN DIFFERENT COASTAL

14:35.474 --> 14:36.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ALMOST IN EVERY ONE OF THOSE

14:51.657 --> 14:53.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACES, OBVIOUSLY, IT'S GETTING

14:53.058 --> 14:53.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORSE.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

GREATEST RISKS.

15:01.166 --> 15:02.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO BE

15:02.401 --> 15:02.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SERIOUS HERE.

15:02.968 --> 15:04.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE TO STOP PUTTING SO MUCH

15:04.336 --> 15:05.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLLUTION INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S CAUSING THE SEAS TO RISE.

15:07.006 --> 15:08.274 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WE NEED TO TAKE MEASURES

15:08.274 --> 15:09.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO... TO STOP THAT.

15:09.475 --> 15:11.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT EVEN IF WE... EVEN IF WE

15:11.010 --> 15:12.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STOP POLLUTING THE ATMOSPHERE

15:12.177 --> 15:14.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOMORROW, WE'VE LOCKED IN SO

15:14.246 --> 15:16.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUCH SEA LEVEL RISE AT THIS

DISASTER THAT WE'VE BEGUN, THAT

15:19.251 --> 15:21.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE STILL GOING TO SEE THE

15:21.220 --> 15:22.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RISKS INCREASING VERY

15:22.621 --> 15:23.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DRAMATICALLY IN A NUMBER OF

15:29.862 --> 15:30.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, WHEN YOU LOOK AT DOWNTOWN

15:30.963 --> 15:32.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIAMI, THESE CONDOS ARE VERY

15:32.498 --> 15:33.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

>> THE ONLY REASON THAT YOU CAN

THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS
