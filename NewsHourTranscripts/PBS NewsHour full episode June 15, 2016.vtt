GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill.

00:05.505 --> 00:07.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: As
details of the Orlando massacre
become clear,

00:12.546 --> 00:15.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
focus shifts away from the
killer and toward
his wife.

00:15.515 --> 00:20.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Wednesday:
a look at the Donald Trump
effect. The presumptive

00:20.554 --> 00:26.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nominee isn't backing down, even
when his
party disagrees -- what this
means for his

00:26.493 --> 00:28.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
campaign and the GOP.

00:28.362 --> 00:34.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Plus, a "NewsHour"
exclusive:
After a two-year study, Stanford
researchers

00:34.067 --> 00:37.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
find shocking racial injustices
by the Oakland
Police Department.

00:37.871 --> 00:42.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REBECCA HETEY, Stanford
University: Even when
we took out stops that resulted
in arrests,

00:42.342 --> 00:49.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we found that one in four black
men, for example,
were handcuffed, compared to one
in 15 white

00:49.216 --> 00:50.450 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
men.

00:50.484 --> 00:58.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:58.125 --> 01:01.061 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:01.094 --> 01:10.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Investigators in
Orlando worked
today to reconstruct the
movements of the

01:10.203 --> 01:17.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gunman who killed 49 people over
the weekend.
Omar Mateen died in a gun battle
with police,

01:17.210 --> 01:19.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after the massacre at a gay
nightclub.

01:19.646 --> 01:24.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Authorities working the crime
scene today
said they need to know what
Mateen did before

01:24.651 --> 01:30.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the attack. They wouldn't
confirm that his
wife knew of the plot and might
be charged.

01:30.290 --> 01:36.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEE BENTLEY, U.S. Attorney: I am
not going
to speculate today as to any
charges that

01:36.163 --> 01:43.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
may be brought or indeed about
whether any
charges will be brought in this
case. It is

01:44.004 --> 01:46.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
premature to do so.

01:46.106 --> 01:53.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would interfere and hamper
the investigation
to put out premature information
about where

01:53.780 --> 01:55.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the investigation is headed.

01:55.882 --> 02:01.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Orlando's mayor
said today
that investigators do know that
Mateen visited

02:01.221 --> 02:04.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
several locations Saturday
night. He didn't
elaborate.

02:04.858 --> 02:09.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Senate Democrats
launched a filibuster
today, demanding tougher gun
controls in the

02:10.030 --> 02:15.135 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
aftermath of Orlando.
Connecticut Senator
Chris Murphy and several others
spent much

02:15.168 --> 02:19.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the day calling for a vote on
barring gun
sales to people on the terrorist
watch-list.

02:19.873 --> 02:23.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D),
Connecticut: In the
face of mass slaughter after
mass slaughter,

02:23.310 --> 02:28.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this body has taken absolutely
no action.

02:28.582 --> 02:32.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I know that times are tough
here. I know
that we're often at each others'
throats,

02:32.652 --> 02:38.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but that, in and of itself, is
unacceptable.
Let's find some limited common
ground on issues

02:38.792 --> 02:44.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that the broad American
electorate support,
and let's move forward on it.

02:44.231 --> 02:49.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Meanwhile,
Republican presidential
candidate Donald Trump told a
rally in Atlanta,

02:49.870 --> 02:55.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
carnage could have been avoided
if some of
the Orlando victims had
themselves been carrying

02:55.409 --> 02:57.177 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
guns.

02:57.210 --> 02:59.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
If the bullets were going in the
other direction,

02:59.079 --> 03:06.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aimed at this guy who was just
open target
practice, you would've had a
situation, folks,

03:06.720 --> 03:14.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which would've been always
horrible, but nothing
like the carnage that we all, as
a people,

03:14.394 --> 03:16.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
suffered this weekend.

03:16.263 --> 03:20.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Trump said he will
meet with the
National Rifle Association to
discuss tying

03:20.667 --> 03:27.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gun sales to the terror watch
and no-fly lists.
In response, the NRA says it
supports delaying

03:27.441 --> 03:33.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gun sales to terror suspects for
72 hours,
but it wants a way to take
people off the

03:33.580 --> 03:36.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
watch list, if they're wrongly
accused.

03:36.149 --> 03:42.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Another tragedy
played out
in the Orlando area today, after
an alligator

03:42.089 --> 03:47.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
snatched and killed a 2-year-old
boy at Walt
Disney World. It happened
Tuesday evening

03:47.761 --> 03:53.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the Seven Seas Lagoon, as the
boy was wading
near shore. Police reported that
search teams

03:53.967 --> 03:59.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
found the body today and that it
was intact.
The resort closed all its
beaches.

03:59.406 --> 04:05.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The wreckage of a
missing EgyptAir
plane has been spotted deep in
the Mediterranean

04:05.812 --> 04:11.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sea. Egyptian officials say they
have identified
several main locations on the
ocean floor.

04:11.852 --> 04:17.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The flight disappeared on May
19, killing
all 66 people on board. The
cause of the crash

04:17.357 --> 04:19.092 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
remains unclear.

04:19.126 --> 04:23.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Federal
Reserve left a
key short-term interest rate
unchanged today,

04:24.030 --> 04:28.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in light of an uncertain jobs
picture. In
a statement, the central bank
said -- quote

04:28.368 --> 04:33.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- "The labor market has slowed,
while growth
in economic activity appears to
have picked

04:33.673 --> 04:34.474 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up."

04:34.508 --> 04:36.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Fed Chair Janet Yellen
elaborated:

04:36.543 --> 04:40.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANET YELLEN, Federal Reserve
Chair: Although
recent labor market data have,
on balance,

04:40.814 --> 04:47.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
been disappointing, it's
important not to
overreact to one or two monthly
readings.

04:47.821 --> 04:52.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The committee continues to
expect that the
labor market will strengthen
further over

04:52.692 --> 04:58.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the next few years. That said,
we will be
watching the job market
carefully.

04:58.532 --> 05:04.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yellen said Fed
policy-makers
are also watching for any
economic fallout

05:04.304 --> 05:08.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from Britain's vote next week on
whether to
stay in the European Union.

05:08.275 --> 05:14.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Fed's news
failed to reassure
Wall Street, as stocks fell for
a fifth day.

05:14.114 --> 05:21.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 34 points
to close at 17640. The Nasdaq
gave up eight

05:21.388 --> 05:24.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
points, and the S&amp;P 500 dropped
nearly four.

05:24.090 --> 05:28.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
met with the
Dalai Lama today, despite
China's warnings

05:29.029 --> 05:35.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that it would damage
U.S.-Chinese ties. Beijing
accuses the spiritual leader of
Tibet's Buddhists

05:35.802 --> 05:41.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of campaigning to split the
region from China.
The White House released a photo
of the meeting,

05:41.374 --> 05:43.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but allowed no other coverage.

05:43.176 --> 05:46.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Medical news on two
fronts today.

05:46.513 --> 05:51.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The World Health Organization
now says there's
no conclusive evidence that
drinking coffee

05:51.585 --> 05:58.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
causes cancer. That reverses a
25-year-old
warning. Instead, the WHO says
the real issue

05:58.058 --> 06:04.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is temperature. If you routinely
drink anything
that's very hot, about 150
degrees or more,

06:04.197 --> 06:08.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there's limited evidence it
could lead to
cancer of the esophagus.

06:08.034 --> 06:14.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A major city in
southern India
is on high alert for polio after
an active

06:14.140 --> 06:21.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strain was found in sewage
water. The alert
in Hyderabad means about 350,000
children

06:21.147 --> 06:26.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will be vaccinated next week.
India was declared
free of polio in 2014.

06:26.553 --> 06:32.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And astronomers have
picked up
new echoes of two black holes
crashing into

06:32.525 --> 06:38.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
each other deep in space. The
collision generated
a gravitational wave that gave
off a high-pitched

06:38.698 --> 06:44.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chirp. It's only the second time
that Earth-based
instruments have detected a
gravitational

06:44.037 --> 06:47.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wave, and it helps prove the
first time wasn't
a fluke.

06:47.340 --> 06:52.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
Donald Trump takes an unexpected
stance on

06:52.245 --> 06:59.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gun control; a new report
detailing racial
bias by the Oakland California
police; how

06:59.319 --> 07:06.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the Muslim community is
responding to the
attack in Orlando; and much
more.

07:06.626 --> 07:20.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: No matter which side
you are on,
the 2016 campaign is already on
the books

07:20.874 --> 07:26.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as one of the most unusual in
modern history.
Just this week, Donald Trump,
Hillary Clinton

07:26.479 --> 07:31.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and President Obama have offered
a preview
of what's to come, with attacks,
counterattacks,

07:31.885 --> 07:36.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and harsh disagreement over
policy, both foreign
and domestic.

07:36.456 --> 07:42.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From guns, to refugees, to
immigration, it
has turned into a campaign like
no other.

07:42.195 --> 07:44.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Call it the Trump effect.

07:44.064 --> 07:49.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining us to explain the hows
and whys, Trump
senior campaign adviser Barry
Bennett, Wall

07:49.669 --> 07:55.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Street Journal political
reporter Beth Reinhard,
and pollster J. Ann Selzer.

07:55.275 --> 08:00.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ann Selzer, you just completed a
poll with
Bloomberg Politics that was
released yesterday.

08:00.280 --> 08:04.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tell me, is there anything in
there to support
my notion that there is a Trump
effect this

08:04.517 --> 08:06.286 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year?

08:06.319 --> 08:08.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
J. ANN SELZER, Selzer &amp; Company,
Inc.: Well,
there are a couple of things in
there, Gwen.

08:08.621 --> 08:14.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, what we see
happening right
now is a 12-point lead for
Hillary Clinton

08:14.260 --> 08:21.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over Donald Trump, 49 to 37.
That's a substantial
lead, and polls recently have
been showing

08:21.801 --> 08:26.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this a tighter race than that.
So the Trump
effect for right now, overall,
doesn't appear

08:26.906 --> 08:28.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be a winning position.

08:28.708 --> 08:33.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, secondly, you asked about
whether this
is a race like no other, and
pollsters have

08:33.913 --> 08:38.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
been going through their
archives trying to
find some little piece of data
to shine a

08:38.818 --> 08:45.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
light on that. And I found one
today. If you
look at the proportion of
Republicans who

08:45.125 --> 08:50.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have unfavorable feelings toward
Donald Trump,
it's 27 percent.

08:50.196 --> 08:53.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you might think, well, this
is just a
year that everybody hates
everybody. The number

08:53.800 --> 08:59.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is 15 percent for Hillary
Clinton. That's
looking just at Democratic
voters. But I went

08:59.172 --> 09:04.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back to our archives to see,
four years ago,
what was the situation with Mitt
Romney, because

09:04.677 --> 09:08.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
maybe you think Republicans
always have -- there
is a substantial group that are
unhappy with

09:08.948 --> 09:11.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their nominee. It was 11
percent.

09:11.918 --> 09:17.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So Donald Trump, even within the
confines
of his own party, is turning off
a substantial

09:17.791 --> 09:20.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
number of people there, and
that's a Trump
effect, too.

09:20.126 --> 09:24.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Barry Bennett, he's
also turning
on a substantial amount of
people. How do

09:24.130 --> 09:28.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you measure that? How do you
weigh that against
each other?

09:28.234 --> 09:31.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRY BENNETT, Trump Campaign
Senior Adviser:
Well, I think, typically, a
candidate comes

09:31.137 --> 09:35.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a race and he comes within
the four out
of four voters and the three out
of four voters,

09:35.742 --> 09:39.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and you fight the campaign over
the two out
of four voters.

09:39.679 --> 09:43.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's kind of the inverse this
cycle. Right?
He comes with a bunch of the
folks who are

09:43.950 --> 09:48.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not traditional voters, not
traditional Republican
voters. In fact, in Youngstown,
Ohio, for

09:48.254 --> 09:52.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
instance, in January, there were
16,000 registered
Republicans. Today, that number
is 38,000.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a huge shift. Now, these
three out of
fours...

09:55.128 --> 09:55.929 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

09:55.962 --> 09:56.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In an important
state.

09:56.896 --> 09:58.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BARRY BENNETT: IN a very
important state.

09:58.865 --> 10:04.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
These three-fours and
four-fours, which supported
somebody else in the primary,
they will come

10:04.137 --> 10:05.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
home. It will take some time,
but they will
come home.

10:06.005 --> 10:08.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You have covered
more -- you have
been to this rodeo before, Beth,
so as you

10:08.975 --> 10:13.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
compare this to previous
campaigns, what to
you is the most significant
difference?

10:13.980 --> 10:17.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Beth Reinhard, The Wall Street
Journal: There
is very little that's familiar
about this

10:17.917 --> 10:23.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
race. Donald Trump has not just
rewritten
the rule book, but taken the old
one, burnt

10:23.823 --> 10:26.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it, thrown it in the ocean.

10:26.559 --> 10:31.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everything about how he runs his
campaign
and how he conducts himself is
unlike anything

10:31.197 --> 10:35.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have ever seen before. The
way he interacts
with the media is...

10:35.068 --> 10:36.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Or not.

10:37.003 --> 10:42.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETH REINHARD: Or not. In that
case, disqualifying
reporters from covering him
based on stories

10:42.742 --> 10:45.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he doesn't like, we haven't seen
that before.

10:45.845 --> 10:50.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The way he calls in to so many
of the television
networks and really is just
running his own

10:50.850 --> 10:57.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
media operation on television
and on Twitter
is unlike anything we have seen
before.

10:57.090 --> 11:01.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Ann, we know that
Americans still
think largely the country is on
the wrong

11:01.694 --> 11:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
track. Is that also a number,
which we watch
very carefully every four years,
is that something

11:07.267 --> 11:11.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which could also maybe speak to
the kind of
effect that Donald Trump is
having, something

11:11.905 --> 11:13.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that he can take advantage of?

11:13.740 --> 11:18.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
J. ANN SELZER: Well, our poll is
showing that
the percent of people showing
that the nation

11:18.144 --> 11:23.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is headed off in the wrong
direction has reached
one of its highest points since
we started

11:23.383 --> 11:25.885 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
polling in 2009.

11:25.919 --> 11:32.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there's a lot of discomfort
at the national
level. That's usually a
reflection on the

11:32.592 --> 11:38.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
view of the president. And,
actually, Barack
Obama's numbers were not so
terrible in our

11:39.032 --> 11:44.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
poll. So there sort of is this
breaking apart
of the things that we used to
think hung together

11:44.771 --> 11:48.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and gave you a pretty clear view
of the way
the nation was heading.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.143 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Not so anymore.

11:50.176 --> 11:53.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Barry Bennett, there
are all these
contradictions. The perfect
example today

11:53.913 --> 11:59.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is Donald Trump says that he's
going to speak
to the NRA about changing the
no-fly lists

11:59.786 --> 12:04.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for gun purchases, or who can
purchase guns,
which is something the NRA
objects to.

12:04.757 --> 12:10.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has also said he supports the
LGBT community
in the wake of Orlando, but not
that he supports

12:10.096 --> 12:15.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gay marriage. Is it -- is that
Americans can
hold two opposing thoughts in
their heads

12:15.568 --> 12:17.437 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at one time?

12:17.470 --> 12:20.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRY BENNETT: Well, I think
often in politics
we come up with this monolithic
view of things.

12:20.373 --> 12:23.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this cycle is a perfect
example of where
none of that is really true.
Right?

12:23.376 --> 12:27.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's no such thing as the
average Hispanic
voter, right? They're all over
the place.

12:27.814 --> 12:32.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some are faith-based. Some are
small business-based.
Some are family-based. Some are
just young

12:32.518 --> 12:34.320 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
progressives.

12:34.354 --> 12:39.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we're challenging all the
norms that we
have seen in campaigns. But I
think that the

12:39.659 --> 12:44.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tone of the country, the 45
percent of the
folks think we're going in the
wrong direction,

12:44.497 --> 12:49.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is an all-time record.
They have also
figured out they don't
necessarily have to

12:49.302 --> 12:54.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like or love the candidate for
president,
which we have always believed to
be true.

12:54.273 --> 12:58.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They want to someone who will go
to Washington
literally with a bulldozer's
license and just

12:58.044 --> 13:01.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fix things. And that's, I think,
what we're
seeing.

13:01.114 --> 13:04.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, otherwise, how could
Donald Trump's
approval rating, according to
Ann's poll,

13:04.651 --> 13:10.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be at 29 percent and his ballot
be in the
40s? It's not possible during
traditional

13:10.890 --> 13:12.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
political metrics. Right?

13:12.592 --> 13:15.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, there are no
traditional
political metrics which apply, I
think we

13:15.395 --> 13:17.163 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can all agree.

13:17.196 --> 13:20.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let me ask you, Beth, about
this, though.
We have -- it feels like we have
just lurched

13:20.800 --> 13:25.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into the general election
campaign. Maybe
Bernie Sanders is still in the
race, but it

13:25.538 --> 13:28.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't feel like that's what's
driving this
anymore.

13:28.875 --> 13:36.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so, how different is -- are
primary races,
aside from 17 people on the
Republican ticket

13:36.182 --> 13:40.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- how different are they from
general election
races, and does it matter in a
nontraditional

13:40.653 --> 13:42.455 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
year like this?

13:42.488 --> 13:47.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETH REINHARD: Donald Trump,
people keep saying
he's going to -- quote, unquote
-- "pivot"

13:47.060 --> 13:50.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the general election. And we
have all been
sitting on the edge of our seats
waiting for

13:50.363 --> 13:52.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that to happen, and it really
hasn't.

13:52.198 --> 13:59.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, he still talks about
rivals that
fell away months ago, as if he's
still reliving

13:59.072 --> 14:04.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those conquests. And, of course,
he has talked
quite a bit about Hillary as
well. But it

14:04.844 --> 14:10.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
does still have the feel of a
primary, in
that the rhetoric is just as
fury and just

14:10.083 --> 14:15.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as harsh as you see in a
primary, where people
are trying to appeal to that
fire-breathing

14:15.388 --> 14:17.123 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
base.

14:17.156 --> 14:21.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He hasn't really moderated his
tone, which
is what people expect once you
become the

14:21.494 --> 14:28.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nominee, that you're going to
try to reach
this wider audience with, you
know, more warmer

14:28.234 --> 14:33.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tones. Donald Trump is hitting
it as hard
as ever.

14:33.773 --> 14:37.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Ann Selzer, that
reminds me, yesterday,
the president came as close to
fire-breathing

14:37.944 --> 14:43.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as I guess he ever gets, in his
pretty full-throated,
without mentioning his name,
attack on Donald

14:43.883 --> 14:45.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump, the things that Donald
Trump stands
for.

14:45.651 --> 14:49.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time, am I right,
his approval
rating seems to be creeping up?

14:49.822 --> 14:55.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
J. ANN SELZER: Yes, his approval
rating is
creeping up. His favorability
numbers are

14:55.128 --> 14:59.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
creeping up. He's about on a par
with Bill
Clinton, who has usually
surpassed him a little

14:59.599 --> 15:01.367 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bit there.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, however, there are
things that are
still bothering the general
electorate as

15:04.704 --> 15:11.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they look at Donald Trump. We
tested a few
items, and half say they're
bothered a lot

15:11.310 --> 15:17.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
by Trump's ban on Muslim
immigrants, 55 percent
bothered a lot about comments he
made about

15:17.917 --> 15:24.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the judge ruling in the Trump
University case,
and 62 percent bothered a lot
about his tone

15:24.190 --> 15:28.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with women, 62 percent. That's
bothered a
lot. That's the strongest answer
they could

15:28.728 --> 15:31.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
give us. And it's 71 percent
among women.

15:31.764 --> 15:36.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the one last thing I want to
share with
you is that we know he can
change things if

15:36.235 --> 15:41.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he wants to. When we first were
polling on
Donald Trump here in Iowa a year
ago, his

15:41.741 --> 15:48.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
favorable-to-unfavorable ratio
was 2-to-1
unfavorable. And within the
course of a few

15:48.247 --> 15:54.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
months, he flipped it to where
it was 2-to-1
favorable to unfavorable. So,
he's done magic

15:54.954 --> 15:56.656 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
before.

15:56.689 --> 15:59.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, let me ask Barry
Bennett,
doing magic, how does he flip
those numbers?

15:59.725 --> 16:06.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRY BENNETT: Well, I think
when people hear
his policy positions, you could
either believe

16:06.165 --> 16:10.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what Hillary Clinton says about
his policies
or you can listen to him, that
they will come

16:10.603 --> 16:12.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to appreciate where he is.

16:12.438 --> 16:17.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, government is not
working. We know
precious little -- for instance,
this idea

16:17.977 --> 16:23.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of radical Islamism, we know
precious little
about what causes people to
radicalize. We

16:23.216 --> 16:26.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been dealing with this for
a number of
years now.

16:26.886 --> 16:32.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You would think that we would
have a better
understanding, we would have a
better screening,

16:32.458 --> 16:37.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a better watching and
calculation. But
all of our processes that the
government has

16:37.296 --> 16:39.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
put in place have not worked.

16:39.732 --> 16:42.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Do you think he's
been specific
enough about what the
alternative to that

16:42.735 --> 16:44.637 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is?

16:44.670 --> 16:46.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRY BENNETT: Well, you can
never be specific
enough. Right? That's what
campaigns are about.

16:46.505 --> 16:51.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, I mean, that's why we have
150-some days
to talk about it. But that's
what we're going

16:51.210 --> 16:55.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to talk about in the campaign.
But there are
just so many people in America
who are suffering

16:55.815 --> 17:01.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
real pain. And the current
policies of this
administration and even some of
the policies

17:01.254 --> 17:05.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the previous administration
just never
helped them. And that's what
we're going to

17:05.324 --> 17:07.159 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
talk about.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Barry Bennett,
senior Trump campaign
adviser, Beth Reinhard,
political reporter

17:09.262 --> 17:13.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for The Wall Street Journal, and
Ann Selzer,
the redoubtable Ann Selzer of
the Bloomberg

17:13.733 --> 17:23.676 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
poll, thank you all very much.

17:23.709 --> 17:31.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The police
department in Oakland,
California, has a long and
troubled history.

17:31.651 --> 17:37.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The most recent scandal to roil
the department
involves alleged sexual
misconduct by officers.

17:38.024 --> 17:44.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police chief Sean Whent resigned
last week
for reportedly mishandling that
situation.

17:44.330 --> 17:50.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are decades of tension
and mistrust
between officers and the
African-American

17:50.069 --> 17:51.837 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
community.

17:51.871 --> 17:55.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stanford University has been
studying that
often volatile relationship, and
the results

17:55.708 --> 17:59.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of its groundbreaking study were
released
today.

17:59.278 --> 18:03.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Jackie
Judd has our
exclusive report.

18:03.349 --> 18:10.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: The report confirms
what African-American
residents of Oakland,
California, have long

18:10.823 --> 18:17.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
known, seen and felt. Police
often treat them
very differently than white
residents.

REBECCA HETEY, Stanford
University: We found
a significant pattern of racial
disparities

18:21.901 --> 18:27.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in who was stopped, in who was
handcuffed,
in who was searched, and in who
was arrested.

18:27.440 --> 18:32.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Rebecca Hetey is a
Stanford University
researcher and an author of the
report.

18:32.912 --> 18:37.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBECCA HETEY: More importantly,
these disparities
remained significant after we
took into account

18:37.583 --> 18:42.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a wide range of factors that we
would expect
to influence police
decision-making, like

18:42.088 --> 18:44.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
crime rate, like neighborhood
demographics.

18:44.557 --> 18:48.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. MICHAEL MCBRIDE, Operation
Ceasefire:
It is an insult. And no one can
make me believe

18:48.494 --> 18:53.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that this would be happening in
any other
community, except for a
community that is

18:53.466 --> 18:55.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
defined by black, brown and poor
people.

18:55.835 --> 19:00.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Activists and
brothers Michael
and Ben McBride are longtime
critics of the

19:00.940 --> 19:02.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Oakland Police Department.

19:02.708 --> 19:04.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. BEN MCBRIDE, Operation
Ceasefire: We
have a broken relationship
because, while

19:04.877 --> 19:09.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there have been some steps
moving forward
to try to repair it, there still
has not been

19:09.615 --> 19:14.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the kind of honest discourse
that needs to
happen around truth and
reconciliation.

19:14.653 --> 19:21.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: According to the
most recent
FBI statistics, Oakland has more
violent crime

19:21.994 --> 19:29.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than any other U.S. city except
for Detroit
and Memphis. It was in this
supercharged atmosphere

19:29.168 --> 19:35.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that city officials took an
unprecedented
step. They decided to have
outsiders analyze

19:35.741 --> 19:40.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their officers' behavior,
knowing the results
wouldn't be pretty.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf:

19:42.681 --> 19:45.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIBBY SCHAAF, Mayor of Oakland,
California:
It is incredibly important that
we ask these

19:45.518 --> 19:51.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hard questions, so that we can
get to the
bottom of making the department
something

19:51.724 --> 19:56.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the community trusts and
that is, in
fact, bringing justice.

19:56.929 --> 20:03.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: So, this when I just
broke down the
entire stops into both race and
gender.

20:03.736 --> 20:09.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Researchers at
nearby Stanford
University spent two years
analyzing vast

20:09.041 --> 20:15.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amounts of data, field reports
from 28,000
stops officers made on the
streets and roads

20:15.815 --> 20:23.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
during a 13-month period, and
body-cam video
from 2,000 of those encounters.
They expected

20:23.522 --> 20:30.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to find about 7,800 stops of
African-Americans.
In fact, there were more than
double, almost

20:30.930 --> 20:32.531 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
17,000 stops.

20:32.565 --> 20:37.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What surprised everyone involved
even more
was the huge gap in handcuffing.

20:37.703 --> 20:42.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBECCA HETEY: Even when we took
out stops
that resulted in arrests, we
found that one

20:42.875 --> 20:48.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in four black men, for example,
were handcuffed,
compared to one in 15 white men.

20:48.881 --> 20:54.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Analysis of the
body-cam video
also found disparities. Lead
researcher Jennifer

20:55.020 --> 21:01.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Eberhardt says, while no racial
slurs were
uttered, certain words were used
far more

21:01.560 --> 21:05.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
frequently when an officer
questioned an African-American.

21:05.431 --> 21:08.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER EBERHARDT, Stanford
University: We
started by just looking at
linguistic patterns

21:08.834 --> 21:16.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in that footage. And we found,
for black stops,
words that are associated with
probation,

21:16.942 --> 21:21.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
parole, arrest, jail time, those
kinds of
things...

21:21.647 --> 21:25.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: So, there was an
assumption that
the black person who had been
stopped had

21:25.951 --> 21:27.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a criminal record?

21:27.720 --> 21:30.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER EBERHARDT: There was a
possibility
of that. In our discussions with
community

21:30.990 --> 21:34.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
members, there was a lot of
concern that there
are ways in which they're
stopped where there's

21:35.027 --> 21:36.595 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a suspicion of criminality.

21:36.629 --> 21:40.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, implicit bias can influence
us unintentionally.

21:40.132 --> 21:46.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Eberhardt is a
national expert
on implicit, or unconscious,
bias, and she

21:46.238 --> 21:50.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trains Oakland officers to
understand what
that means.

21:50.209 --> 21:56.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her cautiously worded report
suggests implicit
bias may be behind the racial
disparities

21:56.215 --> 22:02.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in police stops, along with the
police believing
this is the norm, this is what
their superiors

22:02.955 --> 22:10.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want them to do. The phrase
racial profiling,
which suggests overt racism, is
never used.

22:10.663 --> 22:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why is racial profiling such a
radioactive
phrase?

22:13.899 --> 22:16.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN WHENT, Former Oakland
Police Chief: I
think that race is a very
sensitive issue.

22:16.602 --> 22:22.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Former police Chief
Sean Whent,
who resigned last week for
reasons unrelated

22:22.274 --> 22:24.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the Stanford report.

22:24.143 --> 22:28.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN WHENT: Racial profiling, in
and of itself,
obviously is prohibited by our
policy. I mean,

22:28.247 --> 22:33.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it would be a misconduct issue.
The fact that
people are impacted by implicit
bias, that's

22:33.886 --> 22:35.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a different issue.

22:35.821 --> 22:40.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: So you are not
willing to say
that these findings would lead
you to a conclusion

22:40.292 --> 22:43.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that there is racial profiling
in Oakland?

22:43.128 --> 22:46.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN WHENT: I don't know how I
could credibly
say that, no, no racial
profiling is ever

22:46.765 --> 22:51.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- ever occurs here, although
what I don't
believe necessarily is that
these findings

22:51.303 --> 22:56.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
show that there's systemic
racial profiling
going on. I just think it's much
more complex

22:56.342 --> 22:58.077 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than that.

22:58.110 --> 23:02.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: I don't
care if it's
implicit or explicit. I want
bias gone. I

23:02.281 --> 23:07.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want it managed, and I want
people held accountable.
And the people have the right to
be able to

23:07.286 --> 23:10.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
live in a community where bias
is not overdetermining
their lives.

23:10.155 --> 23:15.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: The report is only
the latest
in a string of critical
evaluations since

23:15.427 --> 23:22.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the department came under
federal oversight
in 2003 because of police
misconduct.

23:22.034 --> 23:27.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the time, the department
agreed to adopt
dozens of reforms within a
five-year period

23:27.606 --> 23:33.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- 13 years and millions dollars
later, the
federal government is still
monitoring the

23:33.979 --> 23:36.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Oakland Police Department.

23:36.849 --> 23:42.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
City officials believe the
department is approaching
the day when that oversight will
end. And

23:42.388 --> 23:48.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there has been some progress
recently. Use
of excessive force, the number
of arbitrary

23:48.060 --> 23:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
searches and citizen complaints
have all declined.
And so has the crime rate
itself.

23:54.633 --> 24:00.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sergeant William Febel explains
that different
tactics are now used in
high-crime areas.

24:00.072 --> 24:03.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SGT. WILLIAM FEBEL, Oakland
Police Department:
So, we use intelligence-based
policing. When

24:03.108 --> 24:10.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we talk to folks in the area, we
like to particularly
speak with community members.
Community members

24:10.215 --> 24:15.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
help us identify the subjects
who out there
who are involved in criminal
activity.

24:15.587 --> 24:19.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: The Stanford report
includes
dozens of recommendations,
including more

24:19.925 --> 24:26.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
data collection, sustained
training, annual
review of each officer's stop
data, and regular

24:26.598 --> 24:30.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
community feedback on police
interactions.

24:30.836 --> 24:36.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police departments around the
country, including
those caught up in controversial
police shootings

24:36.241 --> 24:42.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like this one in Chicago, are
watching what
Oakland does now and how the
local community

24:42.214 --> 24:43.182 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
responds.

24:43.215 --> 24:46.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Paul Figueroa leads Oakland's
reform efforts.

24:46.452 --> 24:49.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL FIGUEROA, Interim Chief,
Oakland Police
Department: We're at a position
in reform,

24:49.755 --> 24:56.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
not only locally, but
nationally, that we're
finally getting to the point
where we have

24:56.662 --> 24:58.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the data, where we can take some
real action.

24:58.464 --> 25:02.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIBBY SCHAAF: I believe that, at
the end of
my term, people will be able to
say that this

25:02.868 --> 25:10.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
city really grappled honestly
with some very
difficult issues, like race,
like oppression,

25:10.409 --> 25:12.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like class differences.

25:12.244 --> 25:16.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: Every
mayor that we
have been in relationship with,
the last three

25:16.081 --> 25:21.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mayors, have all told us that:
We're working
as fast as we can, we're close,
we're close.

25:21.353 --> 25:26.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then they go out of office,
and then we
have to hear the exact same
rhetoric from

25:26.458 --> 25:28.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the sitting mayor.

25:28.227 --> 25:32.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER EBERHARDT: I think, on
all sides,
people want this relationship to
work right.

25:32.297 --> 25:37.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think African-Americans
especially don't
want to feel fearful of the
police, of the

25:37.169 --> 25:41.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who are supposed to
protect them. And
I think the police officers
don't want to

25:41.440 --> 25:45.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
feel like targeted. They don't
want to feel
like perpetrators of bias.

25:45.411 --> 25:52.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: At this roll call,
new recruits
join veteran officers as they
prepare for

25:52.451 --> 25:59.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their first shift of a very
tough job. With
this revealing report in hand,
commanders

25:59.091 --> 26:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will expect them to carry out
more even-handed
policing. And a wary community
will be watching.

26:07.299 --> 26:16.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour" this is
Jackie Judd
in Oakland, California.

26:16.975 --> 26:24.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

26:24.583 --> 26:29.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
efforts to boost
diversity in an elite high
school; and why

26:29.755 --> 26:34.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one author calls the Democratic
Party's policies
liberalism of the rich.

26:34.860 --> 26:40.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, first: how
the Muslim
community in Orlando is
responding to the

26:40.532 --> 26:42.367 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mass shooting.

26:42.401 --> 26:46.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As investigators continue to try
to understand
the motives of the Orlando
shooter, the fact

26:46.839 --> 26:53.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he was a Muslim has put
another community
of American Muslims in an
uncomfortable spot,

26:53.345 --> 26:58.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disavowing the actions of an
extremist, while
also facing a backlash
themselves.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the story.

27:00.552 --> 27:07.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As news broke
early Sunday
about the killings in Orlando,
Joshua Weil

27:07.259 --> 27:09.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thought what many Muslims
thought about the
attacker.

27:09.895 --> 27:15.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSHUA WEIL, Islamic Center of
Orlando: My
first thought is always, and
sadly, like,

27:15.701 --> 27:18.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
please don't let him be Muslim.

27:18.070 --> 27:21.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Weil is a
member of the
Islamic Center of Orlando, one
of the largest

27:21.707 --> 27:26.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Muslim mosques in this area. Of
course, news
quickly broke that the killer,
Omar Mateen,

27:26.578 --> 27:32.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was, in fact, a Muslim. The
attacks occurred
right after Saturday night's
Ramadan prayers.

27:32.451 --> 27:38.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOSHUA WEIL: The thought
occurred to me that,
if this guy was Muslim, he
probably just left

27:38.524 --> 27:42.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of these mosques. He might
even have left
this mosque. He might've been
standing and

27:42.494 --> 27:48.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
praying Taraweeh, like, standing
side-by-side
with his brothers and listening
to the Koran,

27:48.967 --> 27:52.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then he left that to go
murder all these
people.

27:52.137 --> 27:55.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Tariq Rasheed
is the imam
of this mosque.

27:55.440 --> 28:00.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TARIQ RASHEED, Imam, Islamic
Center of Orlando:
Every Muslim in this country and
in Orlando

28:00.279 --> 28:06.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is grieved. And they are in
shock. They are
asking questions, how can this
happen here

28:06.752 --> 28:12.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Orlando? How can a person
with Muslim faith
can do this?

28:12.491 --> 28:19.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you know, people are very
much in a shock,
I can tell you, everyone. And
then -- and

28:19.631 --> 28:24.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there is a fear factor as well,
that you know
there might be a backlash.

28:24.603 --> 28:28.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The mosque
held a candlelight
vigil for the shooting victims
the night after

28:28.774 --> 28:33.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the killings, and they have
publicly and repeatedly
condemned the attack, saying
Mateen's actions

28:33.245 --> 28:36.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are no reflection of their
religion.

28:36.181 --> 28:41.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Imam Rasheed says this is the
new reality
for the American-Muslim
community, having

28:41.653 --> 28:46.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to account for the violent
actions of a few
extremists who claim to share
their faith.

28:46.258 --> 28:51.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TARIQ RASHEED: We have nothing
to do with
this. We don't know who this guy
was, where

28:51.196 --> 28:59.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is he coming from, because
terrorism has no
religion. And, in religion,
there is no terrorism.

28:59.171 --> 29:03.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This is what
happened in
San Bernardino and what happened
at the military

29:03.041 --> 29:07.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
base in Texas, where one of
these events occur
and then the Muslim community is
called to

29:07.879 --> 29:12.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
condemn. Are you guys sick of
being asked
to condemn?

29:12.050 --> 29:14.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SYED QUADRI, Islamic Center of
Orlando: Absolutely.
Sick is the right word. We are
sick of this.

29:14.853 --> 29:19.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Syed Quadri
and his wife,
Rubana Khan, and their three
kids are members

29:19.524 --> 29:23.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of this mosque. Syed's a
psychiatrist and
Rubana is an accountant who
helps manage his

29:23.528 --> 29:25.230 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
practice.

29:25.263 --> 29:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUBANA KHAN, Islamic Center of
Orlando: I
actually was terrified and
finding out what

29:27.899 --> 29:31.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exactly happened. And of course,
our heart
goes out to all the mothers and
fathers who

29:31.970 --> 29:37.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have lost their kids. It's
unfortunate. And
it's terrible that these kinds
of incidents

29:37.409 --> 29:42.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are continuing to happen. And
it's putting
a bad name on the Muslim
community.

29:42.147 --> 29:48.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Many people
believe there
is something about Islam that
draws a paranoid,

29:48.520 --> 29:51.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
radicalized thinking. What do
you say to people
who think that that part -- that
that's part

29:51.923 --> 29:53.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and parcel of your faith?

29:53.825 --> 29:58.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SYED QUADRI: Well, I'm not going
to deny that.
There is radicalism in every
religion, I think,

29:58.930 --> 30:04.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know? Islam gets attention
because of
everything that's going around
in the world.

30:04.670 --> 30:09.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm not going to say these
people are
not radical Islamists.
Definitely, they are,

30:09.875 --> 30:12.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but they are not a part of
Islam.

30:12.344 --> 30:17.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We do not consider them Muslims.
We do not
consider them a part of Islam.
Islam is all

30:17.983 --> 30:21.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about peace, nothing to do with
hatred or
violence.

30:21.353 --> 30:25.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But these
repeated disavowals
haven't stopped the threats. The
mosque's

30:25.390 --> 30:29.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Facebook page, beneath its
tributes to the
victims, has been repeatedly
covered with

30:29.728 --> 30:34.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
death threats and angry
denunciations of Islam.
The mosque says they have
received similar

30:34.466 --> 30:36.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
voice-mail messages.

30:36.702 --> 30:41.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joshua Weil says most of these
are likely
just angry venting after the
attacks, but

30:41.106 --> 30:44.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some of them were simply too
specific to ignore.

30:44.109 --> 30:50.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSHUA WEIL: He see us parasites
at the Publix
at Hialeah all the time.

30:50.248 --> 30:52.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The grocery
store.

30:52.084 --> 30:55.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSHUA WEIL: Yes. The grocery
store on Hialeah
all the time, and that the next
time he sees

30:55.787 --> 30:58.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one of us, he's going to take
care of them.

30:58.657 --> 31:01.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that was the one that got us
most. We
contacted the police with that
one.

31:01.927 --> 31:05.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The mosque
alerted the police,
but now they have also hired an
armed guard

31:05.931 --> 31:12.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to patrol the grounds during
prayer services.

31:12.504 --> 31:17.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Imam Rasheed says Ramadan is
usually the busiest
time at the mosque, but now
people are afraid

31:17.309 --> 31:19.211 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to come.

31:19.244 --> 31:22.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TARIQ RASHEED: Sisters in the
community, they
texted me, you know what, I'm
not coming today.

31:23.014 --> 31:28.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, we are fearful. We
don't want to
come. And they didn't send their
children.

31:28.286 --> 31:34.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, we have never done
this. We have
never done this. And this mosque
has been

31:34.226 --> 31:37.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in operation for the last 32
years.

31:37.462 --> 31:42.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Weil says that
he and his
wife, Anna, who's also Muslim,
don't want

31:42.601 --> 31:48.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to give into fear, but he
understands it.
Weil is a teacher by day, and
also works as

31:48.440 --> 31:50.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an outreach director for the
mosque.

31:50.342 --> 31:56.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says, especially at times
like this, people
need to worship together, not
apart. But Anna

31:56.081 --> 32:00.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said, she thinks the anger out
there is serious
enough to stay away from the
mosque for now.

32:00.786 --> 32:07.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNA WEIL, Orlando Resident: We
have not gone
to the mosque for dinner, for
prayers or anything

32:07.626 --> 32:09.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
since the shooting happened.

32:09.294 --> 32:09.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You and the
kids?

32:09.961 --> 32:11.730 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ANNA WEIL: Yes.

32:11.763 --> 32:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Weil says
these attacks
have also shined a light on a
generational

32:14.666 --> 32:20.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
divide within the Muslim
community over the
issue of homosexuality.

32:20.405 --> 32:24.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says most of the younger
American-born
Muslims here have condemned the
attacks and

32:24.810 --> 32:30.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
embraced the gay community
that's been victimized
by this killer. But he says some
of the older

32:30.182 --> 32:35.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
generation, those largely born
abroad in much
more conservative societies,
have struggled

32:35.320 --> 32:37.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with how to respond.

32:37.155 --> 32:40.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSHUA WEIL: They want to
condemn this. They
want to -- they do believe it's
horrible and

32:40.125 --> 32:45.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they do think that it never
should've happened,
but they don't want to go as far
as to, you

32:45.597 --> 32:51.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, embrace or say that they
support homosexuality,
and they kind of feel that this
awkward place.

32:51.803 --> 32:57.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's almost been nice to see
some of them
reluctantly move in and say, no,
we see now

32:57.209 --> 32:59.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this is a community that we
should be supporting.

32:59.611 --> 33:05.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a community that faces
all of the
same bigotry and all of the
same, you know,

33:05.350 --> 33:07.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anger and aggression from many
of the same
people that we do.

33:07.686 --> 33:11.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
reverberations from
this attack have also spilled
onto the campaign

33:11.489 --> 33:17.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trail. Citing Orlando, Donald
Trump doubled
down on his call to ban Muslim
immigration,

33:17.362 --> 33:19.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
although the shooter was born in
New York
City.

33:19.664 --> 33:23.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama and some GOP
leaders have
again condemned that proposal.

33:23.568 --> 33:26.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is your response when you
hear some of
the political rhetoric that
happens -- that

33:26.838 --> 33:28.607 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
flows after attacks like this?

33:28.640 --> 33:32.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SYED QUADRI: It is unfortunate
that some people
take advantage of these kinds of
incidents.

33:32.410 --> 33:38.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, they are banking
on their votes.
They are trying to build their
political careers

33:38.350 --> 33:39.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out of all those. That's all I
can say.

33:39.851 --> 33:43.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUBANA KHAN: Well, I consider
myself an American
and an American Muslim.

33:43.288 --> 33:45.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SYED QUADRI: Absolutely.

33:45.056 --> 33:48.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUBANA KHAN: So, and I -- it
hurts that if
somebody would try to take that
away from

33:48.927 --> 33:54.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me, because this is my country.
This is where
I grew up. So, when you tell me
to leave,

33:54.065 --> 33:55.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where am I supposed to go? You
give me an
answer.

33:55.667 --> 33:56.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SYED QUADRI: That's right.
That's right.

33:56.601 --> 33:58.403 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUBANA KHAN: This is my home.

33:58.436 --> 34:04.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Muslim
community here
hopes the anger directed at them
will soon

34:04.643 --> 34:10.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
subside and that the whole
Orlando community
can continue its slow process of
healing from

34:10.315 --> 34:11.650 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this tragedy.

34:11.683 --> 34:23.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham
in Orlando, Florida.

GWEN IFILL: As the school year
nears its end,
a number of highly selective
public high schools

34:37.509 --> 34:42.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
around the country are
struggling to deal
with a longer-term problem, how
to enroll

34:42.314 --> 34:44.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more students of color.

34:44.149 --> 34:48.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Spencer
Michels looks
at one such school, in this
report produced

34:48.853 --> 34:56.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in association with Education
Week. It's part
of our weekly series, Making the
Grade.

34:56.394 --> 35:05.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: Lowell High
School in San
Francisco excels in everything
from music

35:05.670 --> 35:12.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to math. Motivated, hard-driving
and talented
students have propelled this
four-year institution

35:12.811 --> 35:16.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the top tier of national
public school
rankings.

35:17.015 --> 35:24.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Its graduates include
scientists, politicians,
entertainers and a Supreme Court
justice.

35:24.622 --> 35:27.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chrislyn Earle, here in a
psychology class,
is a senior.

35:28.026 --> 35:32.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISLYN EARLE, Student: I
wouldn't imagine
myself at any other school, to
be honest.

35:32.197 --> 35:37.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This school really builds you
for the next
step and the next chapter in
your life.

35:37.535 --> 35:42.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: But there is
something missing
at Lowell, more students like
Earle from historically

35:43.008 --> 35:50.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disadvantaged minority groups.
She is one
of a very small and dwindling
number of African-Americans,

35:50.148 --> 35:56.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about 2 percent of the student
body. Latinos
make up about 10 percent, while
Asians comprise

35:56.354 --> 36:00.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
57 percent, and whites, also
dwindling, at
14 percent.

36:00.925 --> 36:05.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN POLANCO, Student: I think
the people
who are minorities at this
school feel left

36:05.563 --> 36:09.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out. And it is hard to find a
place in this
school. Like, my freshman year,
I wanted to

36:09.934 --> 36:11.770 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
transfer.

36:11.803 --> 36:14.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KADEE SYLLA, Student: I wanted
to leave immediately.
I wanted to go to Balboa
instead, because

36:14.472 --> 36:16.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know that there's -- it's more
diverse over
there.

36:16.908 --> 36:21.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: That issue came
to a head
this spring when a non-black
student put up

36:21.479 --> 36:28.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a poster that drew the ire of
many at Lowell.
Titled Black History Month, it
glorified black

36:28.386 --> 36:34.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rappers and movies, lampooned
President Obama,
and failed to mention
historically important

36:34.726 --> 36:36.528 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
figures.

36:36.561 --> 36:40.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
African-American students walked
out of class
and marched to city hall to
protest.

36:40.665 --> 36:44.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISLYN EARLE: The poster was
the straw that
broke the camel's back.

36:44.436 --> 36:47.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: Earle lives
with her mother,
Shronda Jackson (ph).

36:47.605 --> 36:53.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISLYN EARLE: The whole main
purpose of
the walkout is the students at
Lowell and

36:53.144 --> 36:59.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
staff members were not
respectful to the black
culture. We were trying to
explain that we

36:59.617 --> 37:04.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are more than just our music and
the movies
and entertainment. This is not
OK and it's

37:04.756 --> 37:06.491 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very insulting.

37:06.524 --> 37:10.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: Earle didn't
expect that
when she took a test and applied
to Lowell,

37:10.662 --> 37:12.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which is a free public school.

37:12.297 --> 37:17.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: When we received the
letter that she
was accepted, I was ecstatic.

37:17.068 --> 37:22.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: But Earle says
she didn't
realize how few
African-Americans she'd meet.

37:22.340 --> 37:27.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISLYN EARLE: It didn't really
soak in until
I got inside the classroom, and
I was the

37:27.512 --> 37:29.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
only black person in there.

37:29.414 --> 37:34.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: Diversity and
how to achieve
it is a hot topic at Boston
Latin, a selective

37:34.352 --> 37:40.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
public high school in
Massachusetts, at Stuyvesant
in New York, and at other elite
schools, many

37:40.758 --> 37:42.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of which are majority Asian.

37:42.660 --> 37:48.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Often, as at Lowell, the
African-American
student population is dropping.
Officials

37:48.733 --> 37:54.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point to the declining numbers
of blacks living
in San Francisco, now just 4
percent, as one

37:54.706 --> 38:00.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
factor in the decrease in black
students at
Lowell. Other factors include
poor preparation

38:00.411 --> 38:06.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in early grades, low test-taking
skills and,
in some cases, disruptive or
difficult home

38:06.985 --> 38:11.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
life, suggests San Francisco
Schools superintendent
Richard Carranza.

38:11.122 --> 38:13.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD CARRANZA, San Francisco
Schools Superintendent:
Some families are homeless. Some
families

38:13.958 --> 38:18.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are living in poverty. Some
students are in
foster care.

38:18.163 --> 38:24.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do we rally to create a
mosaic of supports
for students that have been
historically disadvantaged,

38:24.536 --> 38:28.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to give them the equity boost
they need to
meet the bar that we have set
for them to

38:28.740 --> 38:30.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get into different kinds of
schools?

38:30.742 --> 38:36.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: The low numbers
of blacks
and Latinos at Lowell, for
whatever reason,

38:36.581 --> 38:42.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
discourages other students of
color from even
applying.

38:42.954 --> 38:48.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lowell is certainly interesting,
because of
the diversity problems that it
and several

38:48.193 --> 38:54.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
elite high schools around the
country are
facing. But, for me, it's
personal. My wife,

38:54.265 --> 38:59.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my grandfather, and my father
all went to
Lowell, and I have a son who is
teaching here

38:59.804 --> 39:01.005 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

39:01.039 --> 39:07.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just for the record, I went to a
high school
across town.

39:07.745 --> 39:13.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when principal Andrew
Ishibashi, who has
worked in, and attended,
inner-city schools

39:13.351 --> 39:15.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first became principal here, he
was shocked.

39:15.820 --> 39:18.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
®MD-BO /ANDREW ISHIBASHI,
Principal, Lowell
High School: I found that
diversity was the

39:18.790 --> 39:24.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weakest area at Lowell. It's
something that
I have worried about for the
past nine years.

39:24.462 --> 39:30.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: Micia Mosely, a
part-time
stand-up comedian and teacher
who founded

39:31.002 --> 39:32.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Black Teacher Project in the
Bay Area...

39:32.971 --> 39:35.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICIA MOSELY, Black Teacher
Project: We at
the Black Teacher Project
believe that every

39:35.907 --> 39:37.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
child deserves a black
teacher...

39:37.575 --> 39:41.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: ... says it's
not a surprise
that elite schools lack
diversity.

39:41.779 --> 39:47.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICIA MOSELY: By nature, they're
exclusive.
So how do you have diversity
inside a system

39:47.252 --> 39:52.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or an organization or a school
that's designed
to shut people out? We say we
want diversity

39:52.957 --> 39:57.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this country. We're asking
things of schools
that we're unwilling to do of
ourselves.

39:57.528 --> 39:59.264 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: Her answer?

39:59.297 --> 40:03.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICIA MOSELY: So, you groom
people. So, this
idea that folks are born
innately with the

40:03.701 --> 40:08.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
skills to succeed in these elite
schools is
ridiculous. Everyone's groomed.
Whether that

40:08.339 --> 40:12.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
means that you have a parent
making sure your
academics are in order, or you
go to a good

40:12.277 --> 40:17.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
school that's preparing you,
folks don't come
out of the womb ready to succeed
in an elite

40:17.048 --> 40:19.050 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
school.

40:19.083 --> 40:22.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: But bringing
more people
of color into Lowell is not
simple, says superintendent

40:22.654 --> 40:24.355 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Carranza.

40:24.389 --> 40:26.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD CARRANZA: Well, if we
knew that, we'd
have already figured it out, and
so would

40:26.190 --> 40:32.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have Stuyvesant and Boston
Latin. If you see
students of color in your
school, are they

40:32.096 --> 40:37.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made to feel like they're
welcome? Or do students
of color feel like, well,
they're just a quota?

40:37.535 --> 40:42.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: Lowell's
principal has tried
to dispel that feeling and boost
academic

40:42.774 --> 40:49.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
performance by meeting
occasionally at lunchtime
with black freshmen and
sophomores and a special

40:49.047 --> 40:51.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
consultant to go over grades and
problems.

40:51.949 --> 40:53.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW ISHIBASHI: How did you
guys do last
spring?

40:53.985 --> 40:57.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: First semester, I was
like really
great at algebra II. Even though
I was doubling

40:58.022 --> 41:00.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up, you would think that I would
fall behind,
but I did it.

41:00.725 --> 41:04.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW ISHIBASHI: So, have you
come down here
for tutoring? I have seen you
guys down here,

41:04.629 --> 41:05.897 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
but...

41:05.930 --> 41:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: Yes. I come down here
to study, get
a few tutors.

41:09.267 --> 41:16.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: You know, my Spanish
grade was like
really bad. It was like an F.
And now it's

41:16.474 --> 41:18.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to a B, because I worked really
hard to get
it there.

41:18.876 --> 41:23.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: Addressing the
issues of
diversity frankly is a major
goal of an elective

41:23.748 --> 41:26.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
class in critical thinking and
social change.

41:26.384 --> 41:32.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES HUYNH, Student: A lot of
people don't
want to go to a school full of a
lot of Asians

41:32.123 --> 41:36.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then just like -- you know?
So, it discourages
people from going to Lowell.

41:36.627 --> 41:43.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHILIP MA, Student: I just feel
we -- we're
usually too busy studying and
getting a good

41:43.067 --> 41:47.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GPA and stuff. As a result, we
haven't really
had time to think about how what
we do impacts

41:47.872 --> 41:50.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
minorities and all that stuff.

41:50.208 --> 41:55.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: Malia Cohen, a
member of
San Francisco's Board of
Supervisors, and

41:55.246 --> 42:02.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a graduate of Lowell in 1996,
wants the district
to allocate more money to
address enrollment

42:02.053 --> 42:03.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at her alma mater.

42:03.921 --> 42:06.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALIA COHEN, San Francisco Board
of Supervisors:
So, when it comes to actually
hiring a person

42:06.524 --> 42:13.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
specifically charged with the
duty of targeting
an increasing enrollment, that's
what we're

42:13.965 --> 42:15.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not seeing.

42:15.767 --> 42:17.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD CARRANZA: Who's going to
pay for that?
Do I hire another English
teacher or math

42:17.935 --> 42:20.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
teacher, or do I hire another
specialized
person to do something?

42:20.805 --> 42:25.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: Lowell's
principal has made
recruiting a priority, going
into black and

42:25.510 --> 42:31.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Latino communities and
persuading promising
students to apply to Lowell. As
for making

42:31.616 --> 42:36.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it easier for students to get
in, it's a topic
that was hashed out and rejected
in court

42:36.754 --> 42:38.523 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
years ago.

42:38.556 --> 42:44.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW ISHIBASHI: I would like
to see a little
dent in as far as not having to
pull such

42:44.095 --> 42:45.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
high test scores and grades.

42:46.030 --> 42:51.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: But the way to
get more minority
kids into elite schools, nearly
everyone agrees,

42:51.135 --> 42:52.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is to start young.

42:52.937 --> 42:57.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICIA MOSELY: I went to Brooklyn
Tech High
School in New York City, which
is a specialized

42:57.975 --> 43:03.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
high school, and had to take an
exam. And
I know that the preparation I
had in elementary

43:03.881 --> 43:09.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and middle school allowed me to
do well on
that exam, allowed me to do well
in school.

43:09.053 --> 43:13.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: Lowell and the
nation's other
elite public high schools have
acknowledged

43:13.591 --> 43:18.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have a long way to go to
achieve the
diversity they say they value.

43:18.429 --> 43:29.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour" and
Education Week,
I'm Spencer Michels in San
Francisco.

43:29.106 --> 43:42.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
a look at
some of the backstory to this
year's raucous

43:42.119 --> 43:43.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
political season.

43:43.955 --> 43:49.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just as it brought to the
surface tensions
and disaffection within the
Republican Party,

43:49.260 --> 43:53.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so too have divisions in the
Democratic Party
revealed themselves.

43:53.164 --> 44:00.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Author and historian Thomas
Frank explores
all this in his latest book,
"Listen, Liberal."

44:00.137 --> 44:04.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I sat down with Frank recently
in our studio.

44:04.308 --> 44:05.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thomas Frank, welcome to the
program.

44:05.676 --> 44:07.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THOMAS FRANK, Author, "Listen,
Liberal": Good
to be here, Judy.

44:07.478 --> 44:10.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we should say
the subtitle
is "What Ever Happened to the
Party of the

44:10.147 --> 44:11.883 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
People?"

44:11.916 --> 44:15.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You were talking about the
Democrats, but
just before we talk about what
you think is

44:15.653 --> 44:20.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wrong with the Democratic Party
now, when
was the last time you thought
the Democratic

44:20.157 --> 44:21.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Party was doing what it was
supposed to do?

44:22.026 --> 44:25.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS FRANK: Well, there's a --
look, there's
still a lot of good Democrats
out there, the

44:25.696 --> 44:30.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats that get the -- like,
the seal of
approval from me, you know, that
get five

44:30.268 --> 44:33.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
stars. There's plenty of
Democrats that I
approve of.

44:33.704 --> 44:41.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I will say that I
enthusiastically voted
for President Obama back in
2008. So -- but,

44:41.379 --> 44:49.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the other hand, I think that
the party
has really abandoned its
dedication to working-class

44:49.854 --> 44:54.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Americans, beginning in the
1970s, and has
progressively abandoned it more
and more and

44:54.592 --> 44:57.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more, that sort of traditional
Democratic
mission.

44:57.762 --> 45:01.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I mean, you're
hard. In your
book, you're pretty hard on
President Obama

45:01.933 --> 45:06.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in not fulfilling what you argue
was the promise
of his presidency. You're hard
on both of

45:06.971 --> 45:09.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Clintons, both Bill Clinton
and Hillary
Clinton.

45:09.707 --> 45:16.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you also make the striking
point that
the inequality that we have in
this country

45:16.347 --> 45:18.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is something that they think is
a good thing?

45:18.583 --> 45:22.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
THOMAS FRANK: Well, it's
something that -- I
wouldn't say that. Barack Obama
called it

45:22.420 --> 45:26.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the -- what did he call it? The
great -- the
overriding challenge of our
time.

45:26.324 --> 45:30.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, yes, he has a way of
putting it, and
when he speaks about it in this
very eloquent

45:30.094 --> 45:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
manner, he makes it clear that
this is something
he deplores, something that, you
know, he

45:35.399 --> 45:37.335 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
finds shocking.

45:37.368 --> 45:42.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, the Democratic Party,
the sort of
leadership faction of the
Democratic Party,

45:42.073 --> 45:47.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
isn't really at their core
bothered by inequality.
They think that, to a certain
degree, it reflects

45:48.012 --> 45:52.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the way things ought to be. This
is because
the Democratic Party isn't --
the leadership

45:52.817 --> 45:55.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the Democratic Party is not
who we think
they are.

45:55.987 --> 46:00.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a different group of people
serving a
different agenda than what we --
than their

46:00.625 --> 46:02.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
brand identity tells us they
are.

46:02.426 --> 46:06.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you describe
them as pretty
much the opposite of the working
class, the

46:06.764 --> 46:08.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
blue-collar workers in this
country.

46:08.199 --> 46:12.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THOMAS FRANK: Yes. Yes. That's
not who they're
interested in anymore.

46:12.036 --> 46:17.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once upon a time, say, Franklin
Roosevelt
or Lyndon Johnson or somebody
like that, yes,

46:17.041 --> 46:20.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
absolutely, that's what the
Democratic Party
was about. They were about the
middle class

46:20.277 --> 46:25.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this country. Today, they are
about the
professional, managerial, highly
educated,

46:25.983 --> 46:30.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
white-collar, affluent, suburban
class. That's
who they identify with.

46:30.888 --> 46:35.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's who they -- they have
sort of developed
this enormous literature talking
about how

46:35.660 --> 46:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this class of people is of the
pinnacle of
history. This is also the class
they are all

46:42.266 --> 46:45.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
-- themselves, that they
themselves are drawn
from.

46:45.102 --> 46:48.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They talk about these people all
the time.
And they see that, you know,
this group of

46:48.572 --> 46:53.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
winners is, you know, the
ultimate, the sort
of number one Democratic
constituency, they

46:53.911 --> 46:59.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think that that class of people
deserves to
be where they are, that this is
-- that their

46:59.583 --> 47:01.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
status is something that they
have earned.

47:01.152 --> 47:03.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's a pretty
harsh criticism.

47:03.187 --> 47:08.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you're basically saying that
the leadership
of the Democratic Party, Silicon
Valley, the

47:08.726 --> 47:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
academics, the folks on Wall
Street who are
Democrats, really don't care
about the working

47:15.399 --> 47:16.734 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
class.

47:16.767 --> 47:19.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THOMAS FRANK: Yes, that's
exactly right. That's
exactly right.

47:19.103 --> 47:24.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The more shocking thing is that
the Democrats
basically are a party that
identifies itself

47:24.408 --> 47:28.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Wall Street and that
identifies itself
with Silicon Valley and that
identifies itself

47:28.713 --> 47:34.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with big pharma, with these
industries that
they're forever talking about
and saluting

47:34.218 --> 47:37.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because they're so creative,
they're so innovative.

47:37.655 --> 47:43.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is where these sort of
knowledge-based
industries, where -- the kind of
professionals

47:43.094 --> 47:46.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Democrats see themselves as
representing,
this is where those kind of
people are found.

47:46.797 --> 47:52.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they look at Wall Street
and they don't
see this kind of colossal
villain or, you

47:52.136 --> 47:55.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, the way, say, someone like
Franklin
Roosevelt would have understood
Wall Street.

47:55.473 --> 48:01.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, they see classmates.
They see their
peers. You know, they have a
really difficult

48:01.912 --> 48:09.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time bringing this industry to
heel or making
sure that the rule of law
applies to this

48:09.386 --> 48:11.188 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
industry.

48:11.222 --> 48:14.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you end the
book, Thomas
Frank, on a pretty pessimistic
note, because

48:14.959 --> 48:19.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you say until Democrat -- the
leaders in the
Democratic Party understand the
role they

48:19.897 --> 48:24.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have played in bringing things
to this place,
things aren't going to get
better.

48:24.101 --> 48:29.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS FRANK: Yes, that's
exactly right, because
it's clear that the Republican
Party -- it's

48:29.406 --> 48:33.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clear from my point of view, I
should say,
that the Republican Party, with
its dedication

48:33.477 --> 48:39.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to markets and its philosophy of
entrepreneurs,
is not really interested in
inequality.

48:39.784 --> 48:44.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what's shocking is when you
realize that
the Democrats themselves aren't
really interested

48:44.188 --> 48:48.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in it either, that the kind of
liberalism
that you see in the Democratic
Party is a

48:48.259 --> 48:54.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
liberalism of the rich, that
it's the liberalism
of the top 10 percent of the
income distribution,

48:54.665 --> 48:59.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a kind of -- of a tiny swathe
of Americans
who have actually done very well
in the era

48:59.403 --> 49:01.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of inequality. And that's
shocking once you
realize that.

49:02.006 --> 49:04.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What are the
implications of
this for this year's election?

49:04.441 --> 49:08.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS FRANK: Well, we have a
contest now
that is basically down to Donald
Trump vs.

49:08.779 --> 49:12.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, and between
those two.

49:12.049 --> 49:18.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the matter of inequality, one
of them is
really bad and one of them is a
lot less bad.

49:18.322 --> 49:23.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's where we're left. You
know, it's
the sort of same situation that
we have been

49:23.727 --> 49:27.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in for so many years. No, I
don't think there
is an easy way out this year.
And I think

49:27.531 --> 49:32.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the public is going to get
-- these problems
are going to get worse.
Inequality is going

49:32.303 --> 49:34.104 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to get worse.

49:34.138 --> 49:38.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The situation of working people
is going to
get worse. And you're going to
see more public

49:38.609 --> 49:42.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
frustration and more public
anger and more
Bernie Sanders down the road and
more -- unfortunately,

49:42.847 --> 49:45.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm sorry to say, more Donald
Trumps as well.

49:45.683 --> 49:50.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's a
provocative book, "Listen,
Liberal: What Ever Happened to
the Party of

49:50.688 --> 49:51.822 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the People?"

49:51.856 --> 49:56.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thomas Frank, thank you very
much.

49:56.760 --> 50:04.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THOMAS FRANK: Well, thank you
for having me.

50:04.602 --> 50:11.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We close tonight
with a personal
reflection on the Orlando
shooting from one

50:11.041 --> 50:13.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the city residents William
Brangham introduced
us to earlier.

50:13.944 --> 50:17.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUBANA KHAN, Islamic Center of
Orlando: From
my family to you.

50:17.581 --> 50:21.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dear families of Pulse victims,
I apologize.

50:21.318 --> 50:27.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I apologize not for being a
Muslim, but for
the heinous act committed by a
so-called Muslim.

50:27.691 --> 50:33.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I apologize. I apologize not
because my heart
weeps, but because of all the
hurt and agony

50:33.797 --> 50:37.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it has caused the victims'
families. I apologize.

50:37.601 --> 50:42.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My deepest condolences to all
the families
that are affected by this
monstrous act. There

50:43.007 --> 50:49.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is no place for hatred in Islam.
I apologize.
I apologize not because it was
the holy month

50:49.346 --> 50:55.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Ramadan, but because this
lunatic twisted
and misused the peaceful
religion to carry

50:55.552 --> 50:58.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out his own horrific act.

50:58.222 --> 51:04.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Please don't judge or hate the
rest of the
Muslim nation. I apologize. I
apologize not

51:04.128 --> 51:08.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because I'm being judgmental
towards that
monster, but because loved ones
will have

51:08.666 --> 51:14.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to wait until the day comes when
this monster
shall be held accountable for
his unforgivable

51:14.338 --> 51:16.040 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
deed.

51:16.073 --> 51:21.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Please do not despair. I
apologize. I wish
you find peace of mind, knowing
that they

51:21.478 --> 51:24.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are in a better place than this
world right
now.

51:24.548 --> 51:30.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
May God bless the victims and
their families.
May God bless you. May God bless
America.

51:30.087 --> 51:32.489 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I apologize.

51:32.523 --> 51:37.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
online right
now, Margaret Warner takes a
detailed look

51:38.028 --> 51:43.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at how the Orlando shooter fell
off the FBI's
radar, and the dilemma for law
enforcement

51:43.701 --> 51:47.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in confronting the growing
threat of homegrown
terrorism.

51:47.438 --> 51:52.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

51:52.242 --> 51:56.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And later tonight on "Charlie
Rose," former
Deputy FBI Director Tim Murphy
also looks

51:56.680 --> 51:58.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at the lessons learned from
Orlando.

51:58.682 --> 52:04.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last night, we
aired a story
about the AR-15 rifle, the
weapon used in

52:04.421 --> 52:09.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
several recent mass shootings.
Orlando law
enforcement officials had
initially said that

52:09.994 --> 52:13.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this was the same gun type used
in the nightclub
massacre.

52:13.564 --> 52:20.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, later, they clarified that
the Orlando
shooter was using a Sig Sauer
MCX. That is

52:20.604 --> 52:27.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a rifle with several
similarities to the AR-15
style. The Sig Sauer was
originally designed

52:27.044 --> 52:34.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for use by U.S. special
operations military
forces. The "NewsHour" regrets
the confusion.

52:34.051 --> 52:35.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

52:35.953 --> 52:41.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Thursday, we travel to
Brazil, where fears
over Zika are gripping A local
community and

52:41.759 --> 52:44.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
international athletes ahead of
the Olympics.

52:44.728 --> 52:45.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

52:45.562 --> 52:47.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

52:47.431 --> 52:55.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening.
For all of us here at the "PBS
NewsHour,"

52:55.773 --> 53:07.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.
