JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressional
Republicans yesterday unveiled
a budget that would dramatically

00:04.766 --> 00:09.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
curb spending on a
host of social welfare
programs, including the
federal government's

00:11.733 --> 00:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program, or SNAP,
better known as food stamps.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president's budget released
earlier this year also included
deep cuts to the program.

00:19.933 --> 00:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To see how those proposals
might play out, "NewsHour"
special correspondent Cat Wise

00:26.766 --> 00:30.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
recently traveled to
Arkansas, a state that voted
heavily for Mr. Trump.

00:30.566 --> 00:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This report is part of Chasing
the Dream, our ongoing series
on poverty and opportunity

00:36.200 --> 00:38.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

CAT WISE: In the small
town of Thornton, Arkansas,
Joannie Cayce fires up
her truck twice a month,

00:46.266 --> 00:51.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and drives to a Wal-Mart about
30 miles away to stock up on
fruits, vegetables, meat, milk

00:52.433 --> 00:57.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and other products
donated by the company.

00:57.133 --> 01:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When she returns to the local
food pantry her family has
run since the 1950s, some 200

01:03.866 --> 01:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
residents are waiting, and
a desperate rush begins.

01:07.100 --> 01:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: We get paid every two
weeks, and, by the end of the
week, it's like the cupboards

01:13.466 --> 01:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are bare, and we're
ramen noodling, you know?

01:15.500 --> 01:19.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: I got two kids at
the house and stuff that's
hungry that I have to feed.

01:19.166 --> 01:23.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Ms. Cayce, as she's
known here, says the number
of people she serves each

01:23.600 --> 01:28.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
month has nearly doubled in
the past year-and-a-half,
from 350 to 650, even
as the state's economy

01:31.300 --> 01:33.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has improved.

01:33.300 --> 01:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOANNIE CAYCE, Cayce Charities:
We see no employment, no
grocery stores, no craft stores.

01:38.833 --> 01:41.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Mostly, the families
are generationally poor,
and they can't move.

01:41.533 --> 01:44.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't have the money to
move or anywhere to go to move.

01:44.200 --> 01:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The day we
visited, Brittney Williams
came to Ms. Cayce's with
her two young daughters.

01:51.300 --> 01:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At mid-month, she's already
run out of the $231 a month
she receives in food stamps,

01:57.833 --> 02:01.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or SNAP, the federal
government's Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance
Program for the poor.

02:03.800 --> 02:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRITTNEY WILLIAMS, Receives
SNAP Assistance: I'm out of
food stamps within two weeks.

02:07.200 --> 02:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's another two weeks
week-and-a-half, two weeks,
that I'm sitting here, well, how

02:13.066 --> 02:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
am I going to feed my kids?

02:14.366 --> 02:17.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You know, what am
I going to do next?

02:17.366 --> 02:22.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Am I going to have to beg people
for food, or go to Ms. Cayce,
or what if Ms. Cayce don't

02:23.666 --> 02:26.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
come back to me in
time, and I run out?

02:26.900 --> 02:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Brittney's husband,
Daryl, works full-time as a
security guard at the local

02:31.500 --> 02:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sawmill, making $11 an hour.

02:33.933 --> 02:37.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says the family's bills
have been piling up for months,
and that they're now facing

02:37.866 --> 02:39.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
eviction.

02:39.866 --> 02:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DARYL WILLIAMS, Receives
SNAP Assistance: I have got
a truck payment outside.

02:41.133 --> 02:43.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have got all the
utilities in here.

02:43.700 --> 02:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After buying pull-ups and wipes
for them included, I have got
maybe $50 to $100 left a month,

02:50.700 --> 02:53.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that's got to go in for
gas, so I can get back and
forth to work for the next two

02:53.000 --> 02:55.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weeks.

02:55.166 --> 02:58.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: To qualify for
food stamps, a family
of four in Arkansas must
make less than $32,000

02:58.900 --> 03:01.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a year.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last year, 14 percent of the
state's population was on
SNAP, or about 426,000 people.

03:06.733 --> 03:11.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That percentage mirrors
the national picture.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2016, 44 million
Americans were on SNAP,
receiving an average
benefit of $126 per person

03:17.400 --> 03:20.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
per month, or
about $1.40 a meal.

03:20.533 --> 03:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For years, the program has
been in the crosshairs of
conservative lawmakers,
who say the government

03:27.500 --> 03:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
simply can't sustain a federal
program that last year cost $71
billion, up from $33 billion

03:32.800 --> 03:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in 2007, before the recession.

03:36.766 --> 03:38.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRUCE WESTERMAN (R), Arkansas:
Instead of lifting people
out of poverty, many of our

03:38.266 --> 03:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
welfare programs are actually
trapping people in poverty.

03:41.100 --> 03:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Bruce Westerman is the
Republican U.S. representative
of the 4th District in

03:45.933 --> 03:47.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Arkansas, which
includes Thornton.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:49.666 --> 03:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRUCE WESTERMAN: We have
got to do something to get
the debt under control.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's either do it the easy way
now, which may not seem easy
to some, or have the whole

03:59.100 --> 04:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thing come crashing down and
not be able to provide SNAP,
or Medicare and Medicaid or

04:02.100 --> 04:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anything to anyone because
we're in a financial crisis.

04:05.133 --> 04:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Mick Mulvaney is
the Trump administration's
director of the Office
of Management and Budget.

04:12.033 --> 04:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY, White House
Budget Director: We're no longer
going to measure compassion

04:14.100 --> 04:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the number of programs or
the number of people on those
programs, but by the number

04:17.800 --> 04:20.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of people we help get
off of those programs.

04:20.333 --> 04:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: In May, the
White House presented its
budget, which aimed to
slash federal spending

04:24.133 --> 04:28.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by $3.6 trillion
over the next decade.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If Congress were to pass that
budget, SNAP would lose $193
billion, around a quarter

04:34.200 --> 04:36.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of its funding.

04:36.266 --> 04:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The plan calls for tightening
standards on who qualifies
for the program, and, for the

04:42.733 --> 04:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first time, the budget shifts
a large chunk of the cost to
states, starting with 10 percent

04:46.966 --> 04:51.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in 2020 and rising to
25 percent in 2023.

04:53.766 --> 04:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For Arkansas, that would
mean $144 million added to
its state budget each year.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHY WEBB (D), Former
Arkansas State Representative:
I don't see where we
would make up that $144

05:00.733 --> 05:02.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
million.

05:02.233 --> 05:04.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAT WISE: You don't think
the state can make that up?

05:04.466 --> 05:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KATHY WEBB: I don't think
the state can make that up.

05:06.600 --> 05:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Kathy Webb is a former
state Democratic representative
who now runs the Arkansas Hunger

05:13.266 --> 05:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Relief Alliance, a nonprofit
organization connecting and
advocating for the state's

05:16.300 --> 05:17.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
food banks.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She says private charities
could not fill the gap.

05:19.833 --> 05:23.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KATHY WEBB: We cannot
make up the difference.

05:23.733 --> 05:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all of the charitable food
network put together is about
a 20th of what the federal

05:29.666 --> 05:31.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
safety net is.

05:31.666 --> 05:35.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Webb also worries
about the effect a SNAP cut
would have on grocery stores in

05:36.500 --> 05:38.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
poor communities.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RANDY LINDSEY, Business Owner:
It takes everything to make it.

05:39.033 --> 05:41.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There is no slack.

05:41.066 --> 05:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Randy Lindsey and his
wife, Janice, run the Bottom
Dollar Store in Bearden, near

05:44.700 --> 05:46.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thornton.

05:46.833 --> 05:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's one of the few stores in
the area selling fresh produce
and meat, as well as household

05:50.133 --> 05:52.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
items, flowers and more.

05:52.166 --> 05:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lindsey, a Trump supporter,
says, in a tough economy,
every little bit helps.

05:56.400 --> 06:01.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RANDY LINDSEY: If I
lost 25 percent of SNAP,
for me, it would mean
cutting 10 to 15 hours

06:02.800 --> 06:06.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a week, or roughly 40
hours a month off payroll.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAT WISE: So your employees
would be impacted?

06:08.966 --> 06:09.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RANDY LINDSEY: Yes.

06:09.966 --> 06:11.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It would impact employees.

06:11.166 --> 06:12.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's a pretty
good chunk to lose.

06:12.633 --> 06:15.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's not much gravy
in this operation.

06:15.366 --> 06:18.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We make less money, then
something has to be cut.

06:18.800 --> 06:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Conservatives often
point out that SNAP expanded
considerably under Presidents

06:23.100 --> 06:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
George W. Bush and Barack
Obama, and they are correct.

06:26.900 --> 06:31.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The rise was particularly
acute during the recession of
2008, when millions lost work

06:31.766 --> 06:34.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and joined SNAP's rolls.

06:34.033 --> 06:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Benefits were also increased as
part of the Stimulus Act, the
2009 law that pumped billions

06:38.666 --> 06:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in federal spending into
communities across the country.

06:41.900 --> 06:46.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yet, since late 2012, both
spending and the number of
people on SNAP have fallen, and

06:48.933 --> 06:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the nonpartisan Congressional
Budget Office estimates that,
if no changes were made, the

06:52.833 --> 06:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
share of the population
on SNAP would return to
pre-recession levels by 2027.

06:59.700 --> 07:03.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still, SNAP remains historically
high, as more working families
like the Williams, and

07:05.533 --> 07:09.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seniors like 63-year-old
James Jackson earn less, thus
qualifying for the benefit.

SNAP Assistance: Anybody,
anyone, at any time can
be affected by poverty.

of all seniors in Arkansas
face the threat of hunger.

07:22.333 --> 07:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That leads the nation,
according to a recent report.

07:25.200 --> 07:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jackson, a trained chef and
a professional painter, has
struggled to find work since

his truck broke down.

07:33.433 --> 07:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He now lives in subsidized

to get off the very program
that you're trying to cut.

07:49.700 --> 07:51.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I want to get off.

07:51.366 --> 07:56.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But if you take away my ability
to get off, what can I do?

07:59.266 --> 08:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: In the long
run, it's more economic
opportunities, rather than
government assistance,

08:06.200 --> 08:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Congressman Westerman
says will best help the

that we have to have a program
that large in this country.

08:12.766 --> 08:17.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need to provide more
opportunities for people that
