JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.700 --> 00:07.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.233 --> 00:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
a new storm of criticism.

00:10.033 --> 00:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump's
decision to abandon the
international climate accord
has global corporations,

00:17.033 --> 00:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
American cities and world
leaders calling to keep up the
fight against global warming.

00:22.900 --> 00:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, we go to a small town in
West Virginia, one of the most
pro-Trump communities in the

00:28.500 --> 00:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country, where a group of
women are finding their voice
in protest of the president.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it's Friday.

00:35.933 --> 00:39.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Mark Shields and David
Brooks analyze a week
of news with potentially
historic consequences.

00:41.133 --> 00:44.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Plus: It's a new
season of summer TV.

00:44.600 --> 00:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We find out about some of the
best new and returning shows
coming to the small screen.

00:51.533 --> 00:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SONIA SARAIYA, "Variety":
"Master of None" is -- it's such
a delicate little, beautiful

00:54.233 --> 00:55.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
show.

00:55.500 --> 00:58.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Its a half-hour, but
it's so cinematic.

00:58.766 --> 01:03.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:07.300 --> 01:10.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:10.233 --> 01:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Reaction to
the president's announcement
yesterday that the U.S. will

01:18.933 --> 01:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
withdraw from the Paris
climate agreement has been
unusually fierce on both sides.

01:25.366 --> 01:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, today, the White House
stood firmly by his decision.

01:28.533 --> 01:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of
the United States: Thank
you very much, everybody.

01:30.933 --> 01:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is slightly less
controversial than yesterday,
but yesterday was a big
service to this country,

01:36.533 --> 01:37.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I will tell you.

01:37.700 --> 01:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you very much, everybody.

01:39.833 --> 01:44.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That was all
the president would say about
his much-awaited announcement.

01:46.800 --> 01:51.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Earlier in the day, however,
the head of the Environmental
Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt,

01:51.566 --> 01:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
delivered an energetic defense.

01:53.666 --> 01:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT PRUITT, Environmental
Protection Agency Administrator:
We have nothing to be apologetic

01:55.633 --> 01:57.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about as a country.

01:57.400 --> 02:02.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We have reduced our
CO2 footprint to levels
of the early 1990s.

02:02.033 --> 02:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's been largely
accomplished through innovation
and technology, not government

02:06.433 --> 02:08.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mandate.

02:08.466 --> 02:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nevertheless,
the announcement has touched off
a chorus of protest both here

02:13.166 --> 02:15.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the U.S. and abroad.

02:15.300 --> 02:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
From Berlin, German
Chancellor Angela Merkel:

02:17.633 --> 02:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGELA MERKEL, German Chancellor
(through translator): The
decision of the U.S. to withdraw

02:21.533 --> 02:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the Paris climate
agreement is very regrettable,
and I'm expressing
myself in a very reserved

02:27.266 --> 02:29.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
way when I say that.

02:29.366 --> 02:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We in Germany, in Europe and
in the world are now more
determined than ever to pool

02:33.600 --> 02:36.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all our strength to face one
of the challenges of humankind.

02:36.766 --> 02:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Paris,
France's newly elected
President Emmanuel Macron
offered this appeal

02:43.333 --> 02:45.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reinforced by
speaking in English.

02:45.833 --> 02:50.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMANUEL MACRON, French
President: To all
scientists, engineers,
entrepreneurs, responsible

02:50.500 --> 02:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
citizens who were disappointed
by the decision of the president
of the United States, I want

02:56.966 --> 03:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to say that they will find
in France a second homeland.

03:01.766 --> 03:06.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I call on them, come
and work here with us.

03:09.866 --> 03:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Both leaders said
they wouldn't renegotiate the
deal, as President Trump said

03:14.733 --> 03:16.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he was prepared to do.

03:16.800 --> 03:21.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, in Brussels,
officials from China,
the world's largest
emitter of greenhouse

03:23.266 --> 03:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gases, met with European
counterparts and reaffirmed
their commitment.

03:28.300 --> 03:30.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Support also poured in from
the U.S. corporate world.

03:30.700 --> 03:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than two dozen
companies, including
oil giant Shell, Apple,
Facebook and Morgan Stanley,

03:38.066 --> 03:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had signed a letter urging
Mr. Trump to stay in the pact.

03:42.100 --> 03:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Separately, General Electric
CEO Jeff Immelt and Tesla
chief Elon Musk argued the move

03:48.800 --> 03:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
would cost the U.S. jobs.

03:51.433 --> 03:55.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Disney's chief, Bob Iger,
joined Musk in resigning
from presidential advisory
committees in protest.

03:58.666 --> 04:03.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Peabody Energy,one of
the country's largest
coal companies, did
come out in support of

04:04.533 --> 04:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the president's decision.

04:06.533 --> 04:11.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Russia's President Vladimir
Putin said continued dialogue
was necessary at an event

04:12.433 --> 04:15.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
moderated by NBC News
anchor Megyn Kelly.

04:15.100 --> 04:18.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through
translator): Rather
than make noise over it,

04:18.466 --> 04:23.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we need to create conditions
for mutual work, because if
countries that are big emitters,

04:25.433 --> 04:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like the United States, will
not take part at all, it will
be impossible to negotiate

04:29.900 --> 04:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and sign any kind of agreement.

04:31.900 --> 04:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back at the White
House, the EPA's Pruitt said
the president has made clear

04:36.133 --> 04:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's willing to work with
anyone on a better deal.

04:39.933 --> 04:44.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when pressed on whether Mr.
Trump actually believes that
humans play a role in climate

04:46.000 --> 04:48.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
change, Pruitt
skirted the question.

04:48.066 --> 04:50.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT PRUITT: The discussions
the president and I have had
over the last several weeks

04:50.866 --> 04:55.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
have been focused on one
key issue: Is Paris good
or bad for this country?

04:55.400 --> 04:57.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He determined it was
bad for our country.

04:57.633 --> 04:58.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It hurt us economically.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It didn't achieve good
environmental outcomes.

05:00.766 --> 05:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he made the decision
to reject the Paris deal.

05:03.400 --> 05:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, oil
prices tumbled amid speculation
the U.S. withdrawal would

05:10.200 --> 05:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
boost domestic oil production,
adding to an already
saturated global supply.

05:15.600 --> 05:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will put some of the facts
and claims behind climate change
into context right after the

05:20.466 --> 05:23.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
news summary.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news:
U.S. employers pulled
back a bit on hiring last
month, but the unemployment

05:28.433 --> 05:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rate still dropped, to its
lowest point in 16 years.

05:31.366 --> 05:36.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Labor Department's
monthly report showed a net
gain of 138,000 jobs in May.

05:38.300 --> 05:41.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it posted a loss
of one-tenth of a point
in the unemployment
rate to 4.3 percent.

05:43.633 --> 05:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will explore the numbers
and what they mean a little
later in the program.

05:47.933 --> 05:51.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is word tonight that
special counsel Robert Mueller's
special investigation into

05:51.700 --> 05:56.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
possible ties between
Russia and the Trump
campaign may be growing.

05:56.633 --> 06:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Associated Press reports
that Mueller is taking over an
ongoing criminal investigation

06:02.966 --> 06:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
involving former Trump
campaign chair Paul Manafort.

06:05.433 --> 06:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The probe reportedly may also
expand to look into the role of
Attorney General Jeff Sessions

06:12.433 --> 06:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the deputy attorney
general in the firing of
FBI Director James Comey.

06:18.400 --> 06:22.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the Philippines, police
are still trying to figure out
what motivated a lone attacker

06:22.366 --> 06:27.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
who set fire to a Manila
casino, resulting in
the deaths of 36 people.

06:29.300 --> 06:33.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They suffocated in the heavy
smoke, their bodies not
discovered until hours later.

06:34.466 --> 06:37.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The gunman was found dead
elsewhere in the complex.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: We are still investigating
and trying to ascertain why
somebody will be so senseless

06:43.300 --> 06:45.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and have such a motive.

06:45.266 --> 06:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That is still to be determined.

06:47.300 --> 06:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Police say they
have ruled out terror as a
motive, despite the Islamic

06:53.233 --> 06:55.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
State group claiming
responsibility.

06:55.833 --> 06:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A protest over security
in Afghanistan's capital
turned violent today,
and several demonstrators

07:01.133 --> 07:03.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were killed.

07:03.233 --> 07:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It happened in Kabul, just
days after 90 people died
in a huge truck bombing.

07:08.433 --> 07:10.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
More than 1,000
people marched today.

07:10.266 --> 07:13.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Some threw rocks as
they charged police.

07:13.400 --> 07:18.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officers fired into the
air at first and also used
tear gas and water cannons.

07:20.400 --> 07:24.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.N. Security Council has
voted to slap more sanctions on
North Korea over its continued

07:25.366 --> 07:26.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
missile testing.

07:26.833 --> 07:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The U.S. and China backed
the resolution today.

07:29.700 --> 07:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It blacklists more than a
dozen North Korean individuals
and other entities, including

07:34.700 --> 07:38.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a bank and part of the
North Korean military.

07:38.866 --> 07:43.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia's President Vladimir
Putin is appealing for improved
ties with the United States,

07:45.266 --> 07:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and again denying any improper
actions by his government.

07:47.633 --> 07:52.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He spoke today at a
forum with other leaders
in Saint Petersburg,
and said relations are

07:52.533 --> 07:55.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at their lowest point
since the Cold War.

07:55.800 --> 08:00.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN (through
translator): Therefore,
I think it is necessary
to stop this useless

08:03.200 --> 08:05.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and unhelpful chatter.

08:05.233 --> 08:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to stress it once again:
It is an attempt to bring
internal political squabbling in

08:09.400 --> 08:12.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the United States to
the international arena.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It is an attempt to
solve internal political
problems using foreign
policy instruments.

08:16.366 --> 08:18.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It is harmful.

08:18.766 --> 08:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Putin
also dismissed the
focus on the Russian
ambassador's meetings with

08:21.700 --> 08:25.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump aides as -- quote --
"catastrophic nonsense."

08:25.066 --> 08:30.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Separately, the Russian
president denied that
his ally President
Bashar al-Assad of Syria

08:31.266 --> 08:34.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
used chemical weapons on
his own people in April.

08:34.533 --> 08:38.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He said others carried
out the attack as a - -
quote -- "provocation."

08:38.700 --> 08:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In South Sudan, at least 15
young children have died after
a botched measles vaccination

08:44.833 --> 08:45.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

08:45.833 --> 08:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It happened early last month.

08:47.866 --> 08:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The World Health Organization
said that untrained workers used
a single syringe for all the

08:54.400 --> 08:57.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
children, and that the
vaccine was stored without
refrigeration for days.

Back in this country, the Trump
administration has formally
asked the U.S. Supreme Court

09:02.333 --> 09:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to reinstate a travel ban on
six Muslim-majority countries.

09:08.733 --> 09:11.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lower courts have so far blocked
the ban from taking effect.

09:11.366 --> 09:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, the Justice
Department asked the high
court to decide if it
will hear the government's

09:15.833 --> 09:19.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
appeal, and to reinstate
the ban in the meantime.

09:19.566 --> 09:24.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The former president of Penn
State University will serve
time behind bars for his role in

09:26.100 --> 09:30.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
covering up child sexual
abuse by an ex-assistant
football coach.

09:32.300 --> 09:36.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Graham Spanier will spend two
months in jail, and up to 10
months under house arrest.

09:38.033 --> 09:41.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Two other former
university officials
also received jail time.

09:41.866 --> 09:46.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jerry Sandusky is serving a
prison sentence of 30 to 60
years for sexually abusing 10

09:48.766 --> 09:50.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
boys.

09:50.833 --> 09:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Wall Street today,
stocks shook off the lukewarm
jobs report to again close at

09:55.366 --> 09:57.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all-time highs.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Dow Jones industrial
average gained 62 points
to close at 21206.

10:03.133 --> 10:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 59 points
to close at 6305, and
the S&amp;P 500 added nine.

10:09.300 --> 10:13.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For the week, the Dow
and the S&amp;P each gained
a fraction of 1 percent.

10:15.066 --> 10:17.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Nasdaq added
about 1.5 percent.

10:17.900 --> 10:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
putting the president's
claims about the Paris accord

10:21.466 --> 10:26.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in context; what the latest
jobs numbers say about the
health of the nation's economy;

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
women taking a stand in
Trump country; And much more.

10:43.366 --> 10:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We return now to the president's
decision to withdraw from
the Paris climate accord.

10:48.333 --> 10:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want to take a closer look
at some of the claims President
Trump made during his remarks

10:53.200 --> 10:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the Rose Garden yesterday.

10:55.266 --> 10:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has that.

10:57.433 --> 10:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: As president, I
can put no other consideration

10:59.633 --> 11:03.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
before the well-being
of American citizens.

11:03.166 --> 11:07.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In his
announcement yesterday,
President Trump gave
several reasons why he

11:07.400 --> 11:10.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
thought the Paris
accord was a bad idea.

11:10.200 --> 11:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The main points the president
made was that the Paris accord
is unfair to the U.S., that

11:14.500 --> 11:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it would hurt American workers,
and that it won't really slow
the pace of dangerous climate

11:18.866 --> 11:20.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
change.

11:20.100 --> 11:22.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, let's go through
some of those claims.

11:22.133 --> 11:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The first thing the president
said was, we will get out of
Paris, but maybe we will strike

11:25.566 --> 11:27.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a better deal.

11:27.566 --> 11:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Begin negotiations
to reenter either the Paris
accord, or a really entirely

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
new transaction, on terms that
are fair to the United States.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But leaders
from many of the other 195
nations in the deal said there

11:43.466 --> 11:46.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was no appetite
for renegotiation.

11:46.300 --> 11:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
French President Emmanuel Macron
summed up the view of many.

11:49.500 --> 11:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EMMANUEL MACRON, French
President (through translator):
He committed an error for the

11:53.066 --> 11:58.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interests of his country,
his people and a mistake for
the future of our planet.

11:59.300 --> 12:01.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We will not renegotiate
a less ambitious accord.

12:01.533 --> 12:03.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
There is no way.

12:03.533 --> 12:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: President
Trump also implied that the
Paris accords are binding on the

12:07.500 --> 12:08.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
United States.

12:08.500 --> 12:11.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But they're not.

12:11.033 --> 12:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The entire accord relies
on voluntary commitments,
so many argue that, if
the president wanted

12:14.233 --> 12:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to stay in and wanted to
change the U.S.' commitment,
he's largely free to do so.

12:20.666 --> 12:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jason Grumet is the president
of the Bipartisan Policy Center.

12:22.766 --> 12:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
®MD-BJASON GRUMET, President,
Bipartisan Policy Center: What
was unique about the Paris

12:25.800 --> 12:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
accord is that it was
essentially a collection
of 200 individual promises.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Every country came forward
and made a unique commitment.

12:33.233 --> 12:36.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And each country has
the capacity to reassert
it own commitments.

12:36.600 --> 12:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think it's entirely
reasonable for President
Trump to say, I'm
uncomfortable with this

12:43.533 --> 12:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aspect of what the United
States committed and, therefore,
we're going to take a somewhat

12:46.166 --> 12:48.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
different approach.

12:48.266 --> 12:52.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. would obviously have
much more capacity to influence
the choices, views and efforts

12:53.733 --> 12:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of others if we were part
of that conversation.

12:55.833 --> 12:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Another one
of the main complaints the
president made: This will hurt

12:59.133 --> 13:01.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
U.S. jobs.

13:01.633 --> 13:05.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Compliance
with the terms of the
Paris accord and the
onerous energy restrictions

13:07.200 --> 13:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it has placed on the United
States could cost America as
much as 2.7 million lost jobs by

13:15.033 --> 13:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
2025, according to the National
Economic Research Associates.

13:22.433 --> 13:25.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
international mining
giant Peabody Energy
applauded the president's

13:25.666 --> 13:27.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
move.

13:27.666 --> 13:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Peabody believes that this
path cannot be followed without
substantially impacting the

13:33.633 --> 13:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. economy, increasing
electricity costs on families
and businesses, and requiring

13:38.700 --> 13:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the power sector to rely
on less diverse and more
intermittent energy sources."

13:43.866 --> 13:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But others point out that
study about lost jobs that the
president cited was written

13:46.800 --> 13:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by groups that are opposed to
the Paris accords, and that they
used some worst-case predictions

13:52.966 --> 13:55.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that other economists
believe are unrealistic.

13:55.366 --> 13:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Asked about this on NBC this
morning, Commerce Secretary
Wilbur Ross defended using these

13:59.600 --> 14:01.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
studies.

14:01.766 --> 14:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILBUR ROSS, U.S. Commerce
Secretary: Well, you should
know what your downside is.

14:03.133 --> 14:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's an important thing.

14:05.200 --> 14:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And particularly when you're
trying to forecast events many
years out into the future, it's

14:11.333 --> 14:13.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
very, very difficult
to be accurate.

14:13.833 --> 14:18.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Roberton
Williams is an economist with
Resources For the Future, a

14:18.066 --> 14:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nonpartisan group that
studied the Paris accord.

14:20.200 --> 14:24.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERTON WILLIAMS, Resources
For the Future: What we have
modeled in terms of job effects

14:24.866 --> 14:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is that it's much more of a
job shift than it is job loss
or net job gain, that jobs

14:31.833 --> 14:36.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go away in coal, and you get
more jobs in some green jobs,
renewable energy, small effects

14:39.033 --> 14:40.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
elsewhere.

14:40.266 --> 14:42.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But there is not a big
-- it is not a big drop.

14:42.300 --> 14:46.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The president
also argued that while coal
jobs in the U.S. would suffer,

14:46.066 --> 14:51.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
other nations like India
and China, the other
two major global carbon
polluters, would have

14:51.000 --> 14:52.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a free hand.

14:52.966 --> 14:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: China will be
able to increase these emissions
by a staggering number of

15:00.533 --> 15:01.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
years, 13.

15:01.733 --> 15:04.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They can do whatever
they want for 13 years.

15:04.933 --> 15:07.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Not us.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But Jason
Grumet said it wasn't true that
other countries can do whatever

15:09.833 --> 15:11.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they want.

15:11.800 --> 15:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JASON GRUMET: The assertion that
the United States fundamentally
disabled our economy,

15:17.766 --> 15:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
while other countries move
forward with absolutely no
concern is just not accurate.

15:22.666 --> 15:26.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that the U.S. made
some meaningful commitments.

15:26.166 --> 15:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it's perfectly
reasonable for President Trump
to suggest that we want to

15:29.866 --> 15:31.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reconsider those commitments.

15:31.966 --> 15:36.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Renegotiating the United States'
commitments is absolutely right.

15:39.033 --> 15:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it is an exaggeration to
suggest that other countries
were not sincere or did not

15:41.200 --> 15:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
make meaningful commitments.

15:43.300 --> 15:46.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The president
also touched on an issue that
is central to the Paris accord,

15:46.200 --> 15:51.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is: Can it achieve
its stated goal of
preventing the planet
from warming an additional

15:52.566 --> 15:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
two degrees Celsius, or
about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit?

15:55.366 --> 15:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yesterday, the president
said the accord will barely
affect global temperatures.

15:59.400 --> 16:04.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Even if the Paris
agreement were implemented in
full, with total compliance

16:06.433 --> 16:10.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from all nations, it is
estimated it would only
produce a two-tenths
of one degree -- think

16:12.700 --> 16:17.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of that, this much -- Celsius
reduction in global temperature
by the year 2100, tiny,

16:23.833 --> 16:25.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tiny amount.

16:25.766 --> 16:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Again,
there's a question of where this
data comes from, and whether

16:31.866 --> 16:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the president's statement
accurately reflects the science.

16:33.966 --> 16:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House said the
president was citing this study
done by researchers at MIT.

16:38.933 --> 16:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But MIT said today the president
misused their research.

16:42.233 --> 16:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN REILLY, MIT: The president
really took the study out of
context by pointing out this

16:47.000 --> 16:48.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
two-tenths of a degree.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: John Reilly
is co-author of this MIT report.

16:50.466 --> 16:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN REILLY: This was the
incremental effect of Paris
compared to the previous accord.

16:54.666 --> 16:59.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Altogether, if we look at
past policy, we think that's
reduced warming by a full degree

17:01.833 --> 17:03.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Celsius.

17:03.866 --> 17:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We still have more we need
to do to get to the ultimate
goal of two degrees, but Paris

17:09.066 --> 17:11.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is an important
step along that way.

17:11.100 --> 17:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And Roberton
Williams argues that even a
minor slowing of global warming

17:15.066 --> 17:17.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can hold off some
major destruction.

17:17.433 --> 17:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERTON WILLIAMS: Even
small changes in temperature,
even small reductions
below that what we get

17:24.000 --> 17:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
without any action, can make
a big difference in how much
damage there is to the world.

17:27.933 --> 17:32.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, even tenths of a degree
can make a difference of
hundreds of billions of dollars.

17:32.166 --> 17:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Yesterday,
the president said the U.S.
will formally withdraw from

17:35.800 --> 17:37.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the accord.

17:37.266 --> 17:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a process that could take
several years to complete.

17:43.733 --> 17:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The climate
decision raises question about
the economy, and so does today's

17:55.466 --> 17:58.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
jobs report.

17:58.033 --> 18:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In it, the unemployment
rate dropped to its
lowest point in 16 years,
causing some economists

18:03.333 --> 18:06.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to raise the prospect of what
they call full employment.

18:06.200 --> 18:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But job growth seems to
have slowed considerably.

18:09.600 --> 18:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With the latest revisions,
the economy is generating an
average, we're told, of about

18:13.266 --> 18:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
120,000 net new jobs each month.

18:16.633 --> 18:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To get some insight into all of
this, we're joined from Chicago
by Diane Swonk, an economist

18:21.466 --> 18:23.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who runs her own firm.

18:23.633 --> 18:25.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Diane Swonk, welcome
back to the program.

18:25.733 --> 18:29.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, overall, what do you
make of these jobs numbers
for the month of May?

18:29.166 --> 18:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIANE SWONK, Founder, DS
Economics: Well, certainly,
they were a disappointment.

18:31.933 --> 18:36.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That said, we don't need to
generate as many jobs as we once
did to keep the unemployment

18:36.166 --> 18:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rate steady or even fall.

18:38.233 --> 18:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, the unemployment
rate itself fell for the wrong
reasons in the month of May.

18:42.133 --> 18:45.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that is that
the participation
rate fell yet again.

18:45.200 --> 18:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're seeing more people retire
out of the labor force and men
in particular didn't participate

18:49.900 --> 18:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as much in the month of May.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is something we like
to see moving in reverse
at this stage of the game.

18:54.833 --> 18:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: When you say,
Diane, that the country, you
said we don't need to generate

18:58.333 --> 19:01.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as many jobs as we once
did, what do you mean?

19:01.133 --> 19:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIANE SWONK: Well, basically,
the labor force isn't
growing very rapidly anymore.

19:04.900 --> 19:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And even though the economy
is very subdued in its growth
at 2 percent, you just don't

19:08.933 --> 19:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need to create very many jobs
to absorb those workers coming
into the labor force and keep

19:13.333 --> 19:15.033 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the unemployment
rate going down.

19:15.033 --> 19:18.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We have actually seen
job growth slow and the
unemployment rate fall.

19:18.233 --> 19:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is because we're near
what we call full employment.

19:21.333 --> 19:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That sounds good in terms.

19:23.400 --> 19:27.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What it really means
in economist terms and
for the Federal Reserve
is nearly all of those

19:27.400 --> 19:32.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people who are employable
or are employed or who are
looking for a job are now sort

19:32.066 --> 19:37.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of either between jobs because
they wanted to be between
jobs or are just coming into

19:39.000 --> 19:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the labor force, but it's
not a lot of extra slack
in the U.S. economy.

19:41.066 --> 19:44.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That said, it doesn't mean all
those people who want a job
in the U.S. economy or have

19:44.766 --> 19:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dropped out and are not
looking can actually get a job.

19:47.233 --> 19:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Diane, you were
telling us earlier today that
the focus on jobs obscures

19:51.600 --> 19:55.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the need to look at
raising skill levels.

19:55.400 --> 19:56.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Talk about that.

19:56.400 --> 19:58.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DIANE SWONK: Exactly.

19:58.400 --> 20:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of -- there are two reasons
why we saw the wage gains
slow in the month of May from

20:01.933 --> 20:03.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a year ago.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It is only up at a
2.5 percent rate.

20:04.700 --> 20:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is something we like to see
going in the other direction.

20:06.866 --> 20:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you are near full employment,
wages should be accelerating.

20:09.433 --> 20:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One reason is because
millennials are replacing
older baby boomers
and they're paid less.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That is not a bad reason
for wage growth slowing.

20:16.666 --> 20:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other reason is that we are
seeing many employers out there
dip further into lower-skilled

20:23.700 --> 20:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
workers, but instead of paying
them more, they are actually
investing in training, because

20:25.933 --> 20:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they don't have the skills
necessary to do the jobs they
have or they are leaving job

20:30.800 --> 20:33.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
positions open.

20:33.133 --> 20:36.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The shortages in construction
are particularly acute
and manufacturing, which
actually contracted.

20:38.933 --> 20:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We still have over 300,000
jobs that aren't filled just
because people don't have the

20:41.933 --> 20:44.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right skills.

20:44.033 --> 20:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we would do much better to
enhance the skills of those out
there who are on the sidelines

20:47.933 --> 20:52.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and not participating right
now to bring them back in, than
just give them tax cuts to cut

20:53.566 --> 20:55.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
low wages.

20:55.533 --> 20:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And very quickly,
finally, Diane, we took note
yesterday when President

20:58.133 --> 21:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trumped talked about the country
having created, I think, he
said a million jobs since the

21:03.866 --> 21:05.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
election last November.

21:05.066 --> 21:06.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Does that reflect
what's been going on?

21:06.866 --> 21:09.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DIANE SWONK: It is
a bit of a stretch.

21:09.166 --> 21:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have created 800,000 jobs
since the beginning of the year.

21:12.966 --> 21:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you want to do it
since he's been president,
it's about 600,000 jobs.

21:17.200 --> 21:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, depending on how he wants
to count, I think it is a
little early for him to take

21:21.200 --> 21:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
credit one way or the other,
and might be careful what he
wants to take credit for in

21:25.000 --> 21:27.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
terms of job gains.

21:27.500 --> 21:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it is going to
get better going forward,
but the bottom line
is, that is not really

21:31.333 --> 21:33.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the way to count it.

21:33.300 --> 21:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Diane
Swonk joining us from
Chicago, thanks very much.

21:38.866 --> 21:43.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DIANE SWONK: Thank you.

21:45.133 --> 21:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

21:52.966 --> 21:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Mark Shields and David Brooks
take on the week's news;

21:57.466 --> 22:02.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
50 years later, a
reporter's account of the
Arab-Israeli Six-Day War;
and the most binge-worthy

22:05.433 --> 22:09.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TV hits of the summer.

22:09.400 --> 22:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But first: how last year's
election results shook up one
West Virginia town and how the

22:15.466 --> 22:18.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reverberations continue
to sow division.

22:18.166 --> 22:20.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hari Sreenivasan
has more on that.

22:20.166 --> 22:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Buckhannon
is a town with a population
of less than 6,000.

22:24.033 --> 22:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a deeply conservative
place with a long
history tied to coal.

22:28.166 --> 22:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Its mayor calls it the most
Trumpian place in America.

22:31.633 --> 22:36.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But Buckhannon is also
where a growing group of
women are finding their
voice through protest

22:38.533 --> 22:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and where speaking up has
angered some people, including
the men in their lives.

22:40.733 --> 22:45.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Our Elizabeth Flock has
published a deep look
at these divisions and
the women on the front

22:45.033 --> 22:46.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lines.

22:46.500 --> 22:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It sounds like a tough
climate to protest Trump.

22:48.733 --> 22:50.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: Absolutely.

22:50.300 --> 22:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it's very isolating for
a lot of the women in the town.

22:52.433 --> 22:57.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are just about 70 women
in a town of 6,000, and most
of the town doesn't agree

22:58.000 --> 23:00.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with them.

23:00.133 --> 23:03.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And so how
does the town respond when
they see these women picketing

23:03.300 --> 23:04.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
policies of the
Trump administration?

23:04.966 --> 23:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: Not well.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They have gotten a lot
of pushback from the
town, from everyone from
the local fraternity

23:13.366 --> 23:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brothers at the nearby college,
to their husbands, to their
neighbors, to people at the high

23:17.366 --> 23:19.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
school,.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Some of their kids have
been made fun of for
the women protesting.

23:25.300 --> 23:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Other women go home at night
and their husbands get after
them for appearing on the front

23:27.333 --> 23:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
page with a protest sign.

23:29.733 --> 23:34.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, for them, I think
it's a constant struggle
to keep protesting, in
light of the reaction

23:36.166 --> 23:38.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that they are getting.

23:38.200 --> 23:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: As you point
out, a lot of these women
were not engaged in this way

23:40.900 --> 23:42.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
before this election.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: Absolutely not.

23:44.100 --> 23:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most of them told me the only
political participation they had
up until this point was voting.

23:49.166 --> 23:50.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Most of them had never
held a protest sign.

23:50.233 --> 23:51.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This was very new to them.

23:51.766 --> 23:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think what is interesting is,
this wasn't an organized thing.

23:54.333 --> 23:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of these women just
decided individually that after
the election they wanted to do

23:58.833 --> 24:00.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
something, they wanted
to go out and protest.

24:00.966 --> 24:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They went to the county -- in
front of the county Courthouse
and held a sign, and they

24:04.333 --> 24:06.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
found that there were
other women there
doing the same thing.

24:06.400 --> 24:10.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, as
you point out, their protests
are met with counterprotests.

24:10.466 --> 24:12.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is that like?

24:12.500 --> 24:16.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: Well, the most
striking example was after the
announcement of the proposed

24:18.733 --> 24:21.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
travel ban, when the
women did a march at
the county courthouse,
and a number of trucks

24:21.166 --> 24:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
showed up in counterprotest,
mostly men, members of
the local fraternity
from the nearby college

24:27.733 --> 24:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and other locals, and
basically spewed smoke at the
women as they were marching.

24:31.566 --> 24:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were enveloped in a
huge cloud of black smoke,
dropped firecrackers.

24:34.666 --> 24:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was a scary scene in which
a lot of the women tried not
to run or scream and give

24:40.833 --> 24:42.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the men the reaction
that they wanted.

24:42.866 --> 24:45.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What are
the actions that these women
are taking that they hope have

24:45.633 --> 24:47.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
long-term consequences?

24:47.733 --> 24:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: So, obviously
showing up in the streets with
posters and sort of telling

24:54.100 --> 24:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the town of Buckhannon
that we are here and not
everyone agrees with you.

24:55.500 --> 24:57.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They are lobbying
local representatives.

24:57.733 --> 25:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the women held a town
hall with the Republican --
for the Republican senator,

25:02.633 --> 25:04.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who didn't show up.

25:04.133 --> 25:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, she held this town hall
anyway to an empty chair.

25:06.833 --> 25:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a lot of them are traveling
to meet with other -- they
are part of the Indivisible

25:10.533 --> 25:13.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
group.

25:13.100 --> 25:15.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're traveling to
meet other Indivisible
groups, which is a liberal
anti-Trump grassroots

25:15.166 --> 25:17.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
organization.

25:17.666 --> 25:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they are sort
of connecting the dots
with other grassroots
progressive organizations

25:21.033 --> 25:23.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that are fighting
against Trump's policies
around the country.

25:23.300 --> 25:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And speaking
of around the country, is
this a microcosm of something

25:26.100 --> 25:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that is happening elsewhere?

25:28.700 --> 25:32.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: I do
think this -- Buckhannon
is -- it's one small town
where this is happening,

25:34.166 --> 25:36.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but there are a lot of
indications that there
are women who are doing
this across the country.

25:36.866 --> 25:41.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, 11,000 women are
considering running for office
for the first time, according to

25:41.566 --> 25:43.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
EMILY's List, after
Trump's election.

25:43.966 --> 25:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obviously, the women's march
was a huge show of interest
by women in participating.

25:50.833 --> 25:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Indivisible
groups have been spreading
across the country.

25:52.866 --> 25:54.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think there's
6,000 of them now.

25:54.866 --> 25:59.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And after the story came out,
a lot of women from rural
areas wrote and said that, this

26:01.700 --> 26:04.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really resonated with me and
this is what is going on in our
town as well, in Pennsylvania,

26:04.166 --> 26:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Ohio, across Appalachia,
and basically said
we're also protesting.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is really hard for us here.

26:09.966 --> 26:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is really isolating, because
people don't agree with us,
and we're doing it anyway.

26:12.766 --> 26:14.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
Plenty to follow up on.

26:14.966 --> 26:19.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Liz Flock, thanks
for joining us.

26:21.166 --> 26:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: Thank you.

26:25.300 --> 26:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At the end of
another week jam-packed with
news from Washington, it's

26:31.166 --> 26:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
time for Shields and Brooks.

26:33.200 --> 26:36.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist
Mark Shields and New York
Times columnist David Brooks.

26:36.566 --> 26:38.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, gentleman.

26:38.666 --> 26:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what is there to talk about,
Mark, but yesterday's climate
change decision, the president's

26:45.400 --> 26:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
announcement that the United
States will pull out of
the Paris climate accord?

26:49.966 --> 26:52.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What did you make of it?

26:52.000 --> 26:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: In immediate
impact, Judy, it probably means
less in the American environment

26:58.666 --> 27:03.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than the rules and
regulations already repealed
by his administration
and by his EPA that

27:06.533 --> 27:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were put in force, emissions
controlled by President Obama.

27:10.833 --> 27:15.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, in a larger sense,
it belies and reveals
that president's
sense about the world.

27:18.400 --> 27:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The world is a dangerous,
sinister place.

27:21.400 --> 27:22.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's conspiracies.

27:22.900 --> 27:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Other countries are not
our friends, are partners.

27:26.700 --> 27:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Everything is transactional.

27:28.266 --> 27:30.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are no fixed values.

27:30.266 --> 27:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We saw that, I thought most
dramatically, at NATO, where
the president showed an absolute

27:36.600 --> 27:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
absence of any historical
understanding of
American exceptionalism.

27:40.500 --> 27:45.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, as one who frankly
subscribes to it that
three times in the
20th century the United

27:47.433 --> 27:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States saved the world from
totalitarianism, twice in World
Wars, once in the Cold War,

27:53.300 --> 27:58.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and 124,965 American graves
around the world in cemeteries,
and 94,000 still missing.

27:59.800 --> 28:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I just don't understand.

28:01.333 --> 28:03.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The president knows
that it was for values.

28:03.633 --> 28:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And when NATO has made
mistakes, we have made mistakes.

28:06.633 --> 28:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have been guilty of hubris.

28:08.966 --> 28:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the world is a much
better place because of the
United States' leadership.

28:13.166 --> 28:18.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this was an example of
the United States working with
other nations for a common good

28:19.466 --> 28:20.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to preserve our planet.

28:20.933 --> 28:23.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And he just turned
his back on it.

28:23.066 --> 28:25.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What did you make
of the president's decision and
his argument for why he did it?

28:25.666 --> 28:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, well,
I sort of agree with Mark.

28:27.033 --> 28:28.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was nice to have
an American century.

28:28.433 --> 28:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We were a superpower once.

28:29.700 --> 28:31.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And now we're headed
the way of Portugal.

28:31.700 --> 28:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No, it was --
environmentally, I can't
get super excited about it.

28:36.500 --> 28:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it was a
setback for the cause of
addressing global warming.

28:40.233 --> 28:44.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But, as we have heard
many times, it was a
voluntary agreement.

28:44.633 --> 28:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so this -- and we have done
a very good job, because of
natural gas and fracking and

28:48.433 --> 28:51.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other things, of reducing
emissions over the
last five years or so.

28:51.733 --> 28:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I presume the market
will still work and the
emissions will still come down.

28:55.800 --> 29:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we -- Donald Trump could
have addressed his concerns
about coal workers and stayed

29:00.200 --> 29:01.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the Paris accords.

29:01.133 --> 29:02.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There is nothing block.

29:02.133 --> 29:03.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was totally voluntary.

29:03.866 --> 29:05.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So this wasn't about
global warming.

29:05.466 --> 29:07.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This wasn't about
the environment.

29:07.500 --> 29:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was about sticking a thumb
in the eye of polite society,
the elites, the globalists.

29:14.333 --> 29:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was a Steve Bannon-led
thing designed to change
America's role in the world.

29:18.333 --> 29:23.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so, to me, the
effect is much worse
on the global diplomacy
and the idea of a world

29:24.900 --> 29:27.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
order than it is, at
least in the short-term,
about climate change.

29:27.733 --> 29:29.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the effects, I
think, are ruinous.

29:29.766 --> 29:33.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You can't lead the world
and stick your thumb in
the eye of the world.

29:33.666 --> 29:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People -- if you act extremely
selfishly to other people, they
will start acting extremely

29:37.433 --> 29:38.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
selfishly to you.

29:38.900 --> 29:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that is about to happen.

29:41.133 --> 29:45.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so as the idea that America
could lead the world and
should influence the world and

29:45.766 --> 29:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should have friendship with
other powerful nations in the
world, that's an idea that

29:50.066 --> 29:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
took a big hit this week.

29:52.233 --> 29:55.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, as
we famously heard him
say, yesterday, Mark,
the president said,

29:55.533 --> 29:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm here to represent the
people of Pittsburgh, and
not the people of Paris.

29:59.033 --> 30:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, no, it
was a nice alliterative
line that didn't have
much relevance in reality,

30:05.900 --> 30:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pittsburgh having supported
Hillary Clinton and
basically being a green city.

30:13.066 --> 30:16.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think it was a
political statement.

30:16.400 --> 30:21.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
One can say, in defense
of the president, I
guess, he kept his word.

30:22.566 --> 30:25.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He hasn't been known as
a truth-teller always.

30:25.033 --> 30:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No one has confused him with
George Washington on veracity.

30:28.833 --> 30:33.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But he kept his word
on the Trans-Pacific
treaty, trade treaty.

30:33.633 --> 30:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He kept his word on NATO and
that he was going to belittle
it, or at least diminish it.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he kept his word here.

30:41.166 --> 30:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that was probably
the strongest argument inside.

30:44.833 --> 30:46.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

30:46.900 --> 30:50.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, I'm just struck by the fact
that his is an administration
driven solely by resentment.

30:52.933 --> 30:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He will side with the Steve
Bannon side if that position
will alienate the people he

30:55.566 --> 30:57.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
feels resentful for.

30:57.700 --> 31:01.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He will side with the
regular Republican side
and the budgetary, the
more free market side

31:02.900 --> 31:05.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
if that will offend
elite opinion.

31:05.033 --> 31:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It seems to be all based on
some sense of resentment, a
sense of social inferiority,

31:11.266 --> 31:14.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a sense of fragile ego, him
just wanting to stick the eye
in the people he is resenting.

31:14.266 --> 31:18.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I -- more than any other
time -- we have talked about
Trump not telling the truth a

31:18.433 --> 31:20.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lot over the last year.

31:20.466 --> 31:25.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that global warming speech
to me set new standards of
just being irrelevant to the

31:26.033 --> 31:27.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
facts.

31:27.466 --> 31:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We devote our lives to
talking about the evidence.

31:29.433 --> 31:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We write these wonky
columns about exciting
things and this and that.

31:32.866 --> 31:37.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what Donald Trump said about
the Paris accord is -- just
has no engagement with reality.

31:39.866 --> 31:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fact that somehow we're
bound by this, somehow that
we would be under some sort of

31:42.400 --> 31:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
legal liability if we didn't
abide by the Paris accords,
the fact that the Chinese are

31:47.400 --> 31:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
given permission by Paris to
do this and we're not, all that
has no contact reality, and

31:53.566 --> 31:54.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it doesn't seem like
Donald Trump knows that.

31:54.533 --> 31:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: He doesn't.

31:56.633 --> 31:58.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: As a number
of commentators made, it
doesn't seem like lying.

31:58.200 --> 32:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It just seems like willful
ignorance and disinterest.

32:01.533 --> 32:05.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we have had a lot
of presidents with a
lot of disagreements,
but there has been an

32:05.000 --> 32:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attachment to some sort of
basic research, some basic
contact with reality, which it

32:11.833 --> 32:14.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seems there has just
been a failure of
intellectual virtue here.

32:14.466 --> 32:18.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And because there is some
underlying psychological
issues which is he is
working out, and whatever

32:18.300 --> 32:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he needs to do that, the facts
have to fit that lower reality.

32:22.033 --> 32:24.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

32:24.033 --> 32:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would just add to that, Judy,
what compounds it is not --
if you are on the other side

32:30.500 --> 32:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the argument, you are not
wrong, you are not mistaken,
your facts aren't incorrect.

32:32.833 --> 32:36.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You are evil, you are
part of a conspiracy.

32:36.233 --> 32:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And whatever one thinks, we
are all, all of us, all human
beings, are passengers on this

32:45.400 --> 32:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
little spaceship of
ours with very precious
supplies, vulnerable
supplies of air and water

32:51.633 --> 32:54.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and soil.

32:54.200 --> 32:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, any attempt
to make it rational, to
make it just, to help
human -- make people

33:02.633 --> 33:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more safe and secure and
healthy is to be commended.

33:06.300 --> 33:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's all of a sudden
really did regard this as
selling out the United States.

33:13.566 --> 33:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to cede to China the
leadership in the green
industry, is an abdication.

33:22.500 --> 33:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He accused Barack Obama,
and so did many Republicans,
of leading from the rear.

33:28.966 --> 33:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this is retweeting to the
rear at every possible level.

33:34.700 --> 33:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just cannot overstate
the NATO -- NATO brought a
sustained period of peace, more

33:40.033 --> 33:44.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sustained than any time
since the French Revolution,
to the continent of Europe.

33:44.366 --> 33:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, that is an achievement
of such historical magnitude.

33:48.933 --> 33:49.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And to just dismiss it.

33:49.933 --> 33:51.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He is not even aware of it.

33:51.466 --> 33:53.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't think he understands it.

33:53.766 --> 33:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: From a purely
political standpoint, David, the
president, one assumes he think

33:58.233 --> 33:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this is a smart thing to do.

33:59.733 --> 34:02.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, is it a smart
thing for him to do?

34:02.100 --> 34:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I think so.

34:03.533 --> 34:05.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Yes, I do think so.

34:05.966 --> 34:09.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Environment has never
driven political
voters, I do not think.

34:09.600 --> 34:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can't remember a time
when environmental issues
really rose to that level.

34:13.333 --> 34:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And any time you can pit the
economy vs. the environment,
say I'm siding with the economy,

34:20.266 --> 34:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
politically -- again, not on
the merits, not what I think
of it -- I think it is probably

34:22.666 --> 34:25.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a winning issue.

34:25.066 --> 34:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, finally, just remember,
this is an administration
who is polling and whose
interest is focused

34:29.433 --> 34:32.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on about 12 states.

34:32.400 --> 34:34.433 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And that's a lot
of coal country.

34:34.433 --> 34:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so if people in that
part of the world, with some
justice, some minor justice, see

34:41.733 --> 34:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump as their
savior against the
elites in Paris, then,
politically -- taking aside

34:44.633 --> 34:47.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the merits, politically,
I think it is probably
a good move for him.

34:47.233 --> 34:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you agree
it's winning politically?

34:49.266 --> 34:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I thought
Governor Jerry Brown made a
case last night in his interview

34:52.200 --> 34:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with you, pointed out
that California has
the toughest, greenest
standards of the country,

34:59.100 --> 35:04.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
far more draconian by Trump's
standard, measure, than
anything, environmentally.

35:06.033 --> 35:09.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two million new jobs, a gross
domestic product grown 40
percent fastest than the nation,

35:12.833 --> 35:16.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in spite of, because
of the greenness.

35:16.533 --> 35:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I think a case can be made.

35:20.733 --> 35:22.866 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
But I just think
-- I don't know.

35:22.866 --> 35:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just think there is a limit
to the isolation and this sort
of -- this defensive paranoid,

35:28.933 --> 35:31.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whatever you call
it, nationalism.

35:31.233 --> 35:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It isn't even nationalism.

35:33.333 --> 35:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is just sort of everybody,
all strangers, they are all
-- you know, they are all bad.

35:38.666 --> 35:39.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They wish us no well.

35:39.866 --> 35:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: An us vs. them.

35:41.533 --> 35:43.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: On every matter.

35:43.600 --> 35:47.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, but do you
notice how what used to be
substantive disagreements turn

35:47.166 --> 35:48.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into cultural wars?

35:48.400 --> 35:50.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's like the gun issue.

35:50.466 --> 35:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It used to be the gun issue,
gun control was about which kind
of guns we should have floating

35:53.866 --> 35:55.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
around in our society.

35:55.100 --> 35:57.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But then it became
rural vs. urban.

35:57.500 --> 36:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the substance didn't
actually matter that much.

36:00.466 --> 36:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one has the sense with
global warming it's a not
about substance anymore.

36:04.900 --> 36:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is about what culture
-- in our cultural divide,
which culture are you on?

36:08.900 --> 36:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so he aligned with
one culture, a rural
culture, which is his base.

36:12.466 --> 36:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is why I think, from
his point of view, it solidifies
that, which he needs to

36:16.866 --> 36:18.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
survive.

36:18.966 --> 36:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it seems
like a long time ago, but it
was just -- really just really

36:21.000 --> 36:25.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a couple of days ago, Mark, that
we were hearing reports about
the White House in disarray,

36:27.366 --> 36:31.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president planning to fire
or rearrange - - fire people,
rearrange the staff in an

36:33.400 --> 36:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attempt to get beyond
the focus on the Russia
investigation, everything else.

36:37.933 --> 36:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You couple that with the Paris
announcement, do you see this
White House in any sense getting

36:45.166 --> 36:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
beyond, getting its hands
around the dysfunction that
appears to be gripping...

36:52.300 --> 36:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I really don't.

36:54.100 --> 36:56.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I really don't, Judy.

36:56.666 --> 37:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, just imagine
yourself, you are Reince
Priebus, you are the chief
of staff, and complained

37:02.500 --> 37:06.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to a friend, look, said he
hadn't been able to spend time
with his children for the past

37:07.166 --> 37:08.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
four months.

37:08.400 --> 37:11.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And what does he read
every day in the paper?

37:11.033 --> 37:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president called him
Reincy, refers to him as Reincy.

37:13.600 --> 37:15.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's going to be
ambassador to Greece.

37:15.200 --> 37:16.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They are going to get him out.

37:16.266 --> 37:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're going to replace him.

37:17.333 --> 37:19.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Who is going to replace him?

37:19.366 --> 37:23.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can't be thrive, you can't
be productive in that kind
of an environment, where you

37:23.866 --> 37:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are looking over your shoulder
at who is conspiring over
here and what faction?

37:27.933 --> 37:30.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Are you Kushner
or are you Bannon?

37:30.200 --> 37:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it just -- Judy, they
work long hours, they work
hard, and they're uncertain.

37:37.033 --> 37:38.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're being sniped at.

37:38.866 --> 37:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is no appreciation,
there's no sense
of shared mission.

37:41.333 --> 37:44.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the reward is when
you tell the president
what he wants to hear.

37:44.500 --> 37:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the antithesis of Jim
Baker and Ronald Reagan, where
a president was secure enough

37:51.533 --> 37:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and confident enough to ask a
chief of staff for advice that
he didn't want to hear, that

37:56.000 --> 37:57.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was tough.

37:57.933 --> 37:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does
all this matter, David,
quickly or inside baseball?

37:59.933 --> 38:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, it
matters if we don't have an
effective administration.

38:02.633 --> 38:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reince Priebus has the ultimate
job security right now, because
nobody else wants the job,

38:07.233 --> 38:09.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
so they can't get rid
of him, because somebody
has got to do it.

38:09.366 --> 38:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I do think it makes the
prospect of a functional White
House very remote, because

38:15.766 --> 38:17.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you can't get new people
because they don't want it.

38:17.266 --> 38:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The current people are in some
sort of war with each other.

38:19.700 --> 38:22.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And every time we hear
about something internal,
whether it was the
decision-making over global

38:22.266 --> 38:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
warming, or the shambolic
attempt to get an FBI
director, it just sounds
like disorganization.

38:27.033 --> 38:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And more reports
tonight about investigations
with the Mueller probe.

38:33.133 --> 38:38.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
David Brooks, Mark
Shields, thank you both.

38:47.500 --> 38:52.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Monday marks the 50th
anniversary of the beginning
of the June 1967 Six-Day
War, fought between

38:54.533 --> 38:57.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Israel and several
neighboring Arab nations.

38:57.666 --> 39:00.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The swift Israeli
victory was total.

39:00.533 --> 39:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But no one knew at the time,
and in the war's aftermath,
that many of the dividing lines

39:07.433 --> 39:10.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
struck would define
relations in the region
for the ensuing 50 years.

39:12.500 --> 39:15.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Former "NewsHour" correspondent
Terence Smith reported on
the war then for The New York

39:15.466 --> 39:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Times, and he remembers those
historic days for us now.

39:18.900 --> 39:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TERENCE SMITH, Former "NewsHour"
Correspondent: The Six-Day War
between Israel and her Arab

39:23.233 --> 39:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
neighbors began 50 years ago
shortly after dawn on the hot,
dry morning of June 5, 1967.

39:32.666 --> 39:37.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the course of six frantic
days, Israel decimated the
armies and air forces of Egypt,

39:39.500 --> 39:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jordan and Syria, and redrew
the map of the Middle East.

39:43.433 --> 39:48.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The war created a
stalemate between Israel
and the Palestinians
in Jerusalem and the

39:49.500 --> 39:51.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
West Bank that
persists to this day.

39:51.600 --> 39:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is the same stand-off
that confronted President
Trump on his recent visit.

39:58.533 --> 40:02.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I covered the battle for
Jerusalem and the West
Bank as an incredibly
green, inexperienced

40:03.300 --> 40:05.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
correspondent for
The New York Times.

40:05.500 --> 40:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I had arrived in Israel just 10
days before on my first foreign
assignment for the paper,

40:11.800 --> 40:14.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and I knew nothing.

40:14.766 --> 40:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Scrambling after the Israeli
army units as they conquered the
ancient Old City of Jerusalem,

40:21.766 --> 40:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I followed them inside as they
took control of the Western
Wall, the retaining wall of

40:26.066 --> 40:28.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Second Temple.

40:28.100 --> 40:32.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Suddenly, the troops were
face-to-face with the
holiest site in Judaism.

40:34.066 --> 40:38.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Israelis had not been
able to visit or pray
at the wall since 1948.

40:38.966 --> 40:41.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was quite a moment.

40:41.066 --> 40:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I covered the Israeli units
as they swept through the West
Bank, driving Jordan's Arab

40:47.733 --> 40:50.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
legion from Bethlehem
down to Jericho and to the
banks of the Jordan River.

40:52.766 --> 40:56.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Burned-out Jordanian tanks
and armored personnel
carriers littered the highway.

40:57.833 --> 41:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Where the troops stopped then
is the armistice line today.

41:01.933 --> 41:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fighting in Jerusalem
and on the West Bank had been
fierce, with heavy casualties,

41:08.133 --> 41:10.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but it was largely
over in 96 hours.

41:10.633 --> 41:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Israelis and Palestinians
alike were stunned.

41:13.500 --> 41:18.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Suddenly, two peoples
who had been separated by
the so-called Green Line
for 19 years confronted

41:20.500 --> 41:22.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
each other.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Both sides were curious
about the other.

41:24.066 --> 41:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As soon as they could,
ordinary Israelis poured
into the walled Old City.

41:31.133 --> 41:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Curiosity and the universal
human instinct for bargains
drove them into the shops in

41:35.933 --> 41:37.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the narrow streets
of the Old City.

41:37.966 --> 41:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The shelves on the Jordanian
side were stocked with duty-free
electronics and small luxuries

41:44.233 --> 41:49.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that were unavailable
or much more expensive
in high-tariff Israel.

41:50.433 --> 41:52.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The bargains flew
off the shelves.

41:52.866 --> 41:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And not just ordinary Israelis.

41:55.266 --> 42:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Teddy Kollek, the mayor of
Israeli Jerusalem, and Israel's
defense minister, Moshe Dayan,

42:02.333 --> 42:06.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
both famous antiquities
collectors, descended
on the Arab dealers
in East Jerusalem and

42:08.033 --> 42:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
negotiated for ancient treasures
to add to their collections.

42:12.300 --> 42:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Palestinians began to explore
West Jerusalem and meet
Israelis for the first time.

42:19.266 --> 42:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A few had the nerve to travel
to Jaffa to visit homes that
they or their parents had

42:23.366 --> 42:26.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fled in 1948.

42:26.100 --> 42:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the process of getting
to know each other in
the first weeks after
the war, Palestinians

42:33.133 --> 42:36.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
discovered that Israelis were
not, in fact, 10 feet-tall, and
Israelis found that Palestinians

42:38.200 --> 42:42.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
were not, in fact,
all cutthroats.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It wasn't all
sweetness and light.

42:44.100 --> 42:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A lot of blood had been spilled.

42:46.633 --> 42:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But people on either side of the
Green Line wanted to see what
they could while they could.

42:53.600 --> 42:57.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a shared assumption
that, because the Israeli
victory had been so total, that,

42:59.000 --> 43:02.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this time, some sort of
peace was inevitable.

43:02.933 --> 43:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was an assumption, not
necessarily an aspiration,
not for everyone.

43:09.900 --> 43:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People on both sides expected
that the cease-fire would be
replaced by an agreement, Israel

43:15.333 --> 43:19.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would give up some of the
occupied territory, just as it
had during the Suez crisis nine

43:21.033 --> 43:24.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
years earlier, and that,
this time, finally,
there would be peace.

43:25.700 --> 43:27.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How could it not?

43:27.733 --> 43:32.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
No one I spoke to in
those months after the
war thought that the
stand-off between Israel

43:32.433 --> 43:36.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the Palestinians
would last for 50 years.

43:36.633 --> 43:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even the deeply cynical Moshe
Dayan famously said he was
just waiting for the phone to

43:42.933 --> 43:46.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ring from the other
side to negotiate peace.

43:46.700 --> 43:48.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It wasn't to be.

43:48.733 --> 43:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
By the fall of that year, the
Arab states met in Khartoum
and agreed on their famous

43:54.966 --> 43:59.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
three no's: no negotiation,
no recognition, no
peace with Israel.

44:01.100 --> 44:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time, the first
Jewish settlers had established
a rump settlement on the West

44:06.166 --> 44:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Bank, promising not to leave.

44:08.366 --> 44:13.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I remember asking Dayan at a
news conference, what was going
to be done about the settlers?

44:15.266 --> 44:19.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"If we can solve the big
issues," he told me, "the
settlers will be no problem."

44:21.266 --> 44:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, there are some 400,000
Israelis settlers in the West
Bank and 350,000 more in East

44:28.100 --> 44:30.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Jerusalem.

44:30.200 --> 44:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are still promising not
to leave, and constitute a
major political voice on the

44:35.600 --> 44:38.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right in Israel.

44:38.033 --> 44:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the elements of
a deadlock, the same
deadlock that has defied a
solution for 50 years, were

44:44.233 --> 44:49.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in place before
the year was out.

44:51.100 --> 44:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight:
There was a time when summer
TV was largely confined

45:01.966 --> 45:03.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to reruns.

45:03.900 --> 45:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that has changed
dramatically in the
world of streaming video.

45:06.866 --> 45:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, in fact, a new summer
season is under way.

45:10.733 --> 45:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has a look.

45:12.833 --> 45:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The summer season
has changed so much, that it's
now when some of the best-known

45:15.733 --> 45:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shows debut new episodes.

45:17.800 --> 45:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
High on that list, the fantasy
series "Game of Thrones," which
run the Emmy for best drama

45:22.133 --> 45:23.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and is back on HBO.

45:23.633 --> 45:27.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Orange Is the New Black" will
air new episodes on Netflix.

45:27.166 --> 45:30.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NBC returns with its
surprise comedy hit
"The Carmichael Show."

45:30.900 --> 45:35.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there are plenty
of new options such
as "Claws," a Southern
crime drama with a comic

45:35.466 --> 45:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
edge that comes to TNT, a show
about the founding of the first
women's wrestling federation

45:42.433 --> 45:45.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
called "GLOW" on Netflix, and a
Showtime drama about struggling
comics in the 1970s called

45:46.933 --> 45:49.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
"I'm Dying Up Here."

45:49.000 --> 45:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two TV critics, I hope they're
not dying where we are talking
to them, from all of television.

45:53.366 --> 45:58.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're going to help us
sort through the season, Eric
Deggans of NPR and Sonia Saraiya

45:58.166 --> 45:59.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of "Variety."

45:59.166 --> 46:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thanks, both, for joining us.

46:00.700 --> 46:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't know how you keep up
with this, but help us out here.

46:02.733 --> 46:06.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
First of all, Eric,
summer season, does it
actually mean anything?

46:06.833 --> 46:08.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is there any rhyme
or reason anymore?

46:08.933 --> 46:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC DEGGANS, National Public
Radio: Well, you know, TV is
a business that loves habits.

46:12.566 --> 46:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, for the
broadcasters especially,
there is a summer season.

46:16.233 --> 46:21.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think it's less so for
the cable nets, and it's
even less so for the
streamers like Netflix,

46:22.700 --> 46:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which seem to churn out a new
series just about every week.

46:25.700 --> 46:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there is a sense that the
TV season is slowing down a
little bit, and we're seeing

46:29.000 --> 46:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shows that are less than
marquee shows debuting
during the next few months.

46:33.200 --> 46:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, Sonia, let
me start with you with one of
the new ones coming -- I mean,

46:36.400 --> 46:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of the old ones coming
back, a successful one, is
Aziz Ansari's "Master of None."

46:41.300 --> 46:43.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's take -- first, let's
take a quick look at a clip.

46:43.600 --> 46:46.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALESSANDRA MASTRONARDI,
Actress: This is really good.

46:46.200 --> 46:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AZIZ ANSARI, Actor: I told you.

46:48.433 --> 46:51.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Aren't you glad you
expanded your culinary
horizons beyond Italian?

46:51.433 --> 46:52.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALESSANDRA
MASTRONARDI: Yes, I am.

46:52.433 --> 46:53.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You're right.

46:53.700 --> 46:54.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What else should I try
when I'm in New York?

46:54.633 --> 46:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AZIZ ANSARI: Indian food.

46:55.900 --> 46:56.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALESSANDRA MASTRONARDI:
No, nobody likes curry.

46:56.700 --> 46:58.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AZIZ ANSARI: Racist.

46:58.166 --> 46:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALESSANDRA MASTRONARDI: I
said I don't like curry food.

46:59.400 --> 47:02.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I didn't say I don't
like curry people.

47:02.533 --> 47:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AZIZ ANSARI: All right, I was
kidding earlier, but the phrase
curry people, definitely racist.

47:11.300 --> 47:12.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALESSANDRA MASTRONARDI:
I'm not racist.

47:12.500 --> 47:13.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AZIZ ANSARI: You can't
say curry person.

47:13.933 --> 47:15.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm not a curry person.

47:15.166 --> 47:17.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm not defined by the
flavors my people enjoy.

47:17.166 --> 47:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sonia, I saw you
both actually smiling watching
or even listening to that.

47:21.366 --> 47:23.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Sonia, tell us why
you like that show.

47:23.433 --> 47:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SONIA SARAIYA, "Variety": You
know, "Master of None" is --
it's such a delicate little,

47:27.866 --> 47:29.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
beautiful show.

47:29.100 --> 47:33.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Its a half-hour, but
it's so cinematic.

47:33.366 --> 47:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is -- actually, the
second season references
Italian cinema a lot.

47:37.233 --> 47:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, it's Aziz Ansari more
or less playing himself, you
know, trying to understand his

47:43.233 --> 47:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
life and figure out the world.

47:45.233 --> 47:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, a big thing
that motivates him, as you
can sort of tell, that's kind

47:48.666 --> 47:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a date that he is on in
that clip, and, you know,
figuring out his love life is a

47:52.766 --> 47:54.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
big part of it.

47:54.766 --> 47:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But at the end of the first
season, he decided he wanted
to go to Italy and learn how to

47:58.000 --> 48:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
make pasta because that
was something that he
wanted to do in his life.

48:01.766 --> 48:05.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The second season is
about him broadening
his horizons even more.

48:05.500 --> 48:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is like a lovely little
vacation, that show.

48:07.933 --> 48:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Eric, I'm going
to have you tell us about "House
of Cards," because, indeed,

48:11.633 --> 48:14.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Kevin Spacey and Robin
Wright are back as Frank
and Claire Underwood.

48:14.533 --> 48:16.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let's look at a
little clip of that.

48:16.366 --> 48:19.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROBIN WRIGHT, Actress: Why
did you ask him to leave?

48:19.200 --> 48:24.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEVIN SPACEY, Actor: Because
I just wanted to look in your
eyes one more time before

48:28.166 --> 48:31.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we do this.

48:31.766 --> 48:36.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ROBIN WRIGHT: Francis,
we're doing this.

48:42.066 --> 48:44.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He can't save us.

48:44.800 --> 48:46.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He invented term limits.

48:46.233 --> 48:48.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Eric,
they are still doing it.

48:48.800 --> 48:49.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are still plotting.

48:49.966 --> 48:51.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It goes on and on.

48:51.700 --> 48:53.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ERIC DEGGANS: Yes.

48:53.733 --> 48:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, I know
am so people have grown
tired of "House of Cards."

48:56.600 --> 48:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, if you are one
of those people, you are not
going to necessarily like the

48:59.966 --> 49:02.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
new season.

49:02.133 --> 49:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the new season does have a
lot of political machinations
that I think are sort of the

49:06.833 --> 49:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
heart of the show's appeal.

49:08.766 --> 49:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it also really deals with
the tension and the partnership
between these two very

49:13.033 --> 49:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
singular characters, Frank
Underwood by Kevin Spacey and
Claire Underwood played by Robin

49:18.500 --> 49:20.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Wright.

49:20.466 --> 49:23.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let's look
ahead at some new programs that
you are looking forward to.

49:23.366 --> 49:25.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Sonia, start us
off, start us off.

49:25.066 --> 49:27.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What are a couple of
things you really want
to let us know about?

49:27.600 --> 49:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SONIA SARAIYA: Yes, absolutely.

49:29.600 --> 49:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, there is this crazy
little show called "Claws" on
TNT that is debuting next week,

49:34.433 --> 49:36.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I think.

49:36.500 --> 49:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it stars Niecy Nash as a
manicurist who kind of also
dabbles in some mob activity,

49:43.400 --> 49:46.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and it takes place in
Manatee County in Florida.

49:46.000 --> 49:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And just everything
about it is so different.

49:47.666 --> 49:51.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It is so different
from most other stuff
you would find on TV.

49:51.233 --> 49:52.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The nails are
amazing, obviously.

49:52.733 --> 49:54.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The fashion, the style
is just so much fun.

49:54.966 --> 49:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you get to see these women
who are painting nails also
launder money and maybe commit

50:01.633 --> 50:03.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a few murders here and there.

50:03.566 --> 50:06.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is something a little
bit silly and a little
bit fun about it too.

50:06.066 --> 50:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it also really takes a
look at some of the real issues
that affect people in places

50:10.000 --> 50:12.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that don't often make
it to your TV screen.

50:12.066 --> 50:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I'm really looking forward
to see how that goes too.

50:14.133 --> 50:17.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ERIC DEGGANS: Well, you
mentioned at the start
of this segment "GLOW,"
the Netflix series

50:17.900 --> 50:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the -- well,
the gorgeous ladies of
wrestling is what I think.

50:22.433 --> 50:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is about the start of
a female wrestling league.

50:29.333 --> 50:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it is really the start about
these sort of lovable losers
and their attempts to sort

50:35.000 --> 50:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of find themselves while
they build this very
fledgling operation,
which is a female-centered

50:40.333 --> 50:42.833 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
wrestling league
in the mid-'80s.

50:42.833 --> 50:45.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it is a show that
kind of sneaks up on you.

50:45.666 --> 50:50.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, Marc Maron is
great as the sort of B-movie
director who decides to try

50:53.533 --> 50:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and find another career by
starting this wrestling league.

50:57.866 --> 51:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would compare it a little
more favorably to another
show that you mentioned called

51:01.100 --> 51:06.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"I'm Dying Up Here," a Showtime
series about young comics
working out of a legendary comic

51:09.366 --> 51:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nightclub in Los Angeles.

51:11.300 --> 51:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is fictionalized, but it
also has real people in it.

51:13.600 --> 51:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is based on a book that
is actually about very real
comics like David Letterman and

51:17.800 --> 51:20.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jay Leno and how they
started in Los Angeles.

51:20.633 --> 51:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And because the show has a hard
time walking that line between
fictional characters that

51:25.300 --> 51:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it takes liberties with and
real characters, like Johnny
Carson and Richard Pryor, who

51:29.500 --> 51:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also show up, I think
the show isn't quite as
impactful as it could be.

51:32.666 --> 51:37.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it is also a show about
lovable losers trying to find
themselves and make it in an

51:39.700 --> 51:43.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
industry that is really very
difficult, which is Hollywood
in the late 1970s, early '80s.

51:45.500 --> 51:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
one bonus, real quick for me,
if you would, some show that

51:48.000 --> 51:51.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you love, but you
don't think has gotten
enough attention, Eric?

51:51.533 --> 51:54.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ERIC DEGGANS: It's not
in new episodes yet.

51:54.433 --> 51:55.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It will come back.

51:55.866 --> 51:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is a show called
"Throwing Shade" on TV Land.

51:58.000 --> 52:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is a late-night talk show
with a feminist and a gay man
talking about the day's news,

52:04.800 --> 52:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two points of view that are
woefully underrepresented
in the late-night scheme.

52:07.300 --> 52:09.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I thought it was
brilliant when it was on.

52:09.666 --> 52:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it should come back to
new episodes relatively soon.

52:12.200 --> 52:13.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK.

52:13.366 --> 52:14.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sonia?

52:14.866 --> 52:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SONIA SARAIYA: I am going to
go with "The Carmichael Show."

52:16.366 --> 52:19.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is an NBC sitcom that is
coming into its third season.

52:19.066 --> 52:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is this little show that
has been running on the summer.

52:23.533 --> 52:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I feel like, every season,
it comes up with even more
topics and even more humor

52:30.466 --> 52:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than -- to tackle in this,
like, fascinating way that --
I just think everyone should be

52:34.666 --> 52:36.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
watching this show.

52:36.766 --> 52:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sonia Saraiya
of "Variety," Eric Deggans of
NPR, thank you both very much.

shares five great books
that offer heartfelt
wisdom about -- without

52:59.433 --> 53:01.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
being trite.

53:01.033 --> 53:05.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our
Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:07.833 --> 53:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Robert Costa is preparing
for "Washington Week," which
airs later tonight on PBS.

53:10.500 --> 53:12.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, Bob, what's on tap?

53:12.533 --> 53:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: Well, Judy,
tonight, the deal-maker
becomes disrupter in chief.

53:16.366 --> 53:21.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Our reporters roundtable
will take a closer
look at the controversy
behind President Trump's

53:22.566 --> 53:24.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
decision to ditch the
Paris climate treaty.

53:24.566 --> 53:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's later tonight on
"Washington Week" - - Judy.

53:26.933 --> 53:30.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you
know we will be watching.

53:30.066 --> 53:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And tomorrow on "PBS NewsHour
Weekend," a report from
Cambodia, where rapid economic

53:36.200 --> 53:39.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
growth is forcing
many from their homes.

53:39.166 --> 53:40.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

53:40.500 --> 53:41.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:41.500 --> 53:42.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Have a great weekend.

53:42.500 --> 53:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you, and good night.
