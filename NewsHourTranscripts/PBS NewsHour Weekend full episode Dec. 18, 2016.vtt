DON'T HAVE THAT POWER THAT THEY

05:21.567 --> 05:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
USED TO.

05:22.233 --> 05:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN ADDITION, THE WHOLE BUNCH OF

FIGHT TRUMP, THEY MAY BE UNDER A

05:37.833 --> 05:40.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOT OF PRESSURE TO NOT TO DO IT.

05:40.567 --> 05:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN YOU THINK THAT'S BAD, THE

05:42.433 --> 05:45.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATE LEVEL, 28 IN REPUBLICAN

05:52.533 --> 05:53.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASICALLY HOLD SWAY.

05:53.467 --> 05:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IF YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT YOU'RE

05:54.833 --> 05:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOKING UP FOR FROM A VERY DEEP

05:57.833 --> 05:58.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOME.

05:58.867 --> 06:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: WHEN IT COMES TO

06:00.900 --> 06:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REPUBLICANS IT IS A MIXED

06:02.433 --> 06:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

PRESIDENT.

06:06.833 --> 06:08.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THIS IS WHERE THE NEW

06:08.867 --> 06:10.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONGRESS CAN GET REALLY

06:10.067 --> 06:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERESTING.

06:10.833 --> 06:13.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK 11 OF THEM REFUSE TO

06:13.967 --> 06:14.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENDORSE TRUMP DURING THE

06:14.967 --> 06:16.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAMPAIGN AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF

06:16.767 --> 06:18.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEM THAT HAVE SERIOUS

06:18.400 --> 06:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPOSITION TO WHAT SOME OF

06:20.500 --> 06:22.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP'S APPOINTEES APPARENTLY

06:22.933 --> 06:25.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE PLANNING TO DO IN TERMS OF

06:25.667 --> 06:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIA.

06:26.100 --> 06:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN McCAIN, LINDSEY GRAHAM

06:28.733 --> 06:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS VERY HOSTILE TO THAT IDEA.

06:34.300 --> 06:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IF THE DEMOCRATS COULD STAY

06:36.600 --> 06:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNITED ON APPOINTMENTS AND

06:37.800 --> 06:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISSUES, THE WAY THE REPUBLICANS

06:39.733 --> 06:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DID UNDER OBAMA, IT WOULD ONLY

06:42.100 --> 06:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKE THREE REPUBLICANS CROSSING

06:44.400 --> 06:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE AISLE TO BLOCK SOME OF

06:46.500 --> 06:48.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP'S INITIATIVES.

06:48.467 --> 06:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEN YOU WOULD HAVE A SHIFTING

06:50.400 --> 06:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BALANCE BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME

06:51.900 --> 06:53.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSERVATIVE FISCAL REPUBLICANS

06:53.067 --> 06:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO ARE NOT GOING TO LIKE THE

06:54.933 --> 06:58.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IDEA SAY IF TRUMP LAUNCHES A BIG

06:58.300 --> 07:00.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT.

07:00.267 --> 07:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE STORY MAY NOT BE TOLD OF

07:02.300 --> 07:03.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REPUBLICANS.

07:03.300 --> 07:05.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: YOU THINK WE NEED

07:05.267 --> 07:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE

07:06.433 --> 07:07.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FEDERAL COURT.

07:07.067 --> 07:07.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YES.

07:07.967 --> 07:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK BACK OVER

07:08.933 --> 07:10.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE EIGHT YEARS OF OBAMA SOME OF

07:10.867 --> 07:12.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT HE WANTED TO DO WAS BLOCKED

07:12.967 --> 07:15.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

07:38.533 --> 07:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN THEY ABOLISHED THE

07:41.233 --> 07:43.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FILIBUSTER, IT PUT SEVERAL ON

07:43.067 --> 07:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE APPEALS COURT, APPEALS COURT

07:45.300 --> 07:46.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT BELOW THE SUPREME COURT

07:46.467 --> 07:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY NOW HAVE A MAJORITY.

07:48.433 --> 07:50.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO UNTIL TRUMP CAN FILL THE

07:50.467 --> 07:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VACANCIES THAT EXIST OR UNTIL HE

07:52.133 --> 07:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
