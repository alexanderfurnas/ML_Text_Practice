HARI SREENIVASAN: Now a
lesson in communication
from an unlikely, but
very familiar source.

00:04.700 --> 00:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the latest addition to
the "NewsHour" Bookshelf.

00:07.333 --> 00:09.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has that.

00:09.433 --> 00:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One enormous
turn in the life of Alan Alda,
his 11- year run in the 1970s

00:16.100 --> 00:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and '80s as the star of
"MASH," one of the most beloved
programs in television history.

00:23.066 --> 00:24.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALAN ALDA, Author, "If
I Understood You, Would
I Have This Look on
My Face?": Hello, and

00:24.300 --> 00:26.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
welcome to "Scientific
American Frontiers."

00:26.366 --> 00:29.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Another, by
his own account, came in 1993,
when he began to host the PBS

00:31.133 --> 00:33.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
series "Scientific
American Frontiers."

00:33.633 --> 00:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was a non-scientist learning
on the go, using his trademark
humor and wit to get the

00:40.133 --> 00:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
experts to explain complicated
ideas in accessible language.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALAN ALDA: What keeps the
water from going in here?

00:45.333 --> 00:46.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I mean, it's...

00:46.600 --> 00:48.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: Well, it's
actually tapered.

00:48.100 --> 00:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you look at the hatch,
it's like a porthole.

00:49.266 --> 00:50.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALAN ALDA: Oh, I see.

00:50.566 --> 00:52.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: And pressure
pushes them down.

00:52.700 --> 00:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN ALDA: What I brought
to it was curiosity and
a huge fund of ignorance.

00:55.033 --> 00:57.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

00:57.133 --> 01:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN ALDA: And I just was
after them until it could fill
up the ignorance a little bit

01:00.133 --> 01:02.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with real stuff.

01:02.133 --> 01:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that process of connecting
with them, getting them to
be who they were, because

01:09.433 --> 01:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they were worried about
getting me to understand it,
so it was much more personal.

01:15.833 --> 01:17.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's when I realized
that you could build on that.

01:17.900 --> 01:20.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You can help people
do that all the time.

01:20.366 --> 01:22.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
OK, now he's leaving.

01:22.966 --> 01:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: First, he
worked to help scientists
and science writers do
it all the time, helping

01:26.433 --> 01:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to found the Center for
Communicating Science at Stony
Brook University in New York.

01:33.466 --> 01:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now comes a book for the rest
of us, with the colorful title
"If I Understood You, Would

01:37.500 --> 01:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I Have This Look on My Face?"

01:39.566 --> 01:44.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Alan Alda and I met recently at
Lisner Auditorium in Washington
before he gave a talk about

01:45.500 --> 01:47.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the problem and promise
of communicating.

01:47.533 --> 01:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN ALDA: What I think I found
is, that it's all based on a
personal connection, that if

01:53.733 --> 01:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can sort of understand in some
way, make some approximation
of what you are thinking

01:59.233 --> 02:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and feeling, it's easier
for me to get inside your
head with my message.

02:04.700 --> 02:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If I don't know how you're
receiving it, if I can't see
how it's landing on you, then

02:09.200 --> 02:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm just spraying it at you.

02:11.300 --> 02:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm just trying to pour it
over your head, but I'm not
really connecting with you.

02:14.033 --> 02:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, that connection -- this
is what I don't understand --
that connection with another

02:18.333 --> 02:20.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
person feels so good.

02:20.233 --> 02:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why do we retreat from it?

02:22.033 --> 02:24.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't understand that.

02:24.166 --> 02:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We're living in
a time where there's not only
skepticism, but even outright

02:27.700 --> 02:31.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hostility from a lot of
people towards science.

02:31.533 --> 02:33.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is that just a
communication problem?

02:33.566 --> 02:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN ALDA: I think it's largely
a communication problem, because
there has to be trust, and

02:40.333 --> 02:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you get trust through --
one way you get trust is
through good communication.

02:45.466 --> 02:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are lives at stake.

02:46.800 --> 02:47.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Take doctors.

02:47.966 --> 02:49.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

02:49.966 --> 02:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN ALDA: When patients
regard their doctors as being
empathic, at least one study has

02:56.233 --> 03:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shown that the patients are
19 percent more likely to
follow the doctor's advice.

03:01.866 --> 03:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, in that 19 percent, I
imagine some lives are at stake.

03:04.433 --> 03:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes,
so some of this is
life-and-death communication.

03:06.566 --> 03:07.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ALAN ALDA: Yes.

03:07.566 --> 03:08.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

03:08.566 --> 03:10.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

03:10.700 --> 03:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN ALDA: Science needs to
be understood by the public,
so they can support science.

03:13.300 --> 03:18.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't tell the people I
care about the most the most
important thing I can tell them,

03:19.100 --> 03:21.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that I do care.

03:21.133 --> 03:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For Alda, better
communicating starts with better
person-to-person relating,

03:25.100 --> 03:27.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a concept he had to
learn as a young actor.

03:27.666 --> 03:30.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ALAN ALDA: I knew you
were supposed to relate
in the beginning.

03:30.133 --> 03:31.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

03:31.633 --> 03:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALAN ALDA: And I would do
the best I could to relate.

03:33.700 --> 03:37.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I thought it meant leaning
into the other person's face,
so I was sort of stooped over

03:37.066 --> 03:38.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
most of the time.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

03:40.966 --> 03:43.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN ALDA: But, little
by little, I realized you
can relate to somebody
on the stage even

03:43.266 --> 03:44.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
if their back is turned to you.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You pick up whatever
clues you can.

03:46.900 --> 03:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when you don't have clues
to pick up, you can estimate
what they're probably thinking

03:50.633 --> 03:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by virtue of what's just been
said, or what you have said,
or what you have just written

03:55.400 --> 03:57.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

03:57.433 --> 04:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can picture what the
reader is thinking with
each sentence you put down.

04:02.566 --> 04:04.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It really affects all
forms of communication.

04:04.500 --> 04:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In several
chapters of the book, you
describe these training sessions

04:07.800 --> 04:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that you had with
scientists and many others.

04:09.933 --> 04:12.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But then you talk about
improv classes, right?

04:12.933 --> 04:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Improv, we think of as comedy.

04:15.033 --> 04:16.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALAN ALDA: I know.

04:16.700 --> 04:20.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Most improvisation that
people are aware of is
comedy improvisation.

04:20.333 --> 04:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But that's not what we teach.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We teach a much purer
form of improvisation in
the form of exercises.

04:28.400 --> 04:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're all designed one
on top of the other, starting
with a very basic kind of

04:34.500 --> 04:39.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exercise that enables you to
do the next one, and then that
enables you to do the next one,

04:39.000 --> 04:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and they all put you in
touch with the other person.

04:42.433 --> 04:46.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You have to observe the
other person, and really
carefully to improvise.

04:46.500 --> 04:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have to know -- I have to
know, from your body language
and your face, what you're doing

04:52.400 --> 04:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and what you're thinking.

04:53.400 --> 04:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm reading your face right now.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's really fun.

04:55.400 --> 04:56.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Let's make it...

04:56.400 --> 04:57.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

04:57.400 --> 04:58.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What's going on?

04:58.400 --> 04:59.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

04:59.400 --> 05:01.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ALAN ALDA: Yes.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, I hear you following me,
and then I hear you thinking,
I wonder what I will ask

05:03.500 --> 05:04.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
next?

05:04.500 --> 05:05.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

05:05.500 --> 05:06.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Really?

05:06.500 --> 05:07.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You could see that?

05:07.500 --> 05:09.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

05:09.166 --> 05:09.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ALAN ALDA: Yes, from
-- yes, mostly when you
look down at the paper.

05:09.833 --> 05:10.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

05:10.766 --> 05:11.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, right.

05:11.566 --> 05:12.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's a dead giveaway.

05:12.500 --> 05:13.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Hmm.

05:13.733 --> 05:14.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALAN ALDA: Yes, but
I'm picking it up.

05:14.500 --> 05:15.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You know.

05:15.500 --> 05:17.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's so funny.

05:17.533 --> 05:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Once in a while I will be
talking to somebody and I will
think I'm connected to them.

05:20.066 --> 05:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I will say, wait a second.

05:21.366 --> 05:23.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
In my head, I will say this.

05:23.466 --> 05:24.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What color is his eyes?

05:24.833 --> 05:27.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What color are his eyes?

05:27.533 --> 05:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's the shape of his nose?

05:28.533 --> 05:30.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

05:30.133 --> 05:32.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And then you realize,
what, you're not really
paying attention.

05:32.200 --> 05:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN ALDA: I got -- I realize,
when I think back, there's
been sort of a blob where your

05:34.400 --> 05:36.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
face would -- should be.

05:36.066 --> 05:37.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

05:37.500 --> 05:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I hope I
haven't dissolved to blobness.

05:39.266 --> 05:41.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALAN ALDA: No, you're
not blobby at all, no.

05:41.333 --> 05:42.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK.

05:42.333 --> 05:44.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

05:44.366 --> 05:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's good to know, and also
good to see in his work with
scientists and writers an

05:46.766 --> 05:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attempt to bridge the worlds
of science and the arts.

05:50.633 --> 05:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALAN ALDA: They didn't used
to be kept apart so much.

05:57.633 --> 06:01.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Science and art, or the arts
and humanities often were --
in Greek times and later, were

06:03.133 --> 06:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
considered to be different
aspects of the same inquiry,
the same exploration of being

06:08.800 --> 06:11.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
alive in the universe.

06:11.066 --> 06:16.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
