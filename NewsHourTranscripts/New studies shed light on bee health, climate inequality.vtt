JUDY WOODRUFF: Time now for our
weekly segment on science and
technology, the Leading Edge.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this week, Hari Sreenivasan
is here with an update on a
pair of important stories.

00:09.733 --> 00:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: They are
important findings and analyses
on a pair of stories we have

00:13.900 --> 00:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
long been covering, the
health of bees and the
impacts of climate change.

00:17.400 --> 00:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A recent study looked at
the economic consequences
of climate change and
concluded it will make

00:22.033 --> 00:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the U.S. poorer and more unequal
if present trends continue.

00:26.566 --> 00:28.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The South would be
hit the hardest.

00:28.600 --> 00:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A different set of studies
looked at the health of bees in
connection to insecticides used

00:32.700 --> 00:34.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in crops.

00:34.233 --> 00:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bees are critical for our
global food production.

00:36.333 --> 00:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Honeybees alone are
responsible for pollinating
$15 billion of U.S. crops.

00:43.733 --> 00:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The new papers demonstrated
the popular insecticide
used in agriculture
called neonicotinoids

00:47.300 --> 00:49.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can be harmful to bees.

00:49.400 --> 00:51.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Miles O'Brien is with us again.

00:51.766 --> 00:55.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Miles, we have been
looking at or scientists
have been thinking
about the chemicals that

00:55.833 --> 01:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are used in insecticides as
kind of one of the number one
culprits for colony collapse

01:00.533 --> 01:01.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for a long time.

01:01.766 --> 01:03.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, what is so new
about these studies?

01:03.033 --> 01:05.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well,
you're right, Hari.

01:05.066 --> 01:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There have been a lot of studies
in the past looking at bees
and these insecticides, which

01:08.366 --> 01:13.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are coated on the seeds
and absorbed -- they call
it systemic to the plants.

01:15.366 --> 01:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have been widely used for
a decade, an alternative to
spraying insecticides on the

01:17.733 --> 01:19.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
plant as they grow.

01:19.333 --> 01:21.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The concern is that they
can harm pollinators.

01:21.633 --> 01:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, so far, that's only
been a theory in the lab.

01:25.633 --> 01:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Separate teams in Europe and
Canada tested the possible
link between these neonics and

01:30.500 --> 01:33.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bee losses in the field
for the first time.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They placed bee colonies close
to crops that had been treated
with the neonicotinoids and

01:39.133 --> 01:41.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
other colonies far
away from agriculture.

01:41.333 --> 01:45.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They sampled a variety
of specimens, pollen,
nectar, larvae, bees
themselves, of course.

01:47.300 --> 01:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they say the insecticide
is not only found in the crops
they are meant to protect, but

01:50.066 --> 01:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it spreads to other plants in
the area that are attracted
to bees, and it persists for

01:55.633 --> 01:57.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
months.

01:57.733 --> 01:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, how does
it affect the bees, and what
happens to the whole colony?

01:59.933 --> 02:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: That's the key
question, connecting those dots.

02:03.100 --> 02:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Researchers at York University
in Ontario did a second test
in the laboratory mimicking

02:08.966 --> 02:10.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what they found in the field.

02:10.866 --> 02:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they exposed bees
to a small amount of the
neonicotinoids-infused pollen.

02:14.333 --> 02:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And those bees stopped --
get this -- maintaining
the hygiene of their hive.

02:18.933 --> 02:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Typically, bees will
remove sick or dead bees.

02:22.333 --> 02:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the insecticide-exposed
bees for some reason stopped
doing this, leaving sick bees

02:26.633 --> 02:27.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
inside the hive.

02:27.900 --> 02:31.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the beehive became
a pigsty, if you will.

02:31.033 --> 02:35.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I caught up with Nadejda
Tsvetkov, one of the
lead authors of the
York University study.

02:35.800 --> 02:40.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NADEJDA TSVETKOV, York
University: What we
found in our study was
that worker bees from

02:42.800 --> 02:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exposed colonies die 23
percent sooner, so that's a
very big hit to the colony.

02:48.400 --> 02:52.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They also had abnormal
foraging behaviors.

02:52.033 --> 02:56.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We found also that the
colonies had difficulty
replacing a queen.

02:56.400 --> 03:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, over time, we had more and
more queenless colonies, which,
unless there is an intervention,

03:03.233 --> 03:05.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the colonies will perish.

03:05.266 --> 03:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: At first blush,
this study seems to put to rest
the neonic collapse debate.

03:11.500 --> 03:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, in a separate study also
published last week, a European
team found some bee colonies

03:16.633 --> 03:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Germany that thrived even
though they were close to fields
with neonic-treated crops.

03:22.466 --> 03:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This led researchers to believe
there must be other geographical
or environmental factor

03:26.700 --> 03:28.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in play.

03:28.700 --> 03:31.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Maybe some bees are
more susceptible to the
toxins, depending on
their locations, for

03:31.766 --> 03:33.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
example.

03:33.700 --> 03:37.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In short, the studies suggests
the effects of neonics
on bees are inconsistent.

03:40.133 --> 03:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that study was funded
in part by the German
chemical and pharmaceutical
giant Bayer, which

03:43.900 --> 03:46.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
happens to be the maker
of neonicotinoids.

03:46.133 --> 03:51.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, in a statement, Bayer
says it remains convinced that
neonicotinoid seed treatments

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have no short- or long-term
negative effects on bees, and
that these seed treatments are

03:57.200 --> 03:59.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
useful and effective
tool for farmers.

03:59.233 --> 04:03.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the
totally different category of
climate science, there was a big

04:03.266 --> 04:05.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
study this week.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, usually, when climate
studies come out, we're looking
at environmental impacts.

04:07.733 --> 04:10.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What was interesting
about this one was, it was
looking at economic impacts.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tell us a little bit about that.

04:12.866 --> 04:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, this
one is a very impressive
study on climate change.

04:16.133 --> 04:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Scientists in the climate realm
teamed up with economists,
the dismal science meeting

04:22.000 --> 04:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
climate science, if you will.

04:24.033 --> 04:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they looked at the economic
impacts of climate change as
you project out to the future.

04:28.066 --> 04:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And perhaps the most interesting
finding was that climate change
will hit different socioeconomic

04:33.800 --> 04:35.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
classes differently.

04:35.800 --> 04:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here's Berkeley scientist
and lead author of the
study Solomon Hsiang.

04:38.633 --> 04:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLOMON HSIANG, University of
California, Berkeley: In the
South, where it's hot, and

04:41.066 --> 04:45.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
along the coasts, we
might see populations
losing the equivalent
of 20 percent of their

04:45.666 --> 04:50.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
income, whereas, in the cooler
Northern and Western regions,
we actually see that populations

04:50.266 --> 04:52.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
might benefit a little.

04:52.333 --> 04:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And because the North tends
to be wealthier and the South
tends to be poorer, what we

04:56.033 --> 05:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see is that, in the
future, climate change
is going to increase
economic inequality within

05:01.766 --> 05:03.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the United States.

05:03.266 --> 05:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, how
does the U.S. fare overall?

05:05.400 --> 05:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, the team
estimates that for each degree
Fahrenheit increase in global

05:09.233 --> 05:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
temperatures, the U.S. economy
overall loses about 0.7 percent
of gross domestic product,

05:16.133 --> 05:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with each degree of
warming costing more than
the last as you go up.

05:19.566 --> 05:22.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, the U.S. as a whole is
not a winner economically.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, does
it break down by industry?

05:24.966 --> 05:28.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Say, for example,
agriculture might be hit
harder or real estate?

05:28.466 --> 05:33.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well,
agriculture, especially
in the Midwest, will
likely suffer immensely.

05:33.233 --> 05:35.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That seems obvious.

05:35.266 --> 05:39.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it could be comparable to
the Dust Bowl of the 1930s,
according to these researchers.

05:39.300 --> 05:42.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Of course, real estate
on the coastline, that's
another obvious one.

05:42.233 --> 05:44.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But here's a surprise.

05:44.366 --> 05:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The team found the biggest
economic impact of climate
change was in health care.

05:51.066 --> 05:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They expect people living
in the South especially
will be hit more with
heat-related complications,

05:54.633 --> 05:56.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like heatstroke.

05:56.700 --> 05:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Managing that and dealing
with the victims is, of
course, very expensive.

05:59.600 --> 06:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And this
is happening to a population
that's already poorer than the

06:04.133 --> 06:05.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
general average in
the United States.

06:05.600 --> 06:06.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: And there
is the vicious cycle.

06:06.833 --> 06:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right.

06:07.833 --> 06:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Miles O'Brien, thanks so much.

06:08.966 --> 06:09.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN:
You're welcome, Hari.
