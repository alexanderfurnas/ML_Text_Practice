Gwen Ifill.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

GWEN IFILL: We bring you the
"NewsHour" tonight
from the Quicken Loans Arena in
Cleveland

00:11.211 --> 00:14.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
, Ohio, site of the 2016
Republican National
Convention.

00:14.581 --> 00:19.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For the next four
days, the
political spotlight shines on
Donald Trump.

00:19.653 --> 00:25.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, with memories fresh of
violence at
home and abroad, the Republicans
focus on

00:25.225 --> 00:27.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
security and immigration.

00:27.127 --> 00:32.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Plus: Who is Donald
Trump? We
begin our three-part look at his
life, beginning

00:32.532 --> 00:34.268 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tonight.

00:34.368 --> 00:37.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL D'ANTONIO, Trump
Biographer: From
the very start with Donald, it
was about getting

00:38.038 --> 00:44.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
control of the family business,
building it,
growing it, and becoming the
rich and famous

00:44.111 --> 00:46.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and powerful person that he
eventually became.

00:47.047 --> 00:50.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan
in Washington. We will have all
the non-convention

00:50.984 --> 00:55.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
news of the day, including
another ambush
targeting police officers,
leaving three dead

00:55.489 --> 00:58.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and three wounded in Baton
Rouge, Louisiana.

00:58.525 --> 01:03.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus: Turkey's crackdown. We're
on the ground
there as the country's
government fires nearly

01:03.730 --> 01:09.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
9,000 police, and arrests 6,000
others after
a failed military coup.

01:09.336 --> 01:18.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:18.645 --> 01:21.915 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:22.015 --> 01:33.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Republican
National Convention
has officially opened for
business, but not

01:33.126 --> 01:38.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
without a fuss. Opponents of
Donald Trump
objected loudly to adopting
convention rules

01:38.765 --> 01:40.367 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by voice vote.

01:40.467 --> 01:45.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the candidate is
hoping to keep
focused on a law and order
theme.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Correspondent Lisa Desjardins
begins out coverage.

01:47.975 --> 01:51.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REINCE PRIEBUS, Republican
National Committee
Chairman: This convention will
come to order.

01:51.712 --> 01:58.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
LISA DESJARDINS: The convention
formally began
this afternoon, with events of
the last two

01:58.452 --> 02:03.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
weeks looming over party
business. Police
killings of black men and the
killing of officers

02:03.790 --> 02:10.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Dallas and now Baton Rouge
are in the air,
and Republican Party Chairman
Reince Priebus

02:10.130 --> 02:11.999 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
opened with a moment of silence.

02:12.099 --> 02:16.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REINCE PRIEBUS: The men and
women who protect
our safety and well-being, who
put their lives

02:16.870 --> 02:22.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the line every day, they're
our genuine
heroes. We also want to
recognize all the

02:22.342 --> 02:26.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
families who have lost loved
ones during these
troubling times.

02:26.146 --> 02:29.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The theme of
day one is make
America safe again.

02:29.383 --> 02:33.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That idea of security will not
just dominate
here at the convention, but also
throughout

02:33.420 --> 02:37.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Trump campaign, we're told.
Donald Trump
will try to make the case that
the leadership

02:37.724 --> 02:43.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of President Obama and Hillary
Clinton has
fed violence here at home and
insecurity abroad.

02:43.530 --> 02:48.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight's speakers are meant to
drive that
message home, including
Milwaukee Sheriff

02:48.602 --> 02:54.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Clarke, retired Navy SEAL
Marcus Luttrell,
and former New York City Mayor
Rudy Giuliani.

02:54.574 --> 03:00.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a convention twist, Trump
himself will
introduce his wife, Melania, the
night's featured

03:00.881 --> 03:06.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speaker. But not everyone is
here to see it.
Ohio Governor John Kasich, a
one-time Trump

03:06.253 --> 03:11.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opponent, is staying away, and
so are former
Presidents George W. Bush and
his father,

03:11.525 --> 03:13.226 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
George H.W. Bush.

03:13.326 --> 03:16.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump campaign manager Paul
Manafort today
brushed aside the absences.

03:16.830 --> 03:19.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL MANAFORT, Trump Convention
Manager: The
Bush family, while we would
liked to have

03:19.566 --> 03:24.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had them, they are not -- they
have not been
-- they are part of past. We're
dealing with

03:24.471 --> 03:27.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the future. We're dealing with
fixing the
issues that relate to the
future.

03:27.707 --> 03:31.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Another former
Trump opponent,
Ben Carson, told the
"NewsHour"'s John Yang:

03:31.912 --> 03:35.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BEN CARSON (R), Former
Presidential Candidate:
The choice is going to be as
dramatic as any

03:35.115 --> 03:45.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
choice we have ever had. We are
talking about
traditional American values,
faith, family,

03:46.093 --> 03:54.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
personal responsibility,
compassion for your
neighbor, vs. a continuation of
secular progressivism.

03:54.901 --> 03:59.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Meanwhile,
hundreds of protesters
showed up today.

03:59.973 --> 04:05.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: We should have turned our
backs on
what I see as a festival of
hate. I'm very,

04:05.912 --> 04:07.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
actually, disappointed.

04:07.747 --> 04:11.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Several hundred
Trump supporters
also gathered for a rally today,
and a few

04:11.818 --> 04:16.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were openly carrying guns.
Authorities have
banned some items in the event
zone around

04:16.423 --> 04:21.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the convention. But under Ohio's
open-carry
law, firearms are permitted.
That's adding

04:22.062 --> 04:25.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to security worries and the
heavy police presence.

04:25.298 --> 04:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cleveland Police Chief Calvin
Williams:

04:27.300 --> 04:29.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CALVIN WILLIAMS, Cleveland,
Ohio, Police Chief:
We want to make sure that the
demonstrators

04:29.336 --> 04:33.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are safe walking through the
streets of the
city of Cleveland, and we want
to make sure

04:33.807 --> 04:36.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have enough officers to
respond if things
turn otherwise.

04:37.043 --> 04:41.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Meanwhile, the
Democratic
nominee-to-be, Hillary Clinton,
was in Cincinnati,

04:41.948 --> 04:43.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
addressing the NAACP and laying
into Trump.

04:44.050 --> 04:50.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Donald Trump led the movement to
delegitimize

04:50.357 --> 04:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our first black president,
trumpeting the
so-called birther movement.
Donald Trump plays

04:59.733 --> 05:07.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coy with white supremacists.
Donald Trump
insults Mexican immigrants, even
an American

05:07.741 --> 05:09.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
judge born of Mexican heritage.

05:10.076 --> 05:15.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The GOP has
been known as
the party of Lincoln. Clinton
said, we are

05:15.682 --> 05:20.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
watching it become the party of
Trump.

05:20.554 --> 05:25.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this convention saw its
first political
test tonight, just late tonight,
as the delegates

05:25.992 --> 05:30.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who oppose Mr. Trump called for
a roll call
vote, trying to change the rules
of this convention.

05:30.697 --> 05:34.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They didn't have enough states
to do that.
And in the end, the convention
receded for

05:34.968 --> 05:39.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dinner with the Trump forces
saying they feel
strong. Will we see more of
those objections?

05:39.272 --> 05:41.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will wait and see -- Gwen,
Judy.

05:41.374 --> 05:42.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you, Lisa.

05:42.976 --> 05:46.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gwen and I will be back later in
the program
with much more from Cleveland.

05:46.713 --> 05:50.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But right now to Hari
Sreenivasan in Washington
for the other main stories of
the day.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thank you,
Judy.

05:52.719 --> 05:56.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We turn to the crisis in Turkey,
where the
government continued its
crackdown on those

05:56.122 --> 06:02.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
involved in an attempted coup
that left more
than 250 dead and nearly 2,000
injured. Leaders

06:02.195 --> 06:04.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from around the world are
calling for restraint.

06:04.598 --> 06:08.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"NewsHour" special correspondent
Marcia Biggs
is in Istanbul and has the
latest.

06:09.002 --> 06:17.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Protests raged for
yet another
day in Istanbul's Taksim Square.
Supporters

06:17.143 --> 06:24.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan vowing to
protect their leader and
Turkey's fragile

06:24.150 --> 06:25.919 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
democracy.

06:26.019 --> 06:28.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That fury was channeled by
Turkey's prime
minister, who said the country
will evaluate

06:28.888 --> 06:33.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether to reinstate the death
penalty for
some who plotted the coup.
Turkey had scrapped

06:33.660 --> 06:37.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
capital punishment as part of
its ongoing
bid to join the European Union.

06:37.330 --> 06:40.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BINALI YILDIRIM, Turkish Prime
Minister (through
translator): Death penalty
requires a change

06:40.934 --> 06:44.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of constitution. We will decide
in compliance
with the people's will.

06:44.904 --> 06:49.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: That brought a
swift rebuke
from the E.U. foreign policy
chief, Federica

06:49.342 --> 06:51.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mogherini, and others in Europe.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FEDERICA MOGHERINI, Foreign
Policy Chief,
European Union: We are the ones
saying today

06:53.146 --> 06:58.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rule of law has to be protected
in the country.
There is no excuse for any steps
that takes

06:58.785 --> 07:00.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the country away from that.

07:00.754 --> 07:04.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Mogherini spoke
before meetings
in Brussels with Secretary of
State John Kerry

07:04.424 --> 07:08.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and other foreign ministers.
Kerry pledged
support for Turkey's government,
but cautioned

07:08.762 --> 07:10.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the U.S. and others will be
watching closely.

07:10.797 --> 07:15.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: NATO
also has a requirement with
respect to democracy,

07:15.935 --> 07:20.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and NATO will indeed measure
very carefully
what is happening.

07:20.573 --> 07:25.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: A major point of
contention
between the U.S. and Turkey, the
fate of Muslim

07:25.512 --> 07:30.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cleric and Erdogan opponent
Fethullah Gulen,
who lives in Pennsylvania in
self-imposed

07:30.517 --> 07:35.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
exile. Erdogan and his
administration say
Gulen orchestrated the coup
attempt, a charge

07:35.889 --> 07:38.725 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the cleric forcefully denies.

07:38.825 --> 07:43.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Turkey is demanding he be
extradited. The
coup attempt by factions of
Turkey's military

07:43.930 --> 07:49.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
launched a night of terror late
Friday. President
Erdogan, who was on vacation,
spoke first

07:49.235 --> 07:54.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
via FaceTime on Turkish TV and
called for
his supporters to take to the
streets.

07:54.341 --> 07:59.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, late at night, he flew
into Istanbul's
airport and vowed to purge the
military and

07:59.579 --> 08:01.414 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government.

08:01.514 --> 08:04.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, Turkish
President (through
translator): Those guns were
given to you

08:04.517 --> 08:08.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the people of this country.
If you use
the guns against the people who
gave them

08:09.055 --> 08:11.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to you, you will pay a heavy
price.

08:12.058 --> 08:15.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Chaos continued
through the
night, but by midday Saturday,
the strike

08:16.096 --> 08:21.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against the state was largely
defeated. Erdogan
has moved swiftly to make good
on his vow

08:21.267 --> 08:27.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to purge the country of what he
calls conspirators;
9,000 police and other security
officials

08:27.540 --> 08:29.376 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were fired today.

08:29.476 --> 08:36.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
More than 6,000 military
personnel have been
detained, and more than 3,000
judges suspended.

08:36.449 --> 08:40.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Offices of many Turkish media
organizations
were stormed Friday night,
including state

08:40.620 --> 08:43.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
television and CNN's Turkish
network.

08:43.256 --> 08:48.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Murat Yetkin is editor-in-chief
of Hurriyet
Daily News, whose office was
also taken hostage.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION: Is he in control?

08:50.430 --> 08:54.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MURAT YETKIN, Hurriyet Daily
News: It's president's
quote, prime minister's quote
that everything

08:54.334 --> 08:56.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is not over yet. That means
they're not.

08:56.269 --> 09:02.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: Well, and if it were
over, he wouldn't
be still calling people out into
the street.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.610 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MURAT YETKIN: No.

09:03.710 --> 09:04.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: So, the question
remains, who
has emerged the true winner?

09:04.844 --> 09:06.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MURAT YETKIN: Erdogan's
popularity has increased.

09:06.813 --> 09:11.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Whether in favor
of President
Erdogan or not, most people we
spoke to agreed

09:11.785 --> 09:16.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that military rule wasn't the
answer. Where
the people remain bitterly
divided is over

09:16.489 --> 09:23.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the future identity of their
government, Islamic
or secular.

09:23.329 --> 09:28.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tarkan runs this cafe in a
secular neighborhood.
He says his biggest fear is that
his two small

09:28.501 --> 09:31.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
children will not live in a free
Turkey.

09:31.704 --> 09:36.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His friend Enre is a 31-year-old
gay photographer.
When demonstrators took to the
streets on

09:37.076 --> 09:40.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Friday, he says he felt targeted
and with
no one to call for protection.

09:40.847 --> 09:45.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I don't feel any safe
really in my country
now.

09:45.852 --> 09:50.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Basically, we are not
(INAUDIBLE) people,
because we are wearing short
skirt, dress,

09:51.090 --> 09:53.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and drinking the alcohol and
going to bars.

09:53.526 --> 09:57.163 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
MARCIA BIGGS:
Thirty-five-year-old Burcu is
terrified of the Erdogan
government's promise

09:57.263 --> 10:03.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to institute aspects of Islamic
law into the
traditionally secular Turkish
legal system.

10:03.369 --> 10:07.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
They're telling
us protect your democracy, but
this is not

10:07.707 --> 10:12.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what I understand democracy to
be or what
I want from my democracy. For
the last two

10:12.979 --> 10:17.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
days in this country, there have
been calls
for jihad and people have been
going out to

10:17.150 --> 10:19.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the streets with machetes.

10:19.185 --> 10:23.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA BIGGS: In this
neighborhood, the people
we met were scared, sad, and
desperately uncertain

10:23.156 --> 10:30.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of their future. Not a 10-minute
walk away,
we met 48-year-old Taci and his
family. Taci

10:30.396 --> 10:35.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
took his son with him out on the
streets Friday
night in support of President
Erdogan. He

10:35.468 --> 10:39.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
praises the president for what
he has done
for the economy and scoffs at
suggestions

10:39.639 --> 10:42.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that Turkey under his rule has
lost its freedom.

10:42.375 --> 10:47.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Look
around. Everyone
can dress as they want. There'll
be no Sharia

10:47.480 --> 10:49.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
law brought to Turkey. This will
never happen.

10:49.816 --> 10:54.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: His wife, Hulya,
tells us that
Erdogan is the strong leader the
country needs

10:54.621 --> 10:59.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and she is pleased that her
children can now
attend religion classes at
school, as part

10:59.192 --> 11:03.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of a program initiated by
Erdogan for what
he calls the devout generation.

11:03.429 --> 11:08.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): If
we had Sharia
law now, the heads of these
generals who attempted

11:08.535 --> 11:13.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the coup would be hanging at the
palace gates.
There was no mercy during
Ottoman time under

11:13.106 --> 11:18.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sharia law. We want capital
punishment. We
want it deep from our hearts.
And it will

11:18.411 --> 11:20.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
happen, inshallah.

11:20.313 --> 11:24.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Strong opinions on
both sides
and looming uncertainty for a
divided country

11:24.517 --> 11:26.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a fragile state.

11:26.786 --> 11:29.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Marcia Biggs in
Istanbul, Turkey.

11:29.756 --> 11:34.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For more on
this, we turn
to Soner Cagaptay, director of
the Turkish

11:34.294 --> 11:37.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Research Program at the
Washington Institute
for Near East Policy. He's also
the author

11:38.097 --> 11:42.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of "The Rise of Turkey: The 21st
Century's
First Muslim Power." And
"NewsHour" chief

11:42.502 --> 11:44.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
foreign affairs correspondent
Margaret Warner.

11:44.437 --> 11:49.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Soner, first, I want to ask, the
information
coming out of Turkey says the
Interior Ministry

11:49.342 --> 11:54.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has fired close to 9,000 people.
Were that
many people involved in this
coup?

11:54.380 --> 11:55.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SONER CAGAPTAY, Director,
Turkish Research
Program, Washington Institute
for Near East

11:55.114 --> 11:56.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Policy: Probably not.

11:56.983 --> 11:59.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's likely that the military
plotters of
the coup that the government
arrested were

11:59.852 --> 12:04.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
involved in it, but I can't
believe that 9,000
judges and many other civilian
employees were

12:05.024 --> 12:09.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
involved in the coup. Rather,
what this suggests
is that the government is now
going after

12:09.362 --> 12:15.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Gulen movement, which was
its former ally,
also a conservative movement as
the AKP's

12:15.835 --> 12:17.637 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is.

12:17.737 --> 12:22.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now since the rift, 2013,
there has been
a blood feud between the two,
and it's not

12:22.809 --> 12:27.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a coincidence therefore that
there were some
Gulen-aligned officers who
probably took part

12:27.480 --> 12:32.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this coup effort. But the
government is
casting a wider net and going
after what it

12:32.418 --> 12:36.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
thinks are supporters and
sympathizers of
this movement in the bureaucracy
and also

12:36.356 --> 12:37.557 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the judiciary.

12:37.657 --> 12:40.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So expect a large-scale
witch-hunt in Turkey
coming up.

12:40.893 --> 12:43.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We will talk a
little bit
more about Gulen in a second,
but, Margaret,

12:43.496 --> 12:48.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
what is the U.S. kind of
position on what
looks like a large-scale
crackdown?

12:48.134 --> 12:51.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Well, that is
exactly the
number one U.S. concern.

12:51.537 --> 12:56.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. was caught off-guard by
this, Hari,
and certainly came out and said
the right

12:56.743 --> 13:00.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
things about supporting a
democratic government,
but quickly followed by
admonitions to Erdogan

13:01.080 --> 13:07.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not to use this as a way to
purge, as he has
in others -- in journalist
community and the

13:08.021 --> 13:10.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
judiciary, purge people he
thinks are his
opponents.

13:11.024 --> 13:16.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when Secretary Kerry made
his first comments,
I think it was on Saturday, and
suggested

13:16.229 --> 13:22.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at least in the reporting that
Turkey's NATO
membership might be affected by
this, there

13:22.635 --> 13:26.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was a huge reaction from Turkish
diplomats,
who peppered the State
Department and the

13:26.606 --> 13:28.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
White House demanding an
explanation.

13:28.975 --> 13:33.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so today you saw the White
House press
secretary taking concerns --
taking care to

13:34.080 --> 13:38.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say, look, Turkey is a member,
and it's a
member. This is not like the
E.U.. But there's

13:38.251 --> 13:42.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
certainly concern in the White
House that
this is going to deepen the rift
with Turkey,

13:42.789 --> 13:44.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the chilly relationship.

13:44.691 --> 13:49.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The labor minister even
suggested the U.S.
was behind the coup. Erdogan
hasn't repeated

13:49.562 --> 13:50.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that, but there are deep
concerns.

13:51.030 --> 13:52.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Let's talk a
little bit
about Fethullah Gulen.

13:52.899 --> 13:59.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's in Pennsylvania. Erdogan
says he's behind
the coup. He says, I'm not
behind the coup.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Kerry says prove that
he's behind
the coup.

14:01.174 --> 14:05.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Who is he and does he have the
kind of influence
that scares Erdogan so much?

14:05.545 --> 14:09.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SONER CAGAPTAY: He's known to
have friends
in the Turkish bureaucracy,
including in the

14:09.415 --> 14:12.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
police force, as well as the
judiciary and
the military.

14:12.885 --> 14:18.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And after the rift started with
him and President
Erdogan, many Gulen-aligned or
suspected Gulen-aligned

14:19.025 --> 14:23.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people in the bureaucracy were
kicked out.
Now this gives Erdogan a second
chance to

14:24.097 --> 14:26.032 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
really go after this movement.

14:26.132 --> 14:32.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think at the end, whether or
not we think
Gulen movement was behind the
coup fully,

14:32.438 --> 14:36.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is what President Erdogan
believes. He
believes that this is the main
driving force

14:36.109 --> 14:40.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
behind the coup and he will go
after them
with all his force. And whereas
earlier, the

14:40.546 --> 14:44.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whole issue of Gulen movement
was a talking
point in U.S.-Turkish
relationship when there

14:44.183 --> 14:46.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were bilateral meetings, now
it's going to
be issue number one.

14:46.819 --> 14:52.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Erdogan is going to insist on
his extradition
and he might even link
Turkish-U.S. cooperation

14:52.759 --> 14:55.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Gulen's extradition. Now,
that may not
work with the Pentagon, which
already has

14:56.095 --> 15:00.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a dim view of Erdogan's
administration for
his policy of allowing radicals
to cross into

15:00.633 --> 15:04.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syria to fight the Assad regime,
some of whom
have morphed into ISIS.

15:04.604 --> 15:09.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if he does link those two, I
think that
might create a backlash at the
Pentagon. People

15:09.342 --> 15:12.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
might say, we don't want a deal
like that.
I think what Turkey ought to do
is separate

15:12.345 --> 15:17.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the two issues, provide to
Washington a full
and convincing account of, as
they say, Gulen's

15:17.817 --> 15:21.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
involvement in the coup, but
keep military
cooperation separate from that.

15:21.854 --> 15:25.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Margaret, what
Soner is
pointing to is just also the
geographic and

15:25.491 --> 15:29.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
political importance of Turkey
right now and
how important it is to the
United States and

15:29.529 --> 15:32.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
really all NATO allies,
especially in the
fight against ISIS.

15:32.331 --> 15:36.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Incirlik Air
Base, it's mostly
a Turkish base. And the U.S.
just has a little

15:36.302 --> 15:38.004 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
section there.

15:38.104 --> 15:41.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But some of the coup plotters,
including the
former commander of the base who
tried to

15:41.340 --> 15:48.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
get asylum from the U.S.,
ostensibly or reportedly
or accusedly were working out of
there. It's

15:48.614 --> 15:53.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all very uncomfortable. The
power has not
even been restored to the air
base, but the

15:53.653 --> 15:55.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
U.S. has its own power.

15:55.988 --> 16:01.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you look at a map, Turkey
is absolutely
key now, given its related
involvement in

16:01.861 --> 16:06.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fight against ISIS, in which
it really
is cracking down on people
trying to get in

16:06.532 --> 16:13.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and most importantly letting
U.S. planes use
that, not only to refuel, but to
launch offensive

16:13.506 --> 16:15.308 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
strikes.

16:15.408 --> 16:19.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Otherwise, they have to come
from carriers
in the ocean, taking five, six
times as much

16:19.579 --> 16:24.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and often having to leave
without even dropping
their ordnance. Maintaining this
relationship,

16:24.717 --> 16:29.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you can see the United States
trying very
hard to manage it, so it doesn't
go awry,

16:29.622 --> 16:31.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as Soner was suggesting.

16:31.557 --> 16:34.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SONER CAGAPTAY: There will be
problems moving
forward, because of the fact
that there is

16:34.293 --> 16:36.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really no good outcome of this
coup for Turkey.

16:36.128 --> 16:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the military had won, it
would have become
an oppressive country. And
Erdogan has won,

16:40.800 --> 16:44.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but it still will become a
oppressive place,
because he has a record of
cracking down on

16:45.071 --> 16:50.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dissent, and going after the
opposition, banning
social media, sending the police
to beat up

16:50.743 --> 16:52.612 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
demonstrators.

16:52.712 --> 16:56.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so far Erdogan has done all
of this based
on the assumption that there is
a conspiracy

16:56.916 --> 17:02.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to overthrow him. Now that
theory has legs,
because there really is a
conspiracy to overthrow

17:02.488 --> 17:08.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him. His supporters will embrace
his crackdown
as oppression as a necessary
tool to go after

17:08.594 --> 17:14.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those who want to undermine him,
and he will
continue casting a wide net
against the opposition.

17:15.001 --> 17:19.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While Turkey has the right, an
Erdogan administration,
to go after those who executed
this ill-conceived,

17:19.672 --> 17:24.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ill-executed, nefarious plot, I
think we're
going to see that his crackdown
is going to

17:24.610 --> 17:29.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be wider than that going after
the opposition.
It will become much more
difficult for Turks

17:29.548 --> 17:32.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who don't agree with him to
oppose his policies
democratically.

17:32.318 --> 17:37.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The U.S. view
is, we will
know in two weeks whether it's
that or whether

17:37.223 --> 17:41.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're just rounding up a lot
of suspects
and that in two weeks most are
freed and they

17:41.861 --> 17:44.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
really identify coup plotters.

17:44.163 --> 17:48.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Soner Cagaptay
and Margaret Warner, thanks so
much.

17:48.367 --> 17:53.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SONER CAGAPTAY: It's a pleasure.

17:54.040 --> 17:57.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Pleasure.

17:57.476 --> 18:02.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now back to
this country
and the latest round of violence
involving

18:02.748 --> 18:04.550 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
police.

18:04.650 --> 18:07.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Last week, Baton Rouge,
Louisiana, was the
site of protests following the
police killing

18:07.420 --> 18:12.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Alton Sterling. Yesterday saw
an ambush
that left three officers killed
and three

18:12.458 --> 18:13.492 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wounded.

18:13.592 --> 18:15.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown reports.

18:15.461 --> 18:18.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Mourners laid
flowers today
outside the Baton Rouge gas
station where

18:19.031 --> 18:24.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sunday's slaughter took place.
And investigators
confirmed the attack was
definitely planned.

18:24.303 --> 18:26.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
COL. MIKE EDMONSON,
Superintendent, Louisiana
State Police: There is no doubt
whatsoever

18:27.073 --> 18:33.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that these officers were
intentionally targeted
and assassinated. It was a
calculated act

18:34.046 --> 18:37.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
against those who work to
protect this community
every single day.

18:38.084 --> 18:42.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The gunman was
former Gavin
Long of Kansas City, Missouri,
who served

18:42.288 --> 18:48.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the Marine Corps from 2005 to
2010, including
six months in Iraq.

18:48.361 --> 18:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He carried out the attack on his
29th birthday,
before dying in a shoot-out with
police. Long

18:54.300 --> 18:59.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had previously posted messages
on social media
saying he was fed up with the
treatment of

18:59.305 --> 19:01.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
African-Americans.

19:01.207 --> 19:04.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAVIN LONG, Suspect: You got to
fight back.
That's the only way a bully
knows to quit.

19:04.543 --> 19:06.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He doesn't know words.

19:06.445 --> 19:11.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: The slain
officers were identified
as sheriff's Deputy Brad
Garafola, and police

19:11.417 --> 19:16.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officers Montrell Jackson and
Matthew Gerald.
Their killing came less than two
weeks after

19:16.455 --> 19:21.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the death of Alton Sterling, who
was fatally
shot by Baton Rouge police
during a scuffle.

19:21.927 --> 19:26.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sterling's death and the killing
of Philando
Castile in St. Paul, Minnesota,
triggered

19:26.632 --> 19:33.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
protests nationwide. After a
protest in Dallas,
a sniper shot dead five police
officers, saying

19:33.739 --> 19:36.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he wanted revenge for police
killings of black
men.

19:36.776 --> 19:41.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Attorney General Loretta
Lynch condemned
the bloodshed during a
conference of black

19:41.747 --> 19:43.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
law enforcement officers in
Washington.

19:43.582 --> 19:46.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORETTA LYNCH, U.S. Attorney
General: And
we are determined to do
everything that we

19:46.485 --> 19:50.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can to bridge divides, to heal
the rifts and
to restore trust.

19:51.057 --> 19:55.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The killings
rippled through
the presidential campaign as
well. Democrat

19:55.394 --> 20:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton said today there
can be no
justification for killing
police. And Republican

20:01.400 --> 20:07.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump blamed President
Obama's leadership
and said, "We demand law and
order."

20:07.540 --> 20:11.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And from Louisiana Public
Broadcasting in
Baton Rouge, we're joined now by
the superintendent

20:11.877 --> 20:15.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Louisiana state police,
Colonel Michael
Mike Edmonson.

20:15.347 --> 20:20.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, first, our condolences to
you and members
of your force. I know this is
all very fresh.

20:20.619 --> 20:25.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can you tell us the mood there?
How have your
officers and community
responded?

20:25.391 --> 20:30.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COL. MIKE EDMONSON: Well, I
think they're
doing an incredible job.

20:30.463 --> 20:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These police officers, certainly
the ones
that we talked about in the
press conference

20:34.166 --> 20:38.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today, those police officers,
the two Baton
Rouge city police officers that
were killed,

20:39.004 --> 20:43.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the one East Baton Rouge Parish
sheriff's
deputy, the one that is fighting
for his life

20:43.509 --> 20:45.244 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
now, true heroes.

20:45.344 --> 20:51.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was an ordinary Sunday. And I
think what
took place from 8:40 that
morning and beyond

20:51.250 --> 20:58.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was nothing less than
extraordinary. The mood
is somber. It's sad, but I can
promise you

20:58.691 --> 21:02.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that my police officers and my
state troopers
are committed, they're
dedicated, they're

21:02.628 --> 21:06.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
professional and they're ready
to do the job
that's called upon. They're
public servants.

21:06.465 --> 21:08.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what they do.

21:08.400 --> 21:11.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You said at the
press conference
that the police officers were
assassinated,

21:11.237 --> 21:17.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that it was clearly deliberate.
What tells
you that? Why were these
officers targeted?

21:17.176 --> 21:23.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COL. MIKE EDMONSON: It was
intentional and
it was calculated. As I watched
the film and

21:23.883 --> 21:29.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the video that we had from the
scene on that
particular -- just yesterday
morning, not

21:29.288 --> 21:35.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even 30 hours ago, a little more
than 30 hours
ago, was a gentleman, the
shooter that went

21:35.194 --> 21:36.929 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to that location.

21:37.029 --> 21:41.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And based on his actions and
based on what
he did at that location, he was
targeting

21:41.267 --> 21:47.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
specifically police officers. He
was amongst
the civilians. He saw civilians
in the area.

21:47.106 --> 21:51.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He didn't even engage them. He
discounted
them. He didn't even look at
them. He went

21:51.377 --> 21:56.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
specifically for a location of a
Baton Rouge
city police car. He was engaged
on that police

21:56.849 --> 21:58.684 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
car.

21:58.784 --> 22:01.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When no one was in there, he
backed off, and
he went back around, went to
another location,

22:01.387 --> 22:05.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which was right next door to
that, parked
his car, went towards a Baton
Rouge police

22:05.925 --> 22:11.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officer that was vacuuming his
car before.
He had left. At that point,
police starting

22:11.197 --> 22:15.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
being called in that area
because people see
someone with a gun.

22:15.868 --> 22:20.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As they're responding, he has
backtracked
around one of the side
buildings, and he engages

22:20.472 --> 22:25.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two Baton Rouge police officers.
He kills
them. He engages a sheriff's
deputy. The sheriff's

22:25.544 --> 22:29.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deputy was going back to one of
those police
officers who had been shot just
to try to

22:29.648 --> 22:31.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
render first aid. He kills him.

22:32.017 --> 22:37.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He then moves around, works
himself back around
to the other side, engages a
sheriff's deputy

22:37.823 --> 22:42.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who was in his car, shot through
that car,
and that is the one that is
grasping for his

22:42.261 --> 22:46.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
life right now. And that's when
he was shot
and killed by Baton Rouge SWAT.

22:46.532 --> 22:50.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His intentions were clear. You
can see it
on the tape. You can watch it
unfold as he

22:50.269 --> 22:55.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
moves forward. They were
deliberate and they
were calculated. No doubt in our
mind he was

22:55.107 --> 22:56.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
aiming for police officers.

22:57.076 --> 23:00.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, that's his
intentions.
There is still a lot of
questions of his motives.

23:00.913 --> 23:07.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What questions do you have? Are
you sure,
first of all, that it was just
him? Do you

23:07.519 --> 23:12.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think that perhaps there were
others involved?
Do you know why he came to Baton
Rouge?

23:12.458 --> 23:15.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COL. MIKE EDMONSON: A lot of
unanswered questions.

23:15.894 --> 23:20.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we clearly do know is that
the young
individual is a shooter, that
the Baton Rouge

23:20.599 --> 23:24.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
police department SWAT team shot
and killed,
was indeed the individual who
killed those

23:24.436 --> 23:29.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
police officers. We believe him
to be acting
alone in that particular
scenario.

23:29.208 --> 23:33.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we want to find out what
brought him to
Baton Rouge, what brought him to
that location

23:34.013 --> 23:37.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and what brought him to kill
those police
officers? We have got to
backtrack that car.

23:37.616 --> 23:41.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have got to go to 8:40
yesterday morning
and go backwards and try to work
that timeline.

23:41.687 --> 23:46.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where did the car come from,
where did it
travel to, what are the cities
he go to, why

23:46.191 --> 23:49.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was he in Baton Rouge? Was he
actually looking
for the locations?

23:49.762 --> 23:53.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Was he trying to find locations
where police
officers were? And while he was
here, who

23:53.532 --> 23:57.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
else was he talking to? For
those unanswered
questions, we will look at
social media and

23:57.836 --> 24:02.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we will starting filing each of
those. It's
a large puzzle, a lot of pieces.
We just need

24:02.341 --> 24:02.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to put it together.

24:02.841 --> 24:04.610 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

24:04.710 --> 24:07.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, excuse me
for interrupting
you, because you referred to
other cities

24:07.179 --> 24:09.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he went to. There are
reports that he
was in Dallas.

24:09.515 --> 24:12.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COL. MIKE EDMONSON: We're
hearing all of those.

24:13.018 --> 24:16.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why I say we need to
look at the
footprint of that particular
vehicle, find

24:16.989 --> 24:21.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out where it went prior to 8:40
that morning,
work it as far back as we can,
and try to

24:22.027 --> 24:27.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
find out was anyone else
involved, was he
looking at other locations, what
other possible

24:27.266 --> 24:32.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crimes he's committed, how do he
get those
guns, all the things that need
to be to put

24:32.404 --> 24:35.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that puzzle together, so that we
can completely
tell the story.

24:35.140 --> 24:38.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let me tell you something. Those
three, those
three police officers, they
deserve that we

24:39.011 --> 24:40.746 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
get it right.

24:40.846 --> 24:43.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And just very
briefly, if I
could, because there's so much
talk today

24:43.315 --> 24:49.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around the country about how
police are responding
to these shootings, are you
changing your

24:49.755 --> 24:55.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
procedures at all in terms of
how your officers
respond to emergencies, for
example?

24:55.728 --> 24:58.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COL. MIKE EDMONSON: I wouldn't
do anything
different than what I have seen.

24:59.098 --> 25:02.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been a police officer for
36 years.
I have been superintendent for
nine. The foundation

25:02.935 --> 25:07.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of our training is solid. It's
built around
principles. I think what we need
to do, every

25:07.573 --> 25:10.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
time there's an incident
anywhere in this
country and around the world
that involves

25:10.642 --> 25:13.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
police, we take it, and work
through it in
Louisiana.

25:13.612 --> 25:18.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We ask our officers, how would
you act in
this situation? And we talk
those things through.

25:18.183 --> 25:22.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That type of training has got to
continue.
But I believe the training that
we have, that

25:22.221 --> 25:24.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
foundation is there. We just
need to build
upon it.

25:24.623 --> 25:28.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to go wherever it takes
us, any other
thing we can do, because here's
the deal.

25:28.727 --> 25:32.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can't get enough training.
You can't get
enough talking about scenarios
to where you

25:32.164 --> 25:37.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can continually to be proactive.
I think that's
what the public expects from us.
And that's

25:37.202 --> 25:38.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
certainly what we need to do.

25:38.771 --> 25:41.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
Colonel Michael
Edmonson, thank you very much.

25:41.607 --> 25:46.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COL. MIKE EDMONSON: Thank you,
sir. God bless
you. And we need you. We need
your prayers,

25:46.612 --> 25:49.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
please. Tell the country, please
pray for
us. We need it.

25:49.481 --> 25:54.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Thank you.

25:54.286 --> 26:11.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's been an
action-packed
day already here in Cleveland.
We're excited

26:11.937 --> 26:17.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about our first ever joint "PBS
NewsHour"-NPR
coverage of the 2016
conventions.

26:17.976 --> 26:23.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Weekend Edition Sunday" host
Rachel Martin
will be with us this week and
next. She's

26:23.715 --> 26:27.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the podium here right now
with a preview
of what we expect to see tonight
-- Rachel.

26:27.219 --> 26:29.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RACHEL MARTIN: Hi, Judy.

26:29.188 --> 26:33.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm actually down on the floor
of the convention
arena. This is where all the
action is going

26:33.225 --> 26:37.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to take place tonight. Delegates
are on a
break, but we can expect them to
fill this

26:37.196 --> 26:39.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hall in, in the next little
while.

26:39.932 --> 26:43.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you know, the Trump campaign
has set up
a theme for every night, and
tonight the theme

26:44.069 --> 26:47.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is make America safe again, so
you can be
sure there is going to going to
be a lot of

26:47.539 --> 26:51.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conversation about national
security issues.
And a word you are going to hear
a lot tonight,

26:51.677 --> 26:53.445 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Benghazi.

26:53.545 --> 26:57.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are going to put out guests
who are really
going to try to target Hillary
Clinton on

26:57.616 --> 27:01.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the issue of Benghazi. We are
going to hear
from a mother of one of the four
Americans

27:02.054 --> 27:07.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who was killed there. We're also
going to
hear from some of his supporters
in Congress.

27:07.960 --> 27:11.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions
will speak.
It will be up to him to try to
bridge that

27:11.897 --> 27:17.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
divide between Donald Trump and
some of the
establishment that is still not
yet on the

27:17.202 --> 27:21.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
board. And, of course, the
marquee event,
Melania Trump is going to be
introducing her

27:21.974 --> 27:23.876 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
husband.

27:23.976 --> 27:27.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is going to try to give a
more personal
look at this candidate. She
might get upstaged,

27:27.613 --> 27:32.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
though. The candidate himself is
expected
to introduce her -- back to you,
Gwen and

27:32.351 --> 27:33.752 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Judy.

27:33.852 --> 27:35.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will be
watching and
talking to you, Rachel.

27:35.721 --> 27:40.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Right now, we get the
perspective of the Trump
campaign from one of the
candidate's senior

27:40.292 --> 27:42.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
advisers. She is Kellyanne
Conway.

27:42.694 --> 27:45.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thank you for joining us in our
sky booth.

27:45.764 --> 27:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY, Trump Campaign
Senior Adviser:
Thank you.

27:47.633 --> 27:50.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kellyanne Conway,
how united
are the Republicans tonight? We
saw a little

27:50.936 --> 27:55.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bit of chaos break out a couple
of hours ago
when the delegates were asked
about nominating

27:55.707 --> 27:57.509 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump.

27:57.609 --> 28:00.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Well, that was
a couple
of the never Trump delegates'
last-ditch attempt.

28:00.279 --> 28:02.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We thought the other day was a
last-ditch
attempt. There have been three
or four of

28:03.048 --> 28:08.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them to really either try to
embarrass Mr.
Trump or rob him of the
nomination. They failed

28:08.287 --> 28:10.122 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
again and again.

28:10.222 --> 28:12.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, look, this is what
conventions are for.
This is direct democracy. I
think, in terms

28:12.391 --> 28:16.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of party unity, there is no
Bernie Sanders
equivalent in the Republican
Party right now

28:16.995 --> 28:23.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Hillary Clinton, no one who
won 22 or 23
states, millions of votes, and
just last week

28:23.468 --> 28:25.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
decided to drop out and endorse.

28:25.837 --> 28:31.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think this is healthy for
parties to have
some growing pains, shed some
skin, and have

28:31.243 --> 28:35.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these debates, whether they're
out in public
or behind closed doors, as we
are more accustomed

28:35.314 --> 28:36.381 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to.

28:36.481 --> 28:38.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I saw House Speaker
Paul Ryan
today.

28:38.450 --> 28:42.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he was talking about --
everyone is talking
about unity and how ones finds a
way to make

28:42.487 --> 28:47.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sure that party is on the same
page. He talked
about being a party of ideas. We
hear less

28:47.459 --> 28:54.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about ideas. But among the ideas
are about
building a wall or the ideas are
about banning

28:54.232 --> 28:56.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a religion from coming in the
country, those
kinds of ideas.

28:56.702 --> 29:01.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when we asked Paul Ryan
about that, he
kind of bit his tongue. Do you
feel like the

29:01.440 --> 29:03.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unity is where it needs to be in
that front?

29:03.575 --> 29:08.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Well, what I
think is Donald
Trump has many more ideas, like
the 10-point

29:08.380 --> 29:13.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VA reform plan he laid out in
Virginia Beach
just a week ago, Gwen, where he
-- it's 10

29:13.485 --> 29:15.187 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
points.

29:15.287 --> 29:17.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Anybody can read it. He
basically said if
we don't do what's right by our
veterans,

29:17.456 --> 29:21.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if we don't provide them basic
care and health
services and care about them who
fought for

29:21.693 --> 29:24.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all of our freedoms, the right
to sit here
and converse with each other,
frankly, what

29:24.396 --> 29:26.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are we doing as a nation?

29:26.164 --> 29:29.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then he went and gave a 10-point
road map
that anybody can examine. They
can agree or

29:29.334 --> 29:34.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disagree with it. But at least
it's there.
And you will hear more substance
this week

29:34.106 --> 29:37.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from Donald Trump. He's got a
tax plan that's
been out there for a while.

29:37.442 --> 29:41.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has a repeal-and-replace an
Obamacare plan.
Nobody seems to want to talk
about it or cover.

29:41.880 --> 29:45.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am on TV every day. Nobody has
yet asked
me to compare the two health
care plans or

29:45.384 --> 29:47.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the two national security plans.

29:47.386 --> 29:48.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I, for one, agree with...

29:48.854 --> 29:50.022 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

29:50.122 --> 29:51.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Here's your chance.
Here is your
chance.

29:51.289 --> 29:53.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: And I'm happy
to do that.

29:53.158 --> 29:55.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I, for one, agree with Speaker
Ryan in this
regard. I would love for all of
us to move

29:55.961 --> 30:02.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from this cacophony of
content-free campaigning
into a more substantive debate.
I think voters

30:03.035 --> 30:05.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deserve that. And I know voters
want that.

30:05.771 --> 30:08.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I feel like a religious debate
on the issues,
then people will see they have a
very stark

30:08.874 --> 30:14.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
choice in the future vision of
Hillary Clinton
and Donald Trump, and that those
who want

30:14.646 --> 30:17.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a change election will go for
the outsider,
for Donald Trump, much the way
they went for

30:17.449 --> 30:21.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Barack Obama in '08 and Bill
Clinton in '92,
after two terms of the party in
power.

30:21.386 --> 30:24.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You used the term
shedding
skin.

30:24.256 --> 30:28.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I want to ask you about
that, because
today the campaign manager, Paul
Manafort,

30:28.226 --> 30:32.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
told a group of reporters. He
said, this is
a convention about the future.
It's a campaign

30:32.731 --> 30:36.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the future, not about the
past, when
he was asked about the fact that
both former

30:36.301 --> 30:40.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Presidents Bush are not here, as
well as Mitt
Romney and John McCain.

30:40.772 --> 30:44.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You worked for President George
H.W. Bush's
vice president, Dan Quayle.

30:44.176 --> 30:45.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Yes.

30:45.744 --> 30:47.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you feel
about the Bushes
and others not being here?

30:47.779 --> 30:50.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Well, that is
their right.
We certainly welcome them. We're
glad that

30:51.016 --> 30:54.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have devoted so much of
their lives to
public service.

30:54.686 --> 30:59.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We understand that Jeb Bush
wanted to be here
this week accepting the
nomination, and that

30:59.357 --> 31:03.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are some hard feelings
there. But Dan
Quayle himself, Judy, the former
vice president,

31:03.128 --> 31:04.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has endorsed Donald Trump.

31:04.963 --> 31:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other Bush -- Vice President
Dick Cheney
has endorsed Donald Trump, Newt
Gingrich.

31:08.433 --> 31:12.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there's a little bit of a
split that way
of those who have and those who
haven't. But,

31:12.671 --> 31:17.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
again, I wouldn't want to belong
to a party
where everybody was meant to
talk the same,

31:18.076 --> 31:20.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
either say the -- agree on the
same things.

31:20.278 --> 31:26.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We hope that they're cheering
for the party
from afar. And, also, I also
just want to

31:26.585 --> 31:29.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say that this party is always
looking for
the next Ronald Reagan. Do you
ever listen

31:29.721 --> 31:32.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the candidates? They channel
Ronald Reagan.
We're looking for the next
Ronald Reagan.

31:33.024 --> 31:35.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they were picking Bushes for
a while.

31:35.327 --> 31:40.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So it is -- I said on a
different station
last night, this campaign will
be about the

31:40.465 --> 31:44.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
future, not the past. And I
believe the selection
of Mike Pence broadcast that
loud and clear

31:44.336 --> 31:48.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to voters also, because he's a
fresh face
to many Americans. They're
unfamiliar with

31:48.106 --> 31:48.473 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

31:48.573 --> 31:50.408 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

31:50.509 --> 31:52.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I want to ask you
about Mike Pence.
What kind of reaction are you
hearing now

31:52.344 --> 31:55.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the delegates are here in
town? Is it
a sigh of relief? Is it an
embrace? Is it

31:55.247 --> 31:58.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a who -- isn't this guy a part
of the establishment?
What kind of reaction are you
getting?

31:58.950 --> 32:00.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: He's pure
excitement.

32:00.986 --> 32:03.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Actually, Mike Pence, in his 12
years in Congress,
Gwen and Judy, he voted against
a lot of the

32:04.022 --> 32:08.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bush spending bills, No Child
Left Behind,
Medicare Part B prescription
drug, of course,

32:08.794 --> 32:10.562 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
TARP.

32:10.662 --> 32:13.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so he was able to -- he was
willing to
stand up to leaders of both
parties. It's

32:13.131 --> 32:17.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very refreshing, frankly, to
have someone
in your own party say to a
president of that

32:17.102 --> 32:19.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
party, I'm sorry, I just don't
agree with
you, something Bernie Sanders
has done with

32:19.471 --> 32:21.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
President Obama again and again.

32:21.373 --> 32:27.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And also I believe Mike Pence is
somebody
who was in Washington who never
was of Washington,

32:27.445 --> 32:32.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rust Belt Midwestern governor,
sitting on
$2 billion surplus, gave tax
cuts across the

32:32.684 --> 32:35.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
board to employers and
individuals, spurring
that kind of growth.

32:35.520 --> 32:39.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When he got there after Mitch
Daniels, 8.4
percent unemployment, now less
than 5 percent.

32:39.591 --> 32:41.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's a great story to tell
there.

32:41.493 --> 32:45.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I just wanted to note that
John McCain
and Mitt Romney could not win
those Midwestern

32:45.864 --> 32:51.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states. They lost them all twice
to President
Obama. Let's at least give
Trump-Pence a try

32:51.369 --> 32:54.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to state their case in those
states and see
how they fare.

32:54.339 --> 32:57.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Kellyanne Conway,
senior adviser
to Donald J. Trump, who later
this week will

32:58.009 --> 33:01.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be the -- no longer be likely --
will be the
Republican nominee.

33:01.913 --> 33:02.848 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

33:02.948 --> 33:03.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Thank you for
having me.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

33:05.684 --> 33:09.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: From reality TV to
the top of
the GOP, Donald Trump has been
in the spotlight

33:09.988 --> 33:13.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for decades. What do we know
about his past
that gives hints to where he
wants to lead

33:13.391 --> 33:15.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the country in the future?

33:15.227 --> 33:18.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we begin our series on
the likely
Republican nominee with a look
at Trump's

33:18.964 --> 33:21.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
early years.

33:21.166 --> 33:27.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump was and is a child
of New York,
born and raised in the borough
of Queens to

33:27.606 --> 33:32.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a life of hard-earned privilege.
He was the
fourth of five children born to
a Scottish

33:32.911 --> 33:39.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immigrant mother, Mary, and a
housing developer
father, Fred, who left an
important mark on

33:39.251 --> 33:41.086 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
his son.

33:41.186 --> 33:43.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
My father was great. Good
salesman. Good builder.

33:43.555 --> 33:47.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He loved to build houses. He was
a good builder.
I learned so much from him. And
he was a great

33:47.859 --> 33:49.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
guy, a lovely guy. I loved my
father.

33:49.861 --> 33:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Fred Trump, a shrewd
and political
businessman, made a fortune
building low-income

33:55.400 --> 33:58.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
housing in Brooklyn and Queens
beginning in
the late 1920s.

33:58.803 --> 34:04.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWENDA BLAIR, Author, "The
Trumps": The family
lived in a 23-room house. They
had a chauffeur,

34:04.809 --> 34:09.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a maid. The kids got taken by
the chauffeur
to their private school every
morning.

34:09.147 --> 34:14.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The children were
all raised to
be high achievers, but Donald,
in particular,

34:14.653 --> 34:17.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
patterned himself after his
father.

34:17.255 --> 34:19.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Author Gwenda Blair.

34:19.157 --> 34:25.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWENDA BLAIR: Dad worked 24/7.
If it was Sunday,
you wouldn't take that day off.
You would

34:25.397 --> 34:30.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
put the kids in the car and go
over to a construction
site. You would look for unused
nails, because

34:30.869 --> 34:36.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why would you waste a nail? He
was a very
tough and demanding guy, said to
have told

34:36.474 --> 34:43.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his boys, be killers, win, very
competitive.
And that competitive streak came
out double

34:43.148 --> 34:44.883 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Donald.

34:44.983 --> 34:49.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: But that same
pressure didn't
sit well with Trump's oldest
brother, Freddy.

34:49.187 --> 34:50.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Here's author Timothy O'Brien.

34:51.056 --> 34:54.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TIMOTHY O'BRIEN, Author,
"TrumpNation": Fred
Jr. really couldn't stand the
pressure. He

34:54.259 --> 34:59.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ended up not going into his
father's real
estate business, wanted to
become a pilot.

35:00.065 --> 35:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He ended up an alcoholic, and he
died of alcoholism.

35:02.400 --> 35:06.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Trump cites Freddy's
experience
as why he doesn't drink.

35:06.604 --> 35:11.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: I probably
wouldn't be here
talking to you today if -- if we
didn't -- if

35:11.876 --> 35:15.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I didn't have my brother Fred,
because he
kept me off alcohol. Now, maybe,
with my kind

35:15.613 --> 35:19.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a personality, I would be a
serious alcoholic.
I just don't know. But I have
never had a

35:19.451 --> 35:21.219 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
glass of alcohol in my life.

35:21.319 --> 35:26.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Biographer Michael
D'Antonio says
young Donald's thirst for
attention often

35:26.424 --> 35:28.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
landed him in trouble at school.

35:28.326 --> 35:32.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL D'ANTONIO, Trump
Biographer: He said
to me that he was wise guy. He's
the fellow

35:32.330 --> 35:37.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who threw an eraser and gave the
teacher a
black eye, and would throw cake
around a birthday

35:37.268 --> 35:41.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
party. So, I can imagine him as
being a little
terror.

35:41.239 --> 35:47.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It proved even too
much for Fred
Trump to handle. So, at age 13,
Donald's parents

35:47.479 --> 35:50.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shipped him upstate to the New
York Military
Academy.

35:50.615 --> 35:55.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWENDA BLAIR: Many kids, of
course, are desperately
homesick, can't wait to go home.
He apparently

35:56.021 --> 36:01.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
loved military school. He liked
the -- the
kind of out-front, I think,
competitiveness

36:01.526 --> 36:06.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of it. There were so many
different ways that
you could excel and get medals
and ribbons,

36:06.731 --> 36:10.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cleanest room, shiniest shoes,
all that kind
of stuff.

36:10.168 --> 36:15.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Donald Trump
thrived, rising in
rank, and he was socially
popular with men

36:15.607 --> 36:23.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and women. He also gravitated
toward sports,
or, rather, winning in sports,
in soccer,

36:23.681 --> 36:26.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wrestling, football, and
baseball.

36:26.518 --> 36:30.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIMOTHY O'BRIEN: He excelled at
baseball,
to the point where I think his
coaches felt

36:30.855 --> 36:37.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that he could become a
professional baseball
player. I think military school
at least wrung

36:37.729 --> 36:44.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of his adolescent excesses
out of him
for a brief period of time.

36:44.102 --> 36:49.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the thing to remember about
Donald Trump
is that his wealth sort of
created a bubble

36:49.474 --> 36:56.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around him, and he's been able
to pursue his
appetites and really do whatever
he wanted

36:56.714 --> 36:59.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to do for most of his life with
very few restraints.

36:59.818 --> 37:04.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: After graduation, he
lived at
home while commuting to Fordham
University

37:04.489 --> 37:06.124 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the Bronx.

37:06.224 --> 37:09.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWENDA BLAIR: His sister told me
that the
reason he went to Fordham -- I
asked, and

37:09.861 --> 37:11.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
she said, it's where he got in.

37:11.763 --> 37:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Two years later, he
transferred
to the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton

37:15.600 --> 37:17.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
School of Finance and Commerce.

37:17.535 --> 37:21.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL D'ANTONIO: You won't
find people at
Penn who will say, well, I was
Donald's really

37:21.172 --> 37:26.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
good friend, I was in a
fraternity with him,
or we socialized.

37:26.211 --> 37:32.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He didn't do any of those
things. He studied.
And then, come Friday, as soon
as he could,

37:32.350 --> 37:37.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he'd jump in his car and go back
to Queens,
where he worked with his dad.
So, from the

37:37.188 --> 37:43.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very start with Donald, it was
about getting
control of the family business,
building it,

37:43.962 --> 37:49.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
growing it, and becoming the
rich and famous
and powerful person that he
eventually became.

37:49.634 --> 37:56.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Trump graduated from
Penn in 1968
to start what quickly became a
celebrity real

37:56.307 --> 38:00.678 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
estate career.

38:00.778 --> 38:05.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we pick it up there with
syndicated columnist
Mark Shields, New York Times
columnist David

38:05.483 --> 38:10.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brooks, joined tonight special
treat, by Amy
Walter of The Cook Political
Report.

38:10.555 --> 38:11.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, everybody.

38:11.890 --> 38:14.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Another convention. Another four
years, another
convention.

38:14.492 --> 38:18.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's start by talking about
what we have
seen happening playing out
already on the

38:18.563 --> 38:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
floor today. They have only been
in for a
few hours. They're on dinner
break now.

38:21.766 --> 38:27.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, David, there was kind of a
little bit
of an uprising. And various
Trump supporters

38:27.505 --> 38:32.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and mainstream people like Paul
Ryan have
been going around today trying
to say, where

38:32.443 --> 38:33.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is the party, where is the
party?

38:33.912 --> 38:35.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where is the party?

38:35.113 --> 38:37.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: It's not united,
but it's not
opposed.

38:37.949 --> 38:41.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is to say, there is a
lot of disagreement,
but there's no opposition to
Trump. And, as

38:41.653 --> 38:46.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we saw today, as we have seen
all year, really,
the Trump forces are willing to
take more

38:46.424 --> 38:48.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
risks than the anti-Trump
forces.

38:48.560 --> 38:51.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what happened today was
that a bunch
of people were on the verge of
confronting

38:51.796 --> 38:56.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the party, what is now the Trump
party establishment.
And they sort of got beat back,
partly by

38:56.167 --> 39:01.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strong-arm tactics, partly by
pressure, oh,
we can't help Hillary, and they
got beat.

39:01.873 --> 39:05.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it's a question of morale
and courage.
And the Trump people have it.

39:05.677 --> 39:09.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy, do you think
they're likely
to pull themselves together by
the end of

39:09.881 --> 39:11.583 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this week?

39:11.683 --> 39:13.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: The
anti-Trump forces? This has been
a problem

39:13.585 --> 39:17.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the never Trump movement,
is that they
have always had an antagonist in
Donald Trump.

39:17.255 --> 39:18.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have never had a
protagonist

39:18.957 --> 39:22.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have never had somebody who
is going
to fill the space. If not Trump,
then who?

39:22.460 --> 39:26.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so wanting to be a different
party, wanting
to have a different kind of
candidate, that's

39:26.698 --> 39:28.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
fine, but put that person
forward.

39:28.700 --> 39:32.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I also think that this has been
the goal of
the convention, is not
necessarily what happens

39:32.770 --> 39:36.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down there on the floor, but
what happens
after this convention? Will we
see a party

39:36.674 --> 39:38.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that looks more united among
voters?

39:38.977 --> 39:44.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: How does this
compare, Mark, to
conventions we have all sat
around the table

39:44.148 --> 39:47.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and talked? I have never seen
anything quite
like over something as obscure
as the rules

39:47.352 --> 39:49.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the convention.

39:49.354 --> 39:54.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, last time I
saw something
like that was 1980 in New York,
when the Kennedy

39:54.726 --> 39:59.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people opposing Jimmy Carter's
renomination
tried to turn it into a moral
issue, that

39:59.664 --> 40:05.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
delegates should be able to vote
their own
conscience, which is
philosophically interesting,

40:05.603 --> 40:11.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but politically indefensible,
because you
run as a Cruz delegate or a
Trump delegate.

40:11.943 --> 40:14.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm not running for Mark Shields
in most places.

40:14.779 --> 40:16.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You would have my
vote, Mark Shields.

40:16.514 --> 40:19.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And I appreciate
that. But it's
a rationalization.

40:19.217 --> 40:23.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem for the anybody but
Trump group
is, it's been a concept without
a candidate.

40:23.254 --> 40:25.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have never had -- they have
never been
able to put a face. They can
agree that there

40:26.024 --> 40:29.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ought to be somebody, but they
can never agree
who that somebody is.

40:29.627 --> 40:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Wall Street Journal/NBC
poll show
that 38 percent of Republicans
are satisfied

40:36.301 --> 40:40.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with this choice. So, there is a
major task
this week, not as much in the
hall, but in

40:40.505 --> 40:44.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the country, to unite the party,
to unite
the campaign.

40:44.742 --> 40:51.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, David, how much
does Pence
-- how much help does Mike Pence
bring in

40:51.783 --> 40:52.150 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that regard?

40:52.250 --> 40:52.583 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

40:52.684 --> 40:54.452 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

40:54.552 --> 40:56.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: This is -- one of
the things
-- the weird thing about this
party, it's

40:56.220 --> 40:58.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not a normal party. It's one
person.

40:58.389 --> 41:03.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The campaign is one person. And
whether Trump
is disciplined or not is really
the story

41:03.261 --> 41:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here. What I'm finding is, as
everybody tries
to get him to tone himself down,
he gets Trumpier.

41:09.400 --> 41:09.934 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And so he...

41:10.034 --> 41:11.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Trumpier.

41:11.903 --> 41:15.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Gave a rally in
Cincinnati where
he was just off into weird land,
doing free

41:15.940 --> 41:17.709 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
association.

41:17.809 --> 41:22.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And let's face it. The Pence
rollout session
was one of the weirdest vice
presidential

41:23.014 --> 41:28.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rollout sessions in presidential
history,
where the candidate could not
keep his focus

41:28.319 --> 41:34.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on his subject, which was Pence.
But he just
-- gravitational pull, he had to
talk about

41:34.225 --> 41:37.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
himself. And if he's going that
for the next
few months, then there will be
no shared campaign.

41:37.829 --> 41:39.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will just be Donald Trump on
a one-man
band.

41:39.630 --> 41:43.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, Donald Trump,
one-man band
and his staff.

41:43.368 --> 41:47.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw Paul Manafort, his -- I
guess he's
his campaign manager. I don't
think he has

41:47.638 --> 41:48.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an official title.

41:48.206 --> 41:50.041 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MARK SHIELDS: No.

41:50.141 --> 41:54.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Criticizing the
governor of Ohio,
who is not at this convention
here in Ohio,

41:54.312 --> 41:56.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and actually saying pretty harsh
things about
him.

41:56.381 --> 41:58.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, not only that.

41:58.116 --> 42:01.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If your issue is unity, and Paul
Manafort
came out -- we were at his press
conference

42:01.519 --> 42:02.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yesterday -- he said, that is
going to be
the goal.

42:03.087 --> 42:03.721 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

42:03.821 --> 42:04.889 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That was today.

42:04.989 --> 42:06.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That was today.
Today is unity
day.

42:06.824 --> 42:12.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then you come out and hit
the governor
of Ohio, who you beat, and say
that it's a

42:12.697 --> 42:16.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mistake for him not to be there.
He's getting
in a Twitter war, Paul Manafort
is, with the

42:16.567 --> 42:18.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ohio state Republican Party
chairman.

42:18.870 --> 42:23.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, you may not -- you may
see them as
the establishment and part of
the problem,

42:23.307 --> 42:27.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but it would be at least good
not to antagonize
them. And this has been the
problem all along,

42:27.578 --> 42:32.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is, this is a campaign, it
looks like
beyond Donald Trump, but into
his campaign

42:32.183 --> 42:38.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
manager, too, they are not
magnanimous winners.
They're not gracious losers.

42:38.356 --> 42:43.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's going to make it hard
for at least
a certain segment of the
population, you know,

42:43.494 --> 42:46.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Republican electeds, at
least, to get
around him.

42:46.397 --> 42:51.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields, not
only going
after John Kasich, but after the
Bushes. I

42:51.536 --> 42:52.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was at that briefing today with
Paul Manafort.

42:53.004 --> 42:54.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.

42:54.906 --> 42:57.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He was very
critical of George
W. Bush and his father for not
being here.

42:57.775 --> 43:00.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, you want to
be humble
in victory and proud in defeat.

43:01.045 --> 43:05.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you want to be seeking
converts, and not
heretics. And it seems that the
first 24 hours,

43:05.516 --> 43:09.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have been looking for
heretics, banished
to the outer darkness, the
Bushes and John

43:09.954 --> 43:14.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kasich, when they ought to be
saying, I'm
confident they will come over.
They will be

43:14.425 --> 43:17.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
convinced by this convention.
They will join
us, that it will be great, and I
look forward

43:17.862 --> 43:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to their support on Columbus Day
or Labor
Day or wherever.

43:22.233 --> 43:23.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You don't start punishing
people.

43:24.035 --> 43:28.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Except, when have we
ever seen
that from this campaign? The one
thing Donald

43:28.406 --> 43:33.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump keeps saying is, hey, this
worked. I
beat 16 of them, so why should I
change now?

43:33.811 --> 43:35.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

43:35.713 --> 43:37.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would say two things are
happening. They're
running an objectively bad
campaign, and the

43:37.615 --> 43:41.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world is conspiring to help
Donald Trump,
because if -- we got the
violence in Nice,

43:41.819 --> 43:44.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we got violence in the streets
in America.

43:44.155 --> 43:49.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you wanted a cultural
climate where
an authoritarian figure was
going to be -- people

43:49.727 --> 43:51.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
might flock to him, this is that
climate.

43:51.796 --> 43:53.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: I agree.

43:53.698 --> 43:56.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But just to come back to what
Peter Hart,
the Wall Street Journal/NBC
pollster, said,

43:56.634 --> 44:01.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
he said this is a change
election, and there
is no question. And we're having
earthquake

44:01.439 --> 44:03.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after earthquake, aftershock
after aftershock.

44:04.008 --> 44:10.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in a change year, Donald
Trump has become
the chaos candidate. And that's
what he can't

44:10.248 --> 44:16.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
project is chaos. And there has
got to be
order and discipline and a sense
of magnanimity,

44:16.954 --> 44:21.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as Amy mentioned. And I just
think that's
what's missing. And if that's
not here this

44:21.659 --> 44:24.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
week, it is going to be a severe
body blow
to his chances.

44:24.896 --> 44:31.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Amy, what we
hear is that
they're going to try to tie all
this chaos

44:31.202 --> 44:36.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the world and here in this
country with
the violence we have seen in the
last weeks

44:36.173 --> 44:38.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
directly to Hillary Clinton and
Barack Obama.

44:38.175 --> 44:41.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Well, listen,
there's a good case
to be made by Republicans...

44:41.779 --> 44:43.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.

44:43.748 --> 44:46.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: ... that a
Democratic administration
has not taken care of -- or what
they're going

44:46.617 --> 44:50.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to argue is they have actually
exacerbated
the chaos in the world. And
there is a good

44:51.022 --> 44:52.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
case to prosecute there.

44:52.957 --> 44:57.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They just have a very terrible
person doing
the prosecuting at this point,
in part because

44:57.862 --> 45:00.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- and I think this is the most
important
thing he needs to do here, is
look like the

45:00.965 --> 45:05.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of person who has the
temperament to
be able to make these sorts of
decisions in

45:05.803 --> 45:08.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
times of crisis in a very
chaotic world.

45:08.205 --> 45:11.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's the most
important thing
that he needs to do. All the
talk about unity

45:11.576 --> 45:16.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is nice and fun, but at the end
of the day,
if he comes out of here with
more voters saying,

45:16.614 --> 45:22.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know what, I can see him
now, give him
-- I can see the opportunity for
him to lead

45:22.587 --> 45:24.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a time of crisis.

45:24.422 --> 45:26.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, it's not there. The
polls are not
showing it. That's what this is
about.

45:26.624 --> 45:29.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, we have a
convention opening
tonight. And we're going to hear
from Rick

45:29.994 --> 45:31.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Perry, someone who actually did
endorse him.

45:31.829 --> 45:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to hear from other
people who
ran against him and endorsed
him. We don't

45:35.433 --> 45:39.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know where Chris Christie has
gotten to, but
we are going to hear from other
people. And

45:39.170 --> 45:44.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the end, this may be just a
typical convention,
albeit with a couple of sitcom
stars added

45:44.809 --> 45:46.577 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

45:46.677 --> 45:47.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, Scott Baio,
let's not
underestimate the -- and that
guy from "The

45:47.945 --> 45:49.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Bold and the Beautiful,"
whatever his name
is, that guy.

45:50.014 --> 45:51.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That guy. That guy.

45:51.983 --> 45:53.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: "Charles in
Charge."

45:53.651 --> 45:54.852 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

45:54.952 --> 45:56.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But it is -- it's
actually kind
of weird.

45:56.320 --> 45:57.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, we come here and you think
Trump has
changed everything.

45:57.922 --> 45:59.890 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: No.

45:59.991 --> 46:01.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: The stage, it
looks like a normal
convention stage. The crowd
looks like a normal

46:01.425 --> 46:03.194 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
convention.

46:03.294 --> 46:05.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The one thing that is different,
as you talk
to people in the delegations,
for a lot of

46:05.529 --> 46:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people, this is their first
convention. There
really is recycling of the human
-- the people

46:09.634 --> 46:12.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are here, this is their
first time for
a whole chunk of them.

46:12.136 --> 46:15.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Some people very
happy, proud,
they say, that there aren't many
politicians

46:15.673 --> 46:17.475 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

46:17.575 --> 46:19.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And that's another
difference,
is that all the establishment
folks that would

46:19.443 --> 46:23.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be hosting parties, or we would
be going to
press conferences and talking to
and using

46:23.347 --> 46:25.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as sources, none of them are
here today.

46:25.950 --> 46:30.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's exactly what Donald
Trump is arguing,
which is, that is a segment of
the party that

46:30.388 --> 46:31.656 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has failed them.

46:31.756 --> 46:34.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, thank
you all.

46:34.458 --> 46:40.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will see a lot of you over
the next two
weeks, Amy Walter, David Brooks,
Mark Shields.

46:40.364 --> 46:46.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's now take a look behind the
scenes at
what it takes to put a
convention like this

46:46.170 --> 46:46.737 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
together.

46:46.837 --> 46:49.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang is our guide.

46:49.940 --> 46:55.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: People have come to
the Republican
Convention in Cleveland for many
reasons.

46:55.312 --> 46:59.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: The number one thing that
we need to
achieve here at convention is
unity.

46:59.116 --> 47:01.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: We want to make the party
seem more relevant.

47:01.419 --> 47:03.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: I'm looking forward to
seeing Donald
Trump.

47:03.888 --> 47:09.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The person in charge
of making
it happen, convention executive
producer Phil

47:09.794 --> 47:11.495 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Alongi.

47:11.595 --> 47:12.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHIL ALONGI, Executive Producer,
Republican
National Convention: Believe it
not, this

47:12.363 --> 47:14.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is my 17th political convention.

47:14.465 --> 47:20.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: For 15 of them, he
was a top producer
for NBC News. Now he's doing it
for the Republican

47:20.538 --> 47:22.406 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Party.

47:22.506 --> 47:25.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHIL ALONGI: I always feel that
any opportunity
to give voters information and
fulfill our

47:25.309 --> 47:29.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
responsibility is what we should
do. This
is a news event and it should be
handled by

47:29.880 --> 47:31.682 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a news person.

47:31.782 --> 47:35.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Alongi is in charge
of planning
every detail of the program you
will see on

47:35.386 --> 47:41.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your screens, from the balloon
drop, setting
up signs, even the audio and
video displays

47:42.093 --> 47:48.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
inside the hall. He and his team
started planning
it in April of 2015.

47:48.799 --> 47:54.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you go through that period
and once you
get down to the actual
presumptive nominee,

47:54.205 --> 47:56.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are there tweaks and changes you
have got
to do?

47:56.240 --> 47:59.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHIL ALONGI: Always. We didn't
know who the
nominee was going to be. We
wanted to be able

47:59.143 --> 48:02.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make them feel they were part
of the process
and engage.

48:02.279 --> 48:05.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: What sort of
personalization did
the Trump campaign want?

48:05.216 --> 48:10.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHIL ALONGI: Certainly, the look
of the lectern.
What we're able to do with this
set is achieve,

48:10.921 --> 48:15.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through lighting, through the
screens any
kind of mood of whatever.

48:15.326 --> 48:20.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: His favorite
features, the two
giant video screens on the
podium.

48:20.865 --> 48:26.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHIL ALONGI: It's 1,711 square
feet of LED
screens, something like 10
million pixels.

48:26.804 --> 48:31.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The upper screen is a convex
screen, so it
comes out to you. And the lower
screen is

48:31.575 --> 48:35.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a concave, so it draws you in,
and so that's
what we're hoping. It keeps
everything flowing.

48:35.813 --> 48:40.985 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Alongi's first
position as executive
producer for the party was 2012
in Tampa.

48:41.085 --> 48:45.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a political year unlike
any other.
How does this compare to the
last time?

48:45.289 --> 48:49.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PHIL ALONGI: Well, we had
Governor Romney
earlier in the process, a
different candidate,

48:49.693 --> 48:51.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a different type of race.

48:51.562 --> 48:54.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Delegates we spoke
with, each want
to came away with something
different.

48:54.465 --> 48:58.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: I'm going to take away
all this memory,
all this nice time.

48:58.169 --> 49:00.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Then I feel as a delegate
that I made
a difference.

49:01.071 --> 49:03.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: For Alongi, the goal
is clear.

49:03.607 --> 49:08.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHIL ALONGI: The challenge of
working on this
event from here is you have to
keep 20,000-plus

49:08.712 --> 49:13.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people entertained here and
interested, and
you have the millions of people
that are back

49:14.084 --> 49:15.853 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
home watching.

49:15.953 --> 49:19.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, I just want to bring
whatever I can into
that control room and give the
people the

49:20.057 --> 49:21.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
best show that they can possibly
get.

49:21.926 --> 49:26.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That show standards
tonight, as
Melania Trump and Republican
notables take

49:26.630 --> 49:27.698 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this stage.

49:27.798 --> 49:31.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang in Cleveland.

49:31.669 --> 49:37.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And our coverage
will start
tonight at 8:00 p.m. Eastern.

49:37.942 --> 49:44.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tune in from your car or the
couch for our
special NPR/"PBS NewsHour"
coverage of the

49:44.949 --> 49:48.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican National Convention
Cleveland -- now
back to Hari in Washington.

49:48.352 --> 49:50.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thanks, Judy
and Gwen.

49:50.254 --> 49:53.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
fourth Baltimore
police officer to stand trial
for the death

49:54.091 --> 49:58.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Freddie Gray was acquitted
today. Lieutenant
Brian Rice was the
highest-ranking officer

49:58.929 --> 50:03.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
charged. Gray died in April 2015
after being
critically injured during a ride
in a police

50:03.634 --> 50:08.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
van. Two other officers have
been acquitted,
and two more are awaiting trial.
The trial

50:08.706 --> 50:11.742 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of a sixth officer ended in a
hung jury.

50:11.842 --> 50:16.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An Afghan teenager attacked
passengers on
a train in Germany tonight with
an axe and

50:16.680 --> 50:21.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a knife. Several were seriously
wounded. Police
say it happened on a regional
train near the

50:21.352 --> 50:26.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
city of Wurzburg and Bavaria.
Police killed
the 17-year-old attacker.
There's no word

50:26.357 --> 50:28.125 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on a motive.

50:28.225 --> 50:32.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In France, there's new evidence
that the man
who killed 84 people in a truck
attack in

50:32.263 --> 50:38.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nice had been radicalized just
recently. The
uncle of Mohamed Bouhlel said
today an Islamic

50:38.502 --> 50:41.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
State militant recruited him in
the last two
weeks.

50:41.805 --> 50:43.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And a prosecutor said there's
further evidence.

50:44.074 --> 50:47.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRANCOIS MOLINS, Paris
Prosecutor (through
translator): Another witness
told us that

50:47.912 --> 50:52.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he started growing a beard 10
days ago, explaining
-- and I quote the witness --
that the beard

50:52.683 --> 50:57.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was for religious purposes. He
had also mentioned
the Islamic State, saying he
didn't understand

50:57.922 --> 50:59.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
why ISIS could not claim a
territory.

50:59.990 --> 51:03.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Meanwhile,
France held a
nationwide moment of silence
today. And in

51:03.827 --> 51:07.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nice, thousands gathered on the
promenade
where the attacker plowed into
crowds of people

51:07.598 --> 51:09.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last Thursday.

51:09.466 --> 51:13.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A document tied to last year's
Iran nuclear
deal has surfaced, and it
indicates that key

51:13.137 --> 51:18.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
restrictions will start to lapse
within 11
years. The Associated Press
reports that,

51:18.776 --> 51:24.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beginning in 2027, Iran will be
allowed to
install more powerful machines
to enrich uranium.

51:24.248 --> 51:28.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That could reduce the time
needed to build
a bomb to six months or even
less.

51:28.319 --> 51:33.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An investigative report today
for the World
Anti-Doping Agency details
extensive state-supported

51:33.457 --> 51:38.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doping by Russia since 2011. Its
findings
go well beyond previous
allegations of Russian

51:38.862 --> 51:41.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cheating at the 2014 Winter
Olympics in Sochi.

51:41.565 --> 51:45.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The report's author, Richard
McLaren, said
in Toronto that the biggest
surprise is the

51:45.636 --> 51:47.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
extent of state oversight and
control.

51:47.538 --> 51:52.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RICHARD MCLAREN, World
Anti-Doping Agency:
From all of this comes a picture
which emerges

51:52.409 --> 51:59.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of an intertwined network of
state involvement.
It was a failsafe method of
permitting cheating

51:59.249 --> 52:04.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian athletes to compete
while using performance-enhancing
substances.

52:04.388 --> 52:08.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
Anti-Doping Agency called
for the International Olympic
Committee to

52:09.093 --> 52:13.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ban all Russian athletes from
next month's
Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
In response,

52:13.931 --> 52:17.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian President Vladimir Putin
said all
officials -- quote -- "directly
responsible"

52:17.534 --> 52:20.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for the cover-up will be
suspended.

52:20.204 --> 52:24.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street got off to a slow
start. The Dow
Jones industrial average gained
16 points

52:24.875 --> 52:31.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to close at 18533. The Nasdaq
rose 26 points
and the S&amp;P 500 added five.

52:31.115 --> 52:36.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And President Obama has awarded
the Medal
of Honor to a Vietnam War
veteran nearly 50

52:36.954 --> 52:41.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years after he helped save more
than 40 U.S.
soldiers. Retired Army
Lieutenant Colonel

52:41.425 --> 52:46.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Charles Kettles received the
nation's highest
military award today for
repeatedly flying

52:46.263 --> 52:48.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his helicopter into enemy fire.

52:48.165 --> 52:51.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
To the dozens of American
soldiers that he

52:51.402 --> 52:59.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saved in Vietnam half-a-century
ago, Chuck
is the reason they lived and
came home and

52:59.410 --> 53:07.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had children and grandchildren,
entire family
trees made possible by the
actions of this

53:07.451 --> 53:09.286 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
one man.

53:09.386 --> 53:11.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Kettles
originally received
the Distinguished Service Cross,
but the Veterans

53:11.221 --> 53:15.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
History Project campaigned to
upgrade it to
the Medal of Honor.

53:15.125 --> 53:18.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's it from Washington for
now. I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

53:18.462 --> 53:26.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And stay with us
all night
long for our special "PBS
NewsHour"/NPR coverage

53:26.570 --> 53:31.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the Republican National
Convention. It
all starts at 8:00 p.m. Eastern.

53:31.175 --> 53:33.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And from Cleveland, that's the
"NewsHour"
for now. I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:34.011 --> 53:35.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

53:35.846 --> 53:39.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again here
later tonight.
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank

53:40.050 --> 53:53.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you, and good night.
