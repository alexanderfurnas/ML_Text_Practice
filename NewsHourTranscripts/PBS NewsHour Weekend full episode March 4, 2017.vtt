PRIOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP TAKING

06:03.930 --> 06:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFFICE IN JANUARY.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.935 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PROPOSAL HAD BEEN KIND OF IN

06:08.935 --> 06:11.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WORKS, BUT THE OBAMA

06:13.707 --> 06:15.742 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLOW MR. TRUMP TO MAKE THE

06:21.548 --> 06:23.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY-- AND THE PENTAGON WOULD

06:23.049 --> 06:24.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TELL YOU-- IS POTENTIALLY EVEN

06:24.584 --> 06:26.286 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

HOMELAND THAN ISLAMIC STATE IS.

06:30.123 --> 06:31.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THESE PROPOSALS WERE KIND OF

06:31.791 --> 06:33.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDER WAY, AND THEN MR. TRUMP

06:33.526 --> 06:35.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTED ON THEM, ESSENTIALLY

06:35.161 --> 06:37.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

AND SO FORTH.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

07:01.721 --> 07:04.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCERNED WITH PRIMARILY IS

07:04.724 --> 07:08.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THEY'RE INVOLVED ON THE GROUND.

07:37.157 --> 07:40.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PENTAGON'S LOATHE TO KIND OF

07:40.126 --> 07:41.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, BUT THERE IS

THAT MANY PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON

18:55.968 --> 18:58.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPECT TO HAPPEN SURROUNDING NET

TOM WHEELER, PASSED IN ORDER TO

19:07.580 --> 19:09.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPOSE NEW RULES ON INTERNET

19:09.882 --> 19:10.750 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROVIDERS.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, THESE RULES THAT WERE

19:12.685 --> 19:14.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PASSED WERE PRETTY CONTROVERSIAL

19:14.353 --> 19:15.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THE TIME.

19:15.287 --> 19:16.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALTHOUGH, MANY CONSUMER

19:16.756 --> 19:18.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADVOCATES SAY THAT THEY WERE

19:18.257 --> 19:19.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NECESSARY TO PRESERVE A FREE AND

19:19.792 --> 19:20.826 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPEN INTERNET.

19:20.826 --> 19:23.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT REPUBLICANS, SUCH AS PAI,

19:23.596 --> 19:24.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE CRITICIZED THE RULE SAYING

19:24.697 --> 19:26.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF GOVERNMENT

19:26.732 --> 19:28.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVER-REACH AND WILL DEPRESS

19:28.234 --> 19:30.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERNET PROVIDER INVESTMENTS IN

19:30.936 --> 19:31.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR NETWORKS.

19:31.737 --> 19:32.438 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: SO SOME OF THE

19:32.438 --> 19:33.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCERNS THAT CONSUMER GROUPS

19:33.639 --> 19:34.807 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE IS WHETHER OR NOT THERE

19:34.807 --> 19:36.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL BE A FAST LANE AND A SLOW

19:36.275 --> 19:36.742 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LANE.

19:36.742 --> 19:37.676 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WAS THE FEAR, RIGHT, IF

19:37.676 --> 19:39.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TELECOM COMPANIES ARE ABLE TO

19:39.111 --> 19:40.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRIKE DIFFERENT PARTNERSHIPS,

19:40.713 --> 19:42.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY CAN PROVIDE CERTAIN PIECES

19:42.181 --> 19:43.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF CONTENT BETTER, WHICH MEANS

19:43.949 --> 19:45.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER PIECES OF CONTENT MIGHT

19:45.384 --> 19:46.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT COME UP SO FAST WHEN YOU

19:46.852 --> 19:47.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEARCH FOR THEM.

19:47.720 --> 19:48.854 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, IN SOME CASES, SOME

19:50.489 --> 19:51.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERNET PROVIDERS HAVE

19:51.390 --> 19:53.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMITTED NOT TO DOING THAT, BUT

19:53.926 --> 19:54.960 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FEAR AMONG CONSUMER

19:54.960 --> 19:56.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADVOCATES IS THAT, YOU KNOW,

19:56.829 --> 19:58.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME INTERNET PROVIDERS MAY NOT

19:58.931 --> 19:59.999 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE DISCLOSING CERTAIN NEW

19:59.999 --> 20:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUSINESS MODELS THAT COULD

20:01.333 --> 20:02.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POTENTIALLY HARM CONSUMERS.

20:02.968 --> 20:05.204 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE RULES ARE GENERALLY

20:05.204 --> 20:07.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THOSE

20:07.306 --> 20:08.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POTENTIAL HARMS BY GIVING THE

20:08.741 --> 20:10.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNMENT THE POWER TO

20:10.476 --> 20:12.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INVESTIGATE AND GO AFTER

20:12.411 --> 20:14.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPANIES THAT ARE THINKING

20:14.180 --> 20:16.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT OR INTRODUCING SOME OF

20:16.082 --> 20:16.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE PROGRAMS,

20:16.949 --> 20:17.650 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: AND THERE WAS

20:17.650 --> 20:19.251 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALSO SOME CONCERN ABOUT THE

20:19.251 --> 20:21.020 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRIVACY RULES THAT WENT INTO

20:21.020 --> 20:22.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACE ABOUT, YOU KNOW, RIGHT

20:22.388 --> 20:23.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, MY CELL PHONE PROVIDER

20:23.522 --> 20:25.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRETTY MUCH KNOWS EXACTLY WHERE

20:25.391 --> 20:26.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I AM.

20:26.092 --> 20:27.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY KNOW LOTS AND LOTS OF

20:27.159 --> 20:27.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINGS ABOUT ME.

20:27.860 --> 20:28.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD BE

20:28.694 --> 20:30.196 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABLE TO SELL SOME OF THAT DATA,

20:30.196 --> 20:32.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN IF IT'S ANONYMIZED, TO MAKE

20:32.298 --> 20:33.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A PROFIT.

20:33.766 --> 20:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> EXACTLY.

20:34.500 --> 20:35.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO SOME OF THE RULES THAT WERE

20:35.968 --> 20:37.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PASSED UNDER THE WHEELER TENURE

20:37.770 --> 20:40.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INVOLVED THESE PRIVACY RULES

20:40.372 --> 20:42.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT ARE BASICALLY DESIGNED TO

20:42.174 --> 20:43.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PREVENT INTERNET PROVIDERS FROM

20:43.542 --> 20:44.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABUSING THE DATA THAT THEY

20:44.710 --> 20:46.779 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COLLECT ON CUSTOMERS LIKE YOU

20:46.779 --> 20:47.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ME.

20:47.379 --> 20:48.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO ALL OF THE RULES THAT

20:48.681 --> 20:50.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE BUILT BY THE F.C.C. TO

20:50.049 --> 20:51.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADDRESS PRIVACY ARE AIMED AT

20:51.550 --> 20:53.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PREVENTING INTERNET PROVIDERS

20:53.052 --> 20:54.687 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM ABUSING THAT LEVEL OF

20:54.687 --> 20:55.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFORMATION THAT THEY HAVE ON

20:55.955 --> 20:56.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU.

20:56.655 --> 20:59.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT UNDER AJIT PAI, SOME OF

20:59.592 --> 21:00.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE RULES ARE LIKELY TO BE

21:00.993 --> 21:01.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROLLED BACK.
