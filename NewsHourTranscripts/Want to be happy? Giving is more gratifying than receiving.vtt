GWEN IFILL: Now: the power of
altruism, not
just for those on the receiving
end, but also

00:05.339 --> 00:09.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how it provides physical and
emotional benefits
for the giver.

00:09.743 --> 00:14.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Economics correspondent Paul
Solman takes
a look, part of our weekly
segment Making

00:14.147 --> 00:16.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sense, which airs every Thursday
on the "NewsHour."

00:16.884 --> 00:21.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: I want you to meet my
friend Monkey.
Hello. Do you want to say hello?

00:21.588 --> 00:25.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: It is better to
give than to
receive. You may have heard it
when you were

00:25.993 --> 00:31.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about this age, or even in the
past few weeks,
when you bought out the entire
Christmas list.

00:31.498 --> 00:38.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Look, Monkey has a bowl
just like you.
You don't have any treats and
neither does

00:38.505 --> 00:40.440 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Monkey.

00:40.474 --> 00:43.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But better for
whom? A behavioral
economics experiment has come up
with a provocative

00:43.644 --> 00:44.578 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
answer.

00:44.611 --> 00:46.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: I'm going to give them
all to you.

00:46.480 --> 00:51.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Psychology
professor Elizabeth
Dunn designed this test to see
if even very

00:51.952 --> 00:55.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
young kids could be happier
giving than receiving.

00:55.188 --> 00:57.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH DUNN, University of
British Columbia:
We worked with kind of the
toddler equivalent

00:57.557 --> 01:02.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of gold, namely goldfish
crackers. We gave
them a bunch goldfish for
themselves, and

01:02.663 --> 01:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then we gave them the chance to
give some
of these goldfish away to a
puppet named Monkey.

01:06.600 --> 01:11.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Will you give one to
Monkey? Yes?

01:11.405 --> 01:15.042 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CHILD: Yes.

01:15.075 --> 01:22.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Dunn recorded
dozens of kids
doing this, then had students
who knew nothing

01:22.716 --> 01:28.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the experiment compare the
facial expressions
when receiving and when giving.
When were

01:28.555 --> 01:30.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the kids happiest?

01:30.424 --> 01:33.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH DUNN: What we see is
that the toddlers
are happier when they're getting
the chance

01:33.427 --> 01:37.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to give the goldfish away, as
compared to
when they're getting the
goldfish for themselves.

01:37.564 --> 01:39.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Much happier. So,
it's no surprise
that, with fellow happiness
scholar Michael

01:39.232 --> 01:40.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Norton, Dunn has written a book:
"Happy Money:
The Science of Happier
Spending."

01:40.667 --> 01:42.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It features five key takeaways.

01:42.502 --> 01:46.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH DUNN: Well, if you
want to use money
to buy happiness, we suggest you
should buy

01:46.440 --> 01:56.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
experiences, you should buy
time, you should
make it a treat, you should pay
now and consume

01:56.049 --> 02:01.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
later, and you should invest in
others.

02:01.321 --> 02:07.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Invest in others,
the most surprising
finding of the five and one
which regularly

02:07.194 --> 02:10.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
elicits skepticism, says
business school professor
Michael Norton.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL NORTON, Harvard
University: A lot
of people, when we talk about
the fact that

02:12.933 --> 02:17.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
giving makes you happy and
you're better off
giving than spending your money
on yourself,

02:17.738 --> 02:21.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will argue back, first off, that
we're crazy,
and, secondly, that that can't
be true, because

02:22.009 --> 02:26.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't really know what you
like, but I definitely
know what I like. And so, just
by definition,

02:26.947 --> 02:30.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm better at spending my money
on myself
and getting happiness than you,
because I

02:30.183 --> 02:31.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
don't know everything about you.

02:31.618 --> 02:36.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Can panda have one? Yes.
Can one go
in his bowl?

02:36.323 --> 02:39.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL NORTON: It's just not
what we see
in this study. So, even with
these toddlers,

02:39.226 --> 02:43.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are 2 years old, even if
it's the case
that their parents are making
them give in

02:43.463 --> 02:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
order to be a nice person,
they're smiling.

02:46.366 --> 02:50.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And smiling is something that
just comes out.
It's not something that you can
control very

02:50.037 --> 02:51.805 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
well.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And it's not just
toddlers. Dunn
also designed an experiment for
grownups.

02:54.941 --> 02:58.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH DUNN: We went out on
our campus
at the University of British
Columbia and

02:58.378 --> 03:02.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just walked up to people in the
morning and
handed them either a $5 or a $5
bill, which

03:02.516 --> 03:05.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we asked them to spend by the
end of the day.
And there was a catch. We told
some people

03:05.919 --> 03:08.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they had to spend the money on
themselves.
We told some people they had to
spend the

03:08.822 --> 03:10.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
money on somebody else.

03:10.757 --> 03:14.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we found was that
people who'd been
randomly assigned to spend this
money on somebody

03:14.261 --> 03:17.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
else felt better by the end of
the day than
people who'd been assigned to
spend that same

03:17.564 --> 03:19.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
small amount of money on
themselves.

03:19.399 --> 03:25.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: A small experiment,
small money,
small number of subjects. And
Canadians are

03:25.138 --> 03:26.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
unusually nice, eh?

03:26.873 --> 03:32.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH DUNN: So, we conducted
parallel
experiments in Canada, Uganda,
South Africa,

03:32.412 --> 03:37.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as well as collecting
correlational data from
around the world. And what we
saw was that

03:37.584 --> 03:41.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in poor and rich countries
alike, people felt
happier when they had the chance
to spend

03:41.455 --> 03:43.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
money on others rather than
themselves.

03:43.390 --> 03:47.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Best of all,
though, is the chance
to spend it on others you can
actually see.

03:47.727 --> 03:50.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL NORTON: So, a lot of the
charitable
giving that a lot of us do, we
write a check

03:50.997 --> 03:55.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it goes somewhere. And we
can show that
that does make you happier, but
think of the

03:55.302 --> 03:58.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
difference between the check
goes into the
ether and you don't know what
happened with

03:58.738 --> 04:03.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the money, compared to you
really tangibly
see the impact that your money
had on another

04:03.743 --> 04:05.011 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
person.

04:05.045 --> 04:06.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Or even just the
imaginary effect
on a stuffie.

04:06.546 --> 04:09.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Can you give one to
giraffe?

04:09.783 --> 04:16.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But are all kids
equally altruistic?
Is there a normal distribution,
a kind of

04:16.857 --> 04:22.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bell curve, some give a lot and
are really
happy, some are not happy at
all, most in

04:22.462 --> 04:24.331 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the middle?

04:24.364 --> 04:27.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH DUNN: It's actually
surprisingly
consistent. So, most of the
toddlers are happier

04:27.567 --> 04:30.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when they're giving than when
they're getting
the treats for themselves.

04:30.704 --> 04:33.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So what's that red
spot on the
brain?

04:33.039 --> 04:35.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABIGAIL MARSH, Georgetown
University: So,
the red mark in the brain is an
area of functional

04:35.842 --> 04:37.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
activation in the region called
the amygdala.

04:37.911 --> 04:42.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Georgetown
University psychology
Professor Abigail Marsh measures
the brain

04:42.782 --> 04:49.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
activity of what she terms
extraordinary altruists,
people who donated a kidney to a
total stranger.

04:49.589 --> 04:54.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABIGAIL MARSH: The amygdala is
part of what's
called the mammalian brain. It's
involved

04:54.127 --> 05:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with emotions like fear and it's
involved
in social processes, like, to
some extent,

05:00.534 --> 05:06.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
love and caring. This is an
image from a brain
scan that we did looking at
differences in

05:06.873 --> 05:12.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amygdala activation in people
who had donated
a kidney to a stranger relative
to people

05:12.112 --> 05:14.080 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who have not.

05:14.114 --> 05:19.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Her research, she
says, was unequivocal:
The altruistic amygdalas were
about 8 percent

05:19.085 --> 05:20.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
larger than normal.

05:20.921 --> 05:24.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABIGAIL MARSH: Altruistic kidney
donors showed
increased activation in the
amygdala when

05:24.724 --> 05:30.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they saw somebody in distress,
which is the
opposite of people at the other
end of the

05:30.096 --> 05:34.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
compassion spectrum,
psychopaths, who show
reduced activation in the
amygdala when they

05:34.634 --> 05:35.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
see somebody in distress.

05:35.769 --> 05:38.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And in one study of
psychopaths'
brains:

05:38.972 --> 05:43.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABIGAIL MARSH: Their amygdalas
were shown
to be 17 to 18 percent smaller
than that of

05:43.410 --> 05:49.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
controls, so this also seems to
be related
to having lower levels of
concern or compassion

05:49.783 --> 05:51.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for other people.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, Dr. Seuss was
right. The
Grinch's heart is really three
sizes too small?

05:53.620 --> 05:57.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABIGAIL MARSH: Yes, I do use
that analogy
sometimes. In fact, maybe it was
his amygdala

05:57.557 --> 05:59.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that was too small.

05:59.326 --> 06:02.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So when people find
that giving
is more gratifying than
receiving, what's

06:02.362 --> 06:04.130 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going on?

06:04.164 --> 06:06.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABIGAIL MARSH: Everything I
think we have
learned from our research is
consistent with

06:06.099 --> 06:12.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the idea that it is a good thing
and beneficial
for a person to be giving and
generous to

06:12.839 --> 06:14.140 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
other people.

06:14.174 --> 06:19.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Do you want to give the
last treat
to you or to Monkey?

06:19.145 --> 06:25.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: One last
experiment: the effect
of giving on blood pressure.
Professor Dunn

06:25.518 --> 06:31.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gave adults over 65 with high
blood pressure
pill bottles filled with money.

06:31.091 --> 06:36.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH DUNN: We asked them to
take home
these pill bottles and open them
on specified

06:36.229 --> 06:42.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
days over the course of three
weeks. Now,
inside each bottle was actually
$20. And if

06:42.068 --> 06:45.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you look at the label, there are
some instructions
about what you should be doing
with that money.

06:45.538 --> 06:51.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Please spend this
money on someone
else by 4:30 p.m. at the date
listed below.

06:51.678 --> 06:56.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH DUNN: Other people got
pill bottles
that looked very similar, except
the instruction

06:56.983 --> 06:58.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is a little bit different.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Please spend this
money on yourself.

06:59.853 --> 07:04.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH DUNN: So, everybody
was pretty happy
getting pill bottles filled with
money. But

07:04.391 --> 07:09.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when we measured their blood
pressure, both
before and after the study, what
we found

07:09.162 --> 07:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was that people who got these
pill bottles
telling them to spend the money
on somebody

07:13.266 --> 07:17.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
else showed a significant
reduction in their
blood pressure from the
beginning to the end

07:17.904 --> 07:19.706 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the study.

07:19.739 --> 07:22.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In contrast, people who got this
pill bottle
who were told to spend the money
on themselves

07:22.809 --> 07:24.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just showed no change from the
beginning to
the end.

07:24.978 --> 07:29.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Now, Dunn insists
we issue this
warning. No matter how generous
the hypertense

07:29.916 --> 07:34.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
among you become after watching
this story,
please do not give up your blood
pressure

07:34.587 --> 07:36.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
medication just yet.

07:36.389 --> 07:42.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you want a quick ticket
to happiness,
