JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.405 --> 00:07.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.207 --> 00:11.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: In a
stunning move,
the White House announces
President Trump

00:11.478 --> 00:14.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has fired FBI Director James
Comey.

00:14.614 --> 00:20.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, I sit down with Maine
Senator Susan
Collins to talk about the Comey
firing and

00:20.387 --> 00:25.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fate of the Republicans'
health care bill
as it makes its way to her side
of Capitol

00:25.358 --> 00:27.127 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Hill.

00:27.160 --> 00:32.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And searching for hope in Havana
-- why some
lung cancer patients are making
the trek to

00:32.465 --> 00:34.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Cuba for a promising medication.

00:34.501 --> 00:35.769 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

00:35.802 --> 00:37.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIMOTHY GOGGINS, Oncologist: I'm
surprised
Mick's still here.

00:37.804 --> 00:42.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I do believe that, outside
of divine intervention,
there's some sort of scientific
basis to what

00:43.009 --> 00:44.244 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he's doing.

00:44.277 --> 00:51.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:51.584 --> 00:54.487 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:54.521 --> 01:03.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Our lead story is
breaking
right this minute.

01:03.630 --> 01:07.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump has fired James
Comey as the
director of the FBI.

01:07.700 --> 01:12.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House Press Secretary Sean
Spicer made
the announcement just moments
ago.

01:12.672 --> 01:16.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And here to tell us what we know
at this time
is our own White House
correspondent John

01:16.876 --> 01:17.844 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yang.

01:17.877 --> 01:19.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John, this looks like a bolt out
of the blue.

01:19.446 --> 01:20.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What have you learned?

01:20.447 --> 01:22.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It was absolutely out
of the blue.

01:22.248 --> 01:25.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was after we were told, the
White House
press were told there would be
no more news

01:25.385 --> 01:27.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
developments for the night.

01:27.320 --> 01:32.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sean Spicer walked into the
Briefing Room,
read a very brief statement
saying that President

01:32.258 --> 01:38.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump had fired James Comey on
the recommendation
of the attorney general, Jeff
Sessions, and

01:38.798 --> 01:43.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the deputy attorney general, Rod
Rosenstein.

01:43.636 --> 01:45.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're getting letters.

01:45.505 --> 01:51.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're slowly getting bits and
pieces of the
reasons why, the letters that
Sessions sent

01:51.277 --> 01:57.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the president recommending
this move and
Rosenstein's memo recommending
it as well.

01:57.450 --> 02:03.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It appears to center around
Comey's handling
of the investigation into
Hillary Clinton's

02:03.356 --> 02:11.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
e-mails, ironically enough, that
his announcement,
his holding a press conference
in July clearing

02:11.164 --> 02:15.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her, but also criticizing her at
the same
time.

02:15.335 --> 02:17.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Usually, they don't make
statements like that.

02:17.904 --> 02:22.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Usually, they just say the
investigation is
closed, no charges have been
brought.

02:22.408 --> 02:27.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rosenstein said his memo that
Comey -- that
-- I'm sorry -- he, Rosenstein,
doesn't understood

02:27.680 --> 02:34.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Comey's refusal to accept --
quote -- "nearly
universal judgment that he was
mistaken in

02:34.854 --> 02:36.756 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that."

02:36.789 --> 02:40.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, mistaken in
not going ahead
and prosecuting Hillary Clinton
for what happened

02:40.894 --> 02:42.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with her e-mails?

02:42.695 --> 02:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: As I understand it,
mistaken in
going public with what they had
gathered and

02:47.634 --> 02:52.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then saying we're not going the
prosecute,
rather than just saying, we're
closing this

02:52.605 --> 02:54.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
investigation with no
prosecution.

02:54.774 --> 02:59.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John, did we know
that this
kind of an investigation was
under way at

02:59.546 --> 03:04.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Justice Department looking
into Comey's
handling of the Clinton e-mail
matter?

03:04.217 --> 03:07.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The irony of this is
that all this
criticism had been coming from
the Democrats,

03:07.921 --> 03:13.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but apparently this was being
looked at within
the Justice Department.

03:13.259 --> 03:18.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, this is also an FBI
director who was
conducting an investigation into
possible

03:18.798 --> 03:22.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ties between the president's
campaign and
Russia.

03:22.368 --> 03:25.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There will be, I'm sure,
conspiracy theorists.

03:25.905 --> 03:30.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I'm sure there will be
allegations of, were
they looking for a reason to do
this?

03:30.476 --> 03:35.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And up until now,
President
Trump has given every indication
that he wanted

03:35.081 --> 03:36.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
James Comey to continue.

03:36.916 --> 03:41.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Although today, very
telling, perhaps
tellingly, we don't know, there
was -- after

03:41.221 --> 03:47.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the letter was sent, he had to
correct, clean
up some of his testimony to the
Senate regarding

03:47.694 --> 03:51.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- again regarding this e-mail
investigation,
a separate instance.

03:51.798 --> 03:59.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sean Spicer was asked, does the
president
-- still have the support of the
president?

03:59.138 --> 04:02.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sean said: I have not spoken to
the president
since this development.

04:02.475 --> 04:06.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would be reluctant to say that
now without
speaking to the president first.

04:06.312 --> 04:09.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, John Yang,
again, this
story breaking just as we're
sitting here

04:09.215 --> 04:10.917 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this evening.

04:10.950 --> 04:13.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It broke just 15 minutes before
we went on
the air at 6:00 Eastern,
learning that the

04:13.586 --> 04:18.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- from the White House, the
president has
fired the FBI director, James
Comey.

04:18.758 --> 04:23.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the issue you're talking
about right now,
John, has to do with what James
Comey said

04:24.030 --> 04:30.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last month when he testified
before a Senate
hearing and, in essence, he
talked about how

04:30.770 --> 04:34.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he had handled the Clinton
e-mail matter.

04:34.140 --> 04:39.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And there had been
questions all
along in this process about
whether or not

04:39.712 --> 04:42.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Comey still had the support of
the president.

04:42.382 --> 04:44.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

04:44.284 --> 04:48.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And the question was
asked again
today, and Sean Spicer didn't
give the support.

04:48.488 --> 04:55.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, there is one interesting
line in the
president's letter to Comey
firing him.

04:55.561 --> 05:01.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said: "While I greatly
appreciate you informing
me on three separate
investigations that I

05:01.200 --> 05:06.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
am not under investigation, I
nevertheless
concur with the judgment of the
Department

05:06.606 --> 05:10.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Justice that you are not able
to effectively
lead the bureau."

05:10.276 --> 05:13.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, John
Yang, I want
you to stay with us.

05:13.413 --> 05:19.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the phone joining us now is
someone who
was a huge figure in the
Watergate investigation

05:19.052 --> 05:26.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back in the early 1970s, which,
of course,
led to the resignation of
then-President Richard

05:26.092 --> 05:27.060 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Nixon.

05:27.093 --> 05:28.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're joined on the phone by
John Dean.

05:28.795 --> 05:32.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was the White House counsel
then for President
Nixon.

05:32.465 --> 05:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Dean, you're listening to
this.

05:34.267 --> 05:35.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you make of it?

05:35.802 --> 05:38.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DEAN, Former White House
Counsel: Well,
it's not totally surprising.

05:38.905 --> 05:43.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was actually brooding about it
at lunch
and wondering how Comey was
going to deal

05:43.343 --> 05:46.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with the screw-up on his
testimony.

05:46.512 --> 05:53.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I thought, for the sake of
the bureau,
he might step down, because he's
really splashed

05:53.553 --> 05:55.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mud all over themselves with
this one.

05:55.855 --> 05:58.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why did you think
this might
be so serious?

05:58.925 --> 06:05.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What was it about the mistake
which he made
in that testimony last month
that had you

06:05.198 --> 06:07.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
questioning?

06:07.066 --> 06:13.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DEAN: Well, his rationale
for how he
handled the Clinton
investigation vs. vis-a-vis

06:13.106 --> 06:19.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Trump investigation, where
he disclosed
one publicly and didn't disclose
the other,

06:19.379 --> 06:26.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is -- the rationale has been so
thin, and
the differences are really so
inconsequential,

06:26.853 --> 06:31.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that it made most -- really no
sense to what
he was saying.

06:31.090 --> 06:37.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, now when he gets up and
bolsters his case
with bogus evidence, he looks
really bad.

06:37.430 --> 06:43.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he doesn't look like a
director with an
even hand should look.

06:43.102 --> 06:50.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I don't know what Sessions
-- I didn't
hear anything about what
Sessions' position

06:50.543 --> 06:52.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was, but I thought he was in
trouble.

06:52.845 --> 06:56.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, that was just in the air
to me.

06:56.082 --> 07:00.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I was going to
read just briefly
from a portion of the letter
that was just

07:00.920 --> 07:04.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issued by the White House, by
the attorney
general, Jeff Sessions.

07:04.257 --> 07:08.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says: "I have concluded a
fresh start is
needed at the leadership of the
FBI.

07:08.327 --> 07:13.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's essential this Department
of Justice
clearly reaffirm its commitment
to longstanding

07:13.332 --> 07:19.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
principles that ensure the
integrity and fairness
of federal investigations and
prosecutions."

07:19.172 --> 07:27.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're clearly trying to
connect their concern
about James Comey with the way
the Justice

07:27.046 --> 07:30.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Department operates and the
confidence the
American people and, of course,
the president

07:30.550 --> 07:32.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have to have in that.

07:32.351 --> 07:34.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN DEAN: Absolutely true.

07:34.854 --> 07:36.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, it's going to be very
difficult.

07:36.823 --> 07:42.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not unlike post-Watergate,
when they
had a very difficult time
deciding who to

07:42.795 --> 07:48.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
select, and we had a series of
federal judges
who were put in there who were
absolutely

07:48.534 --> 07:50.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
beyond any kind of question.

07:50.970 --> 07:56.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bill Webster was put in that
post, if you
recall, a former sitting federal
district

07:56.476 --> 08:03.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
court judge who had been a U.S.
attorney in
Saint Louis, and followed by
William Sessions,

08:03.316 --> 08:04.517 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who got fired.

08:04.550 --> 08:05.518 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

08:05.551 --> 08:07.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Exactly.

08:07.353 --> 08:10.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, John Dean -- we're on the
phone with
John Dean, who, of course, was
the White House

08:10.089 --> 08:13.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
counsel to Richard Nixon.

08:13.793 --> 08:17.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are going to be a number
of comparisons
drawn out of this, one of them,
of course,

08:17.763 --> 08:25.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Saturday night -- so-called
Saturday night
massacre, when President Nixon
fired his attorney

08:25.771 --> 08:30.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
general and others because they
wouldn't carry
out his wishes in the time of
Watergate.

08:30.309 --> 08:33.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Any connection with that, or is
this a completely
different set of circumstances?

08:33.379 --> 08:35.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN DEAN: I think this is
different, Judy.

08:35.982 --> 08:39.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it doesn't have any of
that kind of
feel.

08:39.652 --> 08:46.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Archibald Cox was defying the
president and
taking his own course of action
and taking

08:46.259 --> 08:50.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a -- making a decision that was
very much
placing Nixon in jeopardy.

08:50.329 --> 08:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I don't think we have any
similarities
here.

08:53.933 --> 08:59.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just refresh
our memory
on the role of the FBI director.

08:59.438 --> 09:03.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is intended to be an
independent position,
is it not?

09:03.509 --> 09:09.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm asking to remind everyone
that the FBI
is conducting a critical
investigation right

09:09.248 --> 09:16.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now into any connections between
the Trump
campaign for president and
Russian officials.

09:16.188 --> 09:23.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN DEAN: Well, it was
post-Watergate that
they -- indeed, after Hoover,
that the Congress

09:23.296 --> 09:29.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made this a 10-year appointment,
to give it
some independence, where it
could go over

09:29.235 --> 09:32.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from one president to the next.

09:32.338 --> 09:38.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The presidents do have the
ability, if they
don't have confidence in the
director, to

09:38.244 --> 09:42.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fire him, but we have not seen
that very often.

09:42.848 --> 09:45.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It has been the exception to the
rule.

09:45.751 --> 09:51.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have tried to depoliticize
the bureau,
which is the way it should be,
where we have

09:51.891 --> 10:00.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a politics-free federal
investigation unit,
but he is subject to the --
reports to the

10:00.333 --> 10:04.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attorney general, who, of
course, is a political
appointee.

10:04.036 --> 10:07.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, there is always that filter.

10:07.373 --> 10:12.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But yet just the weight of the
bureau itself
carries its own independence.

10:12.945 --> 10:17.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And when it has strong
leadership, it is highly
respected.

10:17.116 --> 10:22.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When that leadership has not
been so strong,
it has been suspect.

10:22.822 --> 10:24.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we -- you're absolutely
right.

10:24.657 --> 10:30.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It couldn't come at a more
difficult time,
given the implications of the
Russian hacking

10:30.896 --> 10:32.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and how that's going to all
unravel.

10:32.932 --> 10:38.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly,
to wrap up,
John Dean, your sense of what
has happened

10:38.838 --> 10:45.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here, you were saying at the
outset, didn't
surprise you that much, given
the mistake,

10:45.611 --> 10:50.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mistake in testimony that it
turns out James
Comey gave to the Congress last
month.

10:50.483 --> 10:57.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DEAN: Well, that certainly
gave both
-- because of the delay in
correcting it,

10:57.590 --> 11:02.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you immediately knew there was a
problem,
because Republicans had leaped
on it, they

11:02.094 --> 11:06.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were using it for political
purposes on bogus
information, so it was going the
embarrass

11:06.832 --> 11:08.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them by undercutting them.

11:08.701 --> 11:13.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So I just knew there was
trouble, and I didn't
know how far it would go, and I
thought Comey

11:13.406 --> 11:16.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
himself might step away from it,
rather than
let anyone else resolve it.

11:16.609 --> 11:21.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just to
refresh anyone
in the audience, what we're
speaking about

11:21.180 --> 11:27.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is when Director Comey spoke
before a Senate
committee last month and talked
about how

11:27.153 --> 11:34.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
e-mails were transmitted from
Hillary Clinton's
e-mail -- I mean, from her
server to the e-mail

11:34.293 --> 11:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
account of her assistant, Huma
Abedin, and
then they were printed out on --
by her husband,

11:41.267 --> 11:43.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the former Congressman Anthony
Weiner.

11:43.402 --> 11:44.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Dean, thank you very much.

11:44.570 --> 11:46.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN DEAN: Thank you, Judy.

11:46.372 --> 11:50.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And here with me
at the table
at our studio in Washington,
John Yang, our

11:50.609 --> 11:52.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
White House correspondent.

11:52.344 --> 11:55.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John, just to refresh everybody
who may be
tuning in, the breaking news
just moments

11:55.581 --> 12:00.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ago, President Trump has
announced he's fired
the FBI director, James Comey.

12:00.352 --> 12:01.754 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You now have some -- a little
bit of new information.

12:01.787 --> 12:03.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That's right, Judy.

12:03.489 --> 12:08.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We now have the memo that Deputy
Attorney
General Rod Rosenstein wrote to
the attorney

12:08.427 --> 12:13.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
general recommending this
firing, and this
does indeed center on that press
conference

12:13.432 --> 12:20.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Comey held in July 2016
detailing -- in
which he detailed Hillary
Clinton's use of

12:20.806 --> 12:24.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a private server and her
handling of classified
e-mails.

12:24.110 --> 12:30.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in it, Rosenstein writes:
"The director
was wrong to usurp the attorney
general's

12:30.916 --> 12:37.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
authority on July 5, 2016, and
announce his
conclusion that the case should
be closed

12:37.423 --> 12:39.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
without prosecution.

12:39.058 --> 12:43.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is not the function of the
director to
make such an announcement."

12:43.462 --> 12:48.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He goes on: "Compounding the
error, the director
ignored another longstanding
principle.

12:48.801 --> 12:53.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We do not hold press conferences
to release
derogatory information about the
subject of

12:53.939 --> 12:57.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a declined criminal
investigation.

12:57.543 --> 13:01.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Derogatory information sometimes
is disclosed
in the course of criminal
investigations and

13:01.647 --> 13:04.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prosecutions, but we never
release it gratuitously."

13:04.617 --> 13:10.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in conclusion, he writes,
"Although the
-- says: "I agree with the
nearly unanimous

13:10.489 --> 13:15.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opinions of former department
officials the
way the director handled the
conclusion of

13:15.628 --> 13:18.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the e-mail investigation was
wrong.

13:18.831 --> 13:24.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a result, the FBI is unlikely
to regain
public and congressional trust
until it has

13:24.503 --> 13:30.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a director who understands the
gravity of
the mistakes and pledges never
to repeat them."

13:30.209 --> 13:36.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, again, it's
going back
to the announcement by James
Comey last summer,

13:36.749 --> 13:41.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
blockbuster announcement, that
he made public
that the FBI had been looking
into the Clinton

13:41.687 --> 13:46.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
e-mail matter and had determined
that there
was -- that it was messy, that
it was sloppy,

13:46.959 --> 13:52.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what Hillary Clinton had done,
in keeping
these -- putting in her personal
e-mail server

13:52.198 --> 13:58.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government e-mails, but he
concluded that
the law had not been broken and
that they

13:58.137 --> 14:01.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were not going to be -- and that
there was
no criminal intent and they were
not going

14:01.674 --> 14:03.342 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to prosecute.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The irony, of course,
Judy, is
that that press conference gave
Donald Trump

14:05.678 --> 14:10.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the candidate so much grist for
his campaign
speeches, for his rallies.

14:10.983 --> 14:16.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It led to the chants of "Lock
her up," and
now this is the basis for him to
fire the

14:16.689 --> 14:17.656 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
FBI director.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And he was very
critical then.

14:19.391 --> 14:23.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, he himself was critical of
Director
Comey at that point, saying in
effect that

14:23.562 --> 14:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he was in the pocket of Hillary
Clinton, he
was doing what she wanted.

14:27.933 --> 14:30.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I remember we interviewed
Hillary Clinton
around that time.

14:30.903 --> 14:34.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She pointed out -- she and
others pointed
out James Comey had been known
as a Republican

14:35.007 --> 14:36.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
before he came into the
administration.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Exactly.

14:38.711 --> 14:42.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was the Democrats, it was
the Hillary
Clinton campaign that blamed,
has blamed and

14:42.648 --> 14:48.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
continues to blame James Comey
for Donald
Trump's victory and her defeat.

14:48.254 --> 14:52.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John, you have
been covering
this city for quite some time,
as I have.

14:52.925 --> 14:57.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you -- what can you
recall in the
past that equates to this
moment?

14:57.396 --> 15:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Yes, the only -- I
cannot recall
anything in the recent past.

15:01.100 --> 15:04.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The only thing that you
mentioned was the
Saturday night massacre during
Watergate.

15:04.336 --> 15:07.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And then we heard
John Dean
say it's a different situation.

15:07.439 --> 15:09.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Exactly, exactly,
exactly.

15:09.308 --> 15:12.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it's -- what
we heard from
John Dean, in talking to Richard
Nixon's legal

15:12.511 --> 15:16.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
counsel just now, is that he's
not so surprised.

15:16.982 --> 15:22.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said, when the FBI director
makes a significant
mistake like that and takes
weeks to clear

15:23.022 --> 15:25.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it up, to clarify, he said,
that's not good.

15:25.658 --> 15:28.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Although that's not
the reason
why he's being fired.

15:28.594 --> 15:29.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Exactly.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that was what got attention
earlier today.

15:31.297 --> 15:33.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Yes, exactly.

15:33.065 --> 15:36.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's what sparked the
question at the
briefing about whether the
president still

15:36.335 --> 15:41.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had confidence and trust in
Comey, a question
Spicer declined to answer.

15:42.007 --> 15:44.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, John Yang,
this is a shocker.

15:44.243 --> 15:48.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, unfair question: Any idea
who will be
named as a replacement?

15:48.447 --> 15:52.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: All we know is that
the president
said that the search has begun,
that they

15:52.084 --> 15:56.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are looking for someone who will
restore trust
and confidence in the FBI.

15:56.088 --> 15:57.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

15:57.990 --> 16:00.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Yang, I know you're going
to continue
to report on this, our White
House correspondent.

16:00.526 --> 16:01.560 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you, John.

16:01.593 --> 16:03.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Thank you.

16:03.362 --> 16:06.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, of course
we're going
to continue to update this story
throughout

16:06.131 --> 16:07.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the program.

16:07.933 --> 16:10.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, in the day's other news --
and there
was other news -- there's word
that the Trump

16:10.869 --> 16:17.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration is considering a
plan to return
to an expanded role for the U.S.
military

16:17.042 --> 16:19.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in fighting the Taliban in
Afghanistan.

16:19.712 --> 16:25.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Washington Post reported the
proposal
could send up to 3,000 more U.S.
troops to

16:25.084 --> 16:31.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the country, and give the
Pentagon, not the
White House, the power to set
troop levels.

16:31.090 --> 16:36.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump is expected to
make a decision
before a NATO summit on May the
25th.

16:36.628 --> 16:42.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trump administration is also
ramping up
efforts to battle the Islamic
State in Syria

16:42.401 --> 16:46.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by arming Kurdish fighters there
with heavier
weapons.

16:46.171 --> 16:50.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's all part of an operation to
recapture
the city of Raqqa from ISIS.

16:50.476 --> 16:55.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The decision was made despite
fierce opposition
from NATO ally Turkey, which
claims that the

16:55.948 --> 17:01.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kurdish forces are linked to
rebels who are
battling the Turkish government.

17:01.086 --> 17:06.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House officials today
defended a decision
not to immediately act on
warnings about former

17:06.592 --> 17:09.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
National Security Adviser
Michael Flynn.

17:09.395 --> 17:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former acting Attorney General
Sally Yates
had testified just yesterday
that she alerted

17:14.400 --> 17:19.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the White House in January that
Michael Flynn
could be blackmailed by the
Russians.

17:19.605 --> 17:23.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Press Secretary Sean Spicer
today said that
Yates' warning was minimized by
the White

17:23.909 --> 17:27.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House because she was, in his
words, a strong
supporter of Clinton.

17:27.212 --> 17:31.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
She had come here given a
heads-up, told us

17:31.784 --> 17:32.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
there were materials.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at the same time, we did
what we should
do.

17:34.920 --> 17:38.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just because someone comes in
and gives you
a heads-up about something and
says I want

17:38.624 --> 17:41.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to share some information
doesn't mean that
you immediately jump the gun and
go take an

17:41.827 --> 17:43.529 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
action.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think if you flip the scenario
and say,
what if we had just dismissed
somebody because

17:45.998 --> 17:49.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a political opponent of the
president had
made an utterance, you would
argue that it

17:49.935 --> 17:52.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was pretty irrational to act in
that manner.

17:52.504 --> 17:56.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In a related
development, CNN
is reporting that Republican
Senator Lindsey

17:56.809 --> 18:02.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Graham of South Carolina intends
to look into
President Trump's business
dealings in Russia.

18:02.948 --> 18:08.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Spicer responded by saying that
the president
has directed a law firm to send
Graham a certified

18:08.353 --> 18:12.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
letter stating that the
president has no connections.

18:12.291 --> 18:17.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South Korea has elected a
liberal president
for the first time in a decade;
64-year-old

18:17.596 --> 18:22.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Moon Jae-in comes to power after
months of
political turmoil in that
country that led

18:22.968 --> 18:27.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the impeachment of former
conservative
President Park Geun-hye.

18:27.406 --> 18:33.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With the highest turnout in 20
years, Moon
secured 41 percent of the vote,
leading his

18:33.112 --> 18:35.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nearest opponent by 17 points.

18:35.414 --> 18:40.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will take a closer look at
the impact of
the election later in the
program.

18:40.786 --> 18:44.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, the U.S.
Department
of Energy declared a state of
emergency after

18:44.623 --> 18:51.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a breach at a nuclear storage
facility some
200 miles southeast of Seattle,
Washington.

18:51.530 --> 18:57.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Workers at the Hanford Nuclear
Reservation
were evacuated or told to seek
cover after

18:57.436 --> 19:02.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the roof of a tunnel used to
transport nuclear
waste caved in.

19:03.008 --> 19:07.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The site's spokesperson updated
the situation
this afternoon on Facebook Live.

19:07.346 --> 19:12.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DESTRY HENDERSON, Hanford
Nuclear Reservation:
All personnel in the immediate
area have been

19:12.251 --> 19:13.619 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
accounted for.

19:13.652 --> 19:17.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are safe, and there's been
no evidence
of radiological release.

19:17.256 --> 19:21.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The effort to rid
the Hanford
site of radioactive material has
been ongoing

19:21.860 --> 19:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since it stopped producing
plutonium back
in the 1980s.

19:28.100 --> 19:34.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Violence erupted at a Florida
airport overnight
after Spirit Airlines canceled
nine flights,

19:34.540 --> 19:36.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
stranding hundreds of travelers.

19:36.642 --> 19:41.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Enraged passengers swarmed the
ticket counters
at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood
International

19:41.914 --> 19:45.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
airport when they were told
there were no
available pilots.

19:45.817 --> 19:47.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Three people were arrested.

19:47.753 --> 19:54.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Spirit Airlines blamed the
cancellations on
an ongoing dispute over the
pilots' contracts.

19:54.426 --> 19:59.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump has set his
sights on reelection,
rolling out a revamped campaign
Web site today

19:59.665 --> 20:02.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
touting his achievements thus
far.

20:02.601 --> 20:07.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It promises -- quote -- "the
truth that the
mainstream media is hiding"
about the president's

20:07.706 --> 20:09.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
first 100 days in office.

20:09.908 --> 20:15.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump filed legal papers for
reelection
the same day he took office.

20:15.080 --> 20:20.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nearly 250 migrants are missing
and feared
dead after two separate
shipwrecks in the

20:20.452 --> 20:22.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mediterranean over the weekend.

20:22.588 --> 20:27.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Survivors from one wreck told
United Nations
agencies that smugglers crammed
more than

20:27.326 --> 20:31.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
130 people onto a rubber boat
designed for
20 people.

20:31.897 --> 20:37.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, a U.N. spokeswoman gave a
grim assessment
of the number of migrants who've
disappeared

20:37.502 --> 20:39.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trying to make the perilous
journey.

20:39.605 --> 20:44.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /CECILE POUILLY, UNHCR:

Africa to
Italy since the beginning of the
year has

20:48.947 --> 20:59.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now reached more than 1,300
people, and a
total of over 43,000 people
trying to cross

21:00.025 --> 21:05.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Central Mediterranean to
reach Italy since
the beginning of the year.

21:05.097 --> 21:09.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Officials fear
the surge in
migration will continue to rise
as the weather

21:09.268 --> 21:11.036 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
becomes warmer.

21:11.069 --> 21:16.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A new study has found that your
Americans'
lifespan can vary by as much as
20 years based

21:16.475 --> 21:18.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on where they live.

21:18.310 --> 21:22.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's according to the
Institute for Health
Metrics and Evaluation at the
University of

21:22.514 --> 21:24.216 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Washington.

21:24.249 --> 21:29.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. counties with the highest
life expectancy,
in Colorado and California, also
had high

21:29.655 --> 21:31.790 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
incomes and education levels.

21:31.823 --> 21:37.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Communities with the lowest life
expectancy,
in the Dakotas, along the
Mississippi valley,

21:37.296 --> 21:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and in Appalachia, were poorer
and less educated.

21:41.667 --> 21:43.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And stocks were mixed on Wall
Street today.

21:43.869 --> 21:49.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 36 points
to close above 20975.

21:49.741 --> 21:59.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose nearly 18
points, and the
S&amp;P 500 slipped two.

21:59.785 --> 22:06.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose nearly 18
points, and the
S&amp;P 500 slipped two.

22:06.658 --> 22:11.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we now get reaction from
Capitol Hill
to President Trump's firing of
FBI Director

22:11.496 --> 22:12.731 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
James Comey.

22:12.764 --> 22:15.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm joined by Republican Susan
Collins of
Maine.

22:15.300 --> 22:17.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She serves on the Select
Committee on Intelligence.

22:17.969 --> 22:22.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator, we had invited you on
to talk about
health care, and maybe we will
get to that,

22:22.140 --> 22:27.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but I have to ask you about the
shocking news
just moments ago that the
president had fired

22:27.145 --> 22:28.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the FBI director.

22:28.146 --> 22:29.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you know about this?

22:29.481 --> 22:31.249 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

22:31.283 --> 22:34.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN COLLINS (R), Maine: Well,
Judy, like
every other American, I'm just
learning about

22:34.519 --> 22:36.488 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this news.

22:36.521 --> 22:45.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wonder in some ways if it were
the inevitable
conclusion to decisions that
were well-intentioned

22:45.464 --> 22:53.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by Mr. Comey that he made last
July in which
he held a press conference to
announce his

22:53.538 --> 23:01.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decision not to pursue an
indictment against
Hillary Clinton and went on to
give his personal

23:01.146 --> 23:03.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
opinion in the case.

23:03.615 --> 23:11.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He did so in a manner that was
contrary to
the policies of the deep
Department of Justice,

23:11.790 --> 23:17.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
although I have no doubt that
his intentions
were good.

23:17.162 --> 23:25.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This seemed to snowball in a way
that led
to the additional events last
fall, and embroiled

23:25.670 --> 23:31.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him in a political controversy
that had continued
to this day.

23:31.109 --> 23:36.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He said at the
time, Senator,
that he felt he had to do that
because of

23:36.648 --> 23:44.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the huge importance of the
national presidential
election that was taking place,
and he owed

23:44.589 --> 23:45.824 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it to the American people.

23:45.857 --> 23:47.559 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

23:47.592 --> 23:53.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN COLLINS: He did say that,
and I have
no doubt at all, knowing the FBI
director,

23:53.899 --> 23:58.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he was sincere in his
conclusion and
in saying that.

23:58.670 --> 24:06.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the fact is that the
Department of Justice
has very specific policies that
requires the

24:06.411 --> 24:16.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FBI to go to his superiors at
the Department
of Justice and get their
decision, and it

24:16.822 --> 24:19.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
really wasn't his call.

24:19.257 --> 24:29.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in that area, it does
appear that his
actions were contrary to the
general rules

24:29.100 --> 24:36.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
followed by the Department of
Justice, particularly
in dealing with very sensitive
criminal cases.

24:36.241 --> 24:40.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, do you think
this was the
right decision by President
Trump?

24:40.545 --> 24:42.047 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

24:42.080 --> 24:46.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN COLLINS: Well, it's hard
to say, because
I'm still learning about it.

24:46.885 --> 24:54.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do think that perhaps it
was inevitable,
given the fact that Mr. Comey
has been unable

24:54.326 --> 25:02.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to put this controversy to rest,
and it was
contrary to the rules of the
Department of

25:02.901 --> 25:04.703 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Justice.

25:04.736 --> 25:13.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do hope that the next FBI
director will
have the same kinds of
integrity, intelligence,

25:13.845 --> 25:24.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and determination that Mr. Comey
exhibited,
but perhaps better judgment on
when it's appropriate

25:24.756 --> 25:27.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to go public with the results of
an investigation.

25:27.926 --> 25:35.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does this give
you confidence
in the Justice Department at
this moment,

25:35.567 --> 25:42.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the administration at a time
when we know
this investigation is under way
into connections

25:42.207 --> 25:46.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between the Trump presidential
campaign and
Russian officials?

25:46.311 --> 25:47.546 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

25:47.579 --> 25:50.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SUSAN COLLINS: Well, the
president didn't
fire the entire FBI.

25:50.482 --> 25:54.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He fired the director of the
FBI.

25:54.553 --> 26:02.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have every confidence that
the FBI will
continue pursuing its
investigation into the

26:02.427 --> 26:07.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian attempt to influence the
elections
last fall.

26:07.332 --> 26:15.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In addition, the Senate
Intelligence Committee
on which I serve is continuing
its bipartisan

26:15.073 --> 26:16.474 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investigation.

26:16.508 --> 26:18.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you're saying
you feel
that's all going to go forward?

26:18.677 --> 26:19.644 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

26:19.678 --> 26:21.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN COLLINS: I do.

26:21.146 --> 26:21.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You have
confidence that all
goes forward as it should?

26:21.980 --> 26:22.948 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

26:22.981 --> 26:23.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN COLLINS: Yes.

26:23.982 --> 26:25.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It should go forward, and it
will go forward.

26:25.750 --> 26:28.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
Senator Collins,
I do have a few minutes left.

26:28.720 --> 26:32.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I want to ask you about the
health care
bill, because that is front and
center.

26:32.791 --> 26:35.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's another issue very much
before the country.

26:36.027 --> 26:41.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All the reporting I have seen
says that Republicans
in the Senate at this point
wouldn't support

26:41.600 --> 26:47.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the health care reform bill that
came out
of the Republican majority in
the House of

26:47.238 --> 26:48.206 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Representatives.

26:48.239 --> 26:51.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you agree with that, and, if
so, why not?

26:51.743 --> 26:53.378 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

26:53.411 --> 26:56.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN COLLINS: First of all, I
think that
it is evident that the Senate is
going to

26:56.915 --> 26:59.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
draft its own bill.

26:59.451 --> 27:06.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have a bill that Senator Bill
Cassidy of
Louisiana, who is a physician,
and I introduced

27:06.124 --> 27:08.326 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
back in January.

27:08.360 --> 27:14.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we think we have come up
with a better
model than what the House passed
just this

27:14.265 --> 27:15.967 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last week.

27:16.001 --> 27:19.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are a lot of questions and
concerns
about the House bill.

27:20.005 --> 27:26.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is difficult to evaluate it
because the
House voted prior to having a
Congressional

27:26.711 --> 27:33.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Budget Office analysis about the
impact of
the bill on coverage and on
cost, both to

27:33.752 --> 27:38.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the federal government and to
families and
individuals.

27:38.256 --> 27:40.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, that is the major problem.

27:41.026 --> 27:47.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we know, the earlier House
bill would have
resulted in 14 million people
losing their

27:47.198 --> 27:51.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
coverage next year, 24 million
over 10 years.

27:51.536 --> 27:54.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is an issue that concerns
me gravely.

27:54.472 --> 28:01.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm also concerned about the
substantial changes
that the House is proposing in
the Medicaid

28:01.279 --> 28:08.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
program and whether that would
end up shifting
a lot of cost to state
government, to hospitals,

28:08.286 --> 28:13.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to nursing homes, and to those
of us who are
insured.

28:13.058 --> 28:20.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is another real flaw
in the House
bill, and that is that the tax
credits that

28:20.999 --> 28:28.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are proposed are not adjusted to
reflect the
income of the individual who
qualifies for

28:28.973 --> 28:30.742 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the credit.

28:30.775 --> 28:36.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it seems to me those tax
credits should
be weighted toward low-income
families and

28:36.681 --> 28:38.383 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
individuals.

28:38.416 --> 28:42.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, as you know,
the House
leadership is very much behind
that bill,

28:42.520 --> 28:49.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for all the issues you point
out, but, Senator,
this is a complex piece of
legislation that

28:49.461 --> 28:51.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you and Senator Cassidy are
proposing.

28:51.529 --> 28:54.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But tell us in a nutshell, how
would it be
different?

28:54.365 --> 28:56.067 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

28:56.101 --> 28:59.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN COLLINS: It would be very
different
from the House bill, because our
goal is to

28:59.204 --> 29:05.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually expand coverage, rather
than reduce
the number of people covered.

29:05.877 --> 29:10.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what we would do is give
more options
to the states.

29:10.081 --> 29:14.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of those options would
be that if
a state finds that the
Affordable Care Act

29:15.019 --> 29:19.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is working well for that state,
they could
keep that model.

29:19.557 --> 29:25.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For many states, it is not
working well, and
the individual market is on the
verge of collapse

29:25.864 --> 29:32.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and premiums have gone sky-high
and deductibles
are too burdensome for
low-income people.

29:32.804 --> 29:40.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a second plan that is
available in
our bill, which we call the
Better Choice,

29:40.578 --> 29:47.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which would set up health
savings accounts
for individuals that would be
federally funded

29:47.719 --> 29:52.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for low- and middle-income
families and individuals.

29:52.557 --> 29:59.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they would be paired with a
high-deductible
plan, plus basic pharmaceutical
coverage.

29:59.998 --> 30:06.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those health savings accounts
could be used
to buy more generous insurance
plans or to

30:06.271 --> 30:11.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pay first-dollar expenses, such
as your co-pays
or deductibles.

30:11.476 --> 30:17.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's important to note that,
regardless
of what choice a state makes,
that we would

30:17.115 --> 30:24.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
keep all of the consumer
protections that
are in the Affordable Care Act,
such as protecting

30:24.455 --> 30:31.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
people with preexisting
conditions, allowing
young people to stay on their
parents' policies

30:31.396 --> 30:39.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
until age 26, no lifetime or
annual caps from
coverage, and also no
discrimination based

30:40.004 --> 30:43.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on gender or race or national
origin.

30:43.308 --> 30:47.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just quickly,
Senator, I'm
sure you know that, at this
point, you and

30:47.579 --> 30:51.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Cassidy are pretty much
alone in supporting
this.

30:51.349 --> 30:54.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There haven't been many others
to sign on
to this.

30:54.385 --> 31:00.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What makes you confident you can
win support
for this proposal, when it does
preserve a

31:00.558 --> 31:04.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pretty significant chunk of
Obamacare, if
that's what states want to do?

31:04.295 --> 31:05.663 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

31:05.697 --> 31:09.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN COLLINS: Well, we do have
three great
Republican co-sponsors.

31:09.100 --> 31:15.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm pleased about that, so
there are five
Republicans on the bill.

31:15.306 --> 31:20.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But our goal is to have a
bipartisan bill.

31:20.111 --> 31:25.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One of the problems with
Obamacare is that
it was totally a partisan
effort.

31:25.650 --> 31:31.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that was one reason that
there weren't
more Republican ideas
incorporated into the

31:31.489 --> 31:34.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bill, and we're seeing the
results of that
now.

31:34.926 --> 31:43.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want a more market-oriented
reform, but
we also recognize that there are
some good

31:43.234 --> 31:46.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
provisions in the Affordable
Care Act that
should be retained.

31:46.638 --> 31:47.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

31:47.639 --> 31:49.507 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

31:49.540 --> 31:52.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN COLLINS: And that is why I
think, in
the end, we will be able to
attract some moderate

31:52.477 --> 31:54.212 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Democrats to our approach.

31:54.245 --> 31:57.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have had those discussions
that are
starting now.

31:57.482 --> 32:02.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Susan
Collins of Maine,
we thank you very much for
talking both about

32:02.720 --> 32:05.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the FBI and about this
complicated health
care issue.

32:05.823 --> 32:06.791 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

32:06.824 --> 32:07.792 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

32:07.825 --> 32:08.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSAN COLLINS: Thank you, Judy.

32:09.027 --> 32:11.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now we get a
Democratic
perspective.

32:11.362 --> 32:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're joined on the telephone by
Congressman
Eric Swalwell of California.

32:15.934 --> 32:19.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He serves on the House
Intelligence Committee.

32:19.203 --> 32:24.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congressman Swalwell, your
reaction to the
news that President Trump has
fired the director

32:24.108 --> 32:25.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the FBI, James Comey?

32:25.209 --> 32:26.177 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

32:26.210 --> 32:27.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ERIC SWALWELL (D), California:
Good evening.

32:27.211 --> 32:28.880 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Judy.

32:28.913 --> 32:32.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is an abuse of power unlike
anything
we have seen in our country
since President

32:32.250 --> 32:33.217 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Nixon.

32:33.251 --> 32:35.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I worry right now for our
democracy.

32:35.119 --> 32:41.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I hope that Republicans join
me in making
sure that this investigation
into the president

32:41.592 --> 32:45.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't go away, as it seems
like he wishes
it would.

32:45.396 --> 32:49.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, let me just
cite you a
little of what I just heard from
Senator Susan

32:49.600 --> 32:55.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Collins, who has been outspoken
at times in
her disagreement with President
Trump on different

32:55.139 --> 32:56.908 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issues.

32:56.941 --> 33:01.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in this instance, she said
in so many
words that she believes the FBI
director left

33:01.045 --> 33:09.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
himself open when he violated
protocol, in
essence, violated the pattern of
behavior,

33:10.021 --> 33:16.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
practice at the FBI, and went
public last
summer with the investigation
that the FBI

33:16.260 --> 33:23.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had conducted into Hillary
Clinton's e-mail
server, in saying that the FBI
wouldn't prosecute,

33:23.134 --> 33:26.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and yes, he had found that they
conducted
the investigation poorly, but
there would

33:26.871 --> 33:27.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be no prosecution.

33:27.905 --> 33:29.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And he talked about the
investigation.

33:29.774 --> 33:31.542 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

33:31.576 --> 33:36.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC SWALWELL: Judy, it's so
interesting to
hear Republicans defend Hillary
Clinton now.

33:36.280 --> 33:42.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's -- a reason that may
have been
believable when Donald Trump
took office on

33:42.587 --> 33:44.355 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
January 20.

33:44.389 --> 33:48.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But since Donald Trump took
office, the FBI
director has told Congress and
the American

33:48.226 --> 33:52.663 align:left position:0%,start line:66.67% size:100%
people that the president's
campaign is under
a criminal and
counterintelligence
investigation.

33:52.697 --> 33:58.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is nothing more than
taking the headrest
off the court, and people should
see it exactly

33:58.669 --> 34:00.405 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as that.

34:00.438 --> 34:06.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But the president
does have
the right, the authority to
remove the FBI

34:06.944 --> 34:07.912 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
director.

34:07.945 --> 34:08.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that not right?

34:08.946 --> 34:09.914 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

34:09.947 --> 34:11.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ERIC SWALWELL: He does.

34:11.816 --> 34:17.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Senate, of course, will
be, you know,
a part of a future FBI
director's confirmation.

34:17.221 --> 34:23.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, past presidents have
shown restraint
in removing FBI directors when
their administrations

34:23.528 --> 34:25.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
were under investigation.

34:25.296 --> 34:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the fact that this president
could not
demonstrate that, I think, says
a lot about

34:29.033 --> 34:32.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how fearful he is about where
this FBI director
was going.

34:32.370 --> 34:37.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, again, to
the point that
both the attorney general, Jeff
Sessions,

34:37.141 --> 34:43.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made in the letter he put out
and this -- and,
again, I was just quoting,
poorly quoting

34:43.047 --> 34:50.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Susan Collins -- their
point is that
what the FBI director did
violated longstanding

34:50.888 --> 34:57.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
principles and, therefore, he
left himself
open for this sort of judgment.

34:57.695 --> 34:59.564 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

34:59.597 --> 35:03.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC SWALWELL: And, again, Judy,
that is something
that we didn't hear from any
Republican when

35:03.468 --> 35:07.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the FBI director made those
statements or
sent that letter.

35:07.105 --> 35:10.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, for that to be the reason
now, again,
it is too late.

35:10.141 --> 35:16.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The FBI director is in the
middle of an investigation
into the president's campaign,
and to pull

35:16.747 --> 35:21.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him off this investigation is
very, very disturbing
for our democracy.

35:21.352 --> 35:25.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally,
Congressman -- we're
talking with Congressman Eric
Swalwell of

35:26.023 --> 35:29.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
California, a Democrat of
California -- what
do you expect will happen next?

35:29.994 --> 35:34.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Have you have had a chance to
talk to other
members of Congress about what
the next steps

35:34.565 --> 35:35.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are here?

35:35.566 --> 35:36.534 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

35:36.567 --> 35:38.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ERIC SWALWELL: No.

35:38.402 --> 35:42.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, right now, Judy, we're
piecing all of
this together to see what we can
do to preserve

35:42.707 --> 35:47.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the integrity of the FBI's
investigation and
also make sure that our own
House investigation

35:48.012 --> 35:51.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
is one that is still
independent, credible,
and makes progress.

35:51.449 --> 35:55.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and that --
and I do
want to ask you about that just
quickly, because

35:55.052 --> 35:59.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I asked Susan -- Senator Collins
about whether
she had confidence that the
Justice Department,

35:59.190 --> 36:04.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the FBI could continue to carry
out the investigation
into possible connections
between the Trump

36:04.662 --> 36:06.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
campaign and Russian officials.

36:06.597 --> 36:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She said she does have that
confidence.

36:08.766 --> 36:09.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What would you answer be?

36:09.901 --> 36:11.769 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

36:11.802 --> 36:16.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC SWALWELL: Well, right now,
the attorney
general is recused on any
Russian investigation.

36:16.908 --> 36:22.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now we are without an FBI
director, so I am
very, very worried that the
president's desire

36:22.713 --> 36:27.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to see this investigation, which
he called
a hoax just yesterday on
Twitter, is, He's

36:27.485 --> 36:29.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to try and bury it.

36:29.487 --> 36:34.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we must do everything we can
to keep light
shining on what happened with
Russia's interference

36:34.559 --> 36:38.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and make sure any U.S. persons
who were involved
are held accountable.

36:38.396 --> 36:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Representative
Eric Swalwell
of California, member of the
House Intelligence

36:43.134 --> 36:47.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Committee, Congressman, thank
you very much
for talking with us.

36:47.505 --> 36:49.207 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

36:49.240 --> 36:56.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ERIC SWALWELL: My pleasure.

36:56.280 --> 37:02.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now we turn
our focus to
Asia.

37:02.086 --> 37:06.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After months of political
upheaval, South
Korean voters have elected a new
president

37:06.757 --> 37:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today, a man who is promising to
take the
nation in a new direction.

37:15.266 --> 37:19.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President-elect Moon Jae-in
addressed throngs
of cheering supporters, and
offered a message

37:19.937 --> 37:22.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of unity to all South Koreans.

37:22.306 --> 37:26.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOON JAE-IN, South Korean
President-Elect
(through translator): Starting
tomorrow, I

37:26.911 --> 37:30.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will become everyone's
president.

37:30.781 --> 37:35.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will become a president who
unifies people
and serves even those people who
didn't support

37:35.253 --> 37:37.021 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me.

37:37.054 --> 37:40.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Moon will assume
control of
the deeply divided government
after the fall

37:40.658 --> 37:43.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of his predecessor, Park
Geun-hye.

37:44.028 --> 37:50.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Park, South Korea's first female
president,
was impeached last year and
later arrested

37:50.201 --> 37:52.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on corruption charges.

37:52.069 --> 37:56.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She sits in jail now, and could
face up to
life in prison.

37:56.274 --> 38:01.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The allegations against her
sparked massive
months-long protests and were a
major factor

38:01.646 --> 38:04.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for voters ahead of the polls
today.

38:04.282 --> 38:08.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): Park
Geun-hye
abused her national authority,
which angered

38:08.786 --> 38:10.421 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the people.

38:10.454 --> 38:13.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I voted with the hope of not
electing the
same kind of president again in
future.

38:13.691 --> 38:20.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Moon now faces
several challenges,
both at home and abroad,
including an increasingly

38:20.865 --> 38:22.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
provocative North Korea.

38:22.900 --> 38:29.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During the campaign, he called
for a return
to engagement with Pyongyang,
including economic

38:29.106 --> 38:34.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
incentives that would be a
significant break
from recent South Korean policy.

38:34.912 --> 38:40.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Moon also said he will
reevaluate the U.S.
military's deployment of the
so-called THAAD

38:40.718 --> 38:45.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
missile defense system to the
peninsula, which
has angered China.

38:45.256 --> 38:49.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of this could lead to
friction with the
Trump White House.

38:49.493 --> 38:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump has had tough
words, at times,
for the North, threatening
unilateral military

38:55.366 --> 38:57.101 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
action.

38:57.134 --> 39:01.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he's also said he would be
honored to
meet North Korean leader Kim
Jong-un under

39:01.639 --> 39:03.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the right circumstances.

39:03.808 --> 39:07.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in an interview with CBS'
"Face the Nation,"
he said of Kim:

39:07.611 --> 39:09.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
He was able to assume power.

39:09.480 --> 39:13.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of people, I'm sure, tried
to take that
power away, whether it was his
uncle or anybody

39:13.951 --> 39:15.353 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
else.

39:15.386 --> 39:17.288 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he was able to do it.

39:17.321 --> 39:19.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, obviously, he's a pretty
smart cookie.

39:19.857 --> 39:24.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For his part Moon
told The
Washington Post last week he's
on the same

39:24.495 --> 39:29.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
page as Mr. Trump and believes
he is -- quote
-- "more reasonable" than he is
generally

39:29.600 --> 39:31.369 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
perceived.

39:31.402 --> 39:35.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the White House offered
congratulations
and said the U.S. looks forward
to working

39:35.539 --> 39:37.708 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Moon.

39:37.742 --> 39:42.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We take a deeper look at Moon's
election and
its implications for South
Korea, and for

39:42.680 --> 39:45.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S. policy in the region, with
David Kang.

39:45.583 --> 39:51.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is the director of the Korean
Studies Institute
at the University of Southern
California.

39:51.288 --> 39:53.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Professor Kang, thank you very
much for joining
us.

39:53.924 --> 39:57.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Give us a thumbnail sketch, if
you will, of
Mr. Moon.

39:57.762 --> 39:59.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What about his background?

39:59.630 --> 40:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID KANG, University of
Southern California:
Well, I think the overriding
thing about Mr.

40:02.566 --> 40:07.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Moon is that he has worked for
sort of left
or progressive policies ever
since he was

40:07.438 --> 40:13.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a student and was arrested in
the 1970s in
pro-democracy movement, a human
rights lawyer,

40:13.944 --> 40:20.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and worked as a chief of staff
for a noted
progressive president 10 years
ago, Roh Moo-hyun.

40:20.251 --> 40:25.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he's very clearly on the
progressive or
leftist side of Korean politics.

40:25.122 --> 40:29.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, coming, what,
after almost
a decade of conservative rule in
South Korea,

40:29.860 --> 40:31.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
why do you think voters chose
him?

40:31.695 --> 40:37.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID KANG: Well, it's important
to remember
that there is domestic politics
in any country,

40:37.668 --> 40:39.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the pendulum swings left and
right.

40:39.570 --> 40:43.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were 10 years of left
presidents, and
then there were 10 years of
rightist presidents.

40:43.841 --> 40:49.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, in particular, there
has been a move
back to the left, which began
before Park

40:49.980 --> 40:51.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was getting impeached.

40:51.949 --> 40:57.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The electorate had elected a
majority national
assembly last year that was more
to the leftist

40:57.588 --> 40:59.390 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
side.

40:59.423 --> 41:04.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So there was a lot of
expectation that the
country had wanted to be -- a
little bit more

41:04.595 --> 41:09.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
engagement with North Korea and
was very concerned
about corruption and collusive
ties.

41:09.900 --> 41:14.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So in a way, it's not a surprise
that he won
the election, because the
electorate was swinging

41:14.605 --> 41:16.340 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
left.

41:16.373 --> 41:19.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, how much
friendlier do
you expect his approach to North
Korea will

41:19.510 --> 41:20.945 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
be?

41:20.978 --> 41:26.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID KANG: I think there
actually is a chance
for some major changes.

41:26.450 --> 41:31.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Engagement, which he broadly
supports, is
a viable strategy.

41:31.755 --> 41:38.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Moon actually has talked
about being very
forward-leaning, even opening a
joint economic

41:38.095 --> 41:41.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- reopening a joint economic
zone between
North and South Korea.

41:41.232 --> 41:46.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I suspect one of the first
things he will
do is send an envoy to North
Korea to find

41:46.937 --> 41:48.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out what is even possible.

41:48.706 --> 41:52.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think, in many ways, he's
going to be
much more proactive in dealing
with North

41:52.042 --> 41:56.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Korea than previous Korean
administrations
and the United States has been.

41:56.046 --> 42:00.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking of
the U.S.,
what is his attitude toward the
U.S., and

42:00.751 --> 42:04.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what do we know of his attitude
toward President
Trump?

42:04.188 --> 42:09.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID KANG: You know, in some
ways, it's a
misnomer that leftist Korean
presidents are

42:09.260 --> 42:11.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hard for the alliance.

42:11.495 --> 42:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Almost every Korean president,
left or right,
realizes that a good
relationship with Washington

42:16.433 --> 42:18.235 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is important.

42:18.269 --> 42:21.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, when he was chief of
staff, that was
when South Korea and the United
States signed

42:21.872 --> 42:23.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the free trade agreement, for
example.

42:23.974 --> 42:29.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I don't actually think there
will be that
much change in the U.S.
relationship.

42:29.713 --> 42:35.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's also said the right things
about Trump,
which is, he thinks he can work
with Trump.

42:35.085 --> 42:39.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that the particular
important
thing for Moon is to craft that
kind of personal

42:39.623 --> 42:41.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relationship with President
Trump.

42:41.592 --> 42:44.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the last six months, we have
had a power
vacuum in South Korea.

42:44.328 --> 42:48.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There has been no president, so
there has
been no way for South Korea to
craft a relationship

42:48.465 --> 42:49.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with the U.S.

42:49.466 --> 42:51.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it's very important that he
does that.

42:51.135 --> 42:52.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And two other
things.

42:52.903 --> 43:00.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What about his attitude, his
thinking about
China and its ability to, if you
will, get

43:00.077 --> 43:04.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the North Koreans to be more
cooperative?

43:04.381 --> 43:06.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID KANG: Sure.

43:06.250 --> 43:12.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think one thing that Moon will
do is, in
some ways, I think he will take
a more independent

43:12.156 --> 43:13.924 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stand.

43:13.958 --> 43:16.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think he wants the lean
toward China,
any more than he wants the lean
toward the

43:16.226 --> 43:17.695 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
United States.

43:17.728 --> 43:21.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He very clearly wants South
Korea to be the
driver of the relationship.

43:21.565 --> 43:27.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As such, I think he will push on
China for
cooperation, but, in many ways,
his approach,

43:27.972 --> 43:32.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which emphasizes economic
relations, fits
in with China's approach.

43:32.142 --> 43:35.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there may be more room to
cooperate than
we might think right now.

43:35.879 --> 43:37.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And one other
thing.

43:37.648 --> 43:41.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There has been some back and
forth between
the U.S. and South Korea
recently over this

43:41.251 --> 43:46.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
missile defense system called
THAAD, the acronym.

43:46.457 --> 43:47.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What has he said about that?

43:47.625 --> 43:49.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you expect to happen
there?

43:49.493 --> 43:54.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID KANG: You know, the U.S.
missile defense
system THAAD, I think in some
ways has gotten

43:54.798 --> 43:58.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
blown up over the last year as a
bigger issue
than it really is.

43:58.602 --> 44:03.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China doesn't like it, but for
the last -- it
was announced last summer, so
we're coming

44:03.641 --> 44:09.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up on an entire year that THAAD
has been in
deployment and is now fully
deployed.

44:09.146 --> 44:14.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But China and the United States
had been negotiating
with an empty chair in South
Korea because

44:14.084 --> 44:17.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the political power vacuum of
the previous
president.

44:17.054 --> 44:22.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So Moon has a lot on his plate,
but with the
proper diplomacy, I think he can
assuage some

44:22.526 --> 44:26.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of China's fears, while still
retaining the
missile defense system.

44:26.530 --> 44:30.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's his task as a president,
is to be able
to deal with both of these big
countries at

44:30.167 --> 44:31.935 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the same time.

44:31.969 --> 44:35.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Professor David
Kang at the
University of Southern
California, we thank

44:35.372 --> 44:36.674 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

44:36.707 --> 44:42.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID KANG: My pleasure.

44:42.079 --> 44:43.881 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cancer

44:43.914 --> 44:51.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: a promising
lung cancer
treatment from Cuba that's
drawing attention

44:51.522 --> 44:53.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from U.S. patients.

44:53.657 --> 44:57.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some Americans are already
traveling there
to try the drug, in the hopes of
stopping

44:58.028 --> 44:59.830 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their cancer from growing.

44:59.863 --> 45:04.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former President Obama cleared
the way for
collaboration between both
countries on such

45:04.735 --> 45:07.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
research, and clinical trials
have started.

45:07.304 --> 45:09.073 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Those trials may take years.

45:09.106 --> 45:14.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But early results have some
researchers intrigued
by this new form of
immunotherapy.

45:14.845 --> 45:18.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Amy
Guttman has the
story.

45:18.248 --> 45:23.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY GUTTMAN: Mick Phillips
travels from his
home near Green Bay, Wisconsin,
to Cuba once

45:23.587 --> 45:24.988 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a year.

45:25.022 --> 45:28.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Despite his passion for vintage
cars, that's
not what draws him.

45:28.992 --> 45:34.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He goes there for CimaVax, a
Cuban-made drug
used to treat cancer that's kept
him alive

45:34.164 --> 45:35.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
longer than any doctor
predicted.

45:35.999 --> 45:41.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICK PHILLIPS, Cancer Patient:
So, I have
this little lunch box here
that's insulated.

45:41.572 --> 45:49.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in there, I carry my
medication and I
also carry gel packs.

45:49.113 --> 45:53.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY GUTTMAN: Phillips is 69
years old and
owns an industrial pump factory,
where he

45:53.350 --> 45:55.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
continues to work every day.

45:55.385 --> 46:00.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was first diagnosed with
non-small cell
lung cancer seven years ago.

46:00.424 --> 46:05.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After chemotherapy and radiation
treatment,
his cancer went into remission.

46:05.062 --> 46:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it returned less than a year
later, in
2011.

46:08.799 --> 46:14.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He did another round of
chemotherapy, then
took CimaVax, and is now in
remission.

46:14.538 --> 46:20.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fewer than 5 percent of stage 4
lung cancer
patients like Phillips survive
for five years.

46:20.110 --> 46:24.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But CimaVax appears to be
improving those
odds for some.

46:24.047 --> 46:29.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICK PHILLIPS: I started the
CimaVax and have
been cancer-free ever since
then.

46:29.386 --> 46:33.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY GUTTMAN: And how long were
you supposed
to live once you went into
remission?

46:33.657 --> 46:36.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICK PHILLIPS: The prognosis was
maybe six
months to a year.

46:36.627 --> 46:38.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY GUTTMAN: How many years ago
was that?

46:38.128 --> 46:39.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICK PHILLIPS: That was six
years ago.

46:40.030 --> 46:45.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY GUTTMAN: At La Pradera, a
hotel-like hospital
near Havana, Phillips pays about
$5,000 for

46:45.702 --> 46:47.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an annual supply of CimaVax.

46:47.938 --> 46:51.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The doctor visit costs only $50.

46:51.241 --> 46:56.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in Wisconsin, Phillips says
he's lucky
that his oncologist, Dr. Timothy
Goggins,

46:56.814 --> 46:58.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
continues to treat him.

46:58.749 --> 47:02.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American doctors can't prescribe
CimaVax,
because the Food and Drug
Administration won't

47:02.820 --> 47:06.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
approve it until U.S. clinical
trials can
prove its effectiveness.

47:06.356 --> 47:07.424 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

47:07.457 --> 47:08.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIMOTHY GOGGINS, Oncologist: How
are things
going?

47:08.458 --> 47:09.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICK PHILLIPS: Oh, pretty good.

47:09.793 --> 47:13.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
AMY GUTTMAN: Dr. Goggins
monitors Phillips
with regular scans.

47:13.263 --> 47:14.932 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

47:14.965 --> 47:18.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIMOTHY GOGGINS: Compare this to
where he
is today, no evidence of growth
necessarily

47:18.068 --> 47:19.036 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in that area.

47:19.069 --> 47:20.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In fact, there might even be
shrinkage.

47:20.804 --> 47:24.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would have expected, in this
case, further
growth, definitely within the
lungs.

47:24.641 --> 47:26.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm surprised Mick's still here.

47:26.743 --> 47:32.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I do believe that, outside
of divine intervention,
there's some sort of scientific
basis to what

47:32.349 --> 47:34.117 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he's doing.

47:34.151 --> 47:37.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY GUTTMAN: Published results
of trials done
in Cuba show those given CimaVax
lived, on

47:37.387 --> 47:42.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average, as little as three
months and as
much as 11 months longer than
those not given

47:42.759 --> 47:44.094 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the drug.

47:44.127 --> 47:45.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Some did even better.

47:45.929 --> 47:50.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dr. Michael Caligiuri, president
of the American
Association for Cancer Research
says, even

47:50.868 --> 47:53.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the success in Cuba, there
must be further
study.

47:53.937 --> 47:55.873 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

47:55.906 --> 47:57.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL CALIGIURI, President,
American Association
for Cancer Research: Whenever
there's an early

47:57.708 --> 48:02.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
evidence of efficacy in a single
population,
a single institution study, the
chance that

48:02.045 --> 48:08.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
it will be replicated
inter-institutionally
is real, but not a given.

48:08.085 --> 48:12.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY GUTTMAN: This facility
outside Havana
produces CimaVax.

48:12.089 --> 48:13.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It doesn't kill cancer cells.

48:14.024 --> 48:19.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Instead, it engages the
patient's immune system
to reduce the protein cancer
thrives on.

48:20.030 --> 48:26.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What makes this different from
other immunotherapies
is, it uses a patient's own
antibodies, rather

48:26.169 --> 48:31.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than manufactured ones, which
carries fewer
side effects and is cheaper.

48:31.375 --> 48:35.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Researchers at Roswell Park
Cancer Institute
in Buffalo, New York, waited
four years to

48:35.846 --> 48:40.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get the green light for clinical
trials of
CimaVax that began in January.

48:40.884 --> 48:46.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The institute's chair of
immunology, Dr. Kelvin
Lee, was in Havana recently for
a conference.

48:46.189 --> 48:47.958 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

48:47.991 --> 48:50.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELVIN LEE, Roswell Park Cancer
Institute:
In many cases, the tumors just
stop growing.

48:50.494 --> 48:52.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're there, but they don't
get any bigger.

48:52.663 --> 48:57.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The patient has the possibility
of going on
for a very long time.

48:57.901 --> 49:02.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY GUTTMAN: CimaVax is given by
injection
and is considered a therapeutic
drug for now.

49:02.773 --> 49:08.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Dr. Lee and his colleagues
are applying
for funding to test it as a
preventive vaccine

49:08.211 --> 49:09.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for high-risk patients.

49:09.813 --> 49:11.715 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

49:11.748 --> 49:15.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELVIN LEE: Because it is safe,
inexpensive,
easy to administer, you could
use it, potentially,

49:15.352 --> 49:17.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to prevent lung cancer.

49:17.154 --> 49:21.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY GUTTMAN: The embargo that
prevented Cuba's
access to American
pharmaceuticals led the

49:21.258 --> 49:27.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
late President Fidel Castro to
invest heavily
in developing medicines and
vaccines.

49:27.731 --> 49:30.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Former President Obama traveled
to Cuba last
year.

49:30.600 --> 49:35.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He later announced new policies
making it
easier for American researchers
to apply for

49:35.872 --> 49:43.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FDA approval to trial Cuban
drugs in the United
States.

49:43.080 --> 49:47.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Mick Phillips voted for
President Trump, but
Mr. Trump has vowed to rollback
some of Obama's

49:47.784 --> 49:50.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
policies when it comes to Cuba
relations.

49:51.021 --> 49:52.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Phillips fears what that could
mean.

49:52.789 --> 49:57.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICK PHILLIPS: I am concerned
that access
to this medication will go away
for many,

49:57.828 --> 49:59.629 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
many people.

49:59.663 --> 50:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY GUTTMAN: Dr. Lee says it's
all part of
a potential change in the way
doctors approach

50:03.467 --> 50:04.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cancer treatment.

50:04.468 --> 50:06.303 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

50:06.336 --> 50:11.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELVIN LEE: There is an idea
that's developing
of converting cancer into a
chronic disease.

50:11.174 --> 50:16.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We give you a pill that you take
every day,
and it allows you to live a
perfectly normal

50:16.413 --> 50:17.948 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

50:17.981 --> 50:22.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY GUTTMAN: Outside Cuba and
the U.S., there's
great interest in CimaVax.

50:22.652 --> 50:25.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's approved in five different
countries.

50:25.188 --> 50:31.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Worldwide, 5,000 patients have
been treated
with the drug since 2011, 1,000
of them Cubans.

50:31.461 --> 50:34.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But no one sees CimaVax as a
magic pill.

50:34.798 --> 50:39.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Twenty percent of vaccinated
patients have
not lived longer than the
average survival

50:39.136 --> 50:40.904 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the unvaccinated group.

50:40.937 --> 50:45.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Phillips' doctor, Tim Goggins,
says there
are many unknowns about the
drug.

50:45.075 --> 50:46.810 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

50:46.843 --> 50:50.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIMOTHY GOGGINS: At some point
in time, the
immune system will probably not
respond to

50:50.380 --> 50:52.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that cancer cell.

50:52.082 --> 50:54.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The cancer cells find a way
around it.

50:54.117 --> 50:58.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY GUTTMAN: Mick Phillips hopes
the new American
president will allow the
progress he credits

50:58.522 --> 51:00.424 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to Cuban drugs to continue.

51:00.457 --> 51:07.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICK PHILLIPS: The key is that
the political
relations staying in place.

51:07.364 --> 51:13.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If that relation stays as it
should, I believe
that we can all benefit from it.

AMY GUTTMAN: Since taking
office, President
Trump has not said much more
about his approach

51:17.641 --> 51:19.076 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
toward Cuba.

51:19.109 --> 51:22.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's still unclear what this
could mean for
future trials of the drug.

51:22.579 --> 51:29.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Amy
Guttman reporting
from Havana.

51:29.319 --> 51:39.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As we reported at
the top of
tonight's "NewsHour," President
Trump abruptly

51:39.629 --> 51:45.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fired FBI Director James Comey
this evening
over his handling of the
investigation into

51:45.402 --> 51:47.404 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton's e-mails.

51:47.437 --> 51:51.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president said in a letter
to Comey it
is -- quote -- "essential that
we find new

51:51.741 --> 51:57.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leadership for the FBI that
restores public
trust and confidence in its
vital law enforcement

51:57.814 --> 51:59.449 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mission."

51:59.483 --> 52:02.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Moments ago, Republican Senator
John McCain
of Arizona weighed in on the
firing.

52:02.619 --> 52:04.387 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

52:04.421 --> 52:05.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MCCAIN (R), Arizona: I
regret that the
action had to be taken, and it's
unfortunate,

52:05.755 --> 52:06.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
because I think he's a good man.

52:06.723 --> 52:08.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president does have that
authority.

52:08.525 --> 52:12.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have always believed that we
should have
a select committee to -- or a
commission,

52:12.696 --> 52:23.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because it's a very large issue
that's gotten
larger, and it will get more
large as time

52:23.073 --> 52:24.808 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
goes by.

52:24.841 --> 52:28.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The number two
Democrat in
the Senate, Dick Durbin of
Illinois, also

52:28.845 --> 52:34.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
questioned whether the FBI's
investigation
into Russian interference in the
last presidential

52:34.384 --> 52:37.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaign would continue without
Comey.

52:37.254 --> 52:39.122 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

52:39.156 --> 52:43.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD DURBIN (D-IL), Minority
Whip: Any
attempt to stop or undermine
this FBI investigation

52:43.560 --> 52:46.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would raise grave constitutional
issues.

52:46.863 --> 52:52.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We await clarification by the
White House
as soon as possible as to
whether this investigation

52:52.169 --> 52:56.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will continue and whether it
will have a credible
lead, so that we know that it
will have a

52:56.973 --> 52:58.775 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
just outcome.

52:58.808 --> 53:02.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also tonight,
Democratic Senator
Patrick Leahy called the firing
-- and I'm

53:02.112 --> 53:04.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quoting -- "nothing less than
Nixonian."

53:05.015 --> 53:09.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And late today, the Reuters news
service also
reported that U.S. intelligence
agencies were

53:09.819 --> 53:13.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
given no advanced notice about
the president's
decision.

53:13.490 --> 53:16.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more here at the end of the
show, we're
joined again by John Yang.

53:16.293 --> 53:17.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
John, what more have you
learned?

53:17.827 --> 53:21.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: No advanced notice
also to the
FBI, to the Justice Department.

53:21.364 --> 53:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nobody seemed to have known
about this.

53:23.200 --> 53:26.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as you hear, the Democrats,
even though
this firing, the justification
for the firing

53:26.970 --> 53:32.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was the Clinton e-mail
investigation, Democrats
are focusing on the
investigation between

53:32.309 --> 53:36.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Trump campaign and Russian
entities and
Russia.

53:36.880 --> 53:39.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Comey was scheduled to testify
on Thursday
before the Senate Intelligence
Committee.

53:39.983 --> 53:40.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Of this week.

53:40.984 --> 53:41.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: This week.

53:41.985 --> 53:44.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And suddenly he's fired a couple
of days before.

53:44.421 --> 53:48.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michael Schmidt, a reporter for
The New York
Times, tweeted that the White
House and the

53:48.425 --> 53:54.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Justice Department were, in his
words, working
on firing Comey for -- since at
least last

53:54.264 --> 53:56.032 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
week.

53:56.066 --> 54:02.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says that Sessions was, in
his words, working
on coming up with reasons for a
firing.

54:02.806 --> 54:07.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we have not confirmed that
reporting,
but that's the speculation.

54:07.777 --> 54:12.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or that's his reporting, but
that's certainly
going to fuel the speculation
among Democrats

54:12.449 --> 54:14.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about what is really behind this
firing.

54:14.284 --> 54:17.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It certainly is,
and fascinating,
and, again, focusing on what
Comey did with

54:17.988 --> 54:19.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
regard to Hillary Clinton's
e-mails last summer.

54:19.889 --> 54:20.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang, thank you.

54:20.957 --> 54:22.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you're going to continue to
report on
it.

54:22.959 --> 54:24.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

54:24.761 --> 54:30.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

President Trump's firing of the

I'm Judy Woodruff.
