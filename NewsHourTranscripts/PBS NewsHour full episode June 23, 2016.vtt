case first what was it that the

university of texas case was
about

08:27.640 --> 08:31.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well actually this was the

the Supreme Court had looked at

university of texas uses race as
a
factor in its admissions policy

denied admissions to the

use of

08:49.829 --> 08:55.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
race as a factor was why she was
denied
admission and that it violated
the

Constitution the supreme court
in 2013

09:06.613 --> 09:08.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the university's explanation

09:08.648 --> 09:12.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you have to give the toughest
scrutiny
we have under the Constitution
and the

09:12.619 --> 09:16.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
university has shown has to show
their
no workable race-neutral
alternatives

09:17.690 --> 09:22.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
well that lower federal
appellate court
held hearings briefings upheld
the plan

09:22.362 --> 09:23.897 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
again

09:23.930 --> 09:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it came back to the Supreme
Court
abigail fisher brought it back
with a

09:26.866 --> 09:30.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conservative organization that
had
backed her from the beginning
and the

09:30.503 --> 09:35.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supreme court today and it's
surprising
for three decision upheld the

09:35.074 --> 09:39.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
university's use of race as
Justice
Kennedy said a factor of a
factor of a

09:39.946 --> 09:41.514 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
factor

09:41.548 --> 09:46.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why do you so surprising he had
never
voted to uphold an affirmative
action

09:46.386 --> 09:51.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plan although he had written and
spoken
about the importance of
diversity in

09:51.958 --> 09:56.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
higher education so he did
believe that
it was an important that
compelling

09:56.663 --> 09:59.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interest to have a diverse
student body

09:59.666 --> 10:03.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now this was a there were some
really
strong opinions voiced here is

10:03.470 --> 10:07.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Justice Alito wrote this is
affirmative
action gone wild gone berserk

10:08.441 --> 10:13.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's what he said he actually
read a
summary of his very long descent
is

10:13.513 --> 10:15.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
descent was 51 pages

10:15.448 --> 10:20.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he read it from summary from the
bench
for 17 minutes almost three
times longer

10:20.253 --> 10:25.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than Justice Kennedy summary of
his
opinion and he took issue with
most of

10:25.458 --> 10:30.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the points Justice Kennedy meant
made by
the way Justice Kennedy said
that this

10:30.363 --> 10:35.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plan is really sort of one of a
kind for
the university of texas under
texas

10:35.668 --> 10:40.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state law the university is
required to
admit students in the top 10% of
their

10:41.007 --> 10:46.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
high school classes and that has
accounted for significant
diversity but

10:46.312 --> 10:52.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the University felt that the
25-percent
places in in the in the school
that the

10:52.852 --> 10:57.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ten percent did not cover did
not really
create diversity in the
classroom so

10:57.590 --> 10:59.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that's why i used race

10:59.359 --> 11:05.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Justice Kennedy said that the
10-percent
plan was really a blunt tool
that it

11:05.965 --> 11:12.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just it admitted students on the
basis
of class rank and the other
twenty-five

11:12.572 --> 11:17.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
percent were admitted under a
holistic
view of that he considered many
other

11:17.176 --> 11:24.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things but Justice Alito in his
dissent
felt that this plan
discriminated

11:24.884 --> 11:31.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against asian americans and he
felt that
the university had not provided
the kind

11:31.157 --> 11:37.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of evidence that it was required
to
provide to show that it had it
needed

11:37.564 --> 11:42.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
race to achieve the type of
diversity at
wanted in the classroom

11:42.635 --> 11:45.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
let me quickly move you to the
other big
decision the court handed down
on

11:45.972 --> 11:50.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama's immigration
executive
orders the justices were asked
to rule

11:50.376 --> 11:54.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the legality of that tell us
about
how they how they came down

11:54.047 --> 11:59.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well this was a plan that was
announced
in 2014 by the administration
and it did

11:59.218 --> 12:05.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two things it would delay
temporarily
the deportation of parents
undocumented

12:05.058 --> 12:08.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
parents of children who are
American
citizens in

12:08.628 --> 12:14.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
legal permanent residents and
also
expanded a 2012 program that
delay the

12:14.834 --> 12:19.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deportation of what we have come
to call
the dreamers children who came
to

12:19.105 --> 12:25.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
america with undocumented
parents Texas
and 26 other republican-led
states

12:25.612 --> 12:30.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
challenge that put program in
the lower
federal court in Texas

12:30.650 --> 12:34.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it claimed that the President
had
exceeded his authority under
federal

12:34.587 --> 12:39.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immigration laws a federal
district
court temporarily entered an
injunction

12:39.926 --> 12:44.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to halt it a federal appellate
court
affirmed that injunction

12:44.230 --> 12:48.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so it was the united states that
came to
this US supreme court to try to
get that

12:48.768 --> 12:54.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
injunction lifted also to
confirm that
the President had this Authority

12:54.173 --> 12:59.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well the Court did split for for
today
and what that means is basically
that

12:59.178 --> 13:04.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the injunction that's halting
the
program remains in effect the
case goes

13:04.117 --> 13:09.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back to the lower federal
district court
for a trial on the merits the
courts for

13:09.689 --> 13:14.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for decision here only affirm
the
judgment of the lower court on
the

13:14.994 --> 13:16.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
preliminary injunction

13:16.996 --> 13:22.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was not a decision on the
merits of
the claim that Texas in the 25
other

13:22.769 --> 13:27.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states made so can you so what
can be
read into this very brief
statement the

13:28.007 --> 13:31.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
court made nothing

13:31.110 --> 13:35.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it it it's as I said it's not a
decision
on the merits

13:35.148 --> 13:41.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's not a precedent going
forward that
other courts can look to the
case may

13:41.054 --> 13:44.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come back to the Supreme Court
at some
point once it goes through trial
and

13:44.691 --> 13:49.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
appeal the United States also
has the
option of filing a petition for

13:49.529 --> 13:55.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rehearing in the US Supreme
Court which
the court can hold until there
is a

13:55.068 --> 13:59.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ninth justice if it so chooses
and just
quickly the presumption is the
absence

13:59.105 --> 14:05.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the late Justice Scalia
clearly had a
very much so as well as today
there was

14:05.244 --> 14:10.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
another 44 decision in a case
involving
Indian tribes important to them
and

14:10.116 --> 14:11.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
American businesses

14:11.984 --> 14:15.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Marcia Coyle thanks very much my
pleasure Judy

14:15.254 --> 14:20.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and now we take a deeper look at
that
case the impact of today's
immigration

14:20.359 --> 14:22.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
split on life outside the court

14:22.762 --> 14:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Angela Maria Kelly is with the
center
for american progress for a time
she

14:26.866 --> 14:31.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
advised the Obama administration
on
immigration and John theory is a
legal

14:31.771 --> 14:36.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policy analyst analyst at the
Center for
Immigration Studies welcome to
both of

14:36.676 --> 14:38.311 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you

14:38.344 --> 14:43.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Angela Kelly let me start with
you your
reaction to this one-sentence
statement

14:43.082 --> 14:48.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they handed down on this
immigration
nine poultry words but boy it
was a big

14:48.955 --> 14:50.423 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what a big blow

14:50.456 --> 14:56.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but look as is Michael just said
what
this is not a marshal yeah it's
a

14:56.896 --> 15:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
disappointment but it's not a
decision
and we're not done

15:00.466 --> 15:04.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have 11 million people in
this
country the average number of
years that

15:04.403 --> 15:08.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they've been here is 12 so these
are not
folks that are just stopping by
there

15:08.040 --> 15:11.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not accidental tourist there are
people
who are living here and we can't
send

15:11.577 --> 15:14.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
them all home as some
presidential
candidates might want have
happen

15:14.847 --> 15:16.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
because they are home

15:16.516 --> 15:19.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so the question is what are we
going to
do about it I think the
president's plan

15:19.685 --> 15:22.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is legal and ultimately we will
be back
in front of the court and i
think that

15:22.622 --> 15:24.157 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
will prevail

15:24.190 --> 15:27.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we do need a nice justice it's
been a
hundred days since Judge Garland
was

15:27.693 --> 15:32.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nominated and he has not yet had
his day
in court he hasn't yet had his
hiring

15:32.231 --> 15:34.801 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but John theory i mean it

15:34.834 --> 15:39.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's true they're the justices
didn't
elaborate but the effect of this
is to

15:39.172 --> 15:40.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
send this back to the lower
court

15:40.807 --> 15:44.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yeah i think what people are
wondering
why the court even took it up to
begin

15:44.043 --> 15:49.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with because all this is done is
delayed
and inevitable rehearing back up
at the

15:49.182 --> 15:53.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Supreme Court a year or two from
now so
it's unclear how long this is
going to

15:53.152 --> 15:56.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take but in some ways a lot of
folks
were arguing that perhaps the
court

15:56.789 --> 16:00.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should have waited and tell the
lower
court actually had a hearing on
the

16:00.893 --> 16:05.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
merits so we would have some
idea of
exactly what issues we were
looking at

16:05.064 --> 16:08.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and where perhaps the White
House was
going to be successful and where
they

16:08.067 --> 16:12.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were not what they were dealing
with
what 26 x large number of states
that

16:12.538 --> 16:14.607 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
had asked them to do to rule on

16:14.640 --> 16:18.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
26 states yes but as I recall
the
state's themselves requested the
supreme

16:18.778 --> 16:22.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
court that they not take the
decision
and in fact that they wait until
there

16:22.648 --> 16:25.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was a hearing at the lower court
level

16:25.351 --> 16:28.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what does this mean you started
to
address this Angela in your
first

16:28.821 --> 16:32.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comment what does this mean for
the
individuals who I mean President
Obama

16:32.758 --> 16:35.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talked today about people coming
out of
the shadows

16:35.294 --> 16:38.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what does it mean for them
that's right
i mean they look their lives
remain in

16:38.197 --> 16:42.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
limbo but their lives remain
here as I
said people have already been
here for

16:42.568 --> 16:44.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nearly a dozen years on average

16:44.604 --> 16:47.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're talking about people who
have US
citizen children so clearly they
put

16:47.640 --> 16:49.175 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
down roots

16:49.208 --> 16:52.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most of them work course and pay
taxes
never perhaps ever see that
refund

16:52.912 --> 16:56.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
so the folks that are
contributing to
the economy as well so I think

16:56.282 --> 16:59.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unfortunately that they are
stuck in the
crosshairs of paralysis in
Washington

16:59.886 --> 17:03.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is in Congress and which
unfortunately is now spilled to
the

17:03.055 --> 17:08.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
court but i don't see that
they're going
to all pack up and leave but
what about

17:08.160 --> 17:10.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that John . indeed should they
pack up
and leave

17:10.963 --> 17:13.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well I don't know that there has
been a
paralysis necessarily it's just
that the

17:14.000 --> 17:16.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
advocates for amnesty and more
immigration haven't got what
they wanted

17:16.903 --> 17:21.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and President Obama himself
knows that
this policy is unpopular if it
were

17:21.507 --> 17:23.075 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
popular

17:23.109 --> 17:25.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he wouldn't wait until after the
midterm
to announce this he didn't want
to have

17:25.645 --> 17:29.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to have Republicans or Democrats
defending something while photos
were

17:29.382 --> 17:33.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heading to the ballot box so you
with
the people are spoken they've
denied the

17:33.986 --> 17:35.621 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
marco rubio sure

17:35.655 --> 17:39.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amnesty bill they stopped the
amnesty
back under president bush and
the DREAM

17:39.926 --> 17:42.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Act which has been introduced
multiple
times went nowhere

17:42.728 --> 17:46.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so it's not so much that we're
in limbo
it's just that we have
administration

17:47.033 --> 17:50.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not that different from the
previous
administration that isn't
committed to

17:50.636 --> 17:55.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enforcing our immigration laws
and so
you're saying that it is that
what that

17:55.274 --> 17:57.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what should happen to these
individuals

17:57.243 --> 18:00.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well under federal law they are
supposed
to go home I mean I was mom

18:00.346 --> 18:02.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was noted i'm gonna go that
they're
not terrorists but in fact 20 of
them

18:03.015 --> 18:06.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually did come as to us they
just
like to State Department and
like the

18:06.218 --> 18:09.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American people who overstayed
their
visas and so if we're going to
have any

18:09.221 --> 18:12.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sense of rule of law in this
country
people have to abide by the
terms that

18:12.792 --> 18:14.493 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we set forth in the comment

18:14.527 --> 18:17.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what about that in well we do
have look
a record number of people who
have been

18:17.496 --> 18:21.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deported into this president has
hardly
been a softy on illegal
immigration and

18:21.901 --> 18:23.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we have a terminal

18:23.569 --> 18:27.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and this build up at the border
so that
illegal immigration the United
States is

18:27.139 --> 18:31.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
basically a 20 on the question
is what
are we going to do about these
folks and

18:31.310 --> 18:34.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
i think that the President did
wait very
patiently the Senate did pass a

18:34.914 --> 18:38.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bipartisan bill on conference
immigration reform and the house
failed

18:38.951 --> 18:43.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to act so I met it's a question
of it's
not an amnesty but i think is
what we

18:43.222 --> 18:44.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
need is an answer

18:44.824 --> 18:47.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and interestingly enough of
poles that
came out yesterday show that
seventy

18:47.827 --> 18:52.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eight percent of Independence
support
with the 11 million not
supporting them

18:52.631 --> 18:57.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but giving them a path to
citizenship so
we're talking about just very
sensible

18:57.403 --> 19:00.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what are we going to do what are
some
common sense solutions but in
the

19:00.973 --> 19:02.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
meantime the court

19:02.908 --> 19:06.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
maybe we don't have an answer
correct
and in the meantime mr. furious
. is

19:06.912 --> 19:11.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they are here illegally
they are
here on without documents

19:11.117 --> 19:14.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well mr. theory should feel
comfortable
in the fact that immigration

19:14.620 --> 19:19.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deportations are going to
continue that
we have a robust ice presents
and Border

19:19.725 --> 19:23.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Patrol forces but that to me
isn't isn't
really the answer look we have
an

19:23.963 --> 19:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immigration system that hasn't
been
updated since 1990

19:27.099 --> 19:32.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we just think about that and so
until
Congress does its job in the
points a

19:32.338 --> 19:33.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
knife or a present

19:33.773 --> 19:37.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nice justice on the Supreme
Court passes
immigration reform

19:37.376 --> 19:39.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're going to have these these
functions not just in our
immigration

19:39.812 --> 19:43.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
system but across many sectors
of
america and clearly we deserve
better

19:43.983 --> 19:47.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of course if you look at actual
ice data
deportations have fallen
dramatically

19:47.753 --> 19:52.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the past five or six years
and not
just deportations of of
non-violent

19:52.491 --> 19:55.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people but even deportations of
criminals islands has dropped
down

19:55.895 --> 19:57.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dramatically over the past five
years

19:57.763 --> 20:02.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what this administration has
decided
outside deferred action is that
they are

20:02.168 --> 20:06.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to narrow the scope of
deportation
and virtually you're not going
to be

20:06.272 --> 20:09.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
facing deportation unless you
are a
violent criminal and in fact
Obama's

20:09.809 --> 20:13.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
former ice director said that
exact
thing to the only times last
year

20:13.112 --> 20:16.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well I mean let me just quote be
part of
what President Obama said he
said it's

20:16.682 --> 20:20.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heartbreaking for the millions
of
immigrants who made their lives
here who

20:20.186 --> 20:25.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
raise their families here who
hope for
the opportunity to work to pay
taxes

20:25.091 --> 20:29.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
didn't excuse me to pay taxes to
serve
in our military and more fully

20:29.061 --> 20:30.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
contribute to the country

20:30.830 --> 20:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the American people are
the most
generous people on the planet
comes to

20:33.866 --> 20:35.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
immigration we welcome in

20:35.434 --> 20:37.736 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
our people for permanent
residency every
year than any other country on
the

20:37.770 --> 20:39.338 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
planet by a mile

20:39.371 --> 20:42.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's just that our generosity i
think is
being taken advantage of and I
think

20:42.842 --> 20:47.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Americans are starting to sour
on even
the concept of immigration
because they

20:47.379 --> 20:50.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see people who are not playing
by the
rules who are breaking the law
school

20:50.416 --> 20:52.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
were actually lying to us

20:52.051 --> 20:55.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cutting in front of lines of
people who
are playing by the rules

20:55.654 --> 20:58.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
taking the time and the money
and the
effort to do it the right way

20:58.791 --> 21:02.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what about that the look at life
is
messy and the undocumented
people don't

21:02.194 --> 21:06.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
live in an apartment building
all by
themselves right so they marry
Americans

21:06.832 --> 21:11.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have citizen children they
work
shoulder-to-shoulder with other
people

21:11.103 --> 21:14.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they go to mosque they go to
church they
go to synagogue with other folks

21:14.573 --> 21:18.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so the idea that we're going to
somehow
take take them all out and
remove them

21:18.444 --> 21:22.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that that's not going to
upset the
fabric of this country is just
is just

21:22.281 --> 21:23.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
foolish and scary

21:23.816 --> 21:27.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here's what we do know is that
in 2012
and the president asked
announced

21:27.620 --> 21:31.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deferred action for dreamers
that since
then we've had a over 700,000
young

21:31.557 --> 21:35.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people come forward get work
authorizations pay taxes get
better jobs

21:35.661 --> 21:39.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that to me is a program that
makes sense
not just for those families but
for the

21:39.865 --> 21:41.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country

21:41.534 --> 21:45.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so that's the direction I was a
just we
going very quick final work
until we see

21:45.037 --> 21:48.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an end to illegal immigration
and actual
commitment from our policymakers
to

21:48.807 --> 21:50.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
actually enforce our immigration
laws

21:50.976 --> 21:54.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any type of legalization program
is just
going to encourage more people
to come

21:54.180 --> 21:57.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
across the board to risk their
lives and
to overstate pieces

21:57.249 --> 22:00.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John theory Angela Maria Kelly
and
earlier

22:00.986 --> 22:04.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Marcia Coyle we thank you all
three

22:06.625 --> 22:10.196 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
yeah

22:14.133 --> 22:17.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should they stay or should they
go
that's the question facing
British

22:17.703 --> 22:21.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters today as they decide

for an
historic day of voting

22:30.649 --> 22:34.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's been a bitter campaign to

whether Britain remains within

22:40.359 --> 22:43.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Britons were on edge don't
really know
what to expect and I think of a
result

22:43.762 --> 22:46.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comes in kind of early in the
morning
everyone might be asleep still
and my

22:51.470 --> 22:54.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the most recent polls show the
outcome
is too close to call

22:55.207 --> 23:01.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but bookies are putting the odds

another

23:54.400 --> 23:58.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
major factor that's perhaps
gonna play
into this referendum result has

it's difficult to see a very
absolutely
certain pattern but it is true
that

24:15.020 --> 24:19.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

the polls close

24:33.906 --> 24:38.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just over an hour and a half ago

sorry Malcolm so now that the
polls have
closed what are you hearing

24:45.684 --> 24:48.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what's the latest

24:49.321 --> 24:52.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well normally these sort of
events you
have

24:53.025 --> 24:56.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exit polls but the broadcaster's
this
time decided that they wouldn't
have won

24:56.695 --> 25:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because there was no real model
for them
but we have heard that so you
kept the

25:01.734 --> 25:06.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United the United Kingdom
Independence
Party has had its own poll of
about

25:06.772 --> 25:11.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
10,000 people and should be
around the
time the polls closed their
leader nigel

25:11.844 --> 25:16.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
farage said he thought that the
remain
people hedged it which seems to
be very

25:17.015 --> 25:18.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
much like a concession

25:18.751 --> 25:22.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he said though that you get was
a force
to be reckoned with them that
this

25:22.955 --> 25:27.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
independence movement we would
not be
going away then to actually
consolidate

25:27.426 --> 25:29.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what seems to be this concession

25:29.461 --> 25:33.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there was also a poll that have
been
carried out during the course of
the day

25:33.232 --> 25:36.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by an Internet polling company
called
you go

25:36.235 --> 25:39.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they've been looking at
around about
five thousand voters tracking
them

25:39.805 --> 25:44.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
during the course of this
referendum and
according to their on the day
polling

25:44.410 --> 25:49.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their outcome is that it's fifty
two
percent for remain and
forty-eight

25:49.581 --> 25:53.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
percent for those people who
want to
leave so the indications are
pretty

25:53.218 --> 25:54.820 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
clear

25:54.853 --> 25:59.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of course you know there are
maybe sort
of as many as 30 or 35 million
votes to

25:59.491 --> 26:02.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be counted during the course
tonight and
that could change but these are
pretty

26:02.661 --> 26:04.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
good indications and

26:04.530 --> 26:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and so I mean sent me in the
remain camp
at the moment

26:07.833 --> 26:11.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people are looking pretty
comfortable
you know how that when you talk
to the

26:11.470 --> 26:15.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people in the last couple of
days as you
are reporting the story out the

26:15.474 --> 26:18.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
undecided are they aware of the
consequences

26:18.210 --> 26:25.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean they were undecided
voters even
up to the polls today yes i know
i think

26:25.751 --> 26:29.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the undecided voters really have
been
absolutely critical in this

26:29.288 --> 26:33.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and up until today that the
opinion
polls which don't necessarily be
trusted

26:33.926 --> 26:37.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for saying that but it might be
might
have been as many as about
eleven

26:37.362 --> 26:41.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
percent of the electricity were
undecided and last night there
was a

26:41.500 --> 26:46.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very interesting debate on one
of the
British to TV channels which had
a

26:46.238 --> 26:50.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
hundred people who were
undecided and it
tracked their emotions during
the course

26:50.876 --> 26:56.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the debate is various issues
came up
and at the end of that debate
that what

26:56.048 --> 27:00.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happened was that most of those
people
who were undecided did vote to
remain

27:00.452 --> 27:02.754 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and what probably happened is
that

27:02.788 --> 27:05.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yeah i think there are lots of
people in
Britain you've just been really
were

27:05.924 --> 27:09.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
welded by the arguments are not
able to
make up their minds at all and
it's a

27:09.895 --> 27:14.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pretty momentous decision to
have to go
into that voting booth and to
make up

27:14.500 --> 27:20.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your mind because the decision
that was
made today is completely
irrevocable to

27:20.305 --> 27:23.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leave the European Union that we
know
some coming back

27:23.308 --> 27:28.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and for many people this has
been a
campaign of loathing and fear
loathing

27:28.814 --> 27:33.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the part of many of the
really them
and breakfasts who hate many of
the

27:33.952 --> 27:37.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things that the European Union
stands
for especially unelected and

27:37.990 --> 27:42.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unaccountable representatives
who they
believe are dictating to Britain
and

27:42.227 --> 27:46.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take away its authority and the
fear
element has been amongst those
people

27:46.632 --> 27:50.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who are worried but in
particular about
the economy and it is perhaps
the

27:50.369 --> 27:56.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
economy which is actually driven
the
those people in the remain can
perhaps

27:56.775 --> 28:00.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because the easiest thing to do
is to
vote for the status quote people
have

28:00.445 --> 28:05.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been very worried about losing
their
jobs they've been worried by
predictions

28:05.183 --> 28:10.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by fairly major individuals in
industry
people like Sir Richard Branson
who say

28:10.088 --> 28:13.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it would be a complete mistake
to come
out of the European you

28:13.525 --> 28:17.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you and so not knowing what was
going to
be on the other out on the other
side of

28:17.963 --> 28:19.498 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this

28:19.531 --> 28:22.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's why perhaps those people
have
been undecided have gone in into
the the

28:22.534 --> 28:25.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voting booths and they decided
to opt
for the status quo

28:25.604 --> 28:28.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all right special correspondent

when big

28:47.159 --> 28:53.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cities don't have enough housing
and a
brief but spectacular take on
why the oj

28:53.098 --> 28:59.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
simpson trial still matters
today but
first it was a rare night and
morning in

28:59.671 --> 29:01.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
congressional history

29:01.406 --> 29:06.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats staged in all night
sitting in
demanding a vote on a plan to
ban anyone

29:06.411 --> 29:09.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the government's terrorist
no-fly
list from buying a gun

lisa de Chardin begins our
coverage over
your house democrats emerged
from the

29:15.687 --> 29:19.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
capital in the early afternoon
giving up
their 26 our sit-in

29:19.891 --> 29:23.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they vowed to keep fighting for
gun
control measures after the July
fourth

29:23.528 --> 29:27.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
break when we come back here on
july in
the fifth

29:27.633 --> 29:33.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're going to continue to push
to pull
this thing out

29:33.939 --> 29:41.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and if necessary just sit down
the scene
outside was nearly as rock is
the one

29:41.580 --> 29:47.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that played out yesterday and
overnight
inside chair declares the house
recess

29:47.486 --> 29:52.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for our 12 noon as Republicans
recessed
triggering an automatic shutdown
of the

29:52.691 --> 29:54.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
official house cameras

29:54.192 --> 29:57.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats took to social media
to
broadcast the back and forth on
the

29:57.996 --> 30:06.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
floor from their cell phones
10pm House
Speaker Paul Ryan tried to
regain

30:06.238 --> 30:09.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
control over Democrats chanting

30:10.142 --> 30:15.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
possibly in order the order was
not
coming house cameras again . the
house

30:15.847 --> 30:24.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stands in recess Democrats kept
sitting
and standing on the floor until

30:24.890 --> 30:30.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans return to a formal
session
again at two thirty AM and not
just any

30:30.662 --> 30:35.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
session GOP leaders called for a
big
vote on a bill that included a
billion

30:35.701 --> 30:37.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dollars to fight the Zika virus

30:37.803 --> 30:41.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
it passed without debate
actually most
reconsider is laid upon the
table and

30:41.973 --> 30:46.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans closed out the
session until
after I for the house stands
adjourned

30:46.611 --> 30:51.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speaker Ryan facing this new
test had
biting words for Democrats today
we are

30:51.450 --> 30:56.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not going to allow stunts like
this to
stop us from carrying out the
people's

30:56.755 --> 30:57.823 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
business

30:57.856 --> 31:04.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why do I call this is stunt well
because
it is one

31:04.162 --> 31:07.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
let's just be honest here why a
stunt

31:07.733 --> 31:12.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ryan pointed out that Democrats
sent out
multiple fundraising emails and
flyers

31:12.504 --> 31:14.039 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about the sit-in

31:14.072 --> 31:17.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he said it wasn't a proud moment
for
democracy but Democrats point
out that

31:17.609 --> 31:22.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
eight years ago then minority
Republicans also held the house
floor in

31:22.614 --> 31:24.249 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
protest

31:24.282 --> 31:28.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one key difference no cell phone
video
streaming then as the house
closed with

31:28.787 --> 31:30.422 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
no action

31:30.455 --> 31:34.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there was a symbolic but
important vote
about the no fly list on the
Senate side

31:34.092 --> 31:39.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a bipartisan plan from Susan
Collins of
Maine with band gun purchases
from those

31:39.064 --> 31:40.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the terror watch list

31:40.732 --> 31:45.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it survived a procedural vote
getting
support from 50 to senators the
issue

31:45.604 --> 31:50.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the Collins plan it will
likely need
60 votes which it doesn't have
to make

31:50.442 --> 31:53.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it out of the Senate for the PBS
Newshour

31:53.378 --> 31:57.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
i'm lisa de Chardin and joining
me now
from Capitol Hill is one of the

31:57.916 --> 32:01.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats who helped organize
the sit-in
in the house is congressman
David

32:01.820 --> 32:06.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cicilline of Rhode Island
congressman
welcome to the program first of
all did

32:06.525 --> 32:08.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you get any sleep at all last
night

32:08.393 --> 32:12.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I did not I actually haven't
pulled an
all-nighter since college so
after this

32:12.464 --> 32:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
show i'm going to go home and go
to bed

32:15.000 --> 32:17.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
why did Democrats

32:17.269 --> 32:21.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
make what - was if not
unprecedented
move as we just heard close to

32:21.773 --> 32:23.341 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unprecedented

32:23.375 --> 32:26.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
well I i think it was
unprecedented we
have been incredibly frustrated
at the

32:26.878 --> 32:32.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican House leadership
refusal to
bring to the floor - very common
sense

32:32.150 --> 32:36.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gun safety proposals one to keep
a
suspected terrorists who are on
the

32:36.721 --> 32:41.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
watch list to prevent them from
buying a
gun and universal background
checks to

32:41.092 --> 32:44.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make sure that everyone who
purchase a
gun has a background check and
these are

32:44.296 --> 32:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two common-sense proposals the
Republican leadership in the
house has

32:48.233 --> 32:51.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
refused to bring these bills to
the
floor and we've been incredibly

32:51.803 --> 32:55.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
frustrated and we thought it was
important to try something new
to bring

32:55.740 --> 32:59.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attention to this issue to
demand that
the Republicans bring these
bills to the

32:59.611 --> 33:02.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
floor for a vote to bring the
attention
of our country to this issue

33:03.481 --> 33:07.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we just saw an event the worst
mass
shooting in the history of the
united

33:07.385 --> 33:12.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states in orlando florida 49
people
slaughtered by an assault weapon
52

33:12.190 --> 33:16.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people injured and we seem to
see this
kind of carnage on a regular
basis and

33:17.028 --> 33:20.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so far the Republicans have been
unwilling to bring a single bill
to the

33:20.665 --> 33:22.067 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
floor

33:22.100 --> 33:25.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that would respond to it and we
thought
this was really important to try

33:25.737 --> 33:30.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something different to demand
that they
move forward on these and this
was the

33:30.642 --> 33:36.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beginning of what will be a
protracted
effort to really encourage and
convince

33:36.281 --> 33:39.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and persuade and ultimately
force our
Republican colleagues to address
this

33:39.985 --> 33:44.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issue and make our communities
safer but
if you don't have the numbers
how do you

33:44.489 --> 33:46.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do that I heard speaker Ryan say
today

33:46.892 --> 33:50.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it actually did come up for a
vote in
committee it just didn't pass
out of

33:51.029 --> 33:54.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
committee in order to get to the
floor
well both of the proposals that
the

33:54.432 --> 33:58.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
proposal to make sure that
terrorists
can't buy a gun and make sure
there are

33:58.336 --> 34:02.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
universal background checks are
supported broadly by the
American people

34:02.707 --> 34:06.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
85 in ninety percent that
includes
Republicans and Democrats in

34:06.311 --> 34:07.846 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
independence

34:07.879 --> 34:10.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so the american people support
this and
what was most gratifying about
last

34:10.515 --> 34:14.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night is we had a huge crowd
outside the
capital that was growing
throughout the

34:14.252 --> 34:15.754 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
night

34:15.787 --> 34:18.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ordinary Americans that it come
to
Washington of capitol grounds to
support

34:18.523 --> 34:20.025 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our effort

34:20.058 --> 34:22.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is going to require the
outside
engagement of folks all across
this

34:22.994 --> 34:25.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country to demand that Congress
do

34:25.931 --> 34:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what they think needs to be done
to keep
them safe this is one of the
issues

34:28.934 --> 34:30.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where the American people are
with us

34:30.669 --> 34:33.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we've got to keep them engaged
in this
fight him and finally convince

34:34.005 --> 34:37.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans that they have a
responsibility to move forward
and keep

34:37.776 --> 34:40.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
individuals who are on the
terrorist
watch list from buying a gun

34:40.845 --> 34:44.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make sure that all guns there's
a
subject to a background check
and really

34:44.316 --> 34:49.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
continue to engage with people
all
across this country to demand
that

34:49.087 --> 34:52.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaders in the Republican Party
bring
these bills to the floor for a
vote

34:52.357 --> 34:55.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but do you really think you're
going to
be able to do that i mean for
example

34:55.393 --> 34:59.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are there any Republicans have
come to
you or any of your Democratic
colleagues

34:59.731 --> 35:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and said I'm changing my mind

35:02.133 --> 35:05.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
well I think there are
Republicans who
heard from their constituents
last night

35:05.503 --> 35:09.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I think as they go home for
the
break I mean imagine in the
middle of

35:09.541 --> 35:11.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this argument we were asking
them

35:11.343 --> 35:14.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
let's debate these bills tell us
why you
oppose them

35:14.846 --> 35:17.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tell us why you think people on
the
terrorist watch list should be
able to

35:17.349 --> 35:18.950 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
my gun

35:18.984 --> 35:21.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tell us why you don't think
there should
be universal background checks
they

35:21.119 --> 35:24.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wouldn't come to the floor and
debate
those of course there's no good
argument

35:24.289 --> 35:28.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against either bill but what
they did
was at two thirty in the morning
in the

35:28.393 --> 35:31.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dark of night while America
slept

35:31.396 --> 35:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they used a procedural maneuver
to
adjourn

35:34.499 --> 35:36.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but they're gonna have to go
home and
their home now they're going to
hear

35:36.768 --> 35:40.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from their constituents who I
expect
going to say you need to pass
and common

35:41.006 --> 35:42.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sense gun safety legislation

35:42.674 --> 35:46.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so when we come back in July
fifth and
we resume our effort they will
have

35:46.578 --> 35:50.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heard from their constituents
and look
this is going to be a long
struggle but

35:50.648 --> 35:54.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
i am confident that the end of
this we
will persuade our colleagues to
do

35:54.486 --> 35:58.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what's right for the American
people in
prevent people on the terrorist
watch

35:58.456 --> 36:00.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
list from buying a gun

36:00.158 --> 36:03.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make sure we have universal
background
checks both things which can
really make

36:03.862 --> 36:07.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our communities safer and keep
guns out
of the hands of people who
shouldn't

36:07.499 --> 36:09.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have them

36:09.034 --> 36:13.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what do you what's your reaction
to
speakers Ryan's com pika Ryan's
comment

36:13.271 --> 36:17.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that this is just a stunt
designed to
get Democrats in front of the TV
cameras

36:17.742 --> 36:21.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look at that despite the fact
that
speaker Ryan turned off the
camera is

36:21.212 --> 36:22.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
shut off our microphones

36:22.814 --> 36:26.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're not going to be silenced
we were
able to use social media

36:26.051 --> 36:29.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
periscope to make sure that the
American
people could see this debate

36:29.521 --> 36:32.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
despite the fact that the
Republicans
didn't want them to see it but
look I

36:32.590 --> 36:36.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think if you speak to any of the
family
members who lost loved ones in
orlando

36:36.861 --> 36:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any of the parents of the
children slain
and Sandy Hook or uncle
community

36:41.399 --> 36:46.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
college or San Bernardino or
aurora that
there's nothing that's a stunt
about

36:46.604 --> 36:50.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this this is about gun violence
which is
an epidemic in this country
which is

36:50.708 --> 36:55.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ripping families apart which is
a really
serious public health crisis in
this

36:55.113 --> 36:59.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
country and we have a
responsibility to
fight hard to enact proposals
that will

36:59.884 --> 37:03.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reduce gun violence in this
country and
we are going to use everything
at our

37:03.288 --> 37:04.889 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
disposal

37:04.923 --> 37:08.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every tool that we have to
continue to
press hard to force the
Republicans to

37:08.359 --> 37:09.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
take up these issues

37:09.994 --> 37:13.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the American people are
demanding it
they expect us to do something
and I can

37:13.431 --> 37:16.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
assure you for the families and
victims
of gun violence in this country
they

37:16.601 --> 37:18.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
don't think this was a stunt

37:18.203 --> 37:20.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they were pleased that we were
in this
fight trying to be sure their
voices

37:20.905 --> 37:23.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were heard in the Congress of
the United
States you expect they'll be
more

37:23.708 --> 37:25.243 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
citizens

37:25.276 --> 37:28.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I expect we're going to do lots
more to
force the Republicans to finally
meet

37:28.346 --> 37:31.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their responsibilities and an
act

night

37:37.422 --> 37:39.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
literally sitting on the house
floor

37:39.390 --> 37:45.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thank you very much thank you
and we do
hope to hear from Republican
lawmakers

37:45.797 --> 37:48.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the coming days

37:51.102 --> 37:54.105 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
yeah

38:01.079 --> 38:06.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the cost of buying or renting a
home and
key American cities keeps on
rising

38:06.151 --> 38:10.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a new study out finds more than
40

38:10.288 --> 38:13.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of their income on rent and the

shortage in cities like new york

38:13.858 --> 38:17.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
washington in San Francisco may
be
costing more than a hundred

financial news

38:27.438 --> 38:32.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you can hear so much with this
old
building every sort of step

38:32.243 --> 38:36.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yeah it's like every every creak
Brian
handling has multiple graduate
degrees a

38:36.714 --> 38:39.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
steady job and a middle-class
income

38:39.484 --> 38:42.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
this is it right here it
probably hasn't
been renovated since the
Eisenhower

38:42.754 --> 38:48.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration yet at 34 years
old he is
the substance of a woman lucky
enough to

38:48.693 --> 38:54.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a rent-controlled apartment
but
Hanlon's time is running out

38:54.098 --> 38:57.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I've been in this room for about
four
and a half years or and a half
years he

38:57.802 --> 39:01.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where is the owner of his
apartment
house will offer the actual
lease holder

39:01.940 --> 39:03.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a lot of money to move

39:03.942 --> 39:07.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meaning handling will have to
pay a lot
more to live in this mission
district

39:07.712 --> 39:09.314 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
neighborhood

39:09.347 --> 39:11.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well so market rate for this
place i'm
guessing is probably it would
probably

39:11.749 --> 39:15.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about five thousand dollars a
month
$5,000 amount of three bedroom

mission

39:17.021 --> 39:20.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sure the situation is forcing
your
growing number of people low
medium and

39:20.692 --> 39:25.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
high income workers into ever
tighter

no

income out of their homes all
together

39:28.466 --> 39:32.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I got here because I have
nowhere to go
Claudia roger has lived on this
sidewalk

39:32.737 --> 39:37.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since losing her assembly line
job last
year and it was on this rapidly

39:37.242 --> 39:42.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gentrifying but still gritty
street that
she says she almost lost her

39:43.414 --> 39:49.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how tall with the flames he was
being
was like like this building and
if it

39:49.120 --> 39:54.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
helped dog big dog window a huge
fire
started by someone throwing

39:54.993 --> 39:58.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
her tent at 3am with her inside

39:58.830 --> 40:03.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just say the fire boom like a
table
can't push me

40:03.201 --> 40:06.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chef I was panicked and I get up
and I
wrong we're not sure

40:06.971 --> 40:09.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nothing everything started
getting fired

40:09.240 --> 40:14.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in sight it's not me it's really
other
helping road shower handle and
find a

40:14.646 --> 40:19.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
stable place to live is
complicated by a
long list of roadblocks faced by

40:19.584 --> 40:22.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
developers who want to construct
high-density homes

40:22.687 --> 40:26.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I run growing that also housing
activists laura clark founded a
group

40:26.924 --> 40:32.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
called Rose San Francisco to
push for
fewer restrictions which even
she admits

40:32.430 --> 40:37.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
were designed with good
intention it
comes historically from a very
good

40:37.101 --> 40:38.636 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
plate

40:38.670 --> 40:43.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
originally there was a lot of
really
good work done to say we
shouldn't be

40:43.041 --> 40:47.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
blasting highways through our
cities we
really need to take an
environmental

40:47.645 --> 40:52.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
perspective about a lot of the
urban
rejuvenation we were doing and
then it

40:52.950 --> 40:56.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kind of went to kind of a toxic
place
one example

40:56.554 --> 41:02.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shadow studies shadow studies
yeah where
we research where the shadows
are going

41:02.327 --> 41:03.961 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to fall

41:03.995 --> 41:07.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was hard to believe shadows
and other
seemingly minor factors could
actually

41:07.498 --> 41:11.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prevent the construction of new
housing
in a city that by some estimates
needs

41:11.736 --> 41:14.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
tens if not hundreds of
thousands more
homes

41:14.739 --> 41:17.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so we track down Jeff Buckley at
San
Francisco City Hall

41:18.509 --> 41:24.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's the mayor senior housing
advisor as
part of a voter mandate which
was

41:24.482 --> 41:29.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
established in the eighties
there are
some public open spaces that
cannot have

41:29.487 --> 41:33.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shadow and in them and others
when they
have a shadow budget shadow
budgets

41:33.925 --> 41:38.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
correct which is a small amount
of
shadow that is allowed in those
areas

41:38.996 --> 41:41.265 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
during certain types of shadows

41:41.299 --> 41:46.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
normally these environmental
concerns
these are issues community
groups and

41:46.337 --> 41:51.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even individuals used to block
new
construction often targeting
market rate

41:51.409 --> 41:57.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or luxury housing but San
Francisco is
trying to cut the red tape and
has an

41:57.148 --> 42:02.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ambitious goal of adding 30,000
new
housing units by 2020 half of
them

42:02.420 --> 42:06.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
subsidized there a lot of
critics will
say you need to be focused on
total

42:06.557 --> 42:09.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
supply and not necessarily
affordability

42:09.360 --> 42:13.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that works well in an
economist
think tank but in the reality of

42:13.731 --> 42:15.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
politics

42:15.299 --> 42:20.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the policy making in an
urban
environment you need to figure
out not

42:20.438 --> 42:25.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just a total unit amount but how
to make
those units affordable for
people who

42:25.076 --> 42:30.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
live here in the city but as
economist .
out more total housing would
lower rents

42:30.648 --> 42:32.150 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for everyone

42:32.183 --> 42:35.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of the most progressive
policies
that this progressive City the
dark

42:35.853 --> 42:41.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would be to build more housing
and Rico
already is an economist at UC
Berkeley

42:41.793 --> 42:45.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
where he studies the
relationship
between housing and employment

42:45.897 --> 42:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think this is a perfect
example of how
broken the planning process is

42:49.367 --> 42:53.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some c-spot there's a developer
who
would like to add three under 45
units

42:53.438 --> 42:59.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the top of walgreen and
brother think
there yet protesters have
blocked this

42:59.076 --> 43:01.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mission district project for
years

43:01.546 --> 43:07.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in part yes because of the
shadows it
would cast the same goes for a
250 unit

43:07.952 --> 43:11.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
project on Market Street which
would
replace this low rise building
and

43:11.756 --> 43:13.157 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
parking lot

43:13.191 --> 43:16.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the net result is that very few
thousand
units get building San Francisco

43:16.994 --> 43:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
welcome to the demand and that
says more
already has far-reaching effects

43:22.366 --> 43:25.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he and his colleagues at the
university
of chicago took a mathematical
model

43:25.770 --> 43:30.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
normally used to study the
economic
effects of immigration
restrictions

43:30.107 --> 43:35.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between countries and applied it
within
the United States crunching
decade's

43:35.213 --> 43:40.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worth of data from 220 us metro
areas
they found five American cities
did not

43:40.818 --> 43:45.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
contribute as much to us
economic growth
as they would have if they had
more

43:45.456 --> 43:46.991 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
housing

43:47.024 --> 43:50.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
according to the research the
housing
crunch in the bay area in New
York

43:50.661 --> 43:54.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Boston in Washington is not just
stressing local runners but also

43:54.832 --> 44:00.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shrinking the incomes of every
American
worker some 100 million people

44:00.738 --> 44:05.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's a loss for the entire
nation we
met already at the San Francisco
Federal

44:05.610 --> 44:09.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reserve where he's a fellow he
says
restricted land use policies are
keeping

44:10.014 --> 44:14.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people out of cities like San
Francisco
how much money with the average
american

44:14.952 --> 44:20.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worker actually earn if these
policies
were in place in these five
cities we

44:20.458 --> 44:24.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
estimate about five thousand
dollars in
additional earnings for the
average

44:24.862 --> 44:31.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worker five thousand dollars in
lost
wages 500 billion dollars in
Miss gdp

44:31.836 --> 44:37.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yes if this five American cities
were to
lower the level of land use
regulation

44:37.308 --> 44:43.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the level of the median
American city
and we will see increased
economic

44:43.447 --> 44:48.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
growth increase GDP and higher
wages and
not just in those cities but
across the

44:48.419 --> 44:50.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country according to them
already

44:50.454 --> 44:55.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these five cities are places
where
specialized workers cluster
making each

44:55.126 --> 45:00.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
member more productive and
therefore
better paid if they loosened
development

45:00.464 --> 45:02.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
restrictions so more

45:02.099 --> 45:06.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
homes could be built rents would
fall
making it easier for newcomers
with high

45:06.270 --> 45:10.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
earning potential to break into
the club
more people would relocate from

45:10.908 --> 45:14.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
different part of the country's
to take
advantage of this hyperactivity
and his

45:14.545 --> 45:16.047 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
high wages

45:16.080 --> 45:19.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this would benefit those who
move
because they would have better
paying

45:19.817 --> 45:21.419 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
jobs

45:21.452 --> 45:24.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it would also benefit those who
stay
behind because it will be more
available

45:24.322 --> 45:28.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
judge in those communities than
there is
now but as it stands

45:28.159 --> 45:31.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's not happening and even
the most
highly educated workers in
cities like

45:31.562 --> 45:35.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
San Francisco are concerned
about the
roof over their heads

45:35.166 --> 45:37.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have a one-bedroom apartment
you know
if you wanna have a family or
something

45:37.568 --> 45:41.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that that's kind of limiting
kyle Hugh
is a highly paid software
engineer who

45:41.238 --> 45:45.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feel stuck in his small rent
regulated
apartment is simply to rent my
current

45:45.443 --> 45:50.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
place would cost so much more
money now
that trading up to a better
place seems

45:50.648 --> 45:52.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you know even more even more
daunting

45:52.416 --> 45:56.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everybody talks for Lee about
the
techies ah the techies are also
living

45:56.787 --> 46:00.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with roommates or in converted
living
rooms

46:00.291 --> 46:04.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ah yeah it's it's kind of
ridiculous
even the people who you want to
hate who

46:04.328 --> 46:08.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are making hundreds of thousands
of
dollars are struggling to find
housing

46:08.165 --> 46:10.101 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the city it's a real crisis

46:10.134 --> 46:14.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so Carl you we can trade up
Brian
handling may be pushed out

46:14.271 --> 46:17.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's a real chance that i
would just
leave the bay area and millions
of

46:17.541 --> 46:21.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
American workers may be taking a
five-thousand-dollar hit

46:21.112 --> 46:24.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're not even aware of in San
Francisco

46:24.115 --> 46:27.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
duarte geraldi know for the PBS
news

46:28.653 --> 46:31.622 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
yeah

46:36.327 --> 46:42.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and now to another in our brief
but
spectacular series where we ask

46:42.233 --> 46:46.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interesting people to describe
their
passions oj simpson has been the
subject

46:46.337 --> 46:51.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of several TV and theatrical
programs
this year including an ESPN
documentary

46:51.642 --> 46:55.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and FX channel series and a play

46:55.446 --> 46:59.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
watching oj by writer David
McMillan
here

46:59.517 --> 47:04.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he explains why the 20 year old
verdict
still matters today and a
warning

47:04.955 --> 47:09.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it contains some explicit
language I
remember the oj simpson trial
very

47:10.027 --> 47:13.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vividly i'll never forget the
day that
the verdict was announced
because I was

47:13.497 --> 47:17.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hanging out with my friend a
white guy
Chris Brown we saw these two
black

47:17.601 --> 47:22.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
friends of ours who are
celebrating and
Chris was like how can you guys
be happy

47:22.406 --> 47:26.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that oj was acquitted and one of
the
black girls said no he didn't
kill that

47:26.177 --> 47:27.812 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
white

47:27.845 --> 47:30.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will never forget that and it
was a
moment where he realized he
didn't know

47:30.915 --> 47:34.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the people that he went to
school with

47:34.151 --> 47:44.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I decided to write a play about
not the
trial itself but people watching
the

47:44.161 --> 47:47.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trial and their reactions to it
unfortunately the play has
become even

47:48.032 --> 47:53.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more timely in the last couple
of years
it speaks to where we are in our
present

47:53.838 --> 47:55.372 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
moment

47:55.406 --> 48:00.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
race is a topic that is getting
a lot of
attention these days but at the
same

48:00.044 --> 48:04.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time people are afraid to start
that
conversation and how to start
their

48:04.949 --> 48:09.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conversation the watching oj
takes place
on the day that the oj simpson
verdict

48:09.820 --> 48:13.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was announced that when these
types of
moments happen suddenly you
realize

48:13.457 --> 48:17.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
maybe I don't know my coworker
or my
friend as as well as I thought I
did

48:18.028 --> 48:21.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I tried to capture as many
different
points of view as I could and
one saying

48:21.932 --> 48:26.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you have two characters Jamal
and
allison one black one white one
is from

48:26.570 --> 48:28.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
brentwood one from the hood

48:28.506 --> 48:32.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they can't possibly believe that
the
other person thinks what they
think

48:32.443 --> 48:36.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
please tell me you think he's
guilty why
does my opinion matter

48:37.848 --> 48:42.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I suppose doesn't on the grand
scheme
but it's a good litmus test for
what

48:42.052 --> 48:45.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to determine whether or not
you're a
sane rational human being

48:45.856 --> 48:50.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
another character derek has
asian
american shares his perspective
on the

48:50.161 --> 48:54.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trial based on his parents who
are
Korean American and how they
were

48:54.265 --> 48:56.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
affected by the LA riots

48:56.066 --> 49:00.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
part of me wants them to get
acquitted
because i want to see a repeat
what

49:00.171 --> 49:04.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happened here three years ago
and
sparing my parents the heartache
of

49:04.208 --> 49:08.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seeing their store destroyed
again means
letting a guilty man go free

49:08.813 --> 49:15.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm willing to live with that
for a lot
of African Americans they saw
the trial

49:15.452 --> 49:21.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not as an indictment of OJ
Simpson but
really as an indictment of the
LAPD one

49:21.225 --> 49:25.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the other characters in the
play Kim
has two sons one who's in school
and the

49:25.563 --> 49:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other who's in prison and she's
looking
at this trial not caring whether
or not

49:30.034 --> 49:33.404 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
oj did it she just wants a win

49:33.437 --> 49:40.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that would just be a win for him
that'd
be a win for all of us for all
the black

49:40.611 --> 49:42.246 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
men

49:42.279 --> 49:46.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's been railroaded by the
system and
for all their mothers who had to
stand

49:46.617 --> 49:49.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by and watch for once

49:49.253 --> 49:52.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we'll finally get a taste of
what
justice feels like

49:52.323 --> 49:57.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and for once we could finally
say yes
god damn it we got one you
mother

49:57.962 --> 50:10.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
yeah we got one race is
something that
we will always have to deal with
as a

50:10.741 --> 50:13.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country our country was founded
on

50:15.145 --> 50:20.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
de jure segregation and racism
and
slavery and so those issues are
part of

50:20.351 --> 50:24.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fabric whether we like it or
not and
i thought the verdict and what
it

50:24.088 --> 50:28.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
brought out in people not again
not the
trial itself but what it brought
out in

50:28.359 --> 50:29.960 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people

50:29.994 --> 50:33.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was it was a moment a moment
where
America got to see itself
reflected back

50:33.631 --> 50:38.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to itself we see the country
that we are
as opposed the country that we
think we

50:38.135 --> 50:39.770 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are

50:39.803 --> 50:43.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
