JUDY WOODRUFF: Reaction to
the president's announcement
yesterday that the U.S. will

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
withdraw from the Paris
climate agreement has been
unusually fierce on both sides.

00:10.433 --> 00:13.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, today, the White House
stood firmly by his decision.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of
the United States: Thank
you very much, everybody.

00:15.966 --> 00:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is slightly less
controversial than yesterday,
but yesterday was a big
service to this country,

00:21.800 --> 00:22.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I will tell you.

00:22.800 --> 00:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you very much, everybody.

00:24.900 --> 00:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That was all
the president would say about
his much-awaited announcement.

00:31.833 --> 00:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Earlier in the day, however,
the head of the Environmental
Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt,

00:36.600 --> 00:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
delivered an energetic defense.

00:38.700 --> 00:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT PRUITT, Environmental
Protection Agency Administrator:
We have nothing to be apologetic

00:40.666 --> 00:42.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about as a country.

00:42.466 --> 00:47.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We have reduced our
CO2 footprint to levels
of the early 1990s.

00:47.100 --> 00:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's been largely
accomplished through innovation
and technology, not government

00:51.500 --> 00:53.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mandate.

00:53.566 --> 00:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nevertheless,
the announcement has touched off
a chorus of protest both here

00:58.266 --> 01:00.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the U.S. and abroad.

01:00.400 --> 01:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
From Berlin, German
Chancellor Angela Merkel:

01:02.933 --> 01:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGELA MERKEL, German Chancellor
(through translator): The
decision of the U.S. to withdraw

01:06.566 --> 01:11.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the Paris climate
agreement is very regrettable,
and I'm expressing
myself in a very reserved

01:12.333 --> 01:14.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
way when I say that.

01:14.433 --> 01:18.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We in Germany, in Europe and
in the world are now more
determined than ever to pool

01:18.666 --> 01:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all our strength to face one
of the challenges of humankind.

01:21.666 --> 01:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Paris,
France's newly elected
President Emmanuel Macron
offered this appeal

01:28.400 --> 01:30.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reinforced by
speaking in English.

01:30.900 --> 01:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMANUEL MACRON, French
President: To all
scientists, engineers,
entrepreneurs, responsible

01:37.233 --> 01:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
citizens who were disappointed
by the decision of the president
of the United States, I want

01:42.000 --> 01:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to say that they will find
in France a second homeland.

01:46.733 --> 01:51.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I call on them, come
and work here with us.

01:54.800 --> 01:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Both leaders said
they wouldn't renegotiate the
deal, as President Trump said

02:00.600 --> 02:02.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he was prepared to do.

02:02.666 --> 02:06.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, in Brussels,
officials from China,
the world's largest
emitter of greenhouse

02:08.233 --> 02:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gases, met with European
counterparts and reaffirmed
their commitment.

02:13.433 --> 02:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Support also poured in from
the U.S. corporate world.

02:15.833 --> 02:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than two dozen
companies, including
oil giant Shell, Apple,
Facebook and Morgan Stanley,

02:23.066 --> 02:26.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had signed a letter urging
Mr. Trump to stay in the pact.

02:26.966 --> 02:31.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Separately, General Electric
CEO Jeff Immelt and Tesla
chief Elon Musk argued the move

02:33.833 --> 02:36.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
would cost the U.S. jobs.

02:36.466 --> 02:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Disney's chief, Bob Iger,
joined Musk in resigning
from presidential advisory
committees in protest.

02:43.633 --> 02:48.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Peabody Energy,one of
the country's largest
coal companies, did
come out in support of

02:49.533 --> 02:51.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the president's decision.

02:51.566 --> 02:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Russia's President Vladimir
Putin said continued dialogue
was necessary at an event

02:57.533 --> 03:00.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
moderated by NBC News
anchor Megyn Kelly.

03:00.100 --> 03:03.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through
translator): Rather
than make noise over it,

03:03.633 --> 03:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we need to create conditions
for mutual work, because if
countries that are big emitters,

03:10.600 --> 03:13.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like the United States, will
not take part at all, it will
be impossible to negotiate

03:14.833 --> 03:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and sign any kind of agreement.

03:16.833 --> 03:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back at the White
House, the EPA's Pruitt said
the president has made clear

03:22.533 --> 03:24.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's willing to work with
anyone on a better deal.

03:24.966 --> 03:29.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when pressed on whether Mr.
Trump actually believes that
humans play a role in climate

03:31.033 --> 03:33.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
change, Pruitt
skirted the question.

03:33.100 --> 03:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT PRUITT: The discussions
the president and I have had
over the last several weeks

03:35.933 --> 03:40.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
have been focused on one
key issue: Is Paris good
or bad for this country?

03:40.466 --> 03:42.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He determined it was
bad for our country.

03:42.700 --> 03:43.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It hurt us economically.

03:43.933 --> 03:45.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It didn't achieve good
environmental outcomes.

03:45.733 --> 03:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he made the decision
to reject the Paris deal.

03:48.333 --> 03:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, oil
prices tumbled amid speculation
the U.S. withdrawal would

03:55.166 --> 03:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
boost domestic oil production,
adding to an already
saturated global supply.

04:00.766 --> 04:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will put some of the facts
and claims behind climate change
into context right after the

04:05.533 --> 04:06.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
news summary.
