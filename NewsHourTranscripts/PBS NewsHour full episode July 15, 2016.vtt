JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.340 --> 00:11.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
startling news
from Turkey -- gunfire and
low-flying jets

00:12.012 --> 00:17.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in nation's capital, as an
attempted military
coup unfolds.

00:17.317 --> 00:22.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And celebration becomes
nightmare. We get
the latest from Southern France,
where at

00:22.222 --> 00:29.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
least 84 are dead and hundreds
injured after
a massacre by one man in a
truck.

00:29.196 --> 00:35.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus: Donald Trump confirms
Indiana's Mike
Pence as his vice presidential
choice. A look

00:35.035 --> 00:39.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the Midwestern governor, and
what he brings
to the Republican ticket.

00:39.940 --> 00:45.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's Friday. Mark Shields
and David Brooks
analyze another full week of
news.

00:45.345 --> 00:51.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:51.251 --> 00:53.253 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:53.287 --> 01:05.599 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There are
shocking events in
Turkey tonight: The military
says that it

01:05.632 --> 01:13.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has carried out a coup in the
name of democracy,
to counter autocratic rule and
growing terrorism

01:13.240 --> 01:16.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in that NATO member state.

01:16.510 --> 01:23.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Helicopters, warplanes and
troops have spread
across the capital, Ankara, and
Istanbul to

01:23.250 --> 01:33.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
take control. President
Erdogan's whereabouts
are unclear, but he's told CNN's
Turkish branch

01:33.293 --> 01:43.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
take control. President
Erdogan's whereabouts
are unclear, but he's told CNN's
Turkish branch

01:43.603 --> 01:51.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that the coup will be put down.

01:51.445 --> 01:56.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama is being updated
on the situation
as it unfolds, according to the
National Security

01:56.116 --> 01:57.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Council spokesperson.

01:57.918 --> 01:58.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm joined now by Steven Cook.
He's a senior
fellow at the Council on Foreign
Relations

01:58.919 --> 02:00.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
here in Washington. And he joins
me via Skype.

02:00.988 --> 02:03.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Steven Cook, can you add
anything from your
sources about what's happening
there?

02:03.690 --> 02:07.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVEN COOK, Council on Foreign
Relations:
Well, Judy, thanks very much.

02:07.561 --> 02:14.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been on the phone and
texting and e-mailing
with my contacts in Istanbul and
Ankara, and

02:14.134 --> 02:19.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are bewildered as anybody
else. In fact,
we probably know more about
what's going on

02:19.072 --> 02:23.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Ankara and Istanbul than most
of those
people, many of whom are at
home, have been

02:23.777 --> 02:28.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unable to access the Internet,
have been unable
to get news because there's been
largely a

02:28.548 --> 02:30.317 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
news blackout.

02:30.350 --> 02:36.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: If the military
is able to
pull this off or even get as far
as they have,

02:36.523 --> 02:41.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what would be behind it? What is
the tension
underlying this clearly serious
divide between

02:41.461 --> 02:43.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Erdogan and the
military?

02:43.230 --> 02:48.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN COOK: Well, first of all,
we have to
be very careful in talking about
the military

02:48.201 --> 02:54.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
or a faction within the
military, which is
something that is not
unprecedented in Turkish

02:54.307 --> 02:56.143 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
history.

02:56.176 --> 03:00.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are a number of
tensions between
the government and military
officers, including

03:00.180 --> 03:04.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what the military, or some
within the military,
I should say, believe to be
adventurism in

03:04.951 --> 03:08.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syria, failure of the government
to protect
Turkish citizens.

03:08.188 --> 03:12.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw a horrific terrorist
attack in the
Istanbul Airport last week after
a string

03:12.692 --> 03:16.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of terrorist attacks over the
course of last
year, and, of course, Erdogan's
drive to consolidate

03:16.530 --> 03:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his power. The Turkish military
has long been
the locus of authority and
legitimacy in the

03:19.666 --> 03:21.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Turkish political system.

03:21.501 --> 03:23.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Erdogan has sought to supplant
them over the
course of the last 13 or so
years. It may

03:23.437 --> 03:27.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in fact be time that younger
officers or a
faction within one of the
services decides

03:27.507 --> 03:29.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they have had enough.

03:29.342 --> 03:34.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we know
that Turkey plays
an enormously strategic role in
the Middle

03:34.581 --> 03:40.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
East, in that part of the world.
What would
it mean if there were a change
in who's in

03:40.587 --> 03:42.422 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
power there?

03:42.456 --> 03:50.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN COOK: Well, there is all
kinds of implications
about a change in power. None of
them are

03:50.197 --> 03:55.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very clear at the moment, but
just think about
Turkey's geography. It literally
sits at the

03:55.569 --> 04:01.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
center of some of the most
important pressing
foreign policy concerns,
including the conflicts

04:01.475 --> 04:06.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Syria, the conflicts in Iraq,
the generalized
instability in the region,
whereas Turkey

04:06.646 --> 04:11.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who was once seen as a
stabilizing force in
the Middle East and does still
play an important

04:11.885 --> 04:15.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
role in the Syrian conflict in
Iraq with the
Kurds.

04:15.889 --> 04:20.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is now clearly an unstable
country.

04:20.227 --> 04:25.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Steven Cook, how
popular is
President Erdogan in that
country?

04:25.098 --> 04:28.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
STEVEN COOK: This is an
extraordinarily important
point, Judy.

04:28.902 --> 04:34.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is quite popular, and he has
made a call
for his supporters to go out in
the streets

04:34.374 --> 04:39.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and to resist this intervention
on the part
of the military. It's
extraordinarily dangerous,

04:39.045 --> 04:43.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but what we often miss or what's
often missed
in the discussion of Turkey is
that there

04:43.650 --> 04:48.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is been so much focus on Erdogan
and his personality
and his drive to consolidate
power that at

04:48.555 --> 04:51.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
least half of the country
supports Erdogan.

04:51.558 --> 04:55.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you have to imagine that at
least some
of those who are not supporters
of Erdogan

04:55.929 --> 04:58.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do not want to see a return to
military rule
in Turkey.

04:58.598 --> 05:02.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But just quickly,
we know that
increasingly in recent months he
has cracked

05:03.003 --> 05:09.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down on the news media, on
social media. He's
made some significant changes
there, has he

05:09.242 --> 05:11.011 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
not?

05:11.044 --> 05:13.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN COOK: He has made many
significant
changes. Turkey, which was once
a promising

05:13.780 --> 05:20.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country, one that everybody
hoped would make
a transition to democracy, has
made a U-turn

05:20.954 --> 05:29.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it looks more like an
authoritarian system,
rather than a democratic system
now.

05:30.030 --> 05:37.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Steven Cook with
the Council
-- now I'm told that we have
another minute

05:37.204 --> 05:44.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or two. We were waiting to get
to a reporter
on the ground in Turkey.

05:44.277 --> 05:52.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While we wait for that, so, as
we sit and
think about what the
implications would be

05:52.919 --> 05:59.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if there were a change in
leadership, we're
really looking at a complete
unknown. This

05:59.426 --> 06:03.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really does come out of the
blue, does it
not?

06:03.863 --> 06:05.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STEVEN COOK: It does.

06:05.699 --> 06:13.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were some indications from
some analysts
who have been suggesting that
possibly the

06:13.773 --> 06:21.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
military would make a move.
However, it seems
completely out of the blue, and
it's not at

06:21.948 --> 06:28.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all clear what this group of
officers who
are attempting to take power
actually stand

06:28.622 --> 06:36.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for. They have released a
statement saying
that they are reestablishing
rule of law in

06:36.730 --> 06:46.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the country, but that is kind of
standard
fare after coups d'etat for the
military acting

06:46.539 --> 06:51.544 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to make that kind of statement.

06:51.578 --> 06:57.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are completely in the unknown
as of this
moment. Perhaps in the coming
hours, things

06:57.684 --> 07:03.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will be clearer. But what I
think should be
for looking is how Erdogan and
his supporters

07:03.356 --> 07:07.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
response. Already, over social
media, you
can see Erdogan's supporters
swarming tanks

07:07.294 --> 07:09.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that are in the streets in
Istanbul and other
places.

07:09.863 --> 07:15.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So this is by no means a done
deal for those
who are attempting to take power
right now.

07:15.235 --> 07:19.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Swarming tanks.
So it could
be the public will have its say
in all of

07:19.339 --> 07:21.141 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this as well.

07:21.174 --> 07:26.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN COOK: At least Erdogan
supporters.
Like I just said, he has called
upon his people

07:26.546 --> 07:31.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to come out into the streets. We
will have
to see how big those protests
become.

07:31.751 --> 07:36.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that means he
still must
have some control of
communications if he's

07:36.690 --> 07:38.725 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
able to get that word out.

07:38.758 --> 07:44.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN COOK: Well, he has gotten
that word
out reportedly via FaceTime with
CNN's Turkish

07:44.331 --> 07:49.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
affiliate, which is -- which
would suggest
that the situation is difficult
for President

07:49.536 --> 07:54.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Erdogan, but he has been able to
make that
statement.

07:54.507 --> 08:01.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The prime minister, Binali
Yildirim, was on
television earlier today calling
for people

08:01.047 --> 08:03.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to come out and resist.

08:03.516 --> 08:12.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Steven Cook with
the Council
on Foreign Relations, we thank
you very much

08:12.625 --> 08:14.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for joining us at the last
minute.

08:14.961 --> 08:22.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now we want to try to get
some perspective
on the ground in this
fast-moving story.

08:22.102 --> 08:30.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for that, we turn to Simone
Dimocon (ph)
of Bloomberg News. She is in
Istanbul.

08:31.010 --> 08:35.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Simone, tell us what you are
seeing and hearing
there right now.

08:35.915 --> 08:39.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our apologies. We thought we did
have a reporter
there in Istanbul.

08:39.386 --> 08:44.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can imagine, given the
situation, communications
are not what they normally are.
We are going

08:44.758 --> 08:50.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to try to continue to reach her.
She is a
reporter for Bloomberg News in
Istanbul, and

08:50.830 --> 08:52.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we will continue to try to reach
her.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meantime, two other major news
stories also
dominated this day.

08:54.768 --> 09:00.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, the aftermath of last
night's attack
in Southern France. More than 80
people died

09:00.306 --> 09:06.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Nice, and more than 200 were
hurt, when
a large truck rode down
revelers; 24 hours

09:06.846 --> 09:11.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
later, there was no claim of
responsibility,
and more questions than answers.

09:11.684 --> 09:13.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Special correspondent Jane
Ferguson reports.

09:13.953 --> 09:19.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: The crime scene,
along the
city's waterfront, was eerily
quiet today,

09:19.592 --> 09:25.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as investigators and forensics
teams searched
for evidence. Covered bodies
still dotted

09:25.432 --> 09:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the palm-tree-lined boulevard.

09:27.133 --> 09:32.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Through the day, onlookers
visited the site,
many still in shock.

09:32.472 --> 09:35.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I don't feel safe. I
don't feel safe
for me. I don't feel safe for my
family, not

09:35.208 --> 09:38.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for my children. I do not feel
safe.

09:38.178 --> 09:44.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Police have now
identified
the attacker as 31-year-old
Mohamed Bouhlel,

09:44.484 --> 09:47.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a Tunisian man who lived in
Nice.

09:47.921 --> 09:54.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, he plowed a large
white truck
into crowds of revelers. This
promenade along

09:54.861 --> 10:00.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the shorefront in Nice was
packed with people
who had come to celebrate
Bastille Day. In

10:00.433 --> 10:04.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
France, that's essentially their
version of
July 4. And so there are
fireworks here, and

10:05.004 --> 10:09.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many brought their families to
enjoy them.
And, tragically, that's why so
many children

10:09.943 --> 10:11.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
were amongst the casualties.

10:11.978 --> 10:17.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The celebrating turned to bloody
chaos, when
the truck hurtled down the
popular Promenade

10:17.383 --> 10:24.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
des Anglais along the
Mediterranean coastline
for a full mile-and-a-half.
Officials estimated

10:24.424 --> 10:31.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some 30,000 people, including
many tourists,
were gathered there, and the
driver zigzagged

10:31.064 --> 10:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to run down as many as possible.

10:33.399 --> 10:37.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): It
was horrible.
At the beginning, we didn't
understand what

10:37.670 --> 10:42.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was going on. We saw the truck
and, suddenly,
life came to a halt. Then we saw
the people

10:42.075 --> 10:44.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
panicking and running towards
the alleys,
and we followed them.

10:44.711 --> 10:49.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANCOIS, France: Everybody was
running. Some
people were on the phone. Most
of the people

10:49.849 --> 10:56.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were on the phone, calling their
friends,
where are you? I have lost you.
Some -- some

10:56.823 --> 11:01.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mothers with their children,
they were looking
for their children, and losing
their shoes

11:01.394 --> 11:04.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and running, running just
escaping. And it
was really scary.

11:04.597 --> 11:11.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: The carnage ended
only when
police killed Bouhlel in a hail
of gunfire,

11:11.037 --> 11:16.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaving the truck's windshield
riddled with
bullets. It also left
investigators to puzzle

11:16.075 --> 11:21.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out what drove a man who had no
immediately
apparent links to extremists to
do this.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRANCOIS MOLINS, Paris
Prosecutor (through
translator): The investigation
will indeed

11:24.617 --> 11:29.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aim to determine, firstly, how
the attacker
was able to get the weapon and
truck he used

11:29.055 --> 11:33.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for his crimes. It will also try
to determine
whether he benefited from
accomplices and

11:34.027 --> 11:37.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
had ties to an Islamist
terrorist organization.

11:37.263 --> 11:42.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This type of action fits in
perfectly with
the constant calls for murder
from such terrorist

11:42.168 --> 11:43.670 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
organizations.

11:43.703 --> 11:47.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: This afternoon,
the truck was
hauled away from the scene.

11:47.640 --> 11:52.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Elsewhere in Nice, President
Francois Hollande
met with police and military
authorities,

11:52.545 --> 11:57.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and he ran into catcalls on the
way there,
after the third mass casualty
attack since

11:57.717 --> 11:59.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
January of last year.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANCOIS HOLLANDE, French
President (through
translator): The lesson that we
must also

12:01.921 --> 12:06.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
learn from this tragedy, from
this terrorist
attack, is that we are facing a
long battle.

12:06.759 --> 12:11.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have an enemy that will
continue to attack
all the people, all the
countries who possess

12:11.130 --> 12:13.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
freedom as an essential value.

12:13.132 --> 12:18.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Hollande has
called up military
and police reservists, and is
moving to extend

12:18.972 --> 12:24.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a state of emergency for three
more months.
It was put in place after last
November's

12:24.677 --> 12:31.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Islamic State attacks across
Paris killed
130 people and wounded hundreds
more.

12:31.818 --> 12:37.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Condolences also poured in from
other capitals.
In Washington, President Obama
reflected on

12:37.457 --> 12:39.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the tragedy, as he hosted a
diplomatic reception.

12:40.026 --> 12:44.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
We pledge to stand with our
French friends

12:44.063 --> 12:51.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as we defend our nations against
this scourge
of terrorism and violence. And
this is a threat

12:51.771 --> 12:58.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to all of us. We don't know all
the details,
but what we know is the capacity
of even a

12:58.711 --> 13:06.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
single individual to do
extraordinary harm
to our people, to our way of
life.

13:06.452 --> 13:11.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: And, around the
world, people
paid respect to the victims by
leaving flowers

13:11.457 --> 13:13.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at French embassies.

13:13.292 --> 13:17.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And here in France, the
government has declared
three days of national mourning,
beginning

13:18.031 --> 13:23.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tomorrow, as investigators
search for answers
in a shaken country -- Judy.

13:23.736 --> 13:30.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jane, we are
seeing the grief
and the shock on the part of the
French people.

13:30.076 --> 13:32.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How is this affecting the
politics of the
country?

13:32.378 --> 13:37.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Well, we have
already seen
today, Judy, far-right leaders
jumping on

13:37.784 --> 13:41.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the issue as a way to promote an
anti-immigration
stance.

13:41.220 --> 13:47.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen the leader of the
National Front
Party, Marine Le Pen, say there
should be

13:47.994 --> 13:52.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a war declared on radical Islam.
Now, it's
not clear yet on whether or not
this attack

13:52.832 --> 13:58.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was linked to radical Islam. No
group like
ISIS or al-Qaida have claimed
responsibility,

13:58.838 --> 14:04.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but it has reignited the debate
in France
about immigration because the
attacker was

14:04.510 --> 14:06.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Tunisian descent.

14:06.312 --> 14:10.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, here, where attack took
place, people
have been coming down to pay
their respects

14:10.616 --> 14:14.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today. You may see behind me
where some flowers
have been placed. People have
been lighting

14:14.754 --> 14:20.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candles and leaving mementos
here. And they
have been having lively debates
about that

14:20.226 --> 14:25.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very subject, some saying that
the government
here needs to take a stronger
stance against

14:25.798 --> 14:32.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immigration, but others here
also saying that
this is not the time for such
divisions and

14:32.038 --> 14:36.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, in fact, this violence
shouldn't be
responded to violently and that
France itself

14:36.909 --> 14:38.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
should pull together.

14:38.711 --> 14:43.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, again, we're seeing after
such an attack
as we have seen in the past in
Europe and

14:43.316 --> 14:48.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America, where large numbers of
civilians
have been targeted, there is
afterwards a

14:48.421 --> 14:55.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lively and sometimes very
divisive debate
about immigration, and France is
no different.

14:55.128 --> 15:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jane Ferguson
reporting for
us from Nice, France, the site
of last night's

15:00.700 --> 15:01.968 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
terrible attack.

15:02.001 --> 15:04.070 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you, Jane.

15:04.103 --> 15:07.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And we turn now to Hari
Sreenivasan in New
York now for more.

15:07.406 --> 15:11.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: With me now is
the French
ambassador to the United States,
Gerard Araud.

15:11.477 --> 15:14.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ambassador, our condolences to
you on this
day.

15:14.480 --> 15:19.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
First question: Has the
government found a
connection between the actions
of this man,

15:19.352 --> 15:20.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whether he was radicalized by
ISIS?

15:20.820 --> 15:23.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GERARD ARAUD, French Ambassador
to the United
States: No.

15:23.055 --> 15:29.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So far, while the investigation
is going on,
but we have -- he wasn't on the
list of radicalized

15:29.862 --> 15:38.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people that we are monitoring.
And we are
now investigating his life, and
all the testimonies

15:38.070 --> 15:46.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we have show that the guy
wasn't religious,
you know, really. So, let's wait
the result

15:46.112 --> 15:52.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of what was found in his
computer. So maybe
there is here we find a link
with ISIL. But,

15:52.418 --> 15:54.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
so far, there is none.

15:54.720 --> 15:58.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What does the
French government
do to prevent something like
this? What more

15:58.291 --> 16:00.026 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can be done?

16:00.059 --> 16:06.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERARD ARAUD: You know, the
problem is that
you have two types of terrorism
today, one

16:06.766 --> 16:10.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's the people coming back
from Syria where
they have been trained,
radicalized, and in

16:10.970 --> 16:16.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a sense it's a question of
intelligence, to
follow them, to see what they
are doing, trying

16:17.009 --> 16:20.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to prevent them to come back and
to strike.

16:20.680 --> 16:27.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the second type of
terrorism, you have
the individuals. And that's --
it's much more

16:27.420 --> 16:34.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
complicated, because
individuals, which have
absolutely no record of
association with radicalized

16:34.160 --> 16:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- radical Islam could suddenly
do what they
are doing, like what he has done
today, and

16:41.234 --> 16:45.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's -- for intelligence, for
the security,
it's quite tough.

16:45.605 --> 16:49.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You had an
increased state
of emergency already since the
previous attacks.

16:49.675 --> 16:55.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It didn't work. How would adding
more police
or military forces to the
streets stop an

16:55.548 --> 16:56.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
individual with a truck?

16:56.949 --> 16:58.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GERARD ARAUD: That's a very good
question.

16:58.818 --> 17:08.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, in a sense, you have
had with Orlando
exactly the same challenge. So,
it means that

17:08.361 --> 17:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not only do we have to provide
more security
to our citizens, with police,
but also the

17:14.133 --> 17:19.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
army in the streets, but it also
means also
that we have to solve, and to
put an end to

17:19.105 --> 17:26.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Syrian civil war, which is
really the
origin of all this violent
propaganda.

17:26.479 --> 17:31.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How does the
French government
try to integrate its newcomers
any better,

17:31.884 --> 17:35.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because there have been concerns
that there
are pockets within France, they
are keeping

17:35.554 --> 17:41.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to themselves, they aren't
understanding perhaps
a greater loyalty to the idea of
being French?

17:41.327 --> 17:45.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERARD ARAUD: Well, frankly,
when you look
at the integration of Muslims in
Europe, I

17:45.831 --> 17:50.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't think that the situation
in France is
worse or even better -- or
better than the

17:50.636 --> 17:52.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
other European countries.

17:52.538 --> 18:00.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we have -- like in this
very country
in the U.S., we have
disenfranchised immigrants.

18:00.680 --> 18:05.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's not because you are
disenfranchised
that you are going to commit
these atrocities.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is something else.

18:07.553 --> 18:11.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But France has
also sent
a very large number. More than
100 people

18:11.123 --> 18:15.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have signed up from France,
French citizens,
to go fight this in Iraq or in
Syria.

18:15.962 --> 18:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERARD ARAUD: Oh, you have --
actually, we
have identified 2,000 French
citizens who

18:20.900 --> 18:23.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have gone to Syria and Iraq,
2,000.

18:23.703 --> 18:29.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the figure for the
Americans is 200,
because of the geography, of
course. So, these

18:30.009 --> 18:36.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people, again, they will come
back and they
will come back with military
training, radicalized,

18:36.148 --> 18:40.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rapidly anti-Semitism, and there
will be a
threat.

18:40.119 --> 18:45.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we are doing our best to
intercept them
before they enter our territory,
to arrest

18:45.691 --> 18:51.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them, to indict them, to prevent
them from
striking. But you saw that with
the attack

18:51.364 --> 18:57.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in November in the Bataclan.
There are some
of them we have not identified.
So, the threat

18:57.737 --> 18:59.505 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is still there.

18:59.538 --> 19:02.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Ambassador,
while I have
you here, you have been hearing
the reports

19:02.742 --> 19:07.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today, as we have been watching
on television,
in Turkey. There are tanks on
the street.

19:07.413 --> 19:12.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president of the country is
in an unknown
location. He's using FaceTime to
try and communicate

19:12.151 --> 19:14.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with his people and tell people
to go out
to the streets.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.689 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Your thoughts?

19:16.722 --> 19:21.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERARD ARAUD: Well, first, I
think our answer
is to express our commitment to
the defense

19:22.028 --> 19:24.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the constitutional order in
Turkey.

19:24.263 --> 19:29.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, really, the Turkish
government,
the Turkish president has been
elected by

19:29.535 --> 19:35.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the Turks through a
constitutional process.
So we can simply express our
hope that this

19:35.641 --> 19:41.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
constitutional order which will
be upheld,
and secondly, of course, to hope
that there

19:41.414 --> 19:43.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are no civilian casualties.

19:43.549 --> 19:48.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The sort of
correlation
or connection here is how
important it is

19:48.687 --> 19:54.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for France to be fighting ISIS
right now.
And how important is the
stability of Turkey

19:54.260 --> 19:54.994 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in that fight?

19:55.027 --> 19:56.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GERARD ARAUD: Of course.

19:56.762 --> 20:02.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Really, Turkey has -- really, at
the same
time, has suffered a lot because
of the Syrian

20:02.535 --> 20:09.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
civil war. Millions of
immigrants have gone
to -- the refugees have gone to
Turkey. The

20:09.975 --> 20:16.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
borders have been destabilized,
so really
Turkey is carrying really a real
burden.

20:16.248 --> 20:21.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Turkey, by definition,
considering its
geography, has a role to play
into solving

20:21.620 --> 20:23.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Syrian civil war.

20:23.456 --> 20:26.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And what about
the political
pushback that you're likely
getting right

20:26.759 --> 20:31.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now? We have heard already that
the far right
and Marine Le Pen is calling for
tighter immigration

20:31.097 --> 20:36.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
controls and calling out a war
on radical
Islam.

20:36.068 --> 20:39.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this something that the
government is willing
to consider, given the tragedies
that you

20:39.205 --> 20:41.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have been experiencing in the
past six months?

20:41.107 --> 20:44.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERARD ARAUD: No, what is
striking, when you
look at political life in
Western democracies,

20:44.610 --> 20:50.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the U.S. to Scandinavia, is
that we're
facing the same outbreak of
(INAUDIBLE) in

20:50.816 --> 20:56.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.S., in Britain with
Brexit, in France
with the National Front, in
Scandinavia, and

20:56.489 --> 21:01.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the same outburst against
immigration.

21:01.060 --> 21:06.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's obvious that, when you
see these
sort of attacks that we have had
in Nice,

21:06.866 --> 21:14.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's -- in a sense, it's a spur
for opportunism.
We will have presidential
elections in May

21:14.073 --> 21:19.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
2017, so we will see what is the
consequence
of the situation.

21:19.078 --> 21:23.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
French Ambassador
to the United States Gerard
Araud, thanks

21:23.149 --> 21:25.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
so much for your time.

21:25.718 --> 21:32.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GERARD ARAUD: Thank you very
much.

21:32.591 --> 21:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The day also
brought major
news in the presidential
campaign:

21:40.766 --> 21:45.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Republican Donald Trump
confirmed that Indiana
Governor Mike Pence will be his
running mate.

21:45.938 --> 21:50.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump tweeted his decision, but
he delayed
a formal appearance, citing the
attack in

21:50.943 --> 21:51.744 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Nice.

21:51.777 --> 21:53.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage:

21:53.879 --> 22:00.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The Indiana governor
arrived at
Trump Tower this afternoon,
ready to go.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. MIKE PENCE (R), Indiana:
I'm looking
forward to meeting with the
Trumps and talking

22:02.655 --> 22:07.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about our plans for tomorrow and
every day
between now and Election Day.

22:07.993 --> 22:13.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: At first, they seemed
unlikely
allies, Donald Trump, the brash
outsider from

22:13.499 --> 22:19.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New York, who's never held
public office,
and Mike Pence, staunch
Midwestern conservative,

22:19.538 --> 22:23.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with a long career in politics
and deep ties
to the Republican establishment.

22:23.842 --> 22:27.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. MIKE PENCE: I'm not against
anybody,
but I will be voting for Ted
Cruz.

22:27.513 --> 22:33.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Less than three
months ago, Pence
endorsed Trump's opponent in the
Indiana primary.

22:33.252 --> 22:38.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump won that contest. Cruz
dropped out.
And Pence threw his support
behind the billionaire.

22:38.390 --> 22:44.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. MIKE PENCE: We're ready to
put a fighter,
a builder and a patriot in the
Oval Office

22:44.830 --> 22:50.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the United States of America.
We're ready
for Donald Trump to be our next
president.

22:50.703 --> 22:55.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Still, differences
remain. Pence
is a longtime advocate of trade
deals like

22:55.574 --> 23:01.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NAFTA. Trump has made opposition
to such agreements
a centerpiece of his campaign.
Trump has called

23:01.313 --> 23:07.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the 2003 Iraq invasion a
mistake. Pence was
a vocal supporter. And Pence
came out against

23:07.720 --> 23:14.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's proposed ban on Muslim
immigration,
calling the idea offensive and
unconstitutional.

23:14.760 --> 23:19.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The 57-year-old Pence served six
terms in
the House and was elected to the
leadership.

23:19.898 --> 23:27.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2012, he won a close race for
governor
of Indiana. Last year, he
triggered an uproar,

23:27.706 --> 23:32.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
signing a bill that could have
let business
owners discriminate against gays
and lesbians

23:32.411 --> 23:34.680 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
based on religious beliefs.

23:34.713 --> 23:41.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After big business in the state
complained,
Pence signed a measure
protecting LGBT customers.

23:41.253 --> 23:45.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His selection for the national
ticket today
drew praise from top
Republicans.

23:45.157 --> 23:47.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REINCE PRIEBUS, Republican
National Committee
Chairman: What I think Mike
Pence brings to

23:47.059 --> 23:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the table is, he's -- I think
he's measured.
I think he's experienced. I
think he, I think,

23:54.867 --> 24:03.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shores up a conservative base
that's important.
I think that he's a
complementary to Donald

24:03.242 --> 24:05.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Trump as far as personality.

24:05.044 --> 24:08.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And in a statement,
House Speaker
Paul Ryan said: "I can think of
no better

24:08.947 --> 24:14.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
choice for our vice presidential
candidate.
He will help bring real change
to Washington."

24:14.586 --> 24:19.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump and Pence will make their
first public
appearance as the newly minted
GOP ticket

24:19.391 --> 24:21.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tomorrow morning in New York.

24:21.193 --> 24:23.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

24:23.662 --> 24:28.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And joining us
now is reporter
who has covered Governor Pence
in the Hoosier

24:29.001 --> 24:34.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State, Brandon Smith. He is
statehouse bureau
chief for Indiana Public
Broadcasting. He

24:34.173 --> 24:35.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
joins us from Indianapolis.

24:35.974 --> 24:38.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Welcome back to the program,
Brandon Smith.

24:38.377 --> 24:43.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, how is Governor Mike Pence
seen in the
state of Indiana by the
Republicans, by the

24:43.982 --> 24:45.818 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people?

24:45.851 --> 24:48.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH, Indiana Public
Broadcasting:
I wouldn't say he's as popular
as the national

24:48.387 --> 24:50.889 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
folks are making him seem.

24:50.923 --> 24:56.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's been somewhat divisive as a
governor.
Certainly, he came in on a
message of continuing

24:56.662 --> 25:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the policies of his predecessor,
Mitch Daniels.
And that has been a lot of his
focus when

25:01.066 --> 25:03.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you talk about his agenda with
the legislature.

25:03.736 --> 25:09.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as was mentioned in that
piece, he has
dealt with a lot of controversy
over the way

25:09.108 --> 25:15.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he has handled certain issue,
like the religious
freedom debate, like this year
the signing

25:15.347 --> 25:22.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a harsh anti-abortion bill
and the way
he's handled that and the
resistance to that.

25:22.421 --> 25:27.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he's sort of been divisive,
because you
look at -- Indiana is a pretty
conservative

25:27.493 --> 25:33.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state, and yet a Republican
governor seeking
reelection was in a virtual tie
with his Democratic

25:33.866 --> 25:35.634 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
opponent.

25:35.667 --> 25:40.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is it about
the way he's
handled these issues, these
controversies

25:40.339 --> 25:45.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's been a question for him?
What's made
it controversial?

25:45.144 --> 25:51.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: A big part of it
is his philosophy,
really, as a politician. When he
was in Congress

25:51.583 --> 25:56.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and coming into his job as
governor here,
he was known as a great
communicator, a good

25:56.155 --> 26:01.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
speechmaker, and certainly
someone who stayed
on message.

26:01.760 --> 26:07.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's fine I Congress. It
didn't work so
well when he got to Indiana as
governor. He

26:07.132 --> 26:10.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would be asked direct questions
by myself
and other reporters, more
importantly direct

26:11.003 --> 26:16.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
follow-up questions asking for
specifics for
legislative proposals he was
pushing or things

26:16.642 --> 26:21.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moving through legislature, for
instance,
that he would need to sign or
not sign, and

26:21.814 --> 26:23.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he simply wouldn't give answers.

26:23.649 --> 26:29.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had his one or two talking
points and he
stuck to those all the time. He
couldn't get

26:29.521 --> 26:33.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- he wouldn't be shaken loose,
even when
arguably he needed to be. That
was seen notably

26:33.992 --> 26:38.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the middle of the religious
freedom controversy.
He went on national television
to be interviewed

26:38.330 --> 26:43.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about it. And when asked direct
questions
about whether or not the bill
discriminated

26:43.469 --> 26:47.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against the LGBT community, he
couldn't answer
the yes-or-no question.

26:47.840 --> 26:51.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's really a big part of
what's hurt
him as he's tried to be
governor.

26:51.910 --> 26:56.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Brandon Smith, we
know Mike
Pence is described as a -- quote
-- "reliable

26:56.215 --> 26:57.950 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
conservative."

26:57.983 --> 27:03.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How conservative is he? Where do
you draw
the lines in his -- where --
what his political

27:03.322 --> 27:05.157 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
views are?

27:05.190 --> 27:10.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: Well, he's pretty
conservative.
Like I mentioned, he signed that
anti-abortion

27:10.229 --> 27:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bill earlier this year that even
a lot of
Republican lawmakers in this
state advocated

27:14.933 --> 27:17.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strongly against, because they
felt it went
too far.

27:18.003 --> 27:23.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's something I don't think
Mike Pence
really balked at all, which
endears him to

27:23.108 --> 27:27.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
particularly social
conservatives, which is
part of the reason I think Trump
picked him.

27:27.579 --> 27:35.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you heard in the piece that
he supported
the Iraq War. He went against
President Bush

27:35.554 --> 27:39.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
during the No Child Left Behind
debate. So
he...

27:39.658 --> 27:45.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, if I could
interrupt,
he disagreed with Donald Trump
on whether

27:45.297 --> 27:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Muslims -- there should be a
Muslim ban in
this country.

27:48.166 --> 27:52.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: That's true,
although he has
tried to establish a policy in
Indiana where

27:52.938 --> 27:58.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Indiana would deny Syrian
refugees from entering
the state. So I'm not sure of
how much a line

27:58.877 --> 28:00.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he really drew there.

28:00.612 --> 28:04.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How -- everybody
is wanting
to know what kind of vice
president would

28:04.650 --> 28:09.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
he be. What about his
decision-making? What
is known about that?

28:09.521 --> 28:13.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: He has a pretty
tight inner
circle. And his wife, Karen,
plays a huge

28:13.292 --> 28:15.160 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
part in that.

28:15.193 --> 28:18.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you them out in public
together holding
hands, that's not a political
show. They really

28:18.530 --> 28:23.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are very close. And she plays a
big role in
his life and his decision-making
and his policy-making,

28:23.635 --> 28:28.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the sense. And his inner
circle here in
Indiana again, as I mentioned,
is pretty tight.

28:28.407 --> 28:30.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of his advisers go back to
his time
as -- Congress.

28:30.976 --> 28:36.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His first chief of staff had
been his chief
of staff during his entire
congressional time.

28:37.015 --> 28:42.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of his key advisers as
governor now, his
communications director, was his
communications

28:43.021 --> 28:47.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
person in Congress. The sense is
that the
circle isn't very wide.

28:48.026 --> 28:53.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There has been a
lot of reporting
today, Brandon, about how --
quote -- "unpredictable"

28:53.332 --> 28:59.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump is. And on the
other hand, Mike
Pence is seen more predictable,
a calmer presence.

28:59.605 --> 29:01.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you see that?

29:01.340 --> 29:04.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: That's absolutely
true. It
goes back to that idea of his
philosophy is,

29:04.710 --> 29:08.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm going to have my one or two
talking points
and I'm going to say those
talking points

29:08.380 --> 29:10.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
no matter what is asked of me.

29:10.349 --> 29:13.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a vice presidential running
mate, that
will probably -- certainly, as a
running mate

29:13.852 --> 29:18.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Donald Trump, that will
probably be very
valuable and certainly appealing
to national

29:18.857 --> 29:22.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Republicans who are
uncomfortable with the
unpredictability of Trump's
campaign.

29:22.761 --> 29:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, we know,
finally, Brandon,
that he -- if he hadn't been
chosen as Donald

29:27.866 --> 29:31.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's running mate, he was
expected to run
for reelection as governor. What
kind of race

29:31.670 --> 29:33.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was he facing there?

29:33.472 --> 29:37.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: A very, very
close one. He
was facing the same person he
ran against

29:37.109 --> 29:41.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for governor in 2012, former
Indiana House
Speaker John Gregg.

29:41.713 --> 29:47.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But while Mike Pence only beat
John Gregg
by 3 percentage points in 2012,
in the polling

29:47.419 --> 29:50.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have seen in this state, in
the limited
polling we have seen in this
state so far,

29:50.989 --> 29:55.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that looked to be virtually the
same, almost
a virtual tie, and some pretty
unfavorable

29:55.560 --> 29:58.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
numbers for a conservative
governor in Mike
Pence.

29:58.730 --> 30:03.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there any
doubt in your
mind that Indiana is going -- we
know it's

30:03.769 --> 30:09.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
traditionally gone Republican
for president.
Any doubt in your mind it's
trending in Donald

30:09.474 --> 30:11.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump's direction in this
election?

30:11.376 --> 30:14.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: Absolutely no
doubt whatsoever.
This state will vote for Donald
Trump. I would

30:14.546 --> 30:16.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be shocked if it were even
close.

30:16.381 --> 30:20.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
Brandon Smith with
Indiana Public Broadcasting,
thank you very

30:20.552 --> 30:21.353 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

30:21.386 --> 30:23.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: Thanks for having
me.

30:23.422 --> 30:28.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, with the
Republican Convention
just three days away now, our
Lisa Desjardins

30:28.760 --> 30:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is already in Cleveland with
this look at
how the city is preparing for
rising concerns

30:34.199 --> 30:36.034 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
over country.

30:36.068 --> 30:40.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The welcome
signs are flying,
the parks are green and
gorgeous, but on the

30:40.238 --> 30:44.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
eve of this long-awaited moment
for Cleveland,
the city is holding its breath.

30:44.976 --> 30:48.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CALVIN WILLIAMS, Cleveland,
Ohio, Police Chief:
We have to ensure everybody's
safety, whether

30:48.046 --> 30:52.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're a protester, a delegate,
or a visitor
or a person that lives here in
the city of

30:52.951 --> 30:54.820 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Cleveland.

30:54.853 --> 30:58.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The city and
police department
have a two-part plan, one, a
secure fenced-in

30:58.256 --> 31:00.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
zone around the two main
convention sites.

31:00.926 --> 31:06.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's standard practice in
convention cities.
But there is a second zone, a
much wider area

31:06.164 --> 31:10.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outside the perimeters, where
the city and
police have banned a number of
items, from

31:10.869 --> 31:17.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tasers to tennis balls. But
police say guns
will be allowed, due to Ohio's
open carry

31:17.776 --> 31:19.478 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
law.

31:19.511 --> 31:21.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAYLOR BOHLEN, Cleveland Police
Department
: Next week is just -- I'm
concerned about

31:21.313 --> 31:26.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the mass of people, but it's
going to be the
same situations that we deal
with every day

31:26.284 --> 31:29.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
while we're working out on the
street, just
on a larger scale.

31:29.521 --> 31:34.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: The
restrictions have gone
too far, according to ACLU Ohio
staff attorney

31:34.192 --> 31:40.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Elizabeth Bonham. She
successfully sued, forcing
changes in the city's security
plan.

31:40.198 --> 31:44.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH BONHAM, ACLU:
Originally, the way
the city drew these restrictions
was extremely

31:44.569 --> 31:51.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
broad. They cannot leave the
First Amendment
rights of all the people coming
here to demonstrate

31:51.309 --> 31:54.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or celebrate or what have you on
the back
burner.

31:54.412 --> 31:58.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The result is a
downtown
zone that includes places like
this park,

31:58.717 --> 32:03.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Public Square. It's where
officials hope thousands
of protesters will go, but some
protest groups

32:03.855 --> 32:07.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tell us that they think the
restrictions are
too tight and they're not going
to follow

32:07.459 --> 32:09.261 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the rules.

32:09.294 --> 32:13.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Others say they are preparing
now to try and
prevent violence. Tea Party
activist Ralph

32:13.865 --> 32:20.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
King is planning a pro-Trump
event for Monday.
He took the rare step of meeting
with these

32:20.038 --> 32:24.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anti-Trump activists this week,
recording
a short video asking for calm.

32:24.943 --> 32:28.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RALPH KING, Tea Party Activist:
I don't care
if you're for Mr. Trump, you're
against Mr.

32:28.213 --> 32:34.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump. I don't care if you're a
Black Lives
Matter. If you want to come to
Cleveland,

32:34.820 --> 32:39.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you act and you respect our
city. If you don't
want to, we don't want you here.

32:39.724 --> 32:44.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: King says he's
not nervous,
but Jeff Yaw (ph) is. He's a
local filmmaker

32:44.629 --> 32:47.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
producing a documentary about
the convention.

32:47.132 --> 32:52.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Yes, I'm worried. I think
you have to
be. I think, if you're not,
you're perhaps

32:52.404 --> 32:54.306 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unprepared.

32:54.339 --> 32:57.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Cleveland
police say they're
prepared, using a $50 million
federal government

32:57.776 --> 33:03.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
security grant to buy equipment
and non-lethal
weapons.

33:03.148 --> 33:08.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining them will be 3,000
federal security
officials and thousands of state
National

33:08.220 --> 33:11.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Guard and officers on loan from
other departments.

33:11.990 --> 33:16.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clevelanders themselves say that
adds confidence,
especially after the attack in
Nice, France.

33:16.795 --> 33:19.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW ROBINSON, Cleveland: I'm
real happy
there is going to be a lot of
security. I'm

33:19.698 --> 33:21.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
real happy.

33:21.466 --> 33:24.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRYAN GOZELANCZYK, Cleveland: I
think that's
always a concern, but, I mean, I
have a lot

33:24.769 --> 33:28.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of faith in, you know, not only
the Cleveland
police, the Cuyahoga County
Sheriff's Office

33:28.940 --> 33:31.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and everyone else that is kind
of working
to secure the event.

33:31.276 --> 33:37.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Most of these
folks are first-time
protesters, a group of doctors
that formed

33:37.983 --> 33:44.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stand Against Trump and now
think their protest
march next Thursday may draw
thousands.

33:44.122 --> 33:45.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Surgeon Jana Hambley.

33:46.024 --> 33:49.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANA HAMBLEY, Protester: We are
committed
to being completely peaceful.
This is a nonviolent

33:49.461 --> 33:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
group. For the most part, we are
all medical
professionals, and so most of us
have taken

33:55.033 --> 33:58.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
oaths in our personal and
professional life
to uphold human life.

33:58.770 --> 34:04.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Babu
Chandrababu owns and
runs Cafe Sausalito, a downtown
restaurant

34:04.209 --> 34:07.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that was set to close just six
years ago,
when he turned it around.

34:07.746 --> 34:11.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAVANAN "BABU" CHANDRABABU,
Cafe Sausalito:
All the protesters, media,
everything is going

34:11.616 --> 34:16.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be on our side, so we are
very concerned
about it and especially our
employees are

34:16.087 --> 34:17.856 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
scared.

34:17.889 --> 34:24.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Scared of what
might happen
next week, given the
restaurant's proximity

34:24.663 --> 34:30.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the security barrier. His
customers, like
Emily Berndt, they are worried,
too. She's

34:30.101 --> 34:31.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not going to work next week.

34:31.870 --> 34:36.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EMILY BERNDT, Cleveland:
Primarily, it's the
road closures. My bus has to
stop way far

34:36.574 --> 34:43.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
away from where I work, and so
it makes it
more difficult to get to work,
and also I

34:43.448 --> 34:45.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was concerned about the possible
protesters.

34:45.750 --> 34:51.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Concerns shared
by many,
the public, protesters and
police.

34:51.489 --> 34:54.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins
in Cleveland.

34:54.592 --> 34:58.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that brings
us to the analysis
of Shields and Brooks.

34:58.463 --> 35:02.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is syndicated columnist
Mark Shields
and New York Times columnist
David Brooks.

35:02.600 --> 35:07.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gentlemen, we're going to lashed
at the hip,
I think, next week. You're
heading to Cleveland.

35:07.305 --> 35:09.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we don't know whether
there's going to
be disruptions or not.

35:10.008 --> 35:14.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Mark, let's start by
talking about Donald
Trump setting the table. He has
now chosen

35:14.612 --> 35:20.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his running mate, Mike Pence.
What do you
think? We just heard from a
reporter in Indiana.

35:20.385 --> 35:22.153 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you make of this?

35:22.187 --> 35:26.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think Mike Pence
was the least
Trump-like of the three
finalists. And in

35:26.091 --> 35:27.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that sense, he makes sense.

35:28.026 --> 35:33.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's got conservative -- solid
conservative
credentials, especially with
social conservatives.

35:33.598 --> 35:42.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's articulate. He's
personable, he's
got national ambitions. He's
made no secret

35:42.040 --> 35:44.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of them in the past.

35:44.075 --> 35:50.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would just remind him that
it's -- a successful
vice president -- an
unsuccessful vice presidential

35:50.415 --> 35:55.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidate has been elected
president of the
United States exactly once in
the nation's

35:56.021 --> 35:59.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
history. I mean, we have got
President Joe
Lieberman, President John
Edwards.

35:59.357 --> 36:01.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You said an
unsuccessful...

36:01.259 --> 36:04.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: An unsuccessful.
Franklin Roosevelt,
who lost in 1920, and got
elected in 1932.

36:04.729 --> 36:11.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's not necessarily a road
to the White
House on an unsuccessful vice
presidential

36:11.536 --> 36:18.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaign. But I think he makes
sense for Trump,
given Trump's special problems.

36:18.710 --> 36:19.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Makes sense?

36:19.778 --> 36:20.745 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

36:20.779 --> 36:22.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will let you
explore that.

36:22.414 --> 36:23.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: He does have
special problems.

36:23.181 --> 36:23.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Makes sense?

36:23.581 --> 36:24.249 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

36:24.282 --> 36:25.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think special...

36:25.550 --> 36:26.217 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

36:26.251 --> 36:28.219 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, all right.

36:28.253 --> 36:31.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, I think so. Of the three
that were available.
It wasn't like everyone was
available to him,

36:31.256 --> 36:34.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and so he picked the one who
doesn't cause
him any problems.

36:34.559 --> 36:38.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I got to know Mike Pence. I
first met him
in the early '90s. He was a talk
radio host

36:38.863 --> 36:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Indiana. I think his slogan
was, I'm the
Rush -- decaf Rush Limbaugh.

36:42.133 --> 36:43.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right. It
was.

36:43.635 --> 36:46.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And so he was less
spicy. And
his demeanor is sweet and kind.

36:46.971 --> 36:51.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And in the House, he was
successful, because
he's a nice guy, genuinely nice
guy. But if

36:51.443 --> 36:54.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he was a decaf Rush Limbaugh, I
don't know
what he is to Donald Trump.

36:54.179 --> 36:55.914 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

36:55.947 --> 36:58.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: He is going to --
I think he
will disappear, frankly. I think
it's a less

36:58.983 --> 37:03.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
important vice presidential pick
than any
we have had, just because Trump
is his own

37:03.555 --> 37:05.323 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
show.

37:05.356 --> 37:09.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he hasn't promoted a rival
show. He's
just going to be his own show.
And Pence will

37:09.828 --> 37:13.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
appear at the vice presidential
debate, but
I would be surprised if we were
talking too

37:13.431 --> 37:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
much about him for the next few
months.

37:15.467 --> 37:20.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: One quick point,
Judy, that
Trump said that he wanted an
attack dog, someone

37:20.405 --> 37:22.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who could be a pit bull or
whatever.

37:22.607 --> 37:28.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Mike Pence is the opposite
of that. He
ran for Congress in 1988 and
1990 against

37:28.379 --> 37:34.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a longtime Democratic incumbent,
Phil Sharp,
in that district, and he lost
twice. And after

37:34.519 --> 37:42.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the second defeat, he wrote an
article entitled
"Confessions of a Serial
Negative Campaigner."

37:42.961 --> 37:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he apologized for running
negative ads
and so forth. I mean, that
doesn't sound like

37:49.434 --> 37:50.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an attack dog to me.

37:50.869 --> 37:54.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, unless they
wanted a Middle
Western, Midwestern...

37:54.405 --> 37:55.573 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

37:55.607 --> 37:57.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: ... something,
compared to Donald
Trump.

37:57.142 --> 37:57.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sweet? Sweet?

37:57.642 --> 37:59.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

37:59.444 --> 38:01.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But what does it
say, though?
We have been hearing in the last
24, 48 hours

38:01.546 --> 38:06.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about Donald Trump maybe having
second thoughts
at midnight last night. There
was the back

38:06.050 --> 38:07.852 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and forth.

38:07.886 --> 38:11.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He told one interviewer: I'm
close to a decision.
I want somebody on national
security."

38:11.823 --> 38:14.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then he told somebody else:
No, it's down
to three.

38:14.492 --> 38:15.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you make of this whole
process?

38:15.794 --> 38:18.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, this is not
a real campaign.

38:18.363 --> 38:22.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, there is a certain norm of
the way things
are done. Usually, when you
announce your

38:22.567 --> 38:26.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vice presidential candidate,
there is like
a professional rollout. Like,
you do trivial

38:26.604 --> 38:29.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things like updating your Web
page, which
the Trump campaign didn't do for
a little

38:29.741 --> 38:30.375 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
while.

38:30.408 --> 38:31.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.

38:31.643 --> 38:33.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And so they're
just -- it's
a one-man show.

38:33.912 --> 38:36.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one gets the impression
everyone else
around is sort of in the dark,
and Trump is

38:36.981 --> 38:42.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deciding or not deciding. And,
as a result,
the institutional presence that
a campaign

38:42.153 --> 38:46.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has, where decisions get made,
and things
get done and conventions get
organized, a

38:46.191 --> 38:48.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lot of that, it's unclear if
that's happening.

38:48.493 --> 38:53.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And speaking of
that, Mark,
comment on how they have handled
this, the

38:53.565 --> 38:55.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Pence rollout.

38:55.366 --> 38:57.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But here we are, two or three
days ahead of
the start of the convention. We
still, as

38:57.702 --> 39:02.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
far as I know, as of an hour
ago, didn't have
the schedule. We don't know
who's speaking

39:02.874 --> 39:06.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in what order, the kinds of
things that the
candidates normally do.

39:06.211 --> 39:07.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Historical and
traditionally,
yes.

39:07.979 --> 39:10.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does that matter?
I mean, can
he just put on a great show and
that's all

39:10.748 --> 39:12.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that really counts, or what?

39:12.550 --> 39:15.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I think the
convention,
whether it's for the Elks or for
the aluminum

39:15.553 --> 39:19.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
siding industry or for a party,
is basically
the same thing.

39:19.457 --> 39:25.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has -- it's to energize the
people who
were there, to validate them, to
unite them.

39:25.430 --> 39:33.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in Donald Trump's case, I
think it's to
run a normal convention, and one
where he's

39:33.037 --> 39:40.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not in any way criticizing or
censuring Republicans
who aren't there, that he rises
above, shows

39:40.144 --> 39:41.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a spirit of magnanimity.

39:41.813 --> 39:46.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's it, perhaps a
lot more
important whether Bobby Knight
stiffs him

39:46.317 --> 39:49.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Don King doesn't show up and
Mike Tyson
is invited.

39:49.420 --> 39:51.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

39:51.256 --> 39:54.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think that that's one of
the keys for
this convention. For me I want
to see at least

39:54.359 --> 39:58.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
30 or 40 members of the Trump
family actually
speaking at the podium, which it
seems we're

39:58.062 --> 39:58.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
getting close to that number

39:58.997 --> 40:00.732 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

40:00.765 --> 40:02.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But I do want --
it will be
curious to know how organized it
is, because

40:02.667 --> 40:07.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
if they can't organize a
convention, how do
organize an administration or a
fall campaign?

40:07.138 --> 40:12.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the emotional tone.
Conventions are
like coronations, but if you
watch the Trump

40:12.176 --> 40:16.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speeches leading up in the last
couple of
weeks, it's filled -- it's sour.
He's sour.

40:16.114 --> 40:18.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's filled with resentment.
People aren't
treating me nice. CNN has been
mean.

40:18.416 --> 40:19.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's exactly
right.

40:19.083 --> 40:20.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

40:20.985 --> 40:23.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And so that's not
a normal convention
mood. So it will be interesting
to see if

40:23.321 --> 40:25.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he can pivot and actually be
happy.

40:25.523 --> 40:30.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And on top of
that, you have
these world events that we're
following, this

40:30.061 --> 40:36.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
awful attack, Mark, last night
in France,
with all the -- so many people
killed in this

40:36.401 --> 40:40.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of unspeakable act by this
man who drove
his truck through the crowd.

40:40.071 --> 40:44.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then, tonight, we're
watching and trying
to understand what's going on in
Turkey. What

40:44.876 --> 40:49.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
effect do events like this have
on a presidential
election?

40:49.347 --> 40:53.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, there is a
certain numbing
effect right now.

40:53.217 --> 40:59.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's crisis upon crisis, tragedy
upon tragedy.
And, I mean, I think we're
reeling, quite

40:59.290 --> 41:06.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
honestly. And Nice was just of a
different
order of magnitude, the idea of
driving a

41:06.597 --> 41:11.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
truck through families and
people celebrating
independence day at 70 miles an
hour, and

41:11.069 --> 41:12.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not slowing down.

41:12.136 --> 41:13.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But does it mean
that...

41:13.805 --> 41:15.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: As far as our
politics are concerned?

41:15.673 --> 41:18.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That Americans
want a leader
who is more stable, or someone
who is going

41:18.876 --> 41:20.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to change things?

41:20.678 --> 41:25.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think there is
always -- in
the short run, the call for bold
action over

41:25.416 --> 41:28.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thoughtful, restrained action
has an appeal.

41:28.886 --> 41:40.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, people are enraged,
they're insecure,
they're unsure, and the sure,
certain trumpet

41:40.465 --> 41:47.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that sounds has an appeal at a
time like that.
I mean, it's not like we're on
the eve of

41:47.805 --> 41:55.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an election, and not whether
Donald Trump
has a program or the
credentials. But he is

41:56.013 --> 42:03.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the bold voice, as opposed to
the voice of
restraint and experience that
Secretary Clinton

42:03.788 --> 42:05.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
purports to offer.

42:05.590 --> 42:07.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I don't think
Trump would
exist as a viable candidate if
it's not for

42:07.492 --> 42:12.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this climate for the past couple
of years
of psychological blows the world
has endured.

42:12.330 --> 42:16.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You start with the economic
stuff, anxiety
which is of longstanding nature,
but you go

42:16.501 --> 42:21.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back to the beheadings, the ISIS
beheadings.
These were psychologically
damaging for the

42:21.139 --> 42:24.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country. And what we felt last
week -- we
were on the show last week. It
was rough.

42:24.509 --> 42:25.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

42:25.476 --> 42:27.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: It was a very
depressing week.

42:27.345 --> 42:31.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then this week is worse. And
what's going
on in Turkey, it's just the
world is spinning

42:31.416 --> 42:37.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of order. And so that
implicates the campaign
in two ways. This campaign is in
part a debate

42:38.022 --> 42:41.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between an ardent nationalist,
which Donald
Trump is sort of a
European-style blood and

42:42.026 --> 42:46.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
soil nationalist, vs. a
candidate on the Democratic
side who is more of a globalist,
who believes

42:46.097 --> 42:49.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in global institutions.

42:49.300 --> 42:54.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these attacks all around the
world, we
see the dark side of
globalization. And so

42:54.939 --> 42:58.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think they help Trump. And
then to me,
the interesting thing is, people
are going

42:58.576 --> 43:01.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to want order, as Mark said.
They are going
to want somebody who is going to
preserve

43:01.112 --> 43:02.847 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
order.

43:02.880 --> 43:05.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Normally, that means they want
experience.
And that would be good for
Clinton. But I

43:05.216 --> 43:09.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think in this climate of chaos,
they are going
to want toughness and the sort
of like this

43:09.887 --> 43:12.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
authoritarianism. And that's
sort of up more
Trump's alley.

43:13.024 --> 43:16.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Even when there's
no link,
no proven link, yet?

43:16.160 --> 43:20.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, in France, this man
who drove
this truck, Mark, they still
don't have a

43:20.932 --> 43:25.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
connection between him and ISIS.
It could
have been the act of one person
disgruntled,

43:26.003 --> 43:26.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
upset with his life.

43:26.904 --> 43:28.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, you're right,
Judy.

43:28.739 --> 43:36.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, to David's point, it's
nationalism, too.
He was a Tunisian, of Tunisian
origin and

43:36.080 --> 43:44.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
descent. So, he was the other.
And think this
is very much -- that is very
much in our politics.

43:44.589 --> 43:50.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David raised the point about
chaos in the
world. This is why the
convention is important

43:50.328 --> 43:55.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Donald Trump's deportment,
comportment
are, because, I mean, because
this should

43:55.066 --> 44:00.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be an advantage to him right
now, as the out-party
and the one who has been
preaching this message

44:00.738 --> 44:02.473 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of nationalism.

44:02.507 --> 44:08.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he does projected chaos. And
I think to
that degree this -- it hurts --
it will hurt

44:08.713 --> 44:15.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
him, if in fact, at the
convention in Cleveland,
he personally exemplifies or
represents chaos

44:15.453 --> 44:21.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or the convention itself does. I
think that's
a risk, a high risk for him.

44:21.626 --> 44:24.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: It should be said
that the New
York Times/CBS poll came out
this week, and

44:24.795 --> 44:27.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it showed Clinton and Trump tied
at 40.

44:27.498 --> 44:30.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what is interesting about
the polls over
the past couple of months, is
that he doesn't

44:30.902 --> 44:38.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
move. He's at 40. She rises and
falls, but
he doesn't move. And so a lot of
this climate

44:38.109 --> 44:40.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is, I think, more affecting her
vote somehow
than his vote.

44:40.611 --> 44:44.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that poll --
those polls,
I guess -- and she did slip -- I
guess came

44:44.749 --> 44:47.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after the really bad week she
had with the
release of the e-mails.

44:47.785 --> 44:51.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Some of it was the
e-mails,
but I think some of it was also
just the Dallas,

44:51.622 --> 44:55.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the police killings, somehow the
sense of
just social unraveling, all the
comparisons

44:55.426 --> 44:57.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people were making to 1968.

44:57.161 --> 45:01.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: She did this past
week -- it
seems like it was forever ago,
but it was

45:01.332 --> 45:07.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just Tuesday -- she did get
endorse of Bernie
Sanders, who held out for a long
time, Mark.

45:07.405 --> 45:08.539 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that -- how much -- go ahead.

45:08.573 --> 45:10.308 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

45:10.341 --> 45:14.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think the timing
was better.
If anything, she did need a lift
this week.

45:14.512 --> 45:20.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After Comey and the e-mails and
after Dallas
and after Baton Rouge and after
Minnesota,

45:20.318 --> 45:24.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she needed -- Secretary Clinton
needed a lift,
and I think Bernie Sanders'
endorsement gave

45:24.622 --> 45:30.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her a lift. If it had come two
weeks earlier,
as so many Clinton folks were
urging and exhorting

45:30.361 --> 45:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him to do, I don't think it
probably would
have given the kind of upper
that she did

45:35.933 --> 45:40.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need at that time, even in the
midst of a
week in which it was very much
eclipsed.

45:40.071 --> 45:46.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Bernie made a good case for
her candidacy,
basically, based on Bernie's
campaign.

45:46.544 --> 45:50.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I was going to
say, how enthusiastic
was it?

45:50.081 --> 45:51.816 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

45:51.849 --> 45:54.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, that's it.
Nobody delivers.
We don't deliver anything in
this country

45:54.051 --> 45:56.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anymore, Judy. Nobody delivers
votes.

45:57.021 --> 46:03.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But his enthusiastic endorsement
of her and
the party unity are going to be
important.

46:03.527 --> 46:05.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you
think?

46:05.463 --> 46:08.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I think the
Democratic
Party will be united.

46:08.065 --> 46:10.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have always thought that. She
has now 85
percent of his vote. By the end
of the convention,

46:11.002 --> 46:15.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it will be 90-something. It will
be united.
I think what's changing is, are
his issues

46:15.706 --> 46:17.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on the forefront anymore?

46:17.675 --> 46:21.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, if we look around the
world right
now, are the banks really what
people are

46:21.312 --> 46:23.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fearing most, or is it ISIS, or
is it...

46:23.948 --> 46:25.449 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Inequity.

46:25.483 --> 46:26.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Or is it racial
issues that
have suddenly risen to the fore?

46:26.384 --> 46:28.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

46:28.319 --> 46:31.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And so I think
some of his issues,
at least for the time being, are
being eclipsed,

46:31.989 --> 46:34.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and so that changes the
landscape for her.

46:34.058 --> 46:38.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking of
one of those,
we have almost forgotten to
mention that there

46:38.696 --> 46:45.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was another terrible -- there
were shootings,
we have been watching, Mark, of
black men

46:45.336 --> 46:47.071 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by police.

46:47.104 --> 46:52.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then we had just within the
last week
the terrible massacre of police
officers in

46:52.443 --> 46:59.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dallas. And then there was this
quite remarkable
memorial service this week. And
you were telling

46:59.250 --> 47:02.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
us earlier today it may be the
one bright
spot.

47:02.486 --> 47:06.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It was. It was the
one bright
spot for me in the whole week.
It was almost

47:06.223 --> 47:07.858 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
traditional.

47:07.892 --> 47:10.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was what Americans have come
to expect
at a time of crisis and tragedy.
And that

47:11.028 --> 47:17.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is bipartisanship. I mean, Ted
Cruz, one of
the president's archest critics,
flew down

47:17.635 --> 47:22.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Air Force One with him. John
Cornyn, the
Republican leader in the Senate,
deputy leader,

47:22.640 --> 47:24.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
introduced the president.

47:24.542 --> 47:30.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president -- President
George W. Bush,
I thought, gave a quite personal
Dallas perspective.

47:30.715 --> 47:36.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the president is comforter
in chief. He
does it so well. The police
chief of Dallas,

47:36.554 --> 47:41.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Brown, both Hillary
Clinton and Donald
Trump ought to be grateful that
he hasn't

47:41.258 --> 47:45.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
entered any of the races. He's
just so impressive.

47:45.362 --> 47:53.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I just thought there was a
sense of unity,
of reconciliation, of national
agreement at

47:53.871 --> 47:54.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that Dallas ceremony.

47:54.972 --> 47:56.207 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Quick word?

47:56.240 --> 47:58.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And I have to say,
that's what
real America is.

47:58.375 --> 48:01.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been on this tour of the
country the
last several months to San
Antonio or New

48:01.879 --> 48:06.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Mexico or Fresno or West
Virginia. And it's
-- the country I filled with
healers, people

48:06.751 --> 48:10.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
healing the social fabric. And
we get down.
The news events are horrible.

48:10.721 --> 48:12.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We focus on the
bad things.

48:12.590 --> 48:15.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But there is a
day-to-day reality.
And it's actually a little
closer to what

48:15.359 --> 48:20.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama was saying than
sometimes
the coup and some of horrible
events that

48:20.598 --> 48:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
do we have to cover, obviously.

48:22.266 --> 48:25.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's a
better note to
end on than most of the news
tonight.

48:25.603 --> 48:28.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Brooks, Mark Shields,
thank you both.
And we will see you in
Cleveland.

48:28.038 --> 48:33.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you. Look
forward to it.

48:33.544 --> 48:45.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: Congress
released a long-classified
section of its

48:45.389 --> 48:51.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
report on the 9/11 attacks. It
details possible
links between the hijackers and
officials

48:51.095 --> 48:56.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Saudi Arabia. But it also
notes that subsequent
investigations found no such
links.

48:56.801 --> 49:02.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the White House, Press
Secretary Josh Earnest
said the information doesn't
change the fundamental

49:02.640 --> 49:04.508 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
facts.

49:04.542 --> 49:06.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
They didn't find any evidence
the Saudi government

49:06.510 --> 49:11.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as an institution or senior
Saudi officials
individually funded al-Qaida.
That's the definitive

49:11.916 --> 49:17.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
word of the outside experts who
took an unvarnished
look and this particular
situation, and that's

49:17.454 --> 49:19.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the -- that conclusion is
unchanged.

49:19.523 --> 49:24.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Saudi
ambassador to the
U.S. said today the released
information -- quote

49:24.662 --> 49:27.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- "absolutely exonerates" his
government.

49:27.865 --> 49:33.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Iraq, tens of thousands of
protesters rallied
again in Central Baghdad. Most
are supporters

49:33.504 --> 49:39.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of Shiite cleric Muqtada
al-Sadr, a long-time
critic of the government. The
crowds waved

49:39.043 --> 49:45.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraqi flags and chanted slogans,
calling Prime
Minister Haider al-Abadi a
thief. His government

49:45.616 --> 49:50.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has struggled to end corruption
and stop terror
attacks in the capital.

49:50.721 --> 49:55.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mourners gathered in Baton
Rouge, Louisiana,
today for the funeral of Alton
Sterling, who

49:55.593 --> 50:00.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was shot to death by two white
police officers
last week. Several thousand
people attended

50:00.831 --> 50:07.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the service, just days after the
incident
triggered protests, and some 200
arrests.

50:07.404 --> 50:13.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in Plano, Texas police
turned out again
for the funeral of Michael Krol.
He was one

50:13.077 --> 50:18.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of five officers killed by a
sniper in Dallas
last week.

50:18.282 --> 50:23.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Wall Street's rally fizzled
on this Friday.
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 10

50:23.854 --> 50:33.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
points to close at 18516. But
the Nasdaq fell
four points, and the S&amp;P 500
dropped two.

50:33.898 --> 50:42.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
points to close at 18516. But
the Nasdaq fell
four points, and the S&amp;P 500
dropped two.

50:42.673 --> 50:46.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now updating our lead story, the
crisis in
Turkey, a struggle for power is
under way

50:46.977 --> 50:49.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tonight, with the military
announcing that
it has carried out a coup and
that it's imposed

50:49.880 --> 50:51.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
martial law. It blames growing
terrorism and
repressive rule. And it says
that a peace

50:51.248 --> 50:54.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
council will act to restore
democracy in the
NATO member state.

50:54.251 --> 50:59.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are reports of tanks
firing near the
parliament building in Ankara,
the capital,

50:59.089 --> 51:05.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and helicopters and fighter
planes attacking
key points in both Ankara and
Istanbul. Troops

51:05.663 --> 51:12.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are out in the streets, sealing
off some government
buildings and bridges.

51:12.269 --> 51:18.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan called
CNN's Turkish branch to insist
the coup will

51:18.676 --> 51:24.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fail. He urged his supporters to
rally, and
later soldiers reportedly fired
on people

51:24.381 --> 51:27.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trying to protest the coup in
Istanbul.

51:27.685 --> 51:32.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here in Washington, the White
House says President
Obama is watching all these
rapidly developing

51:32.656 --> 51:38.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
situations -- this rapidly
developing situation.
Turkey has been a key U.S. ally
and a front-line

51:38.262 --> 51:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
member of the coalition battling
Islamic State
militants in Syria.

51:42.599 --> 51:48.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now a reminder about some
upcoming programs
from our PBS colleagues. Gwen
Ifill's already

51:48.472 --> 51:51.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Cleveland preparing for
"Washington Week,"
which airs later tonight.

51:51.842 --> 51:52.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's a preview:

51:52.509 --> 51:54.445 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Hi there, Judy.

51:54.478 --> 52:00.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're in Cleveland tonight for a
special "Washington
