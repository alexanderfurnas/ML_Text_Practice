SO IF THE NEW BILL WENT THROUGH,

08:50.767 --> 08:52.767
GM WOULD HAVE PAID A MUCH HIGHER

08:52.767 --> 08:52.900
FINE.n

08:52.900 --> 08:54.733
IN THIS CASE, THIS IS ALL TH

08:54.733 --> 08:54.867
GOVERNMENT CAN CHARGE.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.633
>> SO BESIDES THE FINE, WHAT

08:56.633 --> 08:58.133
ABOUT THE MONTHLY MEETINGS THE

08:58.133 --> 09:00.500
HAVE TO HAVE WITH REGULATORS

09:00.500 --> 09:02.200
ABOUT EVERY SAFETY ISSUE UNDER

09:02.200 --> 09:03.667
THE SUN THEY'RE DEALING WITH?

09:03.667 --> 09:06.767
>> MY FRIEND AT AUTOMOTIVE NEWS3

09:06.767 --> 09:09.033
SAYS GM WAS PUT ON A SHORT

09:09.033 --> 09:09.433
LEASH.

09:09.433 --> 09:11.933
SO THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED IN TERM

09:11.933 --> 09:14.733
OF ONE OF THE DETROIT CARMAKERS.

09:14.733 --> 09:16.133
GENERAL MOTORS HAS TO BASICALL

09:16.133 --> 09:16.667
REPORT IN.

09:16.667 --> 09:18.233
IT'S ALMOST LIKE IT'S ON PAROL

09:18.233 --> 09:19.700
WITH THE TRANSPORTATIO

09:19.700 --> 09:19.967
DEPARTMENT

09:19.967 --> 09:21.233
AND THIS IS THE KIND OFf

09:21.233 --> 09:22.800
INFORMATION THAT CAR COMPANIES,L

09:22.800 --> 09:23.967
THEY DON'T LIKE GIVING OVER"

09:23.967 --> 09:24.967
INFORMATION TO THE GOVERNMENT.

09:24.967 --> 09:26.633
THEY WOULD RATHER BE ABLE TO RUN

09:26.633 --> 09:27.733
THEIR OPERATIONS WITHOUT HAVIN

09:27.733 --> 09:29.100
TO JUSTIFY WHAT THEY DO.

09:29.100 --> 09:31.733
SO IT'S AN UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL

09:31.733 --> 09:34.000
OF OVERSIGHT FOR A DETROIT

09:34.000 --> 09:34.467
COMPANY.

09:34.467 --> 09:35.533
AND IT WILL BE VERY INTERESTIN

09:35.533 --> 09:36.333
TO SEE HOW THIS RELATIONSHIP

09:36.333 --> 09:37.000
WORKS OUT.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.933
>> AND IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT GM

09:38.933 --> 09:41.533
IS FINISHED WITH ALL OF THIS

09:41.533 --> 09:43.900
I MEAN, THERE'S STILLL

09:43.900 --> 09:45.200
INVESTIGATIONS ONGOING.n

09:45.200 --> 09:46.700
ARE THEY STILL POSSIBLY LIABLE

09:46.700 --> 09:47.767
FOR CRIMINAL MALFEASANCE?

09:47.767 --> 09:49.333
>> THERE'S A COUPLE OF

09:49.333 --> 09:50.633
MILESTONES THAT WILL PROBABL

09:50.633 --> 09:51.867
STILL HAPPEN HERE.

09:51.867 --> 09:54.400
FIRST OF ALL, GENERAL MOTORS I

09:54.400 --> 09:55.700
CONDUCTING ITS OWN INTERNA

09:55.700 --> 09:57.567
INVESTIGATION AND IT HIRED

09:57.567 --> 10:00.400
KENNETH FINEBERG, WHO

10:00.400 --> 10:01.900
ADJUDICATED THE 9/11 VICTIMS

10:01.900 --> 10:02.067
CASES.

10:02.067 --> 10:04.600
HE WAS THE PERSON WHO LOOKED

10:04.600 --> 10:09.367
INTO COMPENSATION IN THE BP OILL

10:09.367 --> 10:11.300
SPILL AND HE'S EXPECTED TO MAK

10:11.300 --> 10:16.267
A RECOMMENDATION AS TO WHETHER

10:16.267 --> 10:16.400
GM SHOULD PAY THE FAMILIES O

10:16.400 --> 10:18.367
THE VICTIMS.

10:18.367 --> 10:20.767
POSSIBLY THERE WILL BE A JUSTICE

10:20.767 --> 10:23.600
DEPARTMENT SETTLEMENT LIKE WEU

10:23.600 --> 10:26.267
SAW IT TOYOTA, WHICH WAS $1.2"

10:26.267 --> 10:28.700
BILLION AND TOYOTA ALSO ADMITTED

10:28.700 --> 10:28.833
FAULT.

10:28.833 --> 10:30.867
>> THE INVESTIGATION SEEMS TO

10:30.867 --> 10:33.500
HAVE UNCOVERED A CULTURE, MORE

10:33.500 --> 10:35.100
THAN A SPECIFIC PROBLEM.

10:35.100 --> 10:38.467
HOW DO REGULATORS TACKLE THI

10:38.467 --> 10:40.167
WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE

10:40.167 --> 10:41.300
FRONT LINES?

10:41.300 --> 10:42.533
>> WHAT'S FASCINATING ABOU

10:42.533 --> 10:44.033
THIS, IT'S THE SECOND TIME THE

10:44.033 --> 10:46.233
GOVERNMENT HAS HAD TO WADE INTO

10:46.233 --> 10:47.700
GENERAL MOTORS TO FIX PROBLEMS

10:47.700 --> 10:49.133
THAT PEOPLE SAW OVER YEARS, BU

10:49.133 --> 10:50.200
WERE NEVER ADDRESSED

10:50.200 --> 10:52.933
SO IF YOU REMEMBER BACK TO THE

10:52.933 --> 10:54.867
BAIL-OUT IN 2009, ONE OF THE

10:54.867 --> 10:56.300
THINGS THAT THE WHITE HOUSE TASK

10:56.300 --> 10:58.167
FORCE DID WAS BASICALLY TELL

10:58.167 --> 11:00.367
GENERAL MOTORS, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN

11:00.367 --> 11:01.733
RUNNING YOUR OPERATIONS3

11:01.733 --> 11:02.033
CORRECTLY.

11:02.033 --> 11:03.800
THESE ARE THE SUGGESTIONS, I

11:03.800 --> 11:05.133
GUESS SUGGESTIONS WITH A

11:05.133 --> 11:07.900
BASEBALL BAT, THAT THEY HAD FOR"

11:07.900 --> 11:08.233
GM.n

11:08.233 --> 11:09.633
NOW HERE WE HAVE TRANSPORTATIO

11:09.633 --> 11:13.633
DEPARTMENT BASICALLY SAYING, YOU

11:13.633 --> 11:14.500
CAMOUFLAGED SAFETY INFORMATION

11:14.500 --> 11:15.333
FROM 2009 FORWARD.

11:15.333 --> 11:19.500
SO I THINK IT'S KIND OF A SA

11:19.500 --> 11:22.400
SITUATION FOR GM THAT IT TAKES

11:22.400 --> 11:24.500
OUTSIDE REGULATORS TO TELL THE

11:24.500 --> 11:26.000
COMPANY TO RUN ITS OPERATION

11:26.000 --> 11:28.367
THE WAY IT WAS SUPPOSED TO

11:28.367 --> 11:30.433
>> ALL RIGHT, THANKS SO MUCH

11:30.433 --> 11:40.700
>> MY PLEASURE

11:40.700 --> 11:43.467
>>> AND NOW TO OUR SIGNATURE

11:43.467 --> 11:44.667
SEGMENT, THE NATIONWIDE DEBATE

11:44.667 --> 11:46.367
ABOUT THE USE OF TRAFFIC

11:46.367 --> 11:46.867
CAMERAS.

11:46.867 --> 11:49.000
MORE THAN 500 COMMUNITIES ACROSS

11:49.000 --> 11:50.300
THE UNITED STATES NOW USE THEM

11:50.300 --> 11:52.467
IN AN EFFORT TO SLOW DRIVERS

11:52.467 --> 11:54.000
DOWN AND SAVE LIVES.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.433
BUT SEVEN STATES HAVE NOW BANNED

11:55.433 --> 11:58.100
THEIR USE, BELIEVING THESE SAM

11:58.100 --> 11:59.467
CAMERAS DENY DRIVERS THEIR

11:59.467 --> 12:01.400
RIGHTS AND INVADE THEIR PRIVACY.

12:01.400 --> 12:04.267
THE BATTLE IS NOW PLAYING OUT IN

12:04.267 --> 12:04.633
OHIO.n

12:04.633 --> 12:06.000
NEWS HOUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDEN

12:06.000 --> 12:07.067
RICK CARR TRAVELED THERE

12:07.067 --> 12:08.900
RECENTLY AND REPORTS

12:08.900 --> 12:11.067
>> Reporter: DRIVERS WHO RUN RED

12:11.067 --> 12:13.800
LIGHTS KILL NEARLY 700 PEOPL

12:13.800 --> 12:15.167
EVERY YEAR NATIONWIDE.

12:15.167 --> 12:17.733
SUE AND PAUL OBER HOUSER REFUS

12:17.733 --> 12:19.367
TO CALL THOSE CRASHES ACCIDENTS.

12:19.367 --> 12:21.467
>> MOST OF THOSE ARE

12:21.467 --> 12:22.067
INTENTIONALLY PEOPLE THINK

12:22.067 --> 12:23.200
THEY'RE GOING TO GET AWAY WITH

12:23.200 --> 12:25.200
IT, AND THEY RUN THE RED LIGHT

12:25.200 --> 12:25.967
THEY NEVER THINK THEY'RE GOING

12:25.967 --> 12:27.533
TO KILL A PERSON

12:27.533 --> 12:28.933
>> THEIR DAUGHTER SARA WAS

12:28.933 --> 12:31.467
KILLED BY A DRIVER WHO RAN A RED

12:31.467 --> 12:32.967
LIGHT IN 2002.

12:32.967 --> 12:34.133
SHE WAS 31 YEARS OLD AND THE

12:34.133 --> 12:35.567
MOTHER OF TWO.

12:41.167 --> 12:43.133
TEACHER-TRAINING WORKSHOP ON A

12:43.133 --> 12:44.667
SATURDAY MORNING WHEN HER LIGH

12:44.667 --> 12:45.767
TURNED GREEN

12:45.767 --> 12:47.767
>> IT WAS A YOUNG MAN, 21 YEAR

12:47.767 --> 12:54.200
OLD, HE RAN THE RED LIGHT GOIN

12:54.200 --> 12:56.333
55 MILES AN HOUR AND HE T BONE

12:56.333 --> 12:58.267
HER CAR AND SARA WAS KILLE

12:58.267 --> 12:58.367
INSTANTLY.

12:58.367 --> 12:59.967
>> THEY BELIEVE THERE'S A WAY TO

12:59.967 --> 13:01.167
PREVENT CRASHES LIKE THE ONE

13:01.167 --> 13:03.200
THAT KILLED THEIR DAUGHTER

13:03.200 --> 13:05.433
AUTOMATED CAMERAS THAT KEEP AN

13:05.433 --> 13:07.567
EYE ON INTERSECTIONS 24/7.

13:07.567 --> 13:09.400
SO EVEN WHEN POLICE AREN'T

13:09.400 --> 13:10.167
THERE, DRIVERS THINK TWICE

13:10.167 --> 13:12.200
BEFORE RUNNING THE LIGHT.n

13:12.200 --> 13:14.500
THE PROOF THAT THEY WORK IS &

13:14.500 --> 13:15.800
40-MINUTE DRIVE FROM THEIR

13:15.800 --> 13:17.600
FARMOUS IN OHIO STATE CAPITAL.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.833
>> THE CITY OF COLUMBU

13:19.833 --> 13:21.433
INSTALLED ITS FIRST RED LIGH

CAMERA AT THIS INTERSECTION IN

13:24.100 --> 13:24.267
2006.n

13:24.267 --> 13:26.000

MORE THAN THREE DOZEN OTHER"

13:28.633 --> 13:28.767
INTERSECTIONS.

13:28.767 --> 13:31.533
AND AT THOSE LOCATIONS, SIDE

13:31.533 --> 13:35.400
IMPACT CRASHES ARE DOWN BY 74%

13:35.400 --> 13:38.700
>> WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED

13:38.700 --> 13:39.967
DRIVER BEHAVIOR FOR THE GOOD

13:39.967 --> 13:43.367
HERE IN COLUMBUS, OHIO

13:43.367 --> 13:48.067

13:49.800 --> 13:52.300
TO BET THE YELLOW IN RUNNING RED

13:52.300 --> 13:52.467
LIGHTS?

13:52.467 --> 13:53.800
THE ANSWER IS ABSOLUTELY

13:53.800 --> 13:56.667
WE HAVE OVER 70% LESS CITATIONS3

13:56.667 --> 13:58.400
THAN WE USED TO.

13:58.400 --> 13:59.800
>> COLUMBUS DRIVERS HAVEN'

13:59.800 --> 14:02.733
TURNED INTO ANGELS

14:02.733 --> 14:04.500
BUT WHEN ONE DOES RUN A RE

14:04.500 --> 14:06.967
LIGHT, AT AN INTERSECTION WITH

14:06.967 --> 14:08.767
CAMERAS, IT'S CAPTURED IN

14:08.767 --> 14:10.467
12-SECOND VIDEO CLIP

14:10.467 --> 14:11.900
>> YOU'LL NOTE THE RED LIGHT HAS

14:11.900 --> 14:13.900
BEEN RED FOR A NUMBER OF SECONDS

14:13.900 --> 14:18.633
PRIOR TO THE CAR COMING INTO THE

14:18.633 --> 14:20.333
INTERSECTION

14:20.333 --> 14:21.267
AND THE DRIVER JEOPARDIZIN

14:21.267 --> 14:21.400
EVERYONE

14:21.400 --> 14:24.567
>> THE CAMERAS SEND THOSE VIDEOS

14:24.567 --> 14:26.333
AND PHOTOS OF THE VEHICLE FROM

14:26.333 --> 14:28.733
BEHIND TO A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR

14:28.733 --> 14:30.000
IT IDENTIFIES WHO OWNS THE CAR

14:30.000 --> 14:31.633
AND SENDS THAT INFORMATION BACK;

14:31.633 --> 14:33.567
TO THE COLUMBUS POLICE

14:33.567 --> 14:34.367
DEPARTMENT

14:34.367 --> 14:36.933
THEN COPS LIKE LIEUTENANT BREN

14:36.933 --> 14:38.867
MOLE REVIEW THE EVIDENCE

14:38.867 --> 14:40.500
>> IS HE SAFE?

14:40.500 --> 14:41.033
RIGHT THERE.

14:41.033 --> 14:42.900
I'M GOING TO SAY HE MADE A SAF

14:42.900 --> 14:43.167
TURN

14:43.167 --> 14:44.600
HE DID LOOK, HE WAS IN CONTROL

14:44.600 --> 14:45.500
OF HIS VEHICLE

14:45.500 --> 14:48.133
THERE WAS NO PEDESTRIANS AND NO

14:48.133 --> 14:50.267
OTHER CROSS VEHICULAR TRAFFIC.

14:50.267 --> 14:52.400
I'M GOING TO REJECT THAT

14:52.400 --> 14:52.933
>> OKAY.

14:52.933 --> 14:55.900
>> IF IT'S LIKE BASEBALL, IF

14:55.900 --> 14:56.933
IT'S A TIE, THE RUNNER GETS TH

14:56.933 --> 14:57.167
ADVANTAGE.

14:57.167 --> 14:59.333
SO IF IT'S A TIE AND I CAN'T

14:59.333 --> 15:00.567
REALLY TELL, WE'LL GIVE THEU

15:00.567 --> 15:01.400
ADVANTAGE TO THE PERSON RUNNIN

15:01.400 --> 15:03.200
THE LIGHT.

15:03.200 --> 15:03.900

OF THE DOUBT, BASICALLY.

IT'S FOR SAFETY, IT'S NOT ABOU

A PERCENTAGE

EITHER WAY, A LOT OF MOTORISTS

16:08.967 --> 16:10.700
JUST DON'T LIKE TRAFFIC CAMERAS.

20-PLUS YEARS IN GOVERNMENT.

22:20.600 --> 22:21.800
HERE'S A SAMPLING OF WHAT THEY

22:21.800 --> 22:22.867
HAD TO SAY

22:22.867 --> 22:24.700
>> INTEGRATION SHOULD BE A GOA

22:24.700 --> 22:25.900
FOR EVERY SCHOOL IN AMERICA,

22:25.900 --> 22:29.533
BECAUSE IT ALLOWS STUDENTS TO BE

22:29.533 --> 22:30.867
EXPOSED TO THE DIVERSITY THEY'LL

THEM BY KEEPING THEM IN &

22:58.767 --> 23:02.000
TO A SCHOOL THAT'S INTEGRATED,

BUT PEOPLE FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE

23:05.167 --> 23:06.567
WITH THEIR OWN CULTURE

23:06.567 --> 23:09.633
