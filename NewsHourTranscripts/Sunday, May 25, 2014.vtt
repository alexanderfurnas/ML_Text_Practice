THREE MORE WEEKS TO HAVE A

04:09.133 --> 04:10.133
RUNOFF

04:10.133 --> 04:12.467

HAD DIFFERENT EMOTIONAL VOICES

04:14.400 --> 04:16.233
BETWEEN THE CANDIDATES BUT

VERGE OF WAR

04:27.900 --> 04:29.600
PUTIN HAS DESIGNS ON UKRAINE AND

04:30.967 --> 04:32.833
CHARGE NOW

04:32.833 --> 04:34.033
THAT'S WHERE THE MARGIN IS

04:34.033 --> 04:35.300
IMPORTANT AND ALSO THE TURNOUT

04:35.300 --> 04:37.900
IF YOU LOOK AT THE SCREEN, I

04:37.900 --> 04:38.733
WAS HUGE

04:38.733 --> 04:41.033
NOT ONLY IN THE 70% AND OVER I

04:41.033 --> 04:42.633
THE WEST, BUT EVEN IN TH

04:42.633 --> 04:44.367
CENTRAL PART, NOT ONLY AROUN

04:44.367 --> 04:46.833
KIEV BUT A LOT OF HEAVIL

04:46.833 --> 04:48.267
RUSSIAN-SPEAKING AREAS, THE ONLY

04:48.267 --> 04:49.767
TWO GRAY ZONES WHERE THEY DON'

04:49.767 --> 04:51.733
HAVE ENOUGH DATA ARE THE TWO

04:51.733 --> 04:54.533
AREASES THAT THE RUSSIAN-BACKE

04:54.533 --> 04:56.067
SEPARATISTS RAN THIS CAMPAIGN OF

04:56.067 --> 04:57.800
INTIMIDATION THAT WE REPORTED SO

04:57.800 --> 04:58.700
MUCH ON THIS WEEK.

04:58.700 --> 05:02.067
THAT MAKES IT SIGNIFICANT.

05:02.067 --> 05:05.533
AND MAKES HIS WIN UNASSAILABLE

05:05.533 --> 05:07.033
>> WHAT ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT HE

05:07.033 --> 05:07.867
FACES WITH THE SEPARATISTS I

05:07.867 --> 05:08.633
THE EAST

05:08.633 --> 05:10.467
>> GREAT QUESTION, HARI.

05:10.467 --> 05:12.600
I ACTUALLY RACED OVER TO HIS

05:12.600 --> 05:13.400
HEADQUARTERS TONIGHT AFTER THE

05:13.400 --> 05:14.500
EXIT POLLS CAME OUT.

05:14.500 --> 05:16.333
AND HE WAS JUST SPEAKING TO TH

05:16.333 --> 05:18.800
PRESS, AND HE SAID, MY FIRST

05:18.800 --> 05:27.800
VISIT WILL BE TO THE DONSPACH,

05:27.800 --> 05:29.733
THE COAL, METAL PRODUCING AREA

05:29.733 --> 05:30.467
IN THE EAST.

05:30.467 --> 05:32.367
HE WANTS TO ASSURE THEM THAT

05:32.367 --> 05:34.100
THEY HAVE A PLACE IN UKRAINE

05:34.100 --> 05:35.633
THEY'RE THE POOREST SECTION OF

05:35.633 --> 05:37.767
THE COUNTRY, BUT WE'LL RESPECT

05:37.767 --> 05:39.667
THEIR RUSSIAN LANGUAGE

05:39.667 --> 05:42.633
SO ON ONE HAND HE'S PUTTING OU

05:42.633 --> 05:44.433
A HAND

05:44.433 --> 05:46.000
AMNESTY EVEN FOR SEPARATISTS

05:46.000 --> 05:48.567
BUT THOSE WHO HAVE KILLE

05:48.567 --> 05:50.133
PEOPLE, THERE WILL NOT B

05:50.133 --> 05:52.233
AMNESTY AND WE'RE GOING TO -

05:52.233 --> 05:53.233
THAT WILL NOT CONTINUE

05:53.233 --> 05:54.933
HE'S MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE WANTS

05:54.933 --> 05:57.133
A MORE MUSCULAR APPROACH T

05:57.133 --> 05:59.900
ARMED SEPARATISTS, TO TH

05:59.900 --> 06:02.100
RUSSIAN OPERATIVES THEY BELIEV

06:02.100 --> 06:05.900
ARE OPERATING THERE WHO AR

06:05.900 --> 06:08.300
RUSSIAN-BACK OR RUSSIAN PAID

06:08.300 --> 06:09.700
ULTRASEPARATISTS AND ALSO THES

06:09.700 --> 06:12.467
CRIMINAL GANGS AND ELEMENTS THAT

06:12.467 --> 06:14.200
WERE HIRED ON BY THAT CROWD.

06:14.200 --> 06:17.433
SO I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE

06:17.433 --> 06:19.300
PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR DOING THIS IN

06:19.300 --> 06:21.667
THE REST OF UKRAINE EVEN IF IT

06:21.667 --> 06:24.600
COSTS SOME LIVES TO GO AHEAD AND

06:24.600 --> 06:26.133
TAKE THEM ON MILITARILY.

06:26.133 --> 06:27.200
I'M NOT SAYING TOMORROW.

06:27.200 --> 06:29.133
HE'S GOING TO MAKE AN OFFER, BUT

06:29.133 --> 06:30.567
TIME IS RUNNING OUT.

06:30.567 --> 06:33.000
>> WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HIM

06:33.000 --> 06:34.433
PERSONALLY BESIDES HE MADE ALL

06:34.433 --> 06:36.333
HIS MILLIONS AND BILLIONS IN

06:36.333 --> 06:37.300
SELLING CHOCOLATE?

06:37.300 --> 06:39.867
>> AND YOU KNOW, FUNNY THING

06:39.867 --> 06:41.367
HARI, I JUST LEARNED LAST NIGH

06:41.367 --> 06:42.967
HE'S DIABETIC AND CAN'T EAT HI

06:42.967 --> 06:44.233
OWN CHOCOLATE, WHICH I

06:44.233 --> 06:44.467
FANTASTIC.

06:44.467 --> 06:46.033
HE MADE BILLIONS IN CHOCOLAT

06:46.033 --> 06:47.567
AND IN MANY OTHER BUSINESSES

06:47.567 --> 06:50.267
HE'S KNOWN, THOUGH, AS A

06:50.267 --> 06:55.167
PRAGMATIST, A VERY PRAGMATIC

06:55.167 --> 06:56.600
HE'S BEEN FINANCE MINISTER

06:56.600 --> 06:57.633
FOREIGN MINISTER, HE'S BEE

06:57.633 --> 06:58.567
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE

06:58.567 --> 07:01.233
HE DOES A LOT OF BUSINESS IN

07:01.233 --> 07:02.633
RUSSIAN EVEN THOUGH PUTIN SHUT

07:02.633 --> 07:04.300
DOWN ONE OF HIS CHOCOLATE PLANTS

07:04.300 --> 07:07.033
WHEN HE SIDED WITH THE UPRISIN

07:07.033 --> 07:08.833
OVER THE WINTER.

07:08.833 --> 07:10.267
ON THE OTHER HAND HE DOE

07:10.267 --> 07:11.700
BUSINESS WITH THE EUROPEANS.

07:11.700 --> 07:13.200
AND FOLKS WE TALKED TO TODAY

07:13.200 --> 07:15.700
LIKE THAT COMBINATION IN HIM

07:15.700 --> 07:17.600
HE DOESN'T STIR DEEP FEELING

07:17.600 --> 07:19.900
BUT THERE IS A SENSE THAT HE'S A

07:19.900 --> 07:22.767
VERY PRAGMATIC GUY, THAT HE'

07:22.767 --> 07:24.400
NOT GOING TO TAKE UKRAINE OVER A

07:24.400 --> 07:25.733
CLIFF IN ONE DIRECTION O

07:25.733 --> 07:27.367
ANOTHER AND THAT HE'S PROBABLY

07:27.367 --> 07:33.733
THE MOST ASTUTE AND SAVVY OF THE

07:33.733 --> 07:33.933
BUNCH.

07:33.933 --> 07:35.633
>> SO YOU'VE BEEN REPORTING FROM

07:35.633 --> 07:37.400
UKRAINE FOR THE PAST WEEK, FRO

07:37.400 --> 07:38.400
THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY,

07:38.400 --> 07:39.733
NOW YOU'RE IN THE CAPITAL.

07:39.733 --> 07:41.867
HOW DO YOU DISTILL THE

07:41.867 --> 07:45.400
DIFFERENCES IN THESE TWO BIG

07:45.400 --> 07:45.533
REGIONS?

07:45.533 --> 07:47.600
>> WELL, YOU MEAN TODAY OR I

07:47.600 --> 07:47.767
GENERAL?

07:47.767 --> 07:50.167
I MEAN, THE DIFFERENCES IN THE

07:50.167 --> 07:51.433
REGIONS ARE PRETTY AMAZING

07:51.433 --> 07:52.933
WE'VE BEEN OVER IN THE EAST

07:52.933 --> 07:57.367
LOT IN MARCH AND NOW AND I

07:57.367 --> 08:00.667
REALLY IS FOR COAL MINERS, I

08:00.667 --> 08:03.133
DON'T KNOW, THINK OF PITTSBURG

08:03.133 --> 08:04.433
OR WEST VIRGINIA IN THE '50s AND

08:04.433 --> 08:06.433
THEY WORK VERY, VERY HARD AN

08:06.433 --> 08:07.067
THERE'S SO MUCH CORRUPTION AND

08:07.067 --> 08:08.800
SO MUCH SKIMMING OF TH

08:08.800 --> 08:10.067
SUBSIDIES THAT THEY DON'T SE

08:10.067 --> 08:10.767
MUCH OF IT

08:10.767 --> 08:12.233
THE REST OF UKRAINE IS REALL

08:12.233 --> 08:14.300
MOVING IN A EUROPEAN MODEL

08:14.300 --> 08:16.000
I SAY TODAY THE DIFFERENCE WAS

08:16.000 --> 08:16.233
SURREAL.

08:16.233 --> 08:18.833
THE VOTING PLACES IN KIEV WERE

08:18.833 --> 08:20.633
ABSOLUTELY RAN LIKE CLOCKWORK.

08:20.633 --> 08:22.333
AT THE SAME TIME I WAS CALLING

08:22.333 --> 08:25.167
AND TEXTING WITH OFFICIALS I

08:25.167 --> 08:29.200
KNEW BACK IN DONETSK AND LUHANSK

08:29.200 --> 08:31.267
