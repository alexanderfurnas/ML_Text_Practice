JUDY WOODRUFF: And to the
analysis of Shields and Brooks.

00:03.433 --> 00:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist
Mark Shields and New York
Times columnist David Brooks.

00:07.766 --> 00:09.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, gentlemen.

00:09.300 --> 00:11.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
David is joining us from
the Rocky Mountains,
Aspen, Colorado.

00:11.533 --> 00:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, let's start, both of you,
by talking about health care.

00:15.433 --> 00:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark, we just heard a little
while ago on the program
Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri

00:19.633 --> 00:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saying it's going to be hard,
he said, to get to 50 votes.

00:23.733 --> 00:25.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are you hearing?

00:25.700 --> 00:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It's an
understatement by Senator Blunt,
a masterpiece of understatement.

00:30.900 --> 00:34.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Judy, never say never.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think it's about
time to say never.

00:36.433 --> 00:39.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, this is not
being put together.

00:39.700 --> 00:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Quite frankly, the motion to
proceed, not to get inside
baseball, but that's when the

00:44.333 --> 00:47.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
majority leader -- means
bringing up a bill.

00:47.466 --> 00:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have never seen a motion
to proceed, which is just
asking that the bill be brought

00:53.233 --> 00:55.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
up for debate, fail.

00:55.300 --> 00:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Mitch McConnell's
reputation as an inside
player has taken a big hit.

00:59.900 --> 01:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there is not -- there is
not majority on what to do.

01:04.033 --> 01:06.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's not there.

01:06.566 --> 01:10.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I will just back to
one Republican has spoken
the absolute abject
truth on this subject.

01:12.733 --> 01:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he said, "In the 25 years
I have served in the Congress,
Republicans have never, not

01:16.733 --> 01:20.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one time ever agreed
on a health care plan."

01:20.100 --> 01:23.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That was Speaker John
Boehner this year.

01:23.066 --> 01:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I think it remains true.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David,
what are you picking up?

01:26.700 --> 01:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I'm hearing
negative vibes, but not
quite as negative as Mark.

01:31.633 --> 01:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I still think there's a chance.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What you hear is frustration
over, one, it's hard
to take away a benefit
people have already

01:38.100 --> 01:40.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
been given by law.

01:40.133 --> 01:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two, the Republicans are
more ideologically divided
than they thought they were.

01:43.433 --> 01:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Three, it's very hard to pass
a bill without a White House.

01:46.933 --> 01:51.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the president basically
ineffective here, and the
vice president barely more so.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so they're trying
to do it without him.

01:53.166 --> 01:56.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think what they're
beginning to hear, as
the calls come in, is
that this is a proposal

01:56.933 --> 01:59.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that hits a lot of
Republicans really hard.

01:59.300 --> 02:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you're a 60-year-old white
male in Ohio, this can be
devastating to you, both in the

02:03.700 --> 02:08.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
coverage loss and in
the deductibles and the
out-of-pocket expenses,
so the calls are coming

02:08.633 --> 02:09.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into the offices.

02:09.866 --> 02:11.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's making
people skittish.

02:11.866 --> 02:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think it's an uphill fight.

02:13.066 --> 02:15.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't think it's quite
as impossible maybe.

02:15.566 --> 02:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I was
struck, Mark, that Senator
Blunt was saying the
more the senators learn

02:19.033 --> 02:20.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about what's in here,
the harder it gets.

02:20.933 --> 02:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.

02:21.933 --> 02:24.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No, that's absolutely -- and
I would just add to it, Judy,
there is no public argument,

02:26.500 --> 02:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a case to be made for this.

02:29.566 --> 02:34.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Senator Blunt answered
your specific questions
well, but there is no --
there is not a rallying

02:36.533 --> 02:39.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
cry for, whether it's
preexisting condition
or, you know, that
everybody's child can be

02:40.866 --> 02:43.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on until the age of 26.

02:43.366 --> 02:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Obamacare, the
Affordable Care Act, they
could make a public case
for it, that everybody

02:48.833 --> 02:51.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is in, that rates
will not be higher.

02:51.200 --> 02:53.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's none here.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think that's
a real problem.

02:55.100 --> 02:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David's point about there
is no political air cover
from the White House.

02:58.933 --> 03:00.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Quite the opposite.

03:00.266 --> 03:03.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, the White House
has been a liability.

03:03.300 --> 03:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president has been
unhelpful, uninformed,
and this morning tweeting,
let's repeal, which,

03:12.933 --> 03:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CBO, the Congressional Budget
Office, has a score on, would
put 26 million people uninsured

03:22.700 --> 03:26.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
immediately, so, you
know, off of insurance.

03:26.733 --> 03:31.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, this is not a
recipe for success.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
David, that's right.

03:33.066 --> 03:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, the president did tweet
this morning, well, if they
can't agree, they should repeal

03:36.433 --> 03:38.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now and replace it later.

03:38.266 --> 03:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, it's the
definition of bad leadership.

03:41.700 --> 03:45.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had a more sensible position
not too long ago, which is
you do both things at the same

03:45.633 --> 03:48.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

03:48.133 --> 03:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you repeal in the
fantasy that you're going
to replace later, when
you can't replace now,

03:50.733 --> 03:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's just not a realistic
way to make policy.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think Senator Blunt made
a good point, that, we got
a piece of legislation.

03:55.933 --> 03:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you can't agree on this,
there's not some mythical future
piece of legislation out there

03:59.600 --> 04:01.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that's going to pass.

04:01.733 --> 04:05.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The basic problem is
that this is a bill that
massively redistributes
wealth from the poor

04:06.533 --> 04:08.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the rich.

04:08.500 --> 04:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there are a lot of senators,
including Bob Corker of
Tennessee and Portman of Ohio

04:14.766 --> 04:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Susan Collins of Maine,
who are just uncomfortable
with the level of upward
redistribution that

04:18.166 --> 04:20.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this bill entails.

04:20.266 --> 04:22.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then there are other
senators on the right,
the Ted Cruzes, who
just want to get rid of

04:22.533 --> 04:24.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what they call
job-killing taxes.

04:24.900 --> 04:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's just a diverse party.

04:26.933 --> 04:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And McConnell is trying super
hard to find some formula
that will please both sides,

04:31.400 --> 04:33.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but it just may be an
unsolvable problem.

04:33.066 --> 04:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I will
just add one thing, Judy.

04:35.133 --> 04:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You had an interview earlier
this week with Senator John
Thune of South Dakota, ranking

04:40.333 --> 04:42.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Republican.

04:42.366 --> 04:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you asked him about one
little mishap, which was that
Dean Heller, the most vulnerable

04:48.100 --> 04:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican incumbent in the
country, up in Nevada next
year, in the only state where

04:52.133 --> 04:57.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Republicans running for
reelection that Hillary
Clinton carried in
2016, expressed his own

04:59.066 --> 05:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reservations, misgivings,
doubts, opposition to the
bill as proposed last Friday.

05:03.466 --> 05:05.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And what happened?

05:05.500 --> 05:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joining the state's governor,
who pointed out that the
rate of uninsured children in

05:11.100 --> 05:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the state had been cut by
one-half under Obamacare because
of the Medicaid extension.

05:17.066 --> 05:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he back -- he hollered
backed at the governor,
at which point the
president's own political

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
action committee, staffed
by the president's own
political aides and
apparatchiks, organized

05:28.533 --> 05:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a $1 million, expressed attack
ad series on him, Heller,
which Senator Thune objected

05:36.066 --> 05:38.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to, that Senator
McConnell opposed.

05:38.466 --> 05:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the political equivalent
of coming down from the hills
and shooting the wounded.

05:42.866 --> 05:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so they had to back off.

05:45.733 --> 05:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so you talk about White
House-congressional relations.

05:49.233 --> 05:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, this is just -- it's
more than counterproductive.

05:53.100 --> 05:54.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's stupid.

05:54.100 --> 05:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're right.

05:56.300 --> 05:58.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Senator Thune -- David,
Senator Thune's comment,
that wouldn't be a good
time to go after members

05:58.900 --> 05:59.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of your own party.

05:59.933 --> 06:01.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

06:03.533 --> 06:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No, it's -- the relations are
-- it's interesting to watch
even the reactions to the tweets

06:08.233 --> 06:09.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and everything else.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They can't get
away from this guy.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what's been interesting,
talking to members of Congress,
is, it would be one thing if

06:13.566 --> 06:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he would just sort of disappear,
but they have to spend so much
of their time just reacting.

06:20.500 --> 06:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's just very hard to make
policy, aside from the problem
of just making policy from

06:23.033 --> 06:25.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Capitol Hill, which is
difficult to start with.

06:25.100 --> 06:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking
of the tweets, David, we have
seen some eyebrow-raisers.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have heard some gasps.

06:32.900 --> 06:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I guess the president's
tweet yesterday morning about
the "Morning Joe" MSNBC cable

06:38.166 --> 06:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hosts, Joe Scarborough and
Mika Brzezinski, where the
president tweeted very personal

06:42.433 --> 06:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
insults, low I.Q.,
face-lift, and so forth, it
seemed to reach a new low.

06:49.966 --> 06:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do we learn anything new about
this president at this point?

06:53.533 --> 06:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, one of the
nice things, if we can find a
silver lining here, is, it's

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
possible for everybody
to be freshly appalled,
that we are not inured
to savage, misogynistic

07:05.133 --> 07:06.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
behavior of this sort.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I saw a lot
of people around.

07:08.666 --> 07:12.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I certainly felt in
myself a freshness, a
freshness of outrage.

07:12.833 --> 07:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I must say, when I hear
Roy Blunt say it's unhelpful
to himself, well, that's true,

07:17.333 --> 07:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but it's more than
unhelpful to Donald Trump
to tweet in this way.

07:20.300 --> 07:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's morally objectionable.

07:21.533 --> 07:24.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I do wish more
senators would say that.

07:24.066 --> 07:27.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Lindsey Graham and Ben
Sasse have said it, but
a lot of others, oh,
it's just not helpful.

07:27.833 --> 07:29.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's more than that.

07:29.266 --> 07:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the issue here is the
corruption of our public sphere.

07:32.033 --> 07:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what Donald Trump
does with these things.

07:34.366 --> 07:37.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it makes it harder for us,
our country, to ever get back
to normal, when these things

07:37.700 --> 07:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are corrosive to just the way
people talk to each other.

07:40.266 --> 07:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Corruption
of the public sphere, Mark.

07:42.333 --> 07:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think David
is guilty of understatement.

07:45.700 --> 07:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
No, I think he put it very well.

07:49.333 --> 07:51.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is hateful
and it's hurtful.

07:51.900 --> 07:56.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy, I don't know what
a parent or a grandparent
is supposed to say to a
10-year-old or a 12-year-old

07:58.300 --> 08:02.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who said anything comparable to
this and was sent -- banished
to their room or whatever

08:04.400 --> 08:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
else for it, I mean, that the
president of the United States
can talk this way, and there

08:09.566 --> 08:12.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are no consequences.

08:12.533 --> 08:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The irony is that he's more
engaged on the back-and-forth
with Joe Scarborough and Mika

08:19.166 --> 08:24.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Brzezinski on this than
he has been on health
care or any other issue.

08:25.300 --> 08:27.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He obviously -- this
is what matters to him.

08:27.833 --> 08:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's just that classic
-- not to be sectionally
biased, but it's sort
of a New York bully

08:36.066 --> 08:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
approach to life, I mean,
that you say anything,
you do anything, because
the important thing

08:41.666 --> 08:43.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is winning.

08:43.700 --> 08:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just -- you know, I
don't know what else there is
to say, other than you want

08:50.133 --> 08:52.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to put yourself through a
car wash after you listen to
the president talk this way.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are there
consequences, David?

08:54.933 --> 08:59.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, I heard what you
said about some senators
are just saying, well,
it's not helpful, but

08:59.033 --> 09:04.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
other senators are going
further and saying,
this is really wrong.

09:04.900 --> 09:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But are there ever consequences?

09:07.600 --> 09:08.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do we just go on like this?

09:08.866 --> 09:10.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

09:10.766 --> 09:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, we will see if
people eventually get
disappointed and get tired.

09:13.666 --> 09:18.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do think if it -- one of the
things that may begin to offend
people is potential mafioso

09:18.100 --> 09:20.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
behavior.

09:20.033 --> 09:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the things we heard
this morning in the op-ed
piece in The Washington Post by

09:22.300 --> 09:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the two hosts was that the
White House sort of threatened
sort of extortion, that, if

09:29.266 --> 09:32.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the show becomes more
Trump-friendly, then
a National Enquirer
investigation into their

09:32.833 --> 09:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
relationship will be spiked.

09:34.800 --> 09:38.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's sort of mafioso,
extortion behavior.

09:38.566 --> 09:40.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's beyond normal
White House behavior.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's beyond political hardball.

09:42.566 --> 09:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's sort of using your media
allies, The National Enquirer
and the Trump administration,

09:48.300 --> 09:50.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to take down enemies.

09:50.400 --> 09:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's not something we
have seen in America since
maybe Nixon, or maybe never.

09:54.033 --> 09:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's true,
Mark, we haven't seen
anything like this in a while.

09:58.333 --> 10:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: We haven't.

10:00.500 --> 10:03.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I think David's
point about extortion
certainly strengthens
the position of James

10:03.700 --> 10:08.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Comey, that threats
and extortion or a hint
of extortion is part
of the modus operandi.

10:11.566 --> 10:13.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
To Republicans...

10:13.200 --> 10:14.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I mean,
we should say the White
House is denying it.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: The White
House is denying it.

10:16.366 --> 10:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jared Kushner, I guess, is
denying it, or perhaps somebody
else through him is denying

10:19.833 --> 10:22.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

10:22.266 --> 10:25.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the fact that there's
negotiations going back
and forth or communications
on this subject,

10:25.266 --> 10:30.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you do this and we won't print
an injurious and harmful article
in The National Enquirer,

10:32.900 --> 10:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one of the great
publications of our time.

10:35.366 --> 10:39.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, Judy, I remember
when Republicans used
to get upset and angry
at Bill Clinton because

10:39.400 --> 10:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he didn't wear a suit and
tie in the Oval Office.

10:43.100 --> 10:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Donald Trump, who
is supposed to be this
great deal-maker, I mean,
Joe and Mika Brzezinski

10:47.766 --> 10:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a morning show which is a
show that watched very much in
this area, but it doesn't have

10:54.300 --> 10:57.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a great national
audience, and probably 1
percent of the people.

10:57.233 --> 11:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he just made them a
national -- everybody now
knows about this show.

11:02.066 --> 11:05.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's probably increased their
ratings, juiced them up.

11:05.166 --> 11:10.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I don't understand
where -- if anything,
it's but counterproductive
in every sense.

11:12.100 --> 11:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it is true,
David, that this is -- it's
hard to find you said there

11:17.800 --> 11:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may be a silver lining in
fresh outrage, but beyond
that, I'm not sure where it is.

11:21.400 --> 11:22.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: No.

11:22.833 --> 11:24.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, you know, the big question
for me is, do we snapback?

11:24.966 --> 11:29.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do the norms that used to govern
politics reestablish themselves
after the Trump administration,

11:30.700 --> 11:32.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or are we here forever?

11:32.366 --> 11:35.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I hope, from the
level of outrage, that
we have a snap back.

11:35.500 --> 11:38.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the politics is
broken up and down.

11:38.200 --> 11:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Trump may emerge from a
reality TV world that is much
more powerful than we think.

11:45.166 --> 11:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there is the prospect
that this is where we are,
which is an horrific thought.

11:47.666 --> 11:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Horrific thought.

11:49.033 --> 11:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, it is that.

11:50.533 --> 11:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields,
David Brooks, we thank you both.

11:53.333 --> 11:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you, Judy.
