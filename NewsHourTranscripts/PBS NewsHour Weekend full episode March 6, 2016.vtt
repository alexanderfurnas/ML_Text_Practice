09:33.400 --> 09:34.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT

09:34.367 --> 09:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT?

09:34.700 --> 09:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK THAT IS TRUE.

09:36.300 --> 09:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK IN MANY WAYS THE HISTORY

09:37.500 --> 09:39.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE REAGAN PRESIDENCY IS

09:39.000 --> 09:41.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STILL BEING WRITTEN IN PART

09:41.967 --> 09:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THE FULL EXTENT OF HER

09:44.333 --> 09:45.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFLUENCE IS FAR FROM KNOWN.

09:45.867 --> 09:49.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK SHE TOOK SOME PAINS TO

09:49.700 --> 09:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCEAL IT.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE, RONALD

09:55.333 --> 10:00.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REAGAN WAS REALLY AS GUILELESS,

10:00.367 --> 10:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRIENDLY, TRUSTING AN

10:02.333 --> 10:04.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDIVIDUAL AS HIS PUBLIC IMAGE

10:04.867 --> 10:05.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUGGESTS.

10:05.900 --> 10:07.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THOSE ARE WONDERFUL

10:07.767 --> 10:08.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUALITIES IN A HUMAN BEING.

10:08.767 --> 10:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IN A PRESIDENT, THEY

10:11.800 --> 10:14.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INEVITABLY IMPOSE A BURDEN, A

10:14.867 --> 10:16.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPENSATORY BURDEN, IF YOU

10:16.467 --> 10:19.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL, MAYBE ON A CHIEF OF STAFF

10:19.867 --> 10:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR IN SOME CASES ON A SPOUSE,

10:21.500 --> 10:23.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT WAS PART OF THE

10:23.167 --> 10:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNWRITTEN JOB OF THE FIRST LADY.

10:25.033 --> 10:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SOME DO IT BETTER THAN

10:27.333 --> 10:27.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHERS.

10:27.767 --> 10:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MRS. REAGAN DID IT SUPERBLY.

10:30.800 --> 10:35.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE HER

10:35.367 --> 10:37.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVERRIDING OBJECTIVE WAS TO

10:37.767 --> 10:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTECT THE MAN SHE LOVED.

10:39.333 --> 10:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SHE HAD EXCELLENT INSTINCTS.

10:41.833 --> 10:44.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE COULD SPOT A PHONY A MILE

10:44.367 --> 10:44.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AWAY.

10:44.967 --> 10:47.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE COULD SPOT A SELF-SERVER

10:47.367 --> 10:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBABLY TWO MILES AWAY.

10:48.900 --> 10:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WASHINGTON AS WE ALL KNOW IS

10:50.700 --> 10:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPLETE WITH BOTH.

10:52.133 --> 10:54.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

10:57.633 --> 11:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YEAH, SHE WAS NOT AFRAID TO

11:03.333 --> 11:06.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHALLENGE PERHAPS POLITICAL

11:06.567 --> 11:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORTHODOXY.

11:07.633 --> 11:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT IS-- YOU KNOW, THAT SAN

11:11.333 --> 11:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXCELLENT EXAMPLE.

11:11.933 --> 11:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF COURSE IN HER CASE IT WAS AN

11:14.333 --> 11:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTENSELY PERSONAL CAUSE.

11:17.600 --> 11:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFTER ALL, SHE WAS LIVING WITH

ALZHEIMER DISEASE, AS WERE-- AS

11:24.400 --> 11:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

11:27.367 --> 11:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT'S NOT SURPRISING JUST ON

11:29.600 --> 11:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A PERSONAL LEVEL THAT SHE WOULD

11:33.633 --> 11:37.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKE SUCH AN INTEREST AND SUCH A

11:37.067 --> 11:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIEW.

>> Sreenivasan: LAST TIME A

11:38.733 --> 11:40.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE SEEN

11:40.667 --> 11:41.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HER WOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE

11:41.967 --> 11:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PASSING OF PRESIDENT REAGAN.

11:43.233 --> 11:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WHAT DID SHE DO IN THE LAST

11:44.333 --> 11:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FEW YEARS OF HER LIFE.

11:45.700 --> 11:47.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I KNOW SHE WAS INVOLVED IN THE

11:47.467 --> 11:48.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REAGAN LIBRARY.

11:48.267 --> 11:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE LIBRARY I THINK WAS A

11:50.000 --> 11:51.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREAT-- A GREAT SOURCE OF PRIDE.

11:51.867 --> 11:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ACTIVITIES.

11:52.733 --> 11:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE WAS VERY ACTIVE FROM BEFORE

11:55.100 --> 11:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LIBRARY WAS BUILT.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE AND THE PRESIDENT WERE BOTH

11:59.933 --> 12:02.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY ACTIVE IN THE BUILDING

12:02.767 --> 12:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DESIGN.

12:03.400 --> 12:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I REMEMBER SITTING IN MEETINGS

12:05.933 --> 12:08.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE EXHIBITS WERE BEING

12:08.367 --> 12:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSIDERED.

12:09.100 --> 12:10.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I REMEMBER THINKING, YOU

12:10.633 --> 12:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW, THIS WOMAN HAS A VERY GOOD

12:13.033 --> 12:13.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EYE.

12:13.467 --> 12:15.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE HAD A REMARKABLE VISUAL

12:15.667 --> 12:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SENSE.

12:16.333 --> 12:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE COULD LOOK AT A STORY BOARD

12:18.333 --> 12:20.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IS A

12:20.767 --> 12:23.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOREIGN KIND OF LANGUAGE.

12:23.167 --> 12:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND GET IT IMMEDIATELY WHAT THE

12:26.133 --> 12:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POINT OF AN EXHIBIT WAS.

12:27.900 --> 12:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ANYWAY, SHE WAS VERY ACTIVE

12:30.333 --> 12:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE LIBRARY.

12:31.233 --> 12:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE USED TO COME UP REGULARLY,

12:33.333 --> 12:34.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO BOOK SIGNINGS.

12:34.967 --> 12:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK SHE STAYED PRETTY

12:36.633 --> 12:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTIVE REALLY ALMOST UP UNTIL

12:37.933 --> 12:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE END.

12:39.333 --> 12:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK SHE HAD A LOT OF

12:42.333 --> 12:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRIENDS.

12:42.900 --> 12:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE WASN'T A RECLUSE.

12:44.533 --> 12:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND OF COURSE SHE WAS

12:46.300 --> 12:47.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MRS. RONALD REAGAN.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK TO THE DAY SHE DIED,

12:49.800 --> 12:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WAS WHAT IN MANY WAYS DE

12:52.100 --> 12:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FINED HER.

16:33.467 --> 16:35.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, IT'S

16:35.667 --> 16:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASICALLY A RACE TO SEE IF

16:37.633 --> 16:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYONE CAN STOP DONALD TRUMP.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

MICHIGAN.

16:44.333 --> 16:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE SPENT THE MOST TIME HERE AND

16:46.400 --> 16:47.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COVERED THE MOST GROUND FROM THE

16:47.667 --> 16:49.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE TO

16:49.267 --> 16:52.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
METRO DETROIT, ALL THE WAY TO

16:52.067 --> 16:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MARQUETTE IN THE UPPER

THE STATE'S POPULATION.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO HE HAS INVESTED A LOT HERE.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND A LOT OF REPUBLICANS ARE

17:01.767 --> 17:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRYING TO LAY CLAIM TO SUITE

CROSSOVER VOTERS AS WELL OR

17:14.333 --> 17:17.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

17:22.400 --> 17:23.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP STILL LOOKS LIKE HE HAD A

17:23.900 --> 17:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEAD.

17:24.433 --> 17:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANY IDEA IF THE MOMENTUM THAT

17:25.633 --> 17:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY TED CRUZ MIGHT HAVE PICKED

17:27.500 --> 17:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UP LAST NIGHT TRANSLATES INTO

17:29.500 --> 17:32.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE CONSERVATIVE MICHIGANERS?

17:32.767 --> 17:34.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT'S POSSIBLE THAT CRUZ

17:34.367 --> 17:35.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CERTAINLY HAS AN ORGANIZATION IN

17:35.667 --> 17:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHIGAN.

17:36.200 --> 17:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

17:40.467 --> 17:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXCEPT FOR THE REPUBLICAN DEBATE

17:42.400 --> 17:43.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN DETROIT.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT BEGS THE QUESTION, HOW

17:45.300 --> 17:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARD HE'S-- HOW HARD HE'S

17:47.833 --> 17:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLAYING HERE.

17:48.933 --> 17:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CERTAINLY MARCO RUBIO HAS TRIED

17:52.333 --> 17:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A BIT.

17:53.600 --> 17:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHIGAN WAS REALLY SUPPOSED TO

17:56.433 --> 17:58.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE JEB BUSH COUNTRY.

17:58.267 --> 18:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND A LOT OF THE STATE'S

18:00.733 --> 18:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STANDARD REPUBLICAN POLITICAL

18:01.733 --> 18:03.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CULTURE WAS GETTING BEHIND HIM.

18:03.167 --> 18:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WHEN HE DROPPED OUT THERE

18:05.133 --> 18:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE SORT OF

18:06.633 --> 18:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WONDERING WHERE TO GO.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

18:18.867 --> 18:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> OH, ABSOLUTELY.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE TRIED TO

18:22.100 --> 18:24.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAKE A NATIONAL ISSUE OF FLINT

18:24.567 --> 18:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS REPRESENTING REPUBLICAN

18:28.633 --> 18:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCOMPETENCE WHEN IT WHEN IT

18:31.200 --> 18:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMES TO GOVERNING.

18:31.833 --> 18:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS ONE OF THE BIG REASONS

18:33.200 --> 18:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY AFTER THE FLINT DEBATE WAS

18:35.733 --> 18:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONVENED BY DEMOCRATIC PARTY
