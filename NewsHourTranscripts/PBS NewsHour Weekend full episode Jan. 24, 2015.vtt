05:47.647 --> 05:48.848

05:48.848 --> 05:50.483
SO, WHAT STEPS DID THE JAPANESE

05:50.483 --> 05:52.686
GOVERNMENT TAKE TO TRY AND FREE

05:52.686 --> 05:54.487
THIS PARTICULAR HOSTAGE, OR WHAT

GET THE NEXT ONE?

05:57.457 --> 05:58.625
>> I BELIEVE THAT THE JAPANESE

06:26.453 --> 06:27.854
HUMANITARIAN SUPPORT.

06:27.854 --> 06:28.688
>> CORRECT.

06:28.688 --> 06:30.757
PRIME MINISTER ABE LAST WEEK

06:30.757 --> 06:34.060
VISITED CAIRO AND ISSUED THAT

06:34.060 --> 06:35.462
STATEMENT THAT THE JAPANESE

06:35.462 --> 06:38.198

06:44.738 --> 06:47.307
FIGHTING WITH THE THREAT OF

06:47.307 --> 06:48.875
ISIS.

06:48.875 --> 06:53.780
APPARENTLY, ISIS SEIZED THE

06:53.780 --> 06:56.716
MOMENT OF THE PRIME MINISTER

06:56.716 --> 07:00.053
ABE'S STATEMENT, AND THE RANSOM

WITH THE AMOUNT OF THE MONEY

07:04.457 --> 07:06.860

07:08.828 --> 07:09.529
>> Sreenivasan: SO, IS THERE

07:09.529 --> 07:11.164
ANY CHANCE THAT JAPAN WOULD PAY

07:11.164 --> 07:12.098
THE RANSOM?

07:12.098 --> 07:13.967
I MEAN, BACK IN THE LATE '70s,

07:13.967 --> 07:15.001
THERE WAS AN INCIDENT IN

07:15.001 --> 07:16.202
BANGLADESH AND THERE WAS SOME

07:16.202 --> 07:17.604
QUESTION ABOUT AN INCIDENT IN

07:17.604 --> 07:20.473
THE LATE '90s IN KYRGYZSTAN.

07:20.473 --> 07:21.741
IS THERE AN OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT

07:21.741 --> 07:22.709
POLICY THAT SAID THEY WOULDN'T

07:22.709 --> 07:23.977
PAY?

07:23.977 --> 07:25.045
>> THE OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT

07:25.045 --> 07:28.481
POLICY IS TO COMPLY WITH THE

07:28.481 --> 07:32.452
KIND OF INTERNATIONAL NORM, NOT

07:32.452 --> 07:35.555
TO BEND TO THE THREAT OF THE

07:35.555 --> 07:37.223
TERRORISTS.

07:37.223 --> 07:40.593
SO, IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT THE

07:40.593 --> 07:43.196
JAPANESE GOVERNMENT IS NOT READY

07:43.196 --> 07:45.065
TO PAY THE RANSOM.

07:45.065 --> 07:48.501
BUT EVERYTHING MAY BE POSSIBLE.

07:48.501 --> 07:54.207
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, NOW ISIS

07:54.207 --> 07:56.209
CHANGED THEIR DEMAND FROM THE

07:56.209 --> 07:58.845
RANSOM TO THE RELEASE OF THE

07:58.845 --> 08:02.749
HOSTAGE TAKEN IN JORDAN.

08:02.749 --> 08:03.883
>> Sreenivasan: SO, WHAT HAS

08:03.883 --> 08:06.052
THE REACTION BEEN IN JAPAN OVER

08:06.052 --> 08:06.586
THE PAST FEW DAYS?

08:06.586 --> 08:07.987
OBVIOUSLY, THIS NEWS BROKE SO

08:07.987 --> 08:08.922
LATE AT NIGHT THAT MOST JAPANESE

08:08.922 --> 08:10.190
WERE ASLEEP, AND THEY WON'T KNOW

08:10.190 --> 08:11.858
UNTIL TOMORROW MORNING, AND THAT

08:11.858 --> 08:12.892
WILL BE THE REACTION TO THIS

08:12.892 --> 08:15.161
HOSTAGE'S ASSASSINATION.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.629
BUT OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS,

08:16.629 --> 08:18.598
AS THIS STORY HAS BEEN BUILDING

08:18.598 --> 08:20.400
IN JAPAN, WHAT'S IT BEEN LIKE?

08:20.400 --> 08:21.835
>> YES, OF COURSE, MOST OF THE

08:21.835 --> 08:24.704
JAPANESE POPULATION ARE VERY

08:24.704 --> 08:26.906
MUCH CONCERNED AND WORRIED ABOUT

08:26.906 --> 08:30.577
THE FATE OF THE TWO HOSTAGES,

08:30.577 --> 08:32.011
AND THERE WAS A PRESS CONFERENCE

08:32.011 --> 08:34.581
BY ONE OF THE... MOTHER OF ONE

08:34.581 --> 08:37.016
OF THE HOSTAGES THE OTHER DAY,

08:37.016 --> 08:44.257
AND IT... HER APPEAL TO FREE

08:44.257 --> 08:47.894
THE... FREE HER SON WAS WIDELY

08:47.894 --> 08:52.265
APPRECIATED, AND A LOT OF

08:52.265 --> 08:55.034
COMPASSION GROWN IN JAPANESE

08:55.034 --> 08:55.902
SOCIETY.

08:55.902 --> 08:57.036
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.105
>> ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE ARE

08:59.105 --> 09:04.878
SOME SENTIMENTS IN CERTAIN

09:04.878 --> 09:08.515
PEOPLE IN JAPAN THAT THE GUYS

09:08.515 --> 09:12.485
WENT TO SYRIA KNOWING THAT THERE

09:12.485 --> 09:13.987
ARE RISKS.

09:13.987 --> 09:18.658
AND THERE ARE SOME VOICES THAT

09:18.658 --> 09:20.293
BLAME THE BEHAVIOR...

09:20.293 --> 09:21.661
>> Sreenivasan: THAT THEY

09:21.661 --> 09:22.595
ENGAGED IN RISKY BEHAVIOR.

09:22.595 --> 09:23.496
>> RIGHT, CORRECT.

09:23.496 --> 09:24.330
>> Sreenivasan: OKAY, HAJIME

09:24.330 --> 09:25.398
OZAKI, THE NEW YORK BUREAU CHIEF

09:25.398 --> 09:26.499
OF THE KYODO NEWS AGENCY, THANKS

09:26.499 --> 09:27.033
SO MUCH.

09:27.033 --> 09:28.401
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

09:39.846 --> 09:40.914
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW TO OUR

09:40.914 --> 09:41.748
SIGNATURE SEGMENT.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.283
TONIGHT, THE DEBATE ABOUT

09:43.283 --> 09:45.251
EMPLOYER BACKGROUND CHECKS.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.387
HOW FAR BACK SHOULD THEY GO?

09:47.387 --> 09:48.922
IT'S MORE THAN A PERSONAL ISSUE

09:48.922 --> 09:50.457
BECAUSE A GROWING BODY OF

09:50.457 --> 09:52.192
EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT ANYONE

09:52.192 --> 09:53.326
WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD, EVEN FOR

09:53.326 --> 09:54.828
A MINOR OFFENSE COMMITTED LONG

09:54.828 --> 09:57.297
AGO, IS MUCH MORE LIKELY TO LIVE

09:57.297 --> 09:58.331
IN POVERTY.

09:58.331 --> 09:59.165
AND TENS OF MILLIONS OF

09:59.165 --> 10:00.934
AMERICANS HAVE SOME SORT OF

10:00.934 --> 10:02.101
CRIMINAL RECORD.

10:02.101 --> 10:02.902
THE NEWSHOUR'S STEPHEN FEE

10:02.902 --> 10:03.603
RECENTLY TRAVELED TO

10:03.603 --> 10:05.605
PHILADELPHIA AND HAS OUR REPORT.

10:07.407 --> 10:08.341
>> Reporter: EVERY AFTERNOON, AT

10:08.341 --> 10:10.310
HIS DINING ROOM TABLE, 35-YEAR-

10:10.310 --> 10:12.011
OLD RONALD LEWIS DOES HIS

10:12.011 --> 10:12.979
HOMEWORK.

10:12.979 --> 10:15.248
BY DAY, HE'S A STUDENT, LEARNING

10:15.248 --> 10:16.316
TO FIX HEATING AND AIR

10:16.316 --> 10:17.484
CONDITIONING SYSTEMS, AND HE

10:17.484 --> 10:19.619
LOOKS AFTER HIS THREE KIDS.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.054
HE ALSO WORKS THE NIGHTSHIFT,

10:21.054 --> 10:22.489
RUNNING HIGH-PRESSURE BOILERS AT

10:22.489 --> 10:23.990
A CHEMICAL PLANT HERE IN HIS

10:23.990 --> 10:25.725
HOMETOWN, PHILADELPHIA.

10:25.725 --> 10:27.393
>> I'M A FATHER.

10:27.393 --> 10:29.696
I'M A HARD WORKER.

10:29.696 --> 10:31.064
I'M VERY AMBITIOUS.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.232
>> Reporter: HE'S ALSO GOT A

10:32.232 --> 10:33.433
CRIMINAL RECORD.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.535
A DECADE AGO, LEWIS HAD TWO

10:35.535 --> 10:37.504
MAJOR RUN-INS WITH THE LAW THAT

10:37.504 --> 10:39.439
HE SAYS HAVE INTERFERED WITH HIS

10:39.439 --> 10:42.041
JOB PROSPECTS EVER SINCE.

10:42.041 --> 10:44.244
IN AUGUST 2004, HE WAS PICKED UP

10:44.244 --> 10:45.979
DURING A DRUG ARREST ALONGSIDE

10:45.979 --> 10:47.113
HIS BROTHER.

10:47.113 --> 10:48.214
LEWIS WAS CARRYING A NINE-

10:48.214 --> 10:49.682
MILLIMETER HANDGUN.

10:49.682 --> 10:51.117
DAYS LATER, HE WAS NABBED FOR

10:51.117 --> 10:52.585
STEALING A POCKETBOOK FROM A

10:52.585 --> 10:53.987
DEPARTMENT STORE.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.522
SO, WHAT WAS THAT LIKE, AND WHAT

10:55.522 --> 10:56.823
HAPPENED AT THAT STAGE AFTER

10:56.823 --> 10:58.091
THEY ARRESTED YOU?

10:58.091 --> 10:59.125
>> IT WAS LIFE CHANGING.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.394
IT WASN'T A GOOD FEELING.

11:01.394 --> 11:02.295
IT WASN'T A GOOD FEELING BECAUSE

11:02.295 --> 11:03.329
YOU FELT LIKE YOU DISAPPOINTED

11:03.329 --> 11:05.198
YOUR FAMILY AND YOU DISAPPOINTED

11:05.198 --> 11:06.633
YOUR MOTHER, WHICH IS THE MOST

11:06.633 --> 11:07.934
IMPORTANT PERSON IN MY LIFE.

11:07.934 --> 11:08.902
>> Reporter: ON THE SUGGESTION

11:08.902 --> 11:10.203
OF HIS LAWYER, LEWIS TOOK A

11:10.203 --> 11:11.237
DEAL.

11:11.237 --> 11:12.872
FOR BOTH CASES, HE PLED GUILTY

11:12.872 --> 11:14.974
TO A TOTAL OF THREE MISDEMEANORS

11:14.974 --> 11:16.409
AND WAS SENTENCED TO FIVE YEARS

11:16.409 --> 11:17.443
PROBATION.

11:17.443 --> 11:18.478
NO JAIL TIME.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.213
AT THAT TIME, WERE YOU WORRIED

11:20.213 --> 11:21.347
AT ALL ABOUT HOW THIS MIGHT

11:21.347 --> 11:22.415
IMPACT YOUR FUTURE?

11:22.415 --> 11:25.318
>> NO, BECAUSE THE LAWYER HAD

11:25.318 --> 11:26.152
TOLD ME, "IT'S ONLY A

11:26.152 --> 11:26.819
MISDEMEANOR.

11:26.819 --> 11:27.687
IT'S NEVER GOING TO HURT YOU.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.289
DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT."

11:29.289 --> 11:30.924
SO, NO, I REALLY DIDN'T THINK

11:30.924 --> 11:33.893
THAT MUCH INTO IT AT THAT POINT.

11:33.893 --> 11:34.827
>> Reporter: A SHORT TIME LATER,

11:34.827 --> 11:36.062
LEWIS BEGAN LOOKING FOR NEW

11:36.062 --> 11:36.796
WORK.

11:36.796 --> 11:38.131
HE WAS OVERJOYED WHEN HE GOT A

11:38.131 --> 11:39.599
TENTATIVE JOB OFFER FROM A

11:39.599 --> 11:40.934
BUILDING COMPANY.

11:40.934 --> 11:41.935
>> I WORKED THERE FOR ABOUT A

11:41.935 --> 11:43.369
MONTH, WAS HONEST WITH THEM.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.704
TOLD THEM, YOU KNOW, WHAT WAS ON

11:44.704 --> 11:45.471
MY RECORD.

11:45.471 --> 11:46.606
THEY STILL HIRED ME.

11:46.606 --> 11:47.440
WE'RE WORKING.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.841
SO, I WORK THERE ABOUT A MONTH.

11:48.841 --> 11:49.742
THEY CALLED ME IN THE OFFICE AND

11:49.742 --> 11:51.711
SAID, "YOUR RECORD CAME BACK.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.613
WE'VE GOT TO LET YOU GO."

11:53.613 --> 11:54.547
>> Reporter: AND THAT WAS IT?

11:54.547 --> 11:55.682
EVEN THOUGH YOU HAD DISCLOSED

11:55.682 --> 11:56.149
EVERYTHING?

11:56.149 --> 11:57.083
YOU WERE NEVER DISHONEST IN THE

11:57.083 --> 11:57.684
HIRING PROCESS?

11:57.684 --> 11:58.751
>> NEVER DISHONEST, NEVER.

11:58.751 --> 12:00.253
THEY LOOKED SO SCARED OF ME, IT

12:00.253 --> 12:01.020
WAS A SHAME.

12:01.020 --> 12:01.988
>> Reporter: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

12:01.988 --> 12:03.122
>> WHEN THEY... "WE GOT TO GET

12:03.122 --> 12:04.057
YOU OUT OF HERE.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.091
WE'VE GOT TO GET YOU OFF THE

12:05.091 --> 12:05.792
PREMISES."

12:05.792 --> 12:06.492
>> Reporter: LEWIS SAYS THAT

12:06.492 --> 12:08.227
SCENARIO PLAYED OUT OVER AND

12:08.227 --> 12:09.429
OVER AGAIN.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.030
LATER ON, HE HAD TWO OFFERS THAT

12:11.030 --> 12:12.231
WERE THEN REVOKED.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.633
HE HAD PROMISING PHONE CALLS

12:13.633 --> 12:15.001
WITH ANOTHER COMPANY THAT WENT

12:15.001 --> 12:15.935
NOWHERE.

12:15.935 --> 12:17.704
HE SAYS THE ONLY EXPLANATION HE

12:17.704 --> 12:19.505
RECEIVED: THE EXISTENCE OF

12:19.505 --> 12:21.140
CRIMES IN HIS PAST.

12:21.140 --> 12:22.542
FOUR OF THOSE COMPANIES DECLINED

12:22.542 --> 12:25.078
TO DISCUSS LEWIS' CASE WITH US.

12:25.078 --> 12:25.812
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING

12:25.812 --> 12:26.879
TO WATCH THIS, AND THEY'RE GOING

12:26.879 --> 12:27.647
TO SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:27.647 --> 12:29.315
YOU WEREN'T A KID.

12:29.315 --> 12:30.550
YOU WERE 25.

12:30.550 --> 12:31.751
YOU WERE AN ADULT.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.386
YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE DOING.

12:33.386 --> 12:34.887
AND THAT THIS IS A CONSEQUENCE.

12:34.887 --> 12:35.888
THIS IS A CONSEQUENCE OF YOUR

12:35.888 --> 12:37.423
ACTIONS."

12:37.423 --> 12:38.424
>> IF YOU SHOW ME ONE PERSON

12:38.424 --> 12:41.060
THAT HASN'T MADE A MISTAKE, THEN

12:41.060 --> 12:43.329
I WON'T APPLY NOWHERE ELSE.

12:58.244 --> 12:59.779
NUMBER OF PEOPLE INTO POVERTY

12:59.779 --> 13:01.881
AND THAT RONALD LEWIS' CASE IS

13:01.881 --> 13:03.149
HARDLY UNIQUE.

13:03.149 --> 13:04.250
>> IT'S VERY COMMON.

ONE IN THREE OF US-- HAS SOME

14:28.668 --> 14:30.303
TYPE OF CRIMINAL RECORD.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.238

14:32.238 --> 14:34.107

15:06.038 --> 15:06.839
LIKE SOMEONE'S GOT A CRIMINAL

15:23.456 --> 15:24.657
POSSIBLE IT'S GOOD FOR A

15:24.657 --> 15:25.792

15:30.530 --> 15:31.497
OF THE JOB.

MAKE AN INDIVIDUALIZED

IT WAS OVER.

19:08.381 --> 19:09.281
BUT FOR THE PAST WEEK, YOU HAVE

19:09.281 --> 19:10.516

19:18.924 --> 19:20.760

19:20.760 --> 19:22.862

19:23.896 --> 19:26.098
SOFTER LINE IN EASTERN UKRAINE,

19:26.098 --> 19:27.500
BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST

19:27.500 --> 19:29.301
WEEK IS QUITE THE OPPOSITE.

19:29.301 --> 19:31.604
NOW, RUSSIA, OF COURSE, FORMALLY

19:31.604 --> 19:33.372
DOES NOT SUPPORT THE SEPARATIST

19:33.372 --> 19:35.408
MOVEMENT HERE MILITARILY.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.743

19:39.712 --> 19:40.880

>> Sreenivasan: WHEN YOU SAY

19:43.249 --> 19:44.283
"MILITARY ESCALATION," IS THIS

19:44.283 --> 19:45.451
SIMILAR TO CRIMEA, WHERE YOU

19:45.451 --> 19:48.454
HAVE SORT OF UNMARKED UNIFORMED

19:48.454 --> 19:51.357
TROOPS ROLLING IN, IN TANKS?

19:51.357 --> 19:54.126

19:54.126 --> 19:55.361
STREETS OF DONETSK.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.296
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ASCERTAIN

19:57.296 --> 19:59.031
WHERE THEY CAME FROM PRECISELY.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.500
THE REBELS HAVE NOT TAKEN NEW

20:01.500 --> 20:02.868
GROUND IN MONTHS AND YET THEY

20:02.868 --> 20:04.403
HAVE MORE MILITARY EQUIPMENT

20:04.403 --> 20:06.505
THAN THEY DID WHEN THE CEASE-

20:06.505 --> 20:07.773
FIRE WAS SIGNED-- AT LEAST

20:07.773 --> 20:09.008
IMPRESSIONISTICALLY, FROM WHAT I

20:09.008 --> 20:10.009
SEE.

20:10.009 --> 20:10.876
NOW, THE DONETSK PEOPLE'S

20:10.876 --> 20:13.079
REPUBLIC CLAIMS TO BE OPERATING

20:13.079 --> 20:14.747
INDEPENDENTLY OF RUSSIA.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.282
AND THE ASSERTION HERE IS THAT

20:16.282 --> 20:17.983
ANY RUSSIAN WHO'S FIGHTING IN

20:17.983 --> 20:19.652
EASTERN UKRAINE IS DOING SO

20:19.652 --> 20:20.820
AS AN INDIVIDUAL, AS A

20:20.820 --> 20:22.154
VOLUNTEER, MAYBE EVEN ON

20:22.154 --> 20:24.156
VACATION, BUT CERTAINLY NOT AS

20:24.156 --> 20:25.658
AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE RUSSIAN

20:25.658 --> 20:26.525
ARMY.

20:26.525 --> 20:27.526
THERE'S BEEN A VERY AGGRESSIVE

20:27.526 --> 20:29.728
STANCE ON BOTH SIDES, REALLY.

20:29.728 --> 20:30.930
THERE'S BEEN SHELLING FROM THE

20:30.930 --> 20:32.198
UKRAINIAN SIDE INTO THE CITY OF

20:32.198 --> 20:33.365
DONETSK.

20:33.365 --> 20:35.167
A BUS STOP WAS HIT RECENTLY WITH

20:35.167 --> 20:36.735
TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES.

20:36.735 --> 20:37.736
GOING THE OTHER WAY, THERE'S

20:37.736 --> 20:38.804
BEEN SHELLING FROM THE REBEL

20:38.804 --> 20:40.806
SIDE IN UKRAINE-HELD AREAS.

20:40.806 --> 20:43.375
TODAY, OF COURSE, THERE WAS THIS

20:43.375 --> 20:45.978
DISASTROUS SHELLING IN THE CITY

20:45.978 --> 20:47.146
OF MARIUPOL.

20:47.146 --> 20:47.947
>> Sreenivasan: SO, THIS HAS

20:47.947 --> 20:49.181
BEEN ONE OF THE LEAST-EFFECTIVE

20:49.181 --> 20:50.516
CEASE-FIRES IN RECENT HISTORY.

20:50.516 --> 20:51.517
THE U.N. ESTIMATES MORE THAN

20:51.517 --> 20:52.785
1,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED

20:52.785 --> 20:53.752
AFTER IT WAS SIGNED.

20:53.752 --> 20:55.054
AND NOW, ARE THESE REBEL FORCES

20:55.054 --> 20:56.455
EMBOLDENED BY THE FACT THEY HAVE

20:56.455 --> 20:58.324
THIS MILITARY SUPPORT COMING IN

20:58.324 --> 20:59.758
FROM RUSSIA?

20:59.758 --> 21:01.594
>> I THINK THAT'S THE CASE.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.963
WITHOUT THE RUSSIAN BACKING, THE

21:03.963 --> 21:05.097
SEPARATIST MOVEMENTS WOULD HAVE

21:05.097 --> 21:07.399
CRUMBLED OR STRUCK A DEAL LONG

21:07.399 --> 21:09.001
AGO.

21:09.001 --> 21:10.069
NOW, THEY SAY THEY WANT TO

21:10.069 --> 21:12.471
EXPAND THEIR BOUNDARIES AND

21:12.471 --> 21:13.939
ULTIMATELY ACHIEVE A MORE

21:13.939 --> 21:15.875
SUSTAINABLE MINI-STATELET HERE

21:15.875 --> 21:17.143
IN EASTERN UKRAINE.

21:17.143 --> 21:17.977
>> Sreenivasan: SO, WHAT ABOUT

21:17.977 --> 21:19.812
THE LEVERAGE THAT THE WEST HAS?

21:19.812 --> 21:21.080
I MEAN, WE'VE HAD... THE

21:21.080 --> 21:22.615
SANCTIONS HAVE BEEN IN EFFECT.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.984
IT'S SQUEEZED RUSSIA'S ECONOMY.

21:24.984 --> 21:27.453
THE PRICE OF OIL HAS TUMBLED.

21:27.453 --> 21:28.420
WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY MORE

21:28.420 --> 21:29.822
LEVERS TO PULL.

21:29.822 --> 21:30.623
>> THERE COULD BE ADDITIONAL

21:30.623 --> 21:31.690
SANCTIONS.

21:31.690 --> 21:33.526
THAT SEEMS UNLIKELY GIVEN THE

21:33.526 --> 21:36.195
SANCTION FATIGUE IN EUROPE.

21:36.195 --> 21:38.564
OTHER THAN THAT, THERE'S ONLY

21:38.564 --> 21:39.431
HAND-WRINGING.

21:39.431 --> 21:40.399
MOST WESTERN GOVERNMENTS HAVE

21:40.399 --> 21:42.334
SAID THEY WILL NOT JOIN THIS

21:42.334 --> 21:44.837
FIGHT MILITARILY, GIVEN RUSSIA'S

21:44.837 --> 21:46.338
GEO-STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE AND

21:46.338 --> 21:47.573
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

21:47.573 --> 21:50.543
AND AT THIS POINT, THERE ARE NOT

21:50.543 --> 21:52.845
A LOT OF BRAKES ON THE REBEL

21:52.845 --> 21:53.846
MOVEMENT HERE IN EASTERN

21:53.846 --> 21:54.647
UKRAINE.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.315
WE HAVE ATTACKS ON THE DONETSK

21:56.315 --> 21:57.750
AIRPORT; ON THE CITY OF

21:57.750 --> 21:59.451
MARIUPOL; AND, NORTH OF DONETSK,

21:59.451 --> 22:02.021
ON A RAILROAD AND ROAD HUB THAT

22:02.021 --> 22:03.389
IS VERY VULNERABLE AT THIS

22:03.389 --> 22:03.956
POINT.

22:03.956 --> 22:04.690
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

22:04.690 --> 22:05.691
ANDREW KRAMER, JOINING US VIA

22:05.691 --> 22:07.226
SKYPE FROM THE REGIONAL CAPITOL

22:07.226 --> 22:08.727
OF DONETSK FROM UKRAINE.

22:08.727 --> 22:10.329
THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.031
>> THANK YOU.

22:14.867 --> 22:16.769
>>THIS IS PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND,

22:16.769 --> 22:18.204
SATURDAY.

22:22.041 --> 22:23.042
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW TO

22:23.042 --> 22:24.443
VIEWERS LIKE YOU, YOUR COMMENTS

22:24.443 --> 22:25.744
ABOUT OUR RECENT WORK.

22:25.744 --> 22:27.112
TONIGHT, SOME OF WHAT YOU HAD TO

22:27.112 --> 22:28.514
SAY ABOUT LAST SATURDAY'S

22:28.514 --> 22:30.349
SIGNATURE SEGMENT FROM BELGIUM

22:30.349 --> 22:31.517
DESCRIBING THAT COUNTRY'S

22:31.517 --> 22:33.285
EUTHANASIA LAWS, THE LEAST

22:33.285 --> 22:35.221
RESTRICTIVE IN THE WORLD.

22:35.221 --> 22:36.322
ONE VIEWER SAID: "I'VE SEEN

22:36.322 --> 22:38.524
PATIENTS GET GREAT COMFORT OUT

22:38.524 --> 22:39.992
OF SIMPLY KNOWING THEY HAVE THE

22:39.992 --> 22:41.860
CHOICE TO END THEIR SUFFERING.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.495
I AM, HOWEVER, SOMEWHAT DUBIOUS

22:43.495 --> 22:45.097
ABOUT USING EUTHANASIA ON

22:45.097 --> 22:46.498
PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS.

22:46.498 --> 22:47.566
NOT BECAUSE I DOUBT THEIR

22:47.566 --> 22:49.101
SUFFERING, BUT BECAUSE I DOUBT

22:49.101 --> 22:51.036
THEIR MENTAL COMPETENCY TO MAKE

22:51.036 --> 22:52.705
A LIFE ALTERING DECISION."

22:52.705 --> 22:55.140
HANA SHEALA ADDED: "I LIVE WITH

22:55.140 --> 22:56.775
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AND I HOPE

22:56.775 --> 22:58.811
EUTHANASIA WILL NOT BE LEGAL,

22:58.811 --> 22:59.812
THAT THERE ALWAYS ARE

22:59.812 --> 23:01.380
ALTERNATIVES FOR BEING SELF

23:01.380 --> 23:03.582
DETERMINED EVEN AS A VENTED

23:03.582 --> 23:05.217
FUNCTIONAL QUADRIPLEGIC."

23:05.217 --> 23:07.987
THERE WAS THIS FROM LSTCARESS:

23:07.987 --> 23:09.588
"AFTER SUFFERING FROM SEVERE

23:09.588 --> 23:11.724
DEPRESSION FOR 30 YEARS AND

23:11.724 --> 23:13.325
GROWING TIRED OF BEING A DRUGGED

23:13.325 --> 23:15.661
ZOMBIE, I'M APPALLED I'M NOT

23:15.661 --> 23:17.162
ALLOWED THIS OPTION."

23:17.162 --> 23:19.498
AND FROM MICHELLE A. MEAD: "MY

23:19.498 --> 23:21.200
MOTHER AND MY CAT WERE BOTH

23:21.200 --> 23:22.835
DYING AT THE SAME TIME.

23:22.835 --> 23:24.403
ONE OF THEM WAS ALLOWED TO DIE

23:24.403 --> 23:25.437
WITH DIGNITY.

23:25.437 --> 23:26.939
IT WAS NOT MY MOTHER."

23:26.939 --> 23:28.173
OTHERS COMMENTED ABOUT THE

23:28.173 --> 23:29.808
PROVISION IN THE BELGIAN LAW

23:29.808 --> 23:31.310
THAT ALLOWS FOR TERMINALLY ILL

23:31.310 --> 23:32.978
CHILDREN TO CHOOSE EUTHANASIA

23:32.978 --> 23:35.047
WITH THEIR PARENTS' CONSENT.

23:35.047 --> 23:37.182
BRIEE DELLA ROCCA ADDED: "I WISH

23:37.182 --> 23:38.784
WE HAD THIS IN THE STATES.

23:38.784 --> 23:40.419
EVERYONE, EVEN CHILDREN, SHOULD

23:40.419 --> 23:41.787
BE ALLOWED TO FREE THEMSELVES

23:41.787 --> 23:43.756
FROM UNENDING PAIN AND TERMINAL

23:43.756 --> 23:45.658
CONDITIONS WHERE TREATMENT IS

23:45.658 --> 23:46.892
ONLY TORTURE."

23:46.892 --> 23:48.661
BETH DEROOS SAID: "PUTTING AN

23:48.661 --> 23:50.796
INNOCENT CHILD TO DEATH BECAUSE

23:50.796 --> 23:52.031
MEDICAL 'PROFESSIONALS' OR

23:52.031 --> 23:53.666
PARENTS FEEL IT'S BEST?

23:53.666 --> 23:55.734
SORRY, BUT ACTUALLY EXECUTING A

23:55.734 --> 23:57.603
CHILD-- WHICH IS WHAT THIS IS--

23:57.603 --> 23:59.338
IS JUST SO WRONG."

23:59.338 --> 24:00.739
AND FINALLY, THERE WAS THIS,

24:00.739 --> 24:02.908
FROM HILLERY GEELON: "UNLESS

24:02.908 --> 24:04.877
YOU'RE EVER IN THAT SITUATION,

24:04.877 --> 24:06.879
NO ONE WOULD EVER BE ABLE TO

24:06.879 --> 24:07.913
JUDGE."
