02:26.213 --> 02:28.081
HELICOPTER TODAY, KILLING BOTH

02:28.081 --> 02:29.483
PILOTS ON BOARD.

02:29.483 --> 02:30.751
IT IS AT LEAST THEIR THIRD

02:30.751 --> 02:32.619
SUCCESSFUL ATTACK ON MILITARY

02:32.619 --> 02:35.022
HELICOPTERS SINCE OCTOBER.

02:35.022 --> 02:36.189
MEANWHILE, ISIS FIGHTERS HAVE

02:36.189 --> 02:37.691
BEEN GETTING A VIRTUAL BOOST

02:37.691 --> 02:40.127
FROM A TWITTER USER IN INDIA.

02:40.127 --> 02:41.028
AN EXECUTIVE CONFESSED TO

02:41.028 --> 02:43.430
TWEETING @shamiwitness FROM

02:43.430 --> 02:44.231
BANGALORE.

02:44.231 --> 02:45.699
HE BECAME ONE OF THE MOST

02:45.699 --> 02:47.234
WIDELY-READ ISIS SUPPORTERS,

02:47.234 --> 02:48.301
POSTING UPDATES ON THE GROUP’S

02:48.301 --> 02:49.636
VICTORIES AND CALLING ON MUSLIMS

02:49.636 --> 02:50.804
TO JOIN THE CAUSE.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.005
THE TWITTER ACCOUNT HAS BEEN

02:52.005 --> 02:52.939
SHUT DOWN.

02:52.939 --> 02:54.274
IT’S BEEN A PARTICULARLY DEADLY

02:54.274 --> 02:55.909
COUPLE OF DAYS IN AFGHANISTAN.

02:55.909 --> 02:57.878
THIS AFTERNOON, A SUICIDE BOMBER

02:57.878 --> 02:59.479
BLEW UP A BUS CARRYING AFGHAN

02:59.479 --> 03:01.281
ARMY PERSONNEL IN KABUL, KILLING

03:01.281 --> 03:02.449
SIX ONBOARD.

03:02.449 --> 03:03.750
EARLIER THIS MORNING, TALIBAN

03:03.750 --> 03:05.452
FIGHTERS KILLED A DOZEN SOLDIERS

03:05.452 --> 03:06.753
WHO WERE CLEARING MINES IN

03:06.753 --> 03:07.921
SOUTHERN AFGHANISTAN.

03:07.921 --> 03:10.123
YESTERDAY, A ROADSIDE BOMB HIT A

03:10.123 --> 03:11.992
CONVOY NEAR A RECENTLY CLOSED

03:11.992 --> 03:13.860
U.S.-RUN PRISON IN BAGRAM,

03:13.860 --> 03:15.262
REPORTEDLY KILLING TWO

03:15.262 --> 03:16.863
AMERICANS.

03:16.863 --> 03:17.898
ALSO IN THE MIDEAST, A FIGHT

03:17.898 --> 03:19.533
OVER LIBYA’S MOST VITAL OIL

03:19.533 --> 03:21.268
TERMINAL IS PITTING TWO FACTIONS

03:21.268 --> 03:22.402
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

03:22.402 --> 03:24.271
BOTH SIDES CLAIM THEY REPRESENT

03:24.271 --> 03:25.872
THE COUNTRY’S REAL GOVERNMENT.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.040
A FACTION OF TRIPOLI-BASED

03:27.040 --> 03:28.542
FORCES CLASHED WITH RIVALS FROM

03:28.542 --> 03:30.177
THE EASTERN CITY OF TOBRUK TO

03:30.177 --> 03:31.878
GAIN CONTROL OF THE SIDRA OIL

03:31.878 --> 03:33.380
TERMINAL TODAY.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.314
TWO PEOPLE WERE KILLED.

03:34.314 --> 03:35.849
THE FIGHT STOKES THE OBAMA

03:35.849 --> 03:37.517
ADMINISTRATION’S CONCERNS OVER

03:37.517 --> 03:39.052
MILITANT GROUPS TRAINING IN

03:39.052 --> 03:40.921
REMOTE AREAS OF LIBYA.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.456
A SOBERING DECISION BY LEADERS

03:42.456 --> 03:43.924
IN SIERRA LEONE TODAY-- THE

03:43.924 --> 03:45.225
GOVERNMENT IS BANNING PUBLIC

03:45.225 --> 03:46.560
CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR’S

03:46.560 --> 03:47.894
CELEBRATIONS, HOPING TO SLOW

03:47.894 --> 03:49.830
DOWN THE SPREAD OF EBOLA.

03:49.830 --> 03:50.897
SOLDIERS WILL PATROL THE

03:50.897 --> 03:52.065
STREETS, BREAKING UP PUBLIC

03:52.065 --> 03:52.866
GATHERINGS.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.234
SIERRA LEONE IS FACING THE WORST

03:54.234 --> 03:55.669
OF THE EBOLA OUTBREAK IN WEST

03:55.669 --> 03:57.304
AFRICA, REPORTING MORE THAN

03:57.304 --> 04:00.173
1,300 NEW CASES IN JUST THE PAST

04:00.173 --> 04:01.241
THREE WEEKS.

04:12.285 --> 04:13.120
>> Sreenivasan: WE’VE BEEN

04:13.120 --> 04:14.721
FOLLOWING THE DRAMATIC DROP IN

04:14.721 --> 04:16.423
OIL PRICES OVER THE LAST FEW

04:16.423 --> 04:17.858
WEEKS, BUT THOSE PRICES ARE JUST

04:17.858 --> 04:19.693
A SNAPSHOT OF A MUCH MORE

04:19.693 --> 04:21.628
DRAMATIC DOWNWARD TREND.

04:21.628 --> 04:23.363
OVER THE LAST YEAR, A BARREL OF

04:23.363 --> 04:28.869
OIL WENT FROM $96.47 TO $67.18.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.037
THAT’S A 30% PLUNGE.

04:31.037 --> 04:32.873
SINCE MONDAY, THE PRICE PER

04:32.873 --> 04:34.608
BARREL OF DOMESTIC SWEET CRUDE

04:34.608 --> 04:38.245
DROPPED FROM $63.13 TO $54.25, A

04:38.245 --> 04:40.213
14% SLIDE.

04:40.213 --> 04:41.381
FOR CONSUMERS, THIS MIGHT SEEM

04:41.381 --> 04:43.049
LIKE WELCOME NEWS, BUT, FOR WALL

04:43.049 --> 04:44.584
STREET, THE NUMBERS TELL A

04:44.584 --> 04:45.452
DIFFERENT STORY.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.553
HERE TO HELP US MAKE SENSE THE

04:46.553 --> 04:48.088
DOWNWARD TREND IS NICK TIMIRAOS

04:48.088 --> 04:48.922
OF THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL,"

04:48.922 --> 04:49.789
WHO’S JOINS US FROM WASHINGTON,

04:49.789 --> 04:50.690
D.C.

04:50.690 --> 04:52.325
SO THIS IS A GOOD THING FOR

04:52.325 --> 04:54.261
CONSUMERS, THE PRICE OF GAS IS

04:54.261 --> 04:55.162
DROPPING AT THE PUMP.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.329
THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE MORE

04:56.329 --> 04:58.265
MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS, RIGHT?

04:58.265 --> 04:59.132
>> YEAH, THAT’S ABSOLUTELY

04:59.132 --> 04:59.466
RIGHT.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.401
I MEAN, IN JUNE, U.S. CONSUMERS

05:01.401 --> 05:03.937
WERE PAYING ON AVERAGE $3.68 A

05:03.937 --> 05:05.972
GALLON FOR GAS.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.941
NOW WE’RE DOWN BELOW $2.60.

05:07.941 --> 05:10.343
SO THIS IS A SURPRISE WINDFALL

05:10.343 --> 05:11.545
AND IT REALLY BENEFITS THE

05:11.545 --> 05:12.812
MIDDLE CLASS BECAUSE THE MIDDLE

05:12.812 --> 05:14.014
CLASS AND LOWER INCOME

05:14.014 --> 05:15.815
HOUSEHOLDS SPEND A HIGHER SHARE

05:15.815 --> 05:17.450
OF THEIR INCOME, AND GAS

05:17.450 --> 05:19.085
ACCOUNTS FOR A HIGHER SHARE OF

05:19.085 --> 05:21.354
THEIR SPENDING THAN IT DOES FOR

05:21.354 --> 05:21.988
THE AVERAGE.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.623
SO IT REALLY IS A MIDDLE CLASS

05:23.623 --> 05:25.959
TAX CUT ON THE ORDER OF $125

05:25.959 --> 05:28.495
BILLION A YEAR IF PRICES ARE

05:28.495 --> 05:29.663
SUSTAINED AT THESE LEVELS.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.298
>> Sreenivasan: SO IF PEOPLE

05:31.298 --> 05:32.666
HAVE MORE MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS

05:32.666 --> 05:33.767
AND THEY GO OUT AND PERHAPS THEY

05:33.767 --> 05:35.268
DO A LITTLE BIT MORE HOLIDAY

05:35.268 --> 05:37.003
SHOPPING OR THEY JUICE THE

05:37.003 --> 05:38.939
ECONOMY UP A LITTLE BIT MORE,

05:38.939 --> 05:40.173
WHAT’S HAPPENING TO WALL STREET?

05:40.173 --> 05:41.841
WHY DOES WALL STREET START TO

05:41.841 --> 05:44.044
TUMBLE EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE HAVE

05:44.044 --> 05:45.212
MORE MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS?

05:45.212 --> 05:47.147
>> WELL, BECAUSE, THIS HAS BEEN

05:47.147 --> 05:47.948
A BIG SURPRISE.

05:47.948 --> 05:50.050
A 45% DROP IN THE PRICE OF CRUDE

05:50.050 --> 05:52.018
OIL SINCE JUNE, THAT’S GOING TO

05:52.018 --> 05:53.620
CREATE A LOT OF VOLATILITY,

05:53.620 --> 05:54.788
AND WALL STREET DOESN’T

05:54.788 --> 05:55.922
NECESSARILY LIKE THAT.

05:55.922 --> 05:58.158
ONE OF THE BIG REASONS OIL HAS

05:58.158 --> 05:59.759
FALLEN IS BECAUSE OF A SLOW-DOWN

05:59.759 --> 06:02.362
IN DEMAND IN EUROPE AND JAPAN

06:02.362 --> 06:03.563
WHERE THERE ARE WORRIES ABOUT

06:03.563 --> 06:04.431
DEFLATION.

06:04.431 --> 06:05.765
AND THEN, OF COURSE, IN CHINA,

06:05.765 --> 06:07.100
WHICH HAS BEEN A HUGE ECONOMIC

06:07.100 --> 06:08.668
GROWTH STORY FOR THE PAST 15

06:08.668 --> 06:09.436
YEARS.

06:09.436 --> 06:10.737
SO THESE CONCERNS THAT THE REST

06:10.737 --> 06:12.105
OF THE WORLD MIGHT BE SLOWING

06:12.105 --> 06:13.907
DOWN, THAT’S WHAT’S REALLY

06:13.907 --> 06:15.242
CAUSING SOME CONCERN ON WALL

06:15.242 --> 06:16.042
STREET.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.777
AND THEN YOU ALSO HAD SOME

06:17.777 --> 06:19.846
TREMENDOUS ENERGY INVESTMENT IN

06:19.846 --> 06:21.448
THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE A LOT

06:21.448 --> 06:23.216
OF THE SURGE IN THE SUPPLY OF

06:23.216 --> 06:24.784
OIL HAS BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT FROM

06:24.784 --> 06:26.419
FRACKING IN NORTHICA DAKOTA AND

06:26.419 --> 06:28.088
TEXAS, SO YOU’VE HAD A LOT OF

06:28.088 --> 06:29.489
SMALL COMPANIES RAISE A LOT OF

06:29.489 --> 06:32.325
DEBT FROM THE NEW FRACKING BOOM.

06:32.325 --> 06:34.127
AND WITH OIL PRICES FALLING, IT

06:34.127 --> 06:36.463
CALLS INTO QUESTION THE BUSINESS

06:36.463 --> 06:37.631
PROSPECTS FOR SOME OF THOSE

06:37.631 --> 06:38.498
COMPANIES.

06:38.498 --> 06:39.366
>> Sreenivasan: IS THERE KIND

06:39.366 --> 06:40.934
OF A TIPPING POINT OR BASEMENT

06:40.934 --> 06:42.836
THAT IS NECESSARY FOR THE PRICE

06:42.836 --> 06:44.771
TO BE AT FOR AN OIL COMPANY TO

06:44.771 --> 06:45.705
SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT, IT MAKES

06:45.705 --> 06:47.340
SENSE TO ME TO DIG A HOLE IN THE

06:47.340 --> 06:48.775
GROUND AND INVEST $1 MILLION TO

06:48.775 --> 06:49.776
FIND ANOTHER WELL OR TO

06:49.776 --> 06:52.178
EXTRACT OIL FROM ANOTHER WELL"?

06:52.178 --> 06:53.580
>> YEAH, WE ARE TESTING THOSE

06:53.580 --> 06:54.514
PRICES RIGHT NOW.

06:54.514 --> 06:55.649
I MEAN, A FEW MONTHS AGO, WHEN

06:55.649 --> 06:58.084
OIL WAS AT $80, PEOPLE SAID,

06:58.084 --> 06:59.486
WELL, MAYBE $70 WOULD BE THE

06:59.486 --> 07:00.887
BREAK-EVEN, MAYBE $60 A

07:00.887 --> 07:02.322
BARREL WOULD BE THE BREAK-EVEN.

07:02.322 --> 07:04.057

07:04.057 --> 07:04.424

07:04.424 --> 07:05.792

THE NEXT FEW MONTHS.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.862
ALREADY YOU’RE SEEING DRILL WELL

COUNTS, THE NUMBER OF DRILLS IN

07:11.131 --> 07:12.699
THE GROUND IN THE U.S., GOING

07:12.699 --> 07:13.233
DOWN.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.934

07:25.645 --> 07:27.280
EFFECT, WE’RE ALSO SEEING THE

07:27.280 --> 07:30.450
RUSSIAN ECONOMY OR THE IRANIANS,

07:30.450 --> 07:32.485
OTHER OIL PRODUCERS ARE UP IN

07:32.485 --> 07:33.753

07:33.753 --> 07:35.021
>> YEAH, I MEAN, THIS IS NOT

07:35.021 --> 07:37.424

07:37.424 --> 07:39.225
NOT GOOD NEWS FOR VLADIMIR PUTIN

07:39.225 --> 07:41.194
IN RUSSIA, BUT IT’S GREAT NEWS

07:41.194 --> 07:41.995
FOR THE U.S.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.430
EVEN THOUGH THE U.S. HAS HAD AN

07:43.430 --> 07:45.131
ENERGY BOOM AND SO THERE ARE

07:45.131 --> 07:47.167
MORE RISKS NOW TO A DROP IN OIL

07:47.167 --> 07:49.235
PRICES THAN IN THE PAST FOR THE

07:49.235 --> 07:51.471
UNITED STATES, THE REWARDS STILL

07:51.471 --> 07:52.739
OUTWEIGH THOSE RISKS.

07:52.739 --> 07:54.240
THIS IS STILL NET POSITIVE FOR

07:54.240 --> 07:55.342
THE UNITED STATES’ ECONOMY

07:55.342 --> 07:57.744
BECAUSE WE STILL ARE ON NET AN

07:57.744 --> 07:59.746
IMPORTER OF OIL, SO WHEN OIL

07:59.746 --> 08:01.114
PRICES GOES DOWN, THAT’S GOING

08:01.114 --> 08:02.482
TO BE GREAT FOR CONSUMERS.

AND CONSUMERS REALLY, YOU

13:59.072 --> 14:01.407
ALLOTMENT WAS CUT OFF, MARY

14:01.407 --> 14:03.476
MORTGAGED HER HOME, PLUNKED DOWN

14:03.476 --> 14:06.879
ALMOST $200,000 TO DRILL A WELL.

14:06.879 --> 14:08.514
IT SAVED HER FARM.

14:08.514 --> 14:09.682
HOW HARD WAS THAT DECISION?

14:09.682 --> 14:12.552
>> IT WASN’T HARD BECAUSE WE HAD

14:12.552 --> 14:14.087
ALREADY INVESTED SO MUCH.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.054
WE CAN’T STOP NOW.

14:15.054 --> 14:16.022
WE DON’T KNOW WHAT’S GOING TO

14:16.022 --> 14:17.657
HAPPEN NEXT YEAR OR THE OTHER,

14:17.657 --> 14:19.158
BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP GOING

14:19.158 --> 14:21.227
FORWARD BECAUSE WE GOT

14:21.227 --> 14:23.429
EVERYTHING, OUR WHOLE LIFE,

14:23.429 --> 14:25.398
INVESTED IN THIS 84 ACRES.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.199
>> Reporter: WHICH IS WHY

14:26.199 --> 14:28.301
FARMERS LIKE MARY WHO CAN AFFORD

14:28.301 --> 14:30.036
IT ARE DRILLING MORE WELLS THAN

14:30.036 --> 14:31.037
EVER.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.805
DRILLING CREWS ARE ARRIVING FROM

14:32.805 --> 14:35.208
ACROSS THE WEST, ADDING TO LOCAL

14:35.208 --> 14:36.976
DRILLERS WHO CAN’T KEEP UP WITH

14:36.976 --> 14:38.044
THE DEMAND.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.545
IF WE WANT TO DRILL A WELL IN

14:39.545 --> 14:41.581
OUR FARM, HOW SOON COULD YOU DO

14:41.581 --> 14:42.215
IT?

14:42.215 --> 14:43.349
>> WE’RE ANYWHERE FROM EIGHT

14:43.349 --> 14:44.584
MONTHS TO A YEAR AND A HALF

14:44.584 --> 14:45.351
BEHIND.

14:45.351 --> 14:46.786
>> Reporter: BUT MORE WORRISOME

14:46.786 --> 14:48.888
IS THAT SO MUCH WATER IS BEING

14:48.888 --> 14:50.857
PUMPED FROM UNDERGROUND TO

14:50.857 --> 14:52.492
REPLACE WATER LOST IN THIS

14:52.492 --> 14:54.794
DROUGHT THAT FEW PEOPLE BELIEVE

14:54.794 --> 14:56.796
IT CAN BE SUSTAINED.

14:56.796 --> 14:58.297
WELLS ARE GOING DRY, AND

14:58.297 --> 15:00.099
DRILLERS ARE FORCED TO GO DEEPER

15:00.099 --> 15:01.801
TO FIND WATER.

15:01.801 --> 15:03.469
THIS WELL, LOCATED 16 MILES FROM

15:03.469 --> 15:05.204
MAIN STREET, IS HEADED DOWN

15:05.204 --> 15:09.475
1,600 FEET, 350 FEET DEEPER THAN

15:09.475 --> 15:10.943
THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING IS

15:10.943 --> 15:11.677
HIGH.

15:11.677 --> 15:12.979
TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU FEEL LIKE

15:12.979 --> 15:15.281
WE CAN ONLY PUNCH SO MANY HOLES

15:15.281 --> 15:17.784
AND PULL OUT SO MUCH WATER

15:17.784 --> 15:19.085
BEFORE WE REALLY START SEEING

15:19.085 --> 15:20.386
HUGE PROBLEMS?

15:20.386 --> 15:22.622
>> WELL, I MEAN, WE’RE TO THAT

15:22.622 --> 15:23.856
STAGE RIGHT NOW, I THINK,

15:23.856 --> 15:25.691
BECAUSE THE DEEPER YOU GO ON

15:25.691 --> 15:26.893
SOME OF THIS, YOU’RE LOSING OUT

15:26.893 --> 15:28.528
ON WATER QUALITY, TOO.

15:28.528 --> 15:29.462
YOU’RE GOING TO GET DOWN SO DEEP

15:29.462 --> 15:30.830
AND THE WATER’S GOING TO START

15:30.830 --> 15:31.998
GETTING SALTY ON YOU.

15:31.998 --> 15:33.566
>> SO THIS GROVE HAS NOT HAD

15:33.566 --> 15:35.101
WATER ON IT IN A WHOLE YEAR.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.502
>> Reporter: RANDY WELDON IS A

15:36.502 --> 15:37.637
LOCAL GROWER.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.071
HE SHOWED US HOW FARMERS WHO

15:39.071 --> 15:40.840
COULD NOT AFFORD TO DRILL WELLS

15:40.840 --> 15:42.508
HELPLESSLY WATCHED THEIR

15:42.508 --> 15:43.776
ORCHARDS DIE.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.679
THESE ORANGE TREES ARE DEAD, AND

15:46.679 --> 15:48.214
THERE ARE THOUSANDS JUST LIKE

15:48.214 --> 15:50.116
THEM NOT FAR FROM DELANO’S MAIN

15:50.116 --> 15:50.716
STREET.

15:50.716 --> 15:52.018
>> IT’S HEARTBREAKING.

15:52.018 --> 15:53.352
IN A LOT OF CASES, THE FARMERS

15:53.352 --> 15:54.720
HAVE THEIR HEART AND SOUL INTO

15:54.720 --> 15:57.523
THIS LAND, AND IT’S LIKE LOSING

15:57.523 --> 16:00.193
A PART OF YOUR FAMILY, YOU KNOW.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.328
AND ECONOMICALLY, IT’S

16:02.328 --> 16:04.063
DISASTROUS.

16:04.063 --> 16:05.064
>> Reporter: IN CALIFORNIA,

16:05.064 --> 16:06.766
WATER IS CONSIDERED A PROPERTY

16:06.766 --> 16:08.668
RIGHT, SO FARMERS ARE FREE TO

16:08.668 --> 16:10.303
DRILL AS MUCH AS THEY WANT, AS

16:10.303 --> 16:11.437
LONG AS ITS ON THEIR OWN

16:11.437 --> 16:12.138
PROPERTY.

16:12.138 --> 16:14.040
ALL THEY NEED IS A PERMIT.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.008
BUT NO ONE KNOWS HOW MUCH WATER

16:16.008 --> 16:17.710
FARMERS ARE PULLING FROM THE

16:17.710 --> 16:20.079
UNDERGROUND AQUIFER-- THAT’S THE

16:20.079 --> 16:22.348
NATURAL RESERVOIR ACCUMULATED

16:22.348 --> 16:23.983
OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS FROM

16:23.983 --> 16:26.319
RAIN AND SNOW-- AND NO ONE KNOWS

16:26.319 --> 16:28.821
HOW MUCH WATER IS LEFT.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.489
IF AN AQUIFER IS LIKE A SAVINGS

16:30.489 --> 16:32.425
ACCOUNT, THIS IS A RUN ON THE

16:32.425 --> 16:35.094
BANK, A RACE TO THE BOTTOM.

16:35.094 --> 16:36.429
>> IT’S BEEN OVER 50 YEARS SINCE

16:36.429 --> 16:37.697
WE BUILT THE STATE WATER

16:37.697 --> 16:38.331
PROJECT.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.332
>> Reporter: AT THE URGING OF

16:39.332 --> 16:40.499
GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN,

16:40.499 --> 16:42.001
CALIFORNIA VOTERS THIS YEAR

16:42.001 --> 16:43.569
AGREED THEY HAD TO BE BETTER

16:43.569 --> 16:45.638
PREPARED FOR A DROUGHT, SO THEY

16:45.638 --> 16:48.841
PASSED A $7.5 BILLION BOND FOR

16:48.841 --> 16:49.876
BUILDING WATER STORAGE

16:49.876 --> 16:52.111
FACILITIES AND WATER RECYCLING

16:52.111 --> 16:53.112
PROJECTS.

16:53.112 --> 16:54.981
THIS ESCALATING THIRST FOR WATER

16:54.981 --> 16:57.149
HAS ALSO LED TO SOME SURPRISING

16:57.149 --> 16:58.417
PARTNERSHIPS.

16:58.417 --> 17:00.887
FOR EXAMPLE, 21 MILLION GALLONS

17:00.887 --> 17:03.222
OF WATER EVERY DAY FLOW INTO THE

17:03.222 --> 17:05.524
CAWELO RESERVOIR, WATER HELPING

17:05.524 --> 17:07.793
SAVE 90 DESPERATE FARMERS SOUTH

17:07.793 --> 17:08.828
OF DELANO.

17:08.828 --> 17:10.730
THE WATER COMES FROM-- OF ALL

17:10.730 --> 17:12.698
PLACES-- HERE.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.800
THIS IS CHEVRON’S KERN RIVER OIL

17:14.800 --> 17:16.903
FIELD JUST 35 MILES SOUTH OF

17:16.903 --> 17:18.304
DELANO’S MAIN STREET.

17:18.304 --> 17:20.473
IT’S THE THIRD LARGEST OIL

17:20.473 --> 17:22.308
PRODUCING FIELD IN THE STATE,

17:22.308 --> 17:24.343
MORE THAN 70,000 BARRELS PER

17:24.343 --> 17:25.344
DAY.

17:25.344 --> 17:26.512
BUT IN THE PROCESS OF

17:26.512 --> 17:28.281
RETRIEVING THE OIL, CHEVRON

17:28.281 --> 17:31.584
PULLS UP MORE WATER, A LOT MORE.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.286
THE WATER IS USED FOR STEAM TO

17:33.286 --> 17:34.487
HELP RECOVER THE OIL

17:34.487 --> 17:36.589
UNDERGROUND AND THEN SEPARATED

17:36.589 --> 17:39.158
FROM THE OIL, CLEANED AND PUMPED

17:39.158 --> 17:40.559
THROUGH PIPELINES TO THE

17:40.559 --> 17:42.128
RESERVOIR AND THE WAITING

17:42.128 --> 17:43.296
FARMERS.

17:43.296 --> 17:44.497
>> FOR EVERY TEN BARRELS OF

17:44.497 --> 17:46.332
FLUID THAT WE PRODUCED FROM KERN

17:46.332 --> 17:48.434
RIVER FIELD, NINE OF THOSE ARE

17:48.434 --> 17:49.268
WATER.

17:49.268 --> 17:51.070
ONE BARREL OF OIL TO NINE

17:51.070 --> 17:52.471
BARRELS OF WATER.

17:52.471 --> 17:54.240

18:06.018 --> 18:07.687
EVERY CASH REGISTER.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.522
NO ONE, OF COURSE, KNOWS WHEN

18:09.522 --> 18:10.890
THE DROUGHT WILL END.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.792
ONLY THAT UNTIL IT DOES, LIFE IN

18:12.792 --> 18:15.194
AND AROUND DELANO FEELS HARDER,

18:15.194 --> 18:16.862
FURTHER BEYOND THEIR CONTROL

18:16.862 --> 18:18.831
THAN THEY’D LIKE, AND THAT THE

18:18.831 --> 18:20.599
THINGS THEY HOLD DEAR HERE IN

18:20.599 --> 18:23.869
THIS RICH VALLEY ARE SUDDENLY IN

18:25.738 --> 18:26.672
HARDER AND HARDER TO BE A

18:26.672 --> 18:27.406
RANCHER.

18:27.406 --> 18:28.407
WE NEED THE RAIN.

18:28.407 --> 18:29.475
EVERYONE DOES.

18:29.475 --> 18:31.410
>> IF WE DON’T GET RAIN THIS

18:31.410 --> 18:33.479
YEAR, WE’RE IN FOR SOME REALLY

18:33.479 --> 18:34.914
BAD TIMES.

BECAUSE THIS IS OUR LIFE, AND

18:37.550 --> 18:38.851
WE’RE HERE BECAUSE WE WANT TO

18:55.868 --> 18:56.769
>> Sreenivasan: THIS WEEK, THE

18:56.769 --> 18:57.903
ASSOCIATED PRESS REVEALED THAT

18:57.903 --> 18:58.971
THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

18:58.971 --> 19:01.007
ATTEMPTED AND FAILED TO CO-OPT

19:01.007 --> 19:03.376
THE HIP-HOP SCENE IN CUBA TO

19:03.376 --> 19:05.444
"SPARK A YOUTH MOVEMENT AGAINST

19:05.444 --> 19:06.379
THE GOVERNMENT."

19:06.379 --> 19:08.247
THIS FAILURE COMES ON THE HEELS

19:08.247 --> 19:09.648
OF TWO OTHERS ALSO REPORTED BY

19:09.648 --> 19:11.450
THE A.P.-- ONE TO CREATE A FAKE

19:11.450 --> 19:13.185
"CUBAN TWITTER" AND THE OTHER TO

19:13.185 --> 19:14.587
SEND YOUNG PEOPLE INTO CUBA TO

19:14.587 --> 19:16.188
RECRUIT ACTIVISTS.

19:16.188 --> 19:17.156
HERE TO HELP US MAKE SENSE OF

19:17.156 --> 19:18.557
THIS STORY IS TRISH WILSON OF

19:18.557 --> 19:20.059
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, WHO JOINS

19:20.059 --> 19:21.527
ME NOW FROM WASHINGTON, D.C.

19:21.527 --> 19:22.728
SO, TRISH, WHAT WAS THIS

19:22.728 --> 19:23.429
PROGRAM?

19:23.429 --> 19:25.531
HOW DID IT WORK?

19:25.531 --> 19:26.932
>> WELL, THE INTENT WAS TO

19:26.932 --> 19:28.401
RADICALIZE THE CUBAN PEOPLE TO

19:28.401 --> 19:30.102
CHALLENGE THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT.

19:30.102 --> 19:31.771
AND THE WAY IT WORKED WAS THAT

19:31.771 --> 19:33.806
U.S.A.I.D. CONTRACTORS

19:33.806 --> 19:35.541
INFILTRATED THE HIP-HOP SCENE

19:35.541 --> 19:37.443
AND WERE TRYING TO GENERATE A

19:37.443 --> 19:39.178
FAN BASE THAT WOULD SPEAK OUT

19:39.178 --> 19:40.046
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND

19:40.046 --> 19:41.614
CHALLENGE IT AND ULTIMATELY LEAD

19:41.614 --> 19:43.382
THEM TO DEMOCRATIC REFORMS.

19:43.382 --> 19:44.083
>> Sreenivasan: HOW DID THEY

19:44.083 --> 19:46.318
SORT OF TRY TO FOMENT MORE

19:46.318 --> 19:47.086
DISSENT?

19:47.086 --> 19:50.256
WHO DID THEY HAVE ON THE GROUND?

19:50.256 --> 19:52.058
>> WELL, U.S.A.I.D. ACTIVITIES

19:52.058 --> 19:53.959
IN CUBA ARE ILLEGAL THERE, AND

19:53.959 --> 19:55.327
PEOPLE WHO OPERATE OR

19:55.327 --> 19:56.262
PARTICIPATE IN THOSE THOSE

19:56.262 --> 19:57.463
PROGRAMS CAN GO TO JAIL.

19:57.463 --> 19:58.497
SO WHAT THE U.S.A.I.D.

19:58.497 --> 20:00.132
CONTRACTORS DID IS, THEY WENT TO

20:00.132 --> 20:03.169
SERBIA, WHERE THEY RECRUITED TWO

20:03.169 --> 20:05.438
SERBIAN MUSIC PROMOTERS TO HELP

20:05.438 --> 20:06.205
THEM IN CUBA.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.306
THE REASON WHY THEY THOUGHT THIS

20:07.306 --> 20:08.607
WOULD WORK WAS BECAUSE, IN

20:08.607 --> 20:10.576
2000, IT WAS A YOUTH MOVEMENT

20:10.576 --> 20:12.711
AND STUDENT PROTEST CONCERTS IN

20:12.711 --> 20:14.313
SERBIA THAT HELPED BRING DOWN

20:14.313 --> 20:16.248
THE PRESIDENCY OF SLOBODAN

20:16.248 --> 20:16.882
MIL0SEVIC.

20:16.882 --> 20:17.683
>> Sreenivasan: SO, THERE WAS

20:17.683 --> 20:19.785
ALREADY A COMMUNITY THERE, THERE

20:19.785 --> 20:22.588
WAS ALREADY CITIZEN SPEECH

20:22.588 --> 20:23.756
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT THAT WAS

20:23.756 --> 20:24.523
HAPPENING?

20:24.523 --> 20:26.025
>> OH, YES.

20:26.025 --> 20:27.893
THE HIP-HOP SCENE WAS PRETTY

20:27.893 --> 20:29.728
MUCH AT ITS PEAK AT THAT TIME.

20:29.728 --> 20:30.896
THE ARTISTS WERE SPEAKING OUT

20:30.896 --> 20:32.098
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.

20:32.098 --> 20:33.466
IT WAS... IT TOOK A LOT OF

20:33.466 --> 20:34.834
PEOPLE, I THINK, BY SURPRISE TO

20:34.834 --> 20:35.968
REALIZE HOW MUCH DISSENT WAS

20:35.968 --> 20:37.570
ALLOWED IN CUBA AT THE TIME.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.838
BUT THE ARTISTS THAT U.S.A.I.D.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.506
WAS FOCUSING ON WERE CALLED LOS

20:40.506 --> 20:44.510
ALDEANOS, AND THEY HAD A SONG

20:44.510 --> 20:46.112
CALLED "RAP IS WAR."

20:46.112 --> 20:47.179
>> Sreenivasan: AND SO, WHERE

20:47.179 --> 20:48.047
DID THIS GO WRONG?

20:48.047 --> 20:49.181
HOW DID THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT

20:49.181 --> 20:49.849
FIND OUT?

20:49.849 --> 20:51.150
WHAT WERE THE REPERCUSSIONS OF

20:51.150 --> 20:52.218
THIS PROGRAM?

20:52.218 --> 20:52.985
>> WELL, THE PEOPLE THAT WERE

20:52.985 --> 20:55.087
PART OF THE PROGRAM KEPT GETTING

20:55.087 --> 20:56.589
DETAINED BY THE CUBAN OFFICIALS,

20:56.589 --> 20:57.556
WHO WOULD GO THROUGH THEIR

20:57.556 --> 20:59.325
COMPUTERS AND THEIR THUMB DRIVES

20:59.325 --> 21:00.426
AND WERE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO

21:00.426 --> 21:02.161
FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON.

21:02.161 --> 21:03.996
THE U.S.A.I.D. CONTRACTORS

21:03.996 --> 21:06.432
CONTINUED TO GO THROUGH CUSTOMS

21:06.432 --> 21:08.634
WITH THEIR COMPUTERS, AND THEY

21:08.634 --> 21:10.803
WERE DETAINED SO MANY TIMES THAT

21:10.803 --> 21:12.271
THE CUBANS ULTIMATELY FIGURED IT

21:12.271 --> 21:12.738
OUT.

21:12.738 --> 21:13.539
>> Sreenivasan: AND SO, WHAT

21:13.539 --> 21:15.141
HAPPENED AS A RESULT, SAY, TO

21:15.141 --> 21:16.208
THE BAND MEMBERS?

21:16.208 --> 21:17.343
>> WELL, ONE OF THE KEY THINGS

21:17.343 --> 21:18.711
THAT HAPPENED IS THAT THERE WAS

21:18.711 --> 21:20.279
AN INDEPENDENT MUSIC CONCERT

21:20.279 --> 21:23.516
FESTIVAL IN CUBA AT THE TIME.

21:23.516 --> 21:27.686
AND AT THE CONCERT IN 2010, THE

21:27.686 --> 21:29.421
LOS ALDEANOS PERFORMED BEFORE A

21:29.421 --> 21:31.157
BIG CROWD OF 15,000, THE BIGGEST

21:31.157 --> 21:32.024
CROWD EVER,

21:32.024 --> 21:33.292
BUT AFTERWARDS, THE CUBANS

21:33.292 --> 21:34.960
FIGURED OUT THAT THE CONCERT WAS

21:34.960 --> 21:37.263
ACTUALLY FUNDED BY U.S.A.I.D.,

21:37.263 --> 21:38.931
SO THEY TOOK IT OVER AND THAT

21:38.931 --> 21:40.799
ENDED THE BIG, INDEPENDENT MUSIC

21:40.799 --> 21:41.867
FESTIVAL THAT EXISTED ON THE

21:41.867 --> 21:42.801
ISLAND AT THE TIME.

21:42.801 --> 21:43.736
>> Sreenivasan: MOST PEOPLE IN

21:43.736 --> 21:44.670
THE AUDIENCE ARE ALSO GOING TO

21:44.670 --> 21:46.839
WONDER WHAT DOES U.S.A.I.D. HAVE

21:46.839 --> 21:47.873
TO DO WITH ANY OF THIS?

21:47.873 --> 21:48.607
I MEAN, WHEN WE THINK OF

21:48.607 --> 21:49.642
U.S.A.I.D., USUALLY WE’RE

21:49.642 --> 21:51.477
THINKING OF BAGS OF FOODS IN

21:51.477 --> 21:52.645
COUNTRIES THAT ARE DESPERATE

21:52.645 --> 21:53.646
FOR FOOD.

21:53.646 --> 21:54.680
HOW DOES THIS LINE UP WITH THE

21:54.680 --> 21:56.282
MISSION?

21:56.282 --> 21:57.483
>> WELL, BEYOND ITS

21:57.483 --> 21:58.984
HUMANITARIAN MISSION, PART OF

21:58.984 --> 22:00.719
U.S.A.I.D.’S MISSION IS TO

22:00.719 --> 22:02.188
PROMOTE DEMOCRACY EFFORTS AROUND

22:02.188 --> 22:04.089
THE WORLD, SO THIS IS ONE OF

22:04.089 --> 22:06.058
THOSE PRO-DEMOCRACY EFFORTS.

22:06.058 --> 22:07.159
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT, TRISH

22:07.159 --> 22:08.060
WILSON JOINING US FROM

22:08.060 --> 22:09.195
WASHINGTON, D.C. FROM THE

22:09.195 --> 22:10.329
ASSOCIATED PRESS, THANKS SO

22:10.329 --> 22:10.829
MUCH.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.665
>> THANK YOU.

22:59.078 --> 22:16.669
>>THIS IS PBSNEWSHOUR

22:16.669 --> 22:18.237
WEEKEND, SATURDAY.

22:24.310 --> 22:25.044
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW TO

22:25.044 --> 22:25.978
"VIEWERS LIKE YOU."

22:25.978 --> 22:27.346
WE BEGIN WITH YOUR COMMENTS ON

22:27.346 --> 22:28.414
THE CONVERSATION WE HAD ABOUT

22:28.414 --> 22:29.648
STUDENT LOANS AND THE NEW

22:29.648 --> 22:31.250
OPTIONS THAT ALLOW BORROWERS TO

22:31.250 --> 22:33.485
MODIFY THE TERMS OF THEIR LOANS.

22:33.485 --> 22:35.321
PANHEAD20 WROTE: "WHEN THE

22:35.321 --> 22:36.522
GOVERNMENT GIVES BILLIONS TO THE

22:36.522 --> 22:38.824
BANKSTERS AT 0% INTEREST AND

22:38.824 --> 22:40.326
THEN CHARGES STRUGGLING STUDENTS

22:40.326 --> 22:42.394
4%-PLUS THAT WILL HAUNT THEM

22:42.394 --> 22:43.796
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES,

22:43.796 --> 22:46.232
WELCOME TO INDENTURED SERVITUDE.

22:46.232 --> 22:47.433
:("

22:47.433 --> 22:48.801
CHRISTOPHER GERSTLE COMMENTED:

22:48.801 --> 22:50.269
"IF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES

22:50.269 --> 22:51.904
HAVE TO EDUCATE MORE THAN TWICE

22:51.904 --> 22:53.572
THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THEY ONCE

22:53.572 --> 22:55.474
DID BUT HAVE LESS MONEY TO DO

22:55.474 --> 22:56.875
IT, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING

22:56.875 --> 22:57.676
TO HAPPEN?

22:57.676 --> 22:59.011
SCHOOLS EITHER HAVE TO RAISE

22:59.011 --> 23:00.379
MORE CAPITAL FROM PRIVATE

23:00.379 --> 23:02.781
SOURCES OR RAISE TUITION."

23:02.781 --> 23:04.116
SCOTT TUCKER TOOK A BROADER

23:04.116 --> 23:04.683
VIEW:

23:04.683 --> 23:06.352
"THE AMERICAN COLLEGE DEGREE HAS

23:06.352 --> 23:08.053
BEEN DIMINISHED BY LOWER

23:08.053 --> 23:09.588
STANDARDS FOR ACHIEVEMENT AND

23:09.588 --> 23:11.457
THE FALSE NARRATIVE THAT NO ONE

23:11.457 --> 23:12.958
CAN MAKE IT WITHOUT ONE.

23:12.958 --> 23:14.460
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES LIKE GERMANY

23:14.460 --> 23:15.928
FOR EXAMPLE, PROVIDE FREE

23:15.928 --> 23:17.763
COLLEGE EDUCATION TO ANYONE WHO

23:17.763 --> 23:18.998
PROVES THEY’RE GENUINELY

23:18.998 --> 23:21.033
INTERESTED AND THEIR INTENT IS

23:21.033 --> 23:22.568
WORTHY OF THE DEGREE.

23:22.568 --> 23:24.303
WE ARE BEING OUTPACED BY SUCH

23:24.303 --> 23:26.038
NATIONS AS THEY SEEM TO VALUE

23:26.038 --> 23:27.906
QUALITY OVER QUANTITY."

23:27.906 --> 23:29.775
AND JOHN FRAZIER HAD THE END IN

23:29.775 --> 23:30.542
SIGHT:

23:30.542 --> 23:32.011
"IN TWO MONTHS, MAKING THE LAST

23:32.011 --> 23:34.146
PAYMENT AFTER MY SON GRADUATED

23:34.146 --> 23:35.681
12 YEARS AGO."

23:35.681 --> 23:37.283
COMMENTS ABOUT OUR SEGMENT ON A

23:37.283 --> 23:39.018
LAWSUIT IN CALIFORNIA THAT

23:39.018 --> 23:40.286
CHALLENGED CURRENT TEACHER

23:40.286 --> 23:41.820
TENURE REGULATIONS IN THAT STATE

23:41.820 --> 23:43.756
WERE MOSTLY DIVIDED INTO TWO

23:43.756 --> 23:44.556
CAMPS.

23:44.556 --> 23:45.557
PURP CHITEN WROTE:

23:45.557 --> 23:46.792
"NOBODY IS GOING TO WANT TO GO

23:46.792 --> 23:48.227
INTO THE FIELD AND UNDERGO THE

23:48.227 --> 23:50.062
’TORTURE’ AND ’SLAVE LABOR’ OF

23:50.062 --> 23:51.764
BEING A TEACHER IF THERE IS NO

23:51.764 --> 23:53.432
PROTECTION FOR THEM SUCH AS

23:53.432 --> 23:54.199
TENURE."

23:54.199 --> 23:55.401
AND THERE WAS THIS FROM

23:55.401 --> 23:56.635
BLAKENAUSTIN:

23:56.635 --> 23:58.837
"SENIORITY AND QUALITY HAVE VERY

23:58.837 --> 23:59.905
LITTLE IN COMMON.

23:59.905 --> 24:01.573
SENIORITY SHOULD NOT LEAD TO

24:01.573 --> 24:02.174
TENURE.

24:02.174 --> 24:03.542
SENIORITY SHOULD NOT BE THE

24:03.542 --> 24:05.177
DOMINANT FACTOR IN SETTING

24:05.177 --> 24:06.078
SALARIES."

24:24.196 --> 24:25.264
>> Sreenivasan: FINALLY TONIGHT,

24:25.264 --> 24:27.066
THE SENATE HAS PASSED A FOUR-DAY

24:27.066 --> 24:28.801
SPENDING BILL TO GIVE THEM MORE

24:28.801 --> 24:30.602
TIME TO DEBATE A $1.1 TRILLION

24:30.602 --> 24:31.704
BUDGET PACKAGE.

24:31.704 --> 24:32.738
SENATE MAJORITY LEADER HARRY

24:32.738 --> 24:34.373
REID IS ALSO TRYING TO PUSH

24:34.373 --> 24:35.307
THROUGH SOME OF THE PRESIDENT’S

24:35.307 --> 24:37.242
MOST CONTESTED NOMINEES BEFORE

24:37.242 --> 24:38.644
REPUBLICANS TAKE CONTROL IN

24:38.644 --> 24:39.511
JANUARY.

24:39.511 --> 24:40.512
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS IS

24:40.512 --> 24:41.980
REPORTING THAT FOR THE SECOND

24:41.980 --> 24:43.315
TIME THIS YEAR, A RUSSIAN

24:43.315 --> 24:45.250
MILITARY AIRCRAFT REPORTEDLY

24:45.250 --> 24:47.353
TURNED OFF ITS TRANSPONDERS AND

24:47.353 --> 24:48.987
NEARLY COLLIDED WITH A PASSENGER

24:48.987 --> 24:50.289
JET OVER SWEDEN.

24:50.289 --> 24:51.423
THE RUSSIAN PLANE WAS APPARENTLY

24:51.423 --> 24:53.158
TRYING TO AVOID COMMERCIAL

24:53.158 --> 24:53.859
RADAR.

24:53.859 --> 24:54.993
THAT’S IT FOR THIS EDITION OF

24:54.993 --> 24:55.928
PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

24:55.928 --> 24:56.862
I’M HARI SREENIVASAN.

24:56.862 --> 24:58.697
THANKS FOR WATCHING.
