JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:01.700 --> 00:03.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:03.166 --> 00:05.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
parsing the president.

00:05.166 --> 00:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We break down Mr. Trump's
latest statements in a barrage
of interviews and tweets.

00:10.533 --> 00:14.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, we continue our series on
South Sudan's brutal civil war
with a look at the devastating

00:15.933 --> 00:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
food shortage facing those
forced to flee their homes.

00:19.666 --> 00:24.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: These are the
roots of the water lily flowers.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is all people in this part
of South Sudan have to eat.

00:27.933 --> 00:29.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's muddy.

00:29.433 --> 00:31.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It has very little nutritional
value and is deeply unpleasant.

00:31.766 --> 00:36.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And how one
county in California is cutting
the high costs of asthma with a

00:38.733 --> 00:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
home care program focused
on keeping kids healthy
and out of the E.R.

00:42.833 --> 00:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDA NEUHAUSER, University
of California, Berkeley: In
Alameda County alone, we might

00:46.633 --> 00:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be able to save as much as
$16 million a year just on
hospitalizations of children.

00:53.933 --> 00:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:02.533 --> 01:05.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:05.633 --> 01:10.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President
Trump and Russia's President
Vladimir Putin have been on the

01:14.833 --> 01:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
phone again, and they agreed
to step up diplomacy in Syria.

01:19.233 --> 01:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The two men spoke today for
the first time since the U.S.
attacked a Syrian air base

01:24.033 --> 01:25.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last month.

01:25.633 --> 01:29.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Earlier, Putin met
with Chancellor Angela
Merkel in Sochi, Russia.

01:29.666 --> 01:33.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He claimed again that
Moscow didn't meddle
in the U.S. election.

01:33.800 --> 01:37.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through
translator): We never
interfere into political

01:37.500 --> 01:42.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lives and political processes
in other countries, and
we would very much like
that nobody interfered

01:42.466 --> 01:45.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into our political life and into
the political life in Russia.

01:45.833 --> 01:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are just rumors used
in the internal political
struggle in the U.S.

01:49.633 --> 01:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile,
Hillary Clinton said today
that Putin certainly interfered

01:54.033 --> 01:57.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in order to help Donald
Trump and defeat her.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. intelligence agencies and
the Congress are investigating
whether the Russians coordinated

02:03.133 --> 02:05.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with Trump aides
during the campaign.

02:05.100 --> 02:09.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The head of Thailand's military
junta says he is now expecting
much-improved relations

02:11.233 --> 02:13.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with the U.S.

02:13.333 --> 02:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They cooled sharply after he
seized power in a 2014 coup
and became prime minister.

02:19.500 --> 02:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, today, he said President
Trump assured him in a weekend
phone call that -- quote

02:25.000 --> 02:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
- - "Thai-U.S. relations will
now be closer than ever before."

02:28.066 --> 02:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president also invited
him to visit the White House.

02:31.700 --> 02:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump gave out conflicting
messages today on the compromise
measure to fund the government

02:37.900 --> 02:39.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
through the end of
this fiscal year.

02:39.933 --> 02:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, in a tweet, he signaled
displeasure, and suggested
shutting the government down

02:45.100 --> 02:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the next budget fight.

02:47.233 --> 02:50.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Later, though, as he honored
the Air Force Academy football
team, he praised the spending

02:52.300 --> 02:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deal, and said -- quote -- "This
is what winning looks like."

02:54.400 --> 02:58.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: This bill is
a clear win for the American

02:58.700 --> 03:00.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

03:00.866 --> 03:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We brought lawmakers together
from both sides of the aisle
to deliver a budget that funds

03:06.700 --> 03:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the rebuilding of the United
States military, makes historic
investments in border security,

03:12.433 --> 03:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and provides health care for
our miners and school choice
for our disadvantaged children.

03:19.366 --> 03:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Later,
White House Budget Director
Mick Mulvaney said Mr.
Trump is unhappy with

03:24.633 --> 03:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
portrayals that Democrats
won the budget fight.

03:26.666 --> 03:29.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY, White House
Budget Director: The president
is frustrated with the fact

03:29.766 --> 03:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he negotiated in good
faith with the Democrats and
they went out to try and spike

03:32.866 --> 03:34.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the football and
make him look bad.

03:34.933 --> 03:37.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It doesn't surprise me at
all that his frustrations
were manifested in that way.

03:37.466 --> 03:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have got a lot to do
-- we have got a lot to
between now and September.

03:41.366 --> 03:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't anticipate a shutdown in
September, but, if negotiations
-- if the Democrats aren't

03:46.300 --> 03:49.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to behave any better than
they have in the last couple
of days, it may be inevitable.

03:49.666 --> 03:53.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The leader of
Senate Democrats, Chuck Schumer,
said that shutting down the

03:53.266 --> 03:56.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
government at any time
would be a bad idea.

03:56.233 --> 04:01.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A guilty plea today from
a white former policeman
who shot a black man
to death in Charleston,

04:02.133 --> 04:04.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
South Carolina.

04:04.266 --> 04:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michael Slager shot Walter
Scott five times as Scott
ran from his car in 2015.

04:10.600 --> 04:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A state court jury deadlocked
on murder charges, but, today,
Slager pleaded to federal civil

04:15.700 --> 04:17.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rights violations.

04:17.366 --> 04:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Under the deal, the state
agreed to drop its murder case.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
No sentencing date was set.

04:22.800 --> 04:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are two reports tonight
that the Justice Department
will not charge police officers

04:27.500 --> 04:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Baton Rouge, Louisiana,
in the killing of Alton
Sterling last July.

04:33.866 --> 04:35.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was shot dead after
being pinned on the ground.

04:35.766 --> 04:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the incident was
videotaped and sparked tense
protests in that city.

04:40.433 --> 04:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A little over a week later,
a gunman killed three
Baton Rouge officers.

04:47.400 --> 04:50.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There's word today that
the overall death rate
among African-Americans
dropped sharply

04:51.166 --> 04:53.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from 1999 to 2015.

04:53.266 --> 04:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention reports that it
fell 25 percent in that period.

05:00.566 --> 05:03.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, the overall life
expectancy for African-Americans
is still four years less
than that for whites.

05:06.033 --> 05:11.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Black Americans are also
far more likely to die
of heart disease and
cancer than are whites.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Airline executives found
themselves in the hot seat at
a congressional hearing today

05:17.700 --> 05:20.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on the issue of
overbooking flights.

05:20.266 --> 05:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It followed United Airlines'
forced removal of a passenger
who refused to give up his

05:25.033 --> 05:26.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
seat last month.

05:26.866 --> 05:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
United CEO Oscar Munoz
was one of four airline
representatives at the hearing.

05:33.233 --> 05:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He called the incident a
turning point for his company.

05:35.733 --> 05:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OSCAR MUNOZ, CEO,
United Airlines: It will
accelerate, at least from
United's perspective,

05:39.266 --> 05:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and as you heard from others,
this will make us better.

05:41.500 --> 05:46.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Once you sit on our aircraft
and you are on a seat, other
than for safety or security

05:46.200 --> 05:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reasons, we will not
take you off that flight.

05:48.433 --> 05:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Republicans
and Democrats alike warned
the airlines to shape up.

05:53.066 --> 05:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Committee Chair Representative
Bill Shuster said customer
service had better improve,

05:57.833 --> 05:58.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or else.

05:58.833 --> 06:00.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

06:00.733 --> 06:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BILL SHUSTER (R), Pennsylvania:
Get together collectively
and figure this out.

06:02.700 --> 06:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Seize this opportunity, because,
if you don't, we're going to
come, and you're not going

06:08.166 --> 06:10.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to like it.

06:10.233 --> 06:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: United reached
a settlement with the ejected
passenger last week for an

06:12.600 --> 06:14.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
undisclosed sum.

06:14.166 --> 06:17.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
U.S. auto sales
tumbled last month.

06:17.666 --> 06:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Six major companies
today reported weaker
showings than a year ago.

06:21.900 --> 06:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, on Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial average gained
36 points to close near 20950.

06:28.933 --> 06:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose more than
three points, and the S&amp;P
500 added nearly three.

06:34.900 --> 06:38.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the ripple effects of what
President Trump says and tweets;

06:40.933 --> 06:44.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the world's newest country
devolving into war and famine;
does a Netflix hit push its

06:46.833 --> 06:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
portrayal of teen suicide
too far?; and much more.

07:04.833 --> 07:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump has given a
flurry of interviews in the past
week or so to commemorate his

07:09.100 --> 07:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
first 100 days in office.

07:11.500 --> 07:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he made a dizzying amount
of news, giving controversial
and, at times, contradictory

07:18.033 --> 07:21.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
comments on topics
ranging from North Korea
to the U.S. Civil War.

07:21.266 --> 07:26.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To try to make sense of it all,
we are joined now by our own
Lisa Desjardins, by Yeganeh

07:26.900 --> 07:28.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Torbati.

07:28.133 --> 07:30.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She's a State Department
reporter for Reuters.

07:30.533 --> 07:34.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And Julie Davis, she
covers the White House
for The New York Times.

07:34.300 --> 07:36.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we welcome all three
of you to the program.

07:36.833 --> 07:41.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Let's talk first about
the president's comments
about the health care
bill, this replacement

07:41.833 --> 07:43.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bill.

07:43.766 --> 07:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lisa, he was asked some pointed
questions over the weekend,
CBS' John Dickerson, in

07:46.800 --> 07:48.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an interview for
"Face the Nation."

07:48.200 --> 07:50.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Here is some of that interview.

07:50.266 --> 07:51.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Let's watch.

07:51.766 --> 07:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN DICKERSON, Host, "Face
The Nation": They are worried.

07:55.700 --> 07:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are they going to have the
guarantee of coverage if
they have a preexisting
condition, or if

07:58.733 --> 08:02.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they live in a state where the
governor decides that's not a
part of the health care, or that

08:02.866 --> 08:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the prices are going to go up?

08:04.033 --> 08:05.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's the worry.

08:05.300 --> 08:06.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The American Medical
Association says...

08:06.833 --> 08:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: We actually...

08:08.900 --> 08:10.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN DICKERSON: ... it
could effectively make
coverage completely
unaffordable for people.

08:10.900 --> 08:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Yes, we
actually have -- well,
forget about unaffordable.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What's unaffordable
is Obamacare, John.

08:14.233 --> 08:16.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

08:16.366 --> 08:18.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN DICKERSON: So, I'm
not hearing you, Mr.
President, say there's a
guarantee of preexisting

08:18.200 --> 08:20.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
conditions.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We actually
have -- we actually have
a clause that guarantees.

08:22.366 --> 08:25.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lisa, today,
there are Republicans saying
this newly reworked legislation

08:27.200 --> 08:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doesn't guarantee preexisting
conditions will be covered.

08:31.133 --> 08:32.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's going on here?

08:32.600 --> 08:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And it's
changed one major vote, Judy.

08:33.533 --> 08:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's Fred Upton of Michigan.

08:35.633 --> 08:39.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our viewers might be familiar
with him because he used to
chair the committee that wrote

08:39.066 --> 08:41.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
health care policy.

08:41.166 --> 08:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says he's now a no vote on
the Republican plan as it stands
now, because he says preexisting

08:45.233 --> 08:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conditions are not protected
in this latest version.

08:48.333 --> 08:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It seemed that either President
Trump didn't exactly understand
the latest version, or

08:52.533 --> 08:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was talking about not
the preexisting waivers
that states could get,
but perhaps the high-risk

09:00.000 --> 09:03.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pools that they're hoping
states use to protect those
folks who have preexisting
medical conditions.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And at one
point in that interview,
Julie Davis, the president
did refer to pools.

09:07.533 --> 09:09.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What do you think
was going on there?

09:09.566 --> 09:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIE DAVIS, The New York Times:
Well, I think what we're hearing
is a president who doesn't

09:12.000 --> 09:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like to get very steeped in
the details of policy, and
what he wants to emphasize is

09:16.800 --> 09:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his message, which is that he
wants everyone to be covered
as effectively and as fulsomely

09:22.966 --> 09:25.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as they are under the
Affordable Care Act.

09:25.033 --> 09:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The problem is, members of
Congress have to vote on an
actual piece of legislation, and

09:29.100 --> 09:31.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're looking at a bill that
doesn't do what he says it does.

09:31.766 --> 09:36.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that's why we're seeing this
initiative stall yet again, and
it sounds like the president's

09:38.233 --> 09:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rhetoric is out of step with
what is actually happening.

09:40.533 --> 09:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, as we
mentioned, this is to all three
of you, we mentioned a minute

09:43.833 --> 09:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago in our news summary,
there is also conflicting
language coming out of
the White House today

09:48.733 --> 09:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the spending plan that
was agreed to in the last few
days between Democrats and

09:54.800 --> 09:55.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Republicans.

09:55.800 --> 09:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Democrats are saying, we won.

09:57.800 --> 10:01.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Republicans, some of
them are acknowledging
that Democrats got
the better of this.

10:01.433 --> 10:04.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president tweeted this
morning -- and, Julie, I'm going
to come back to you on this

10:04.366 --> 10:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - he said, "The reason for
the plan negotiated between the
Republicans and the Democrats

10:08.233 --> 10:11.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is, we need 60 votes in the
Senate, which are not there.

10:11.400 --> 10:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We," he said, "either elect
more Republican senators in
2018 or we change the rules now

10:17.100 --> 10:18.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to 51 percent.

10:18.800 --> 10:23.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Our country needs a good
shutdown in September
to fix this mess."

10:23.466 --> 10:25.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He sounds frustrated, Julie.

10:25.066 --> 10:27.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIE DAVIS: He is frustrated.

10:27.166 --> 10:31.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we heard from his
OMB director, his budget
director, Mick Mulvaney,
this afternoon, that

10:31.700 --> 10:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he thought that those tweets
were because of the president's
frustration, not that he

10:35.266 --> 10:38.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
didn't want -- get what he
wanted in the deal, according to
the White House, but that they

10:38.766 --> 10:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were acting, that Democrats
were acting like they had won,
when, in fact, you know, the

10:43.300 --> 10:46.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president had been
negotiating in good
faith, Mr. Mulvaney said.

10:46.066 --> 10:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fact is, the president did
have to come to the table and
Republicans in Congress did

10:50.400 --> 10:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and compromise to get a
spending agreement through.

10:53.133 --> 10:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And while most presidents
would be spending this time
saying, we got a lot of what we

11:00.666 --> 11:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wanted, it was a good
compromise, I showed that
I was willing to come
to the table, instead,

11:03.200 --> 11:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president started the
day really emphasizing
how willing he is to
sort of spark a partisan

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
conflict in the next go-round.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, rather than enjoying
the fact that he was able to
broker a compromise that most

11:15.166 --> 11:18.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people thought it was going
to be difficult for him to do,
he is now looking forward to

11:18.766 --> 11:22.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the next negotiation and
saying, well, I'm ready
to torpedo that one.

11:22.066 --> 11:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And how is that
received on the hill, Lisa?

11:24.233 --> 11:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes, that
was a big lead balloon on the
Hill, Republicans shaking their

11:27.666 --> 11:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
heads, openly saying, no,
none of this makes sense.

11:30.133 --> 11:32.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We don't want a
shutdown, actually.

11:32.066 --> 11:36.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It achieves nothing, with
very exceptions, they were
saying, and also saying, on the

11:36.266 --> 11:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senate side, Senate Republican
Leader Mitch McConnell was
adamant with reporters today,

11:40.833 --> 11:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying the vast majority
of the Senate does not
want to change the rules.

11:44.300 --> 11:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We heard from top to bottom
they feel that those rules do
protect the minority in a way

11:49.033 --> 11:50.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that both parties
agree on right now.

11:50.800 --> 11:53.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So he's out of step.

11:53.333 --> 11:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there was a lot of
head-shaking, a lot of
question marks about
exactly what the president

11:55.900 --> 11:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is trying to achieve here.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So,
Yeganeh, I want to bring
you in now, because I
want to share this clip.

12:00.800 --> 12:04.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This is the president's
interview yesterday
with Bloomberg News
in which he was asked

12:04.566 --> 12:09.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about North Korea, and, of
course, its young dictator,
Kim Jong-un, came up.

12:10.300 --> 12:11.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's listen to this.

12:11.233 --> 12:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is an audio interview.

12:13.400 --> 12:17.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: We have
a potentially very bad
situation that we will
meet in the toughest

12:21.266 --> 12:23.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of all manners if
we have to do that.

12:23.533 --> 12:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it would be appropriate
for me to meet with him, I
would absolutely -- I would be

12:30.166 --> 12:32.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
honored to do it.

12:32.533 --> 12:37.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If it's under the -- again,
under the right circumstances.

12:37.466 --> 12:39.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But I would -- I would do that.

12:39.200 --> 12:42.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, he's
honored to meet with the
dictator of North Korea.

12:42.133 --> 12:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How is that being received at
the State Department and abroad?

12:44.500 --> 12:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEGANEH TORBATI, Reuters: Right.

12:46.666 --> 12:50.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think the question
here is that it's not
so much a fundamental
shift in U.S. policy.

12:52.533 --> 12:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you will remember during
the 2008 presidential campaign,
former President Obama said that

12:55.366 --> 12:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's no reason why
we shouldn't meet with
rogue nations in order to
advance U.S. interests.

12:59.900 --> 13:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's true.

13:02.066 --> 13:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YEGANEH TORBATI: It's really
the wording of saying that he
would be honored to meet with

13:04.333 --> 13:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kim Jong-un, who is someone
that, you know, U.S. officials
have said violates his own

13:08.133 --> 13:12.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
people's rights and
is ruling really North
Korea with an iron grip.

13:12.066 --> 13:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think that sort of
language, especially coming on
the heels of his interview last

13:16.366 --> 13:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
week, one in which he said
that there's a potential for
a major, major conflict with

13:20.933 --> 13:25.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
North Korea, causes a
little bit of whiplash
within the bureaucracy,
especially the national

13:27.133 --> 13:29.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
security bureaucracy
here in Washington.

13:29.666 --> 13:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The State Department, the
Pentagon, the Treasury
Department, they're
all looking for signals

13:31.733 --> 13:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the president as to sort
of what their talking points
and what their policy should

13:35.400 --> 13:36.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
be.

13:36.833 --> 13:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's a little bit
contradictory at the moment.

13:38.833 --> 13:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Lisa, on
the Hill, again, you have so
many members looking to see how

13:42.033 --> 13:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president speaks about these
very sensitive international,
national security question.

13:48.466 --> 13:50.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: There is
no lack of reaction to this.

13:50.500 --> 13:53.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, of course, as
expected, Democrats said
this was a problem, but
many Republicans did

13:53.833 --> 13:55.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as well.

13:55.900 --> 13:59.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Senate Foreign Relations
Chairman Bob Corker
told reporters the
president's iPhone needs

13:59.033 --> 14:00.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be taken away.

14:00.666 --> 14:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John McCain, Armed Services
chairman, went farther.

14:03.400 --> 14:05.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He said that he thought
this was disturbing.

14:05.933 --> 14:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it is both serious, and
to some degree people aren't
taking the president seriously

14:10.733 --> 14:11.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as well.

14:11.733 --> 14:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's a problem for him.

14:13.800 --> 14:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I did speak to one source in
Trump world who spent a lot
of time with the president who

14:16.866 --> 14:21.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said he's a disrupter, and
that people should realize he's
trying to find solutions, so

14:21.266 --> 14:24.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he is both hot and
cold at the same time.

14:24.433 --> 14:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Washington doesn't know how
to deal with that, and that's
what we're seeing right now.

14:28.166 --> 14:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The last excerpt
I want to share with the
audience brings up the Civil

14:34.566 --> 14:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
War, and I'm going to come back
to you, Julie, on this one.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The president was talking.

14:38.033 --> 14:41.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This is in an interview
he did a couple of days
ago with Sirius radio.

14:41.033 --> 14:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was being interviewed by
the reporter Salena Zito, and
Andrew Jackson, president Andrew

14:47.666 --> 14:49.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jackson''s name came up.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's listen to that.

14:51.566 --> 14:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I mean, had
Andrew Jackson been a little
later, you wouldn't have had the

14:54.633 --> 14:57.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Civil War.

14:57.100 --> 15:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was -- he was a very tough
person, but he had a big heart.

15:05.133 --> 15:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he was really angry that
he saw what was happening
with regard to the Civil War.

15:11.066 --> 15:13.200 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
He said, there's
reason for this.

15:13.200 --> 15:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Julie Davis,
we know President Andrew Jackson
died 16 years before the Civil

15:18.800 --> 15:20.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
War started.

15:20.833 --> 15:23.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president was trying to
clean this up a little bit
on Twitter this morning.

15:23.966 --> 15:26.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What are they saying
at the White House?

15:26.033 --> 15:30.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIE DAVIS: Well, I think, as
with many of his tweets, they
weren't professing to know

15:31.666 --> 15:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
exactly what he meant
when he made that comment.

15:34.533 --> 15:38.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think one of the more
charitable explanations
was that the was talking
about the nullification

15:38.866 --> 15:42.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crisis, when the Southern
states wanted to secede,
and he was against that.

15:42.966 --> 15:47.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, really, I mean, historians
point out that this is a
president who is really not

15:49.866 --> 15:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
steeped in the details of
history, even sort of the broad
outlines of history, the way

15:54.233 --> 15:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that many presidents have been.

15:56.266 --> 16:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, he's not interested in
the details, so much as he's
making the point, Andrew Jackson

16:00.133 --> 16:05.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a populist who he has said
he very much admires and sort
of wants to fashion himself

16:05.533 --> 16:07.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
after.

16:07.066 --> 16:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The question, though, is, Andrew
Jackson was also a slave owner.

16:09.633 --> 16:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to the degree that he might
have been suggesting that there
might have been a solution

16:13.633 --> 16:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
short of the Civil War that
would have ended the conflict,
but preserved slavery or some

16:17.933 --> 16:22.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
element of it, that had
people really concerned,
and that had both historians
and other analysts

16:24.933 --> 16:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just sort of scratching
their heads, like, why would
you make a point like that?

16:26.866 --> 16:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just one of those comments
that left I think a little
bit more of a mess than he

16:32.233 --> 16:34.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
intended.

16:34.766 --> 16:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Yeganeh
Torbati, obviously, the
Civil War, they don't
have to worry about

16:36.000 --> 16:36.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that any more at the
State Department.

16:36.900 --> 16:38.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

16:38.900 --> 16:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But they do
obviously consider the way the
president uses language and the

16:42.300 --> 16:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way he speaks about and his
knowledge of American history.

16:49.200 --> 16:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do the diplomats you speak
with, those who pay attention
to the sensitivities of

16:53.766 --> 16:55.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all this, say?

16:55.866 --> 16:59.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YEGANEH TORBATI: There is some
concern that our allies and
our rivals abroad, U.S. allies

17:01.733 --> 17:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and rivals abroad, are somewhat
behind closed doors a little
bit mocking of some of the

17:07.500 --> 17:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things that President Trump
says, and U.S. diplomats sort
of just have to kind of grin

17:10.333 --> 17:12.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and bear it.

17:12.333 --> 17:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's not much they can really
say either in defense or sort
of an explanation, because

17:16.033 --> 17:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're not really sure
themselves what the president
might be getting at.

17:19.933 --> 17:24.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a broader question of,
when he makes these kind of
contradictory remarks or remarks

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where he's sort of whipsawing
from sort of statement to
statement, you know, do the rank

17:31.333 --> 17:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and file, do the bureaucrats
within the National
Security Agency, do they
know which direction

17:35.633 --> 17:39.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to follow when they're
trying to sort of set
the agenda for meetings?

17:39.333 --> 17:42.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're not quite sure right
now, because they usually get
their signal, their policy

17:42.466 --> 17:44.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
signal from the president.

17:44.066 --> 17:46.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it's not really
clear right now.

17:46.633 --> 17:50.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even if Secretary of State
Tillerson or Secretary
of Defense Mattis are
very consistent in their

17:50.600 --> 17:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
own messaging, the State
Department and the Pentagon may
not sort of -- the right hand

17:54.833 --> 17:58.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may know what the left hand
is doing, and so that's sort
of the concern that diplomats

17:58.866 --> 18:01.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at least have right now.

18:01.066 --> 18:04.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's a
reminder that every word
out of the president's
mouth has repercussions

18:04.366 --> 18:09.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Capitol Hill, elsewhere
around the executive
branch, Julie and Yeganeh,
completely, around

18:11.333 --> 18:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the world, not just in the
diplomatic community here, but
literally around the globe.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yeganeh Torbati, Julie Davis,
Lisa Desjardins, we thank you.

18:16.566 --> 18:17.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEGANEH TORBATI: Thank you.

18:17.566 --> 18:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Thank you.

18:20.233 --> 18:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIE DAVIS: Thanks, Judy.

18:27.300 --> 18:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last night,
we brought you a look at the
brutal civil war ravaging South

18:34.900 --> 18:37.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Sudan and the lives
it has scarred.

18:37.400 --> 18:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, another
calamity afflicting South
Sudan, a famine, caused
by drought and man.

18:44.333 --> 18:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The United Nations estimates
40 percent of the country's
people are at risk.

18:50.133 --> 18:53.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again in partnership with
the Pulitzer Center on Crisis
Reporting, special correspondent

18:53.466 --> 18:56.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jane Ferguson reports.

18:56.266 --> 19:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: She studies
with focus and poise.

19:03.200 --> 19:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rebecca looks like a typical
student next to her classmates
in Thoahnom (ph) school,

19:06.633 --> 19:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a remote area of South
Sudan, but few of them have been
through what she has endured.

19:13.500 --> 19:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her family fled for their
lives when government
soldiers raided their village.

19:18.533 --> 19:21.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They survived by hiding
in swamps for two weeks.

19:21.000 --> 19:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBECCA RIAK CHOL, South
Sudan (through translator):
When we fled our village,
we were 28 people.

19:26.300 --> 19:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
When we got here, we were 24.

19:28.666 --> 19:30.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Two were shot and
two died of hunger.

19:30.633 --> 19:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: One of those who
died was her 13-year-old sister.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rebecca watched her grow
weak and starve to death.

19:37.533 --> 19:41.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REBECCA RIAK CHOL
(through translator):
We didn't have anything
to dig with to bury her,

19:41.966 --> 19:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so we just put grass on
the body and left it there.

19:44.733 --> 19:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Marco
Nuer is 16 years old and
also goes to school here.

19:51.766 --> 19:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two months ago, he made it
to this village with what
remained of his family.

19:53.733 --> 19:58.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCO NUER, South Sudan (through
translator): When we fled
the fighting, I saw at least

19:58.066 --> 19:59.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
20 people killed.

19:59.666 --> 20:02.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Along the road later,
people died of hunger.

20:02.366 --> 20:07.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: His brother,
sister and father were among
those who died of starvation.

20:09.366 --> 20:13.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The trauma of their
loss haunts him.

20:13.200 --> 20:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both Rebecca and Marco have
found safety in this village
controlled by rebel gunmen.

20:20.166 --> 20:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rebecca's family have been
given this small hut to
shelter in by local people.

20:23.166 --> 20:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her mom, Tipasa, tries to sell
tea to make extra money for
food, but it's never enough,

20:30.366 --> 20:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so she forages in the marshes.

20:32.966 --> 20:36.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
These are the roots of
the water lily flowers.

20:36.233 --> 20:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is all people in this part
of South Sudan have to eat.

20:40.433 --> 20:41.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's muddy.

20:41.966 --> 20:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It has very little nutritional
value and is deeply unpleasant.

20:45.300 --> 20:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is what they ate when
they were hiding in the bush,
too, and how countless numbers

20:49.900 --> 20:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of people in South Sudan are
trying to survive, on the run
from government troops targeting

20:55.800 --> 20:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them because of their tribe.

20:58.433 --> 21:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A split between president Salva
Kiir and his vice president,
Riek Machar, in 2013 tore

21:04.566 --> 21:08.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
apart the country,
sparking a civil war.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Both sides have been
accused of war crimes.

21:11.133 --> 21:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most recently, government
soldiers have been
attacking communities of
tribes seen as supportive

21:18.100 --> 21:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Machar's rebel fighters,
killing civilians and forcing
large groups of people to flee.

21:23.433 --> 21:25.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They run into these
massive swamps.

21:25.666 --> 21:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is a good hiding place from
soldiers hunting them, but
there is nothing to eat here, so

21:32.100 --> 21:35.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
famine has come to both
Marco and Rebecca's homes.

21:35.766 --> 21:39.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is a cruel
manmade disaster.

21:39.400 --> 21:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is food in South Sudan,
but many have had to leave
it behind when they flee.

21:47.100 --> 21:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Food is being dropped by aid
agencies to the most desperate.

21:55.833 --> 22:00.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Those with the strength
come out of hiding to
get lifesaving supplies.

22:00.400 --> 22:03.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is Leer, the famine
area where Marco is from.

22:03.900 --> 22:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People here used to grow their
own vegetables and farm cattle.

22:07.266 --> 22:12.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When they ran for their lives
into the bush, they left behind
any way of feeding themselves.

22:15.100 --> 22:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The International Committee
of the Red Cross is giving
them tools and seeds.

22:19.100 --> 22:24.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they plant maize now, they
can harvest it by August,
if they live that long.

22:26.066 --> 22:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In many ways, this area is
symbolic of the link between
war and hunger in South Sudan.

22:32.200 --> 22:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An area where aid agencies
are giving out food to local
people, they say this once was

22:36.233 --> 22:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a vibrant marketplace, until
government troops came in
and burned it to the ground.

22:42.833 --> 22:46.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And now the only thing
left of that market is
just ash on the ground.

22:46.133 --> 22:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The numbers of those in
need here are staggering;
100,000 people are right
now starving to death

22:52.766 --> 22:54.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
across the country.

22:54.600 --> 22:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Millions more are on the brink.

22:56.633 --> 23:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEEPMALA MAHLA, Mercy Corps:
Before I came here, I thought,
I know the drill, I have

23:00.533 --> 23:02.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been there.

23:02.533 --> 23:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have never seen anything more
complicated, more saddening
as compared to South Sudan;

23:07.700 --> 23:09.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
4.8 million people do
not have enough food.

23:09.866 --> 23:12.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It really shocks me.

23:12.466 --> 23:16.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Deepmala
Mahla runs the U.S.-based
charity Mercy Corps'
operation in South Sudan.

23:17.266 --> 23:19.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She is not optimistic
for the future.

23:19.800 --> 23:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEEPMALA MAHLA: I have
to say the gap between
being brink of starvation
and actually starving,

23:23.433 --> 23:25.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there isn't a whole
lot of time left.

23:25.566 --> 23:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It happens -- the deterioration
happens pretty fast.

23:29.066 --> 23:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: South Sudan
is the most dangerous
place in the world for
aid workers, yet people

23:35.233 --> 23:37.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
here desperately
needs their help.

23:37.700 --> 23:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Over 80 have been killed since
the war started, a fifth of
those in this year so far alone.

23:44.533 --> 23:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Aid agencies often
struggle to reach people
starving in the wilderness.

23:48.233 --> 23:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Flying for hundreds of miles
over this vast country, you
rarely see even a dirt road.

23:55.300 --> 23:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's in these remote areas
where people are dying,
far from the world's view.

24:01.366 --> 24:05.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People in urban areas like the
capital, Juba, can get help.

24:05.266 --> 24:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
International Medical
Corps runs this hospital.

24:08.366 --> 24:13.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the intensive care ward
for children, Dr. Sadia
Azam shows us how she
diagnoses malnutrition.

24:14.300 --> 24:16.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, she is in danger?

24:16.233 --> 24:18.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

24:18.133 --> 24:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SADIA AZAM, International
Medical Corps: Yes,
she is in danger.

24:20.133 --> 24:22.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She is really
acute malnourished.

24:22.466 --> 24:24.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JANE FERGUSON: What's
causing that for her?

24:24.733 --> 24:25.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

24:25.866 --> 24:27.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SADIA AZAM: The
children are like this.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Their bodies are very fragile.

24:29.700 --> 24:31.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are very weak.

24:31.433 --> 24:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: And weak bodies
can't fight off deadly diseases.

24:36.066 --> 24:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One-and-a-half-year-old
Nyagoah also has pneumonia.

24:39.633 --> 24:44.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This hospital exists
largely because of U.S.
government funding.

24:44.500 --> 24:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
American money is responsible
for much of the aid relief
in South Sudan, whether it's

24:48.600 --> 24:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
food drops from planes
or the seeds and tools
distributed in famine areas.

24:55.666 --> 24:58.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cuts to foreign aid proposed
by the Trump administration
could mean less money makes

24:58.400 --> 24:59.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it here.

24:59.400 --> 25:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And charities are nervous.

25:01.633 --> 25:05.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Jason Straziuso is the
regional spokesperson
for the International
Committee of the Red

25:05.566 --> 25:07.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Cross.

25:07.600 --> 25:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JASON STRAZIUSO, International
Committee of the Red Cross: The
United States is the largest

25:09.133 --> 25:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
single supporter of the ICRC, a
substantial part of our budget.

25:13.800 --> 25:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we view this
American generosity and
goodwill as vital to our
operations, as vital to our

25:21.633 --> 25:24.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
humanitarian assistance
around the world.

25:24.766 --> 25:29.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JANE FERGUSON: Rebecca
escaped the horrors of
widespread killings,
only to face starvation

25:30.500 --> 25:32.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the wilderness.

25:32.566 --> 25:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Famine will continue to stalk
families like hers in this
country for as long as people

25:36.400 --> 25:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cannot peacefully farm their
cattle and grow food at home.

25:40.766 --> 25:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the war that drives
hunger here is far from over.

25:44.400 --> 25:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Jane Ferguson in
Unity State, South Sudan.

25:51.366 --> 25:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In her final
report tomorrow, Jane brings us
the stories of women in South

25:56.833 --> 26:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sudan who have survived rape
used as a weapon of war.

26:10.600 --> 26:12.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Stay with us.

26:12.666 --> 26:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
home visits that cut back on
the risks and cost of asthma;

26:18.566 --> 26:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and from our "NewsHour"
Bookshelf, a new perspective
on a polarizing president.

26:24.066 --> 26:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But first: Can a dramatic
depiction of suicide go too far?

26:28.033 --> 26:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A new series on Netflix about
a teenage girl's tragic death
has some school districts and

26:35.100 --> 26:39.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mental health experts worried
that the show has gone beyond
just entertainment, and could

26:39.900 --> 26:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pose a threat to young students.

26:41.766 --> 26:43.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham
explores the controversy.

26:43.566 --> 26:46.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's part of our weekly
series Making the Grade.

26:46.200 --> 26:49.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And a warning: The story
contains graphic content.

26:49.466 --> 26:53.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KATHERINE LANGFORD,
Actress: Some of you cared.

26:53.766 --> 26:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
None of you cared enough.

26:55.966 --> 26:58.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Neither did I.

26:58.100 --> 27:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: "13 Reasons
Why" tells the fictional story
of Hannah Baker, a 17-year-old

27:04.133 --> 27:06.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
high school student
who takes her own life.

27:06.733 --> 27:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hannah leaves behind 13 cassette
tapes, where she narrates
the events leading up to her

27:12.200 --> 27:13.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
suicide.

27:13.433 --> 27:14.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KATHERINE LANGFORD:
Hey, it's Hannah.

27:14.100 --> 27:16.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hannah Baker.

27:16.133 --> 27:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Each tape
centers around one person, and,
in it, Hannah tries to explain

27:21.233 --> 27:24.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
why that person was or wasn't
to blame for her death.

27:24.533 --> 27:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHERINE LANGFORD: Don't
adjust your -- whatever
device you're hearing this on.

27:28.333 --> 27:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's me, live and in stereo.

27:30.433 --> 27:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Get a snack, settle in, because
I'm about to tell you the story
of my life, more specifically

27:39.333 --> 27:41.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
why my life ended.

27:41.000 --> 27:45.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And if you're listening
to this tape, you're
one of the reasons why.

27:47.400 --> 27:50.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
show, which was released
in its entirety a month
ago, brutally depicts

27:50.833 --> 27:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some very tough topics: hazing,
cyber-bullying, and rape.

27:53.933 --> 27:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hannah's own rape by one of her
classmates is unsparingly shown.

28:00.966 --> 28:05.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The series is based on a
2007 young adult novel by Jay
Asher, and it was produced by

28:05.833 --> 28:07.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
singer Selena Gomez.

28:07.833 --> 28:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Since its release, school boards
around the country have sent
warning letters to parents,

28:11.533 --> 28:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alerting them to the show,
offering ways to talk about its
content with their kids, but

28:17.966 --> 28:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also suggesting that some kids
probably shouldn't watch it.

28:20.633 --> 28:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Among the concerns cited is
the very explicit way Hannah's
suicide is shown in the final

28:26.100 --> 28:27.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
episode.

28:27.600 --> 28:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KATHERINE LANGFORD: Pardon me,
but you really hurt my feelings.

28:31.666 --> 28:35.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Some
psychologists say it
glorifies suicide.

28:35.733 --> 28:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Others worry it could
lead to copycat behavior.

28:38.700 --> 28:43.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The National Association
of School Psychologists
advised teenagers who
suffer from suicidal

28:43.433 --> 28:48.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
thoughts not to watch
at all, saying it "may
lead impressionable
viewers to romanticize

28:49.566 --> 28:51.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the choices made
by the characters."

28:51.600 --> 28:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both groups found fault with
the notion of Hannah sending
these taped messages from beyond

28:56.600 --> 29:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the grave, and criticized the
depiction of a school counselor
on the show who, they argue,

29:03.000 --> 29:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fails to follow up on
Hannah's obvious distress.

29:05.400 --> 29:09.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Following the outcry, Netflix
says it will add a warning
at the beginning the series,

29:09.466 --> 29:12.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in addition to the
warnings in front of the
most graphic episodes.

29:12.900 --> 29:17.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And from the beginning, the
show's creators say they
consulted mental health experts,

29:17.266 --> 29:20.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and tried hard not
to glamorize suicide.

29:20.600 --> 29:22.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Brian Yorkey is one of
the show's creators.

29:22.633 --> 29:26.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRIAN YORKEY, Co-Creator, "13
Reasons Why": We did want it
to be painful to watch, because

29:26.466 --> 29:31.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we wanted it to be very clear
that there is nothing in any
way worthwhile about suicide.

29:35.400 --> 29:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We asked
the "NewsHour"'s own Student
Reporting Labs to ask some high

29:39.233 --> 29:42.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
schoolers for their
take on the series.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Some applauded the show.

29:44.033 --> 29:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA, Student: I thought the
series would help students that
were grappling with suicide,

29:47.566 --> 29:52.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just because the show promoted
awareness for students who deal
with suicide and depression,

29:55.066 --> 29:57.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and they wanted it to
start conversations.

29:57.733 --> 30:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it became so popular and
so many people were talking
about it, that I felt like it

30:02.066 --> 30:04.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
did.

30:04.200 --> 30:08.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: I really think
that it's important for
adults to know how much
social media impacts

30:08.000 --> 30:10.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us now.

30:10.066 --> 30:14.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's a different time,
and social media is one
of the biggest reasons
why suicide happens

30:17.133 --> 30:19.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nowadays.

30:19.233 --> 30:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Others were
concerned about how the show
dealt with suicide and mental

30:20.933 --> 30:22.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
health.

30:22.866 --> 30:25.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZOIE, Student: I feel like
there is a lot of younger
audiences who watch it, and that

30:25.166 --> 30:30.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they watch it and they get the
wrong idea that maybe suicide
is OK or suicide is romantic,

30:32.166 --> 30:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or maybe, if I kill myself,
there will be a boy somewhere
who turns out to be in love

30:36.233 --> 30:38.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with me.

30:38.366 --> 30:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It shows the pain that others
are suffering, but it doesn't
really address the fact that

30:41.466 --> 30:43.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hannah is dead.

30:43.600 --> 30:45.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MUNA, Student: The
message behind it was to
be kind to everyone so,
like, they don't commit

30:45.533 --> 30:46.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
suicide.

30:46.833 --> 30:47.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But, in the show,
no one helped her.

30:47.800 --> 30:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The counselor didn't help her.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Like, all the students
didn't help her.

30:51.133 --> 30:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, she reached out to
people, but none of them,
like, tried to help her,.

30:54.333 --> 30:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that, like, it brings a bad
message to people who actually
have depression and stuff,

30:57.400 --> 31:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like they can't talk to
someone about it, like
no one's going to listen.

31:01.400 --> 31:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, is "13
Reasons Why" just a powerful,
provocative drama, or something

31:07.000 --> 31:09.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more troubling?

31:09.166 --> 31:12.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I'm joined now by Dr.
Christina Conolly, who
oversees psychological
services for all the

31:12.500 --> 31:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
public schools in Montgomery
County, Maryland, and
by Sonia Saraiya, a TV
critic for "Variety."

31:18.800 --> 31:19.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

31:19.800 --> 31:21.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

31:21.700 --> 31:23.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINA CONOLLY, Montgomery
County Public Schools:
Thank you for having us.

31:23.366 --> 31:25.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Dr.
Conolly, I would like
to start with you first.

31:25.366 --> 31:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Before we get to some of the
concerns about this show, I
know your job is to oversee 100

31:29.666 --> 31:31.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
school psychologists.

31:31.633 --> 31:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You look out for the welfare
of young people, but, as a
person, as a viewer that watched

31:34.666 --> 31:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this show, what was your
reaction when you saw it?

31:36.500 --> 31:38.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

31:38.033 --> 31:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTINA CONOLLY: Initially,
the show is very provocative.

31:39.966 --> 31:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I first watched like an episode
a day, and I was watching
at night after work, and I

31:42.766 --> 31:44.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was like, like, oh, my goodness.

31:44.166 --> 31:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it really draws you in.

31:47.066 --> 31:50.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, at the end, like,
over the weekend, I was like,
OK, I have to finish it.

31:50.300 --> 31:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I watched like four
or five episodes at once.

31:52.700 --> 31:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So you did a
little binge-watching yourself.

31:53.833 --> 31:55.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

31:55.333 --> 31:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTINA CONOLLY: I did a
little binge-watching myself.

31:56.300 --> 31:58.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it was very emotional.

31:58.466 --> 32:00.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I had trouble sleeping
after watching it.

32:00.766 --> 32:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I even cried after the
episode tape -- Clay's tape.

32:05.400 --> 32:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was just very
heart-wrenching to see
everything that was
occurring, all the negative

32:11.533 --> 32:13.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
experiences that
Hannah went through.

32:13.133 --> 32:15.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And all I kept thinking,
OK, oh, my goodness.

32:15.633 --> 32:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can only imagine
teenagers watching this,
especially vulnerable
teenagers, and wondering,

32:20.600 --> 32:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
how are they feeling with this?

32:21.566 --> 32:22.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Because I'm an adult.

32:22.733 --> 32:23.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm a mental health
professional.

32:23.966 --> 32:24.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I'm
just going to stop you.

32:24.566 --> 32:25.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

32:25.566 --> 32:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTINA CONOLLY: OK, stop me.

32:27.600 --> 32:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Just
be careful about banging
on your microphone there.

32:28.133 --> 32:29.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

32:29.066 --> 32:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTINA CONOLLY: Oh, OK.

32:29.600 --> 32:31.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sorry.

32:31.300 --> 32:33.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Tell
me a little bit more
about those concerns.

32:33.300 --> 32:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is it that you worry
about a kid who might be having
some -- suffer from some sort

32:34.666 --> 32:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of psychological
trouble, what's the fear?

32:35.200 --> 32:37.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

32:37.233 --> 32:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINA CONOLLY: The biggest
fear is that there will be
copycat behavior, that they

32:39.733 --> 32:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will watch Hannah's death,
watch her die by suicide,
because it graphically shows her

32:46.766 --> 32:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the razor cutting her
wrists, and say, is this
how I can die by suicide?

32:52.133 --> 32:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this how -- kind of like a
recipe for how I can die, how
-- a way of coping with what's

32:56.733 --> 32:58.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
happened.

32:58.766 --> 33:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is not -- as educators,
as mental health professionals,
we do not want students

33:01.600 --> 33:05.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and other adolescents
following along in --
with what Hannah has done.

33:05.666 --> 33:07.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Does
that actually happen?

33:07.133 --> 33:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is there evidence that copycat
suicides really do occur?

33:09.900 --> 33:11.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

33:11.966 --> 33:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINA CONOLLY: Yes, there
is research out there showing
that suicide can be contagious.

33:15.500 --> 33:19.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It can be copycat, especially
-- even in schools.

33:19.200 --> 33:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Even in the series itself, there
is Hannah who dies by suicide.

33:22.766 --> 33:26.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the last episode, there is
another student, Alex, who was
involved in the tapes and then

33:26.966 --> 33:28.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he attempts suicide.

33:28.533 --> 33:30.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, absolutely, this
can happen in schools.

33:30.566 --> 33:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Sonia Saraiya,
I would like to turn to you.

33:33.233 --> 33:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, before we get to the
concerns that have been raised
about the series, as a TV

33:37.566 --> 33:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
critic, as someone who analyzes
this as a piece of art, what
was your reaction to the

33:41.700 --> 33:43.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
series?

33:43.666 --> 33:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SONIA SARAIYA, "Variety":
You know, I found it
extremely compelling.

33:45.733 --> 33:50.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think that Christina's
experience of watching
it was one I felt, too.

33:52.666 --> 33:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wasn't expecting to be so
taken in by a show that was
aimed at teenagers, and I really

33:55.833 --> 33:59.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ended up bingeing
it in the same way.

33:59.600 --> 34:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And part of it is because, you
know, more than being about
teenagers and being about

34:06.000 --> 34:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their feelings, the show is
constructed really brilliantly.

34:08.733 --> 34:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brian Yorkey, who adapted the
show from Jay Asher's novel,
it's adapted so well as a TV

34:15.000 --> 34:17.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
series, with each
tape being an episode.

34:17.800 --> 34:22.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You feel like you're in a
mystery story, even though you
know what's going to happen.

34:22.466 --> 34:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's something
very moody, almost noirish
about the way that the
atmosphere of the school

34:28.266 --> 34:29.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was constructed.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's a very
compelling atmosphere.

34:31.700 --> 34:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was really easy to sink
into it and to watch this whole
story with these characters

34:37.833 --> 34:39.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who were really
going through a lot.

34:39.933 --> 34:43.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Sonia,
how would you respond
to that concern, though,
that it in some ways

34:45.200 --> 34:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could be seen as a guidebook,
a textbook, that a young
woman goes through some very

34:49.400 --> 34:51.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
troubling things?

34:51.066 --> 34:53.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This is not to discount
the things that happen
to her in the series.

34:53.166 --> 34:57.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's really awful things that
she experiences, but that we
see the resolution of that is

34:59.133 --> 35:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her suicide, and then this very
long sort of -- what some have
argued is a sort of revenge

35:02.600 --> 35:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fantasy played out on all of
her classmates, how do you
respond to that, that that's not

35:06.633 --> 35:08.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
really a great thing
to be showing kids?

35:08.533 --> 35:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SONIA SARAIYA: Stories
are not always about
recreating what's happening.

35:15.266 --> 35:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're about showing us the
-- showing us what happens
with these characters in this

35:20.466 --> 35:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
story, in this world, so that we
can take away something from it.

35:23.733 --> 35:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you were someone who was
thinking about this, you would
understand what it might do

35:28.500 --> 35:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the people around you, what
it -- how difficult it might be
for your parents to find you in

35:33.233 --> 35:35.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that situation.

35:35.233 --> 35:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you might also feel that,
if someone else had gone through
this experience, that you

35:39.900 --> 35:44.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
were not so alone in
your experience of it,
especially because one
of the main takeaways

35:46.900 --> 35:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of "13 Reasons Why," I think,
is that you know Hannah's
going to do this, but you also

35:52.100 --> 35:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see how much of a mistake
it is, as you see the entire
texture of her life and how many

35:55.233 --> 35:59.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people love her and care about
her, even though they weren't
able to express it in the right

35:59.200 --> 36:03.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ways throughout her life
when she needed those crises.

36:03.066 --> 36:05.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At the end, you don't
think it was a good idea.

36:05.466 --> 36:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, that certainly wasn't
the takeaway that I think a
lot of people are taking away

36:09.200 --> 36:10.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from the show anyway.

36:10.533 --> 36:13.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
To me, it seems like
she -- it was a mistake.

36:13.266 --> 36:15.300 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
She really had a
lot to live for.

36:15.300 --> 36:18.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Well,
Christina, what do
you think about that,
the idea that, in some

36:18.300 --> 36:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ways, this really does show
the emotional wreckage, not
only that cyber-bullying and

36:23.166 --> 36:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rape and the assaults and all
of those things do to her,
but also her own death and the

36:28.066 --> 36:30.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
aftermath of that?

36:30.100 --> 36:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Could that be -- from your
experience as a mental health
professional, could that be

36:33.500 --> 36:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cathartic for a lot of kids?

36:35.066 --> 36:37.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

36:37.033 --> 36:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINA CONOLLY: I think that,
for kids, showing -- giving
information about what can

36:39.633 --> 36:44.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
be part of the high
school experience, these
negative experiences
that can occur, these

36:44.566 --> 36:46.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
do happen in real life.

36:46.166 --> 36:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, as educators, we
have to be aware of that.

36:48.666 --> 36:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to help to promote
to our parents that these
things are happening.

36:52.866 --> 36:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our goal is to make sure that
our parents and our teachers
and other staff members at

36:57.833 --> 37:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
schools know that the show is
happening, kids are watching it.

37:00.833 --> 37:03.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're in lunchroom talking
about it, on the bus.

37:03.466 --> 37:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What can we do to help them?

37:05.500 --> 37:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as they talked about,
one of the big things was the
counselor, and parents were

37:09.333 --> 37:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not shown or teachers were not
shown in a way as a helper.

37:13.466 --> 37:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We want people to know
that that's not the case.

37:15.966 --> 37:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in school, we want students
to know that they should
have a trusted adult in their

37:20.100 --> 37:24.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
life that they can go to when
things are going wrong, and
that educators and their parents

37:24.633 --> 37:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are people that they can go
to when these things happen,
unlike Hannah, who went to

37:28.466 --> 37:30.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this counselor.

37:30.533 --> 37:33.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The majority of mental health
professionals are not like
that, and we just want people

37:33.100 --> 37:35.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to understand that.

37:35.200 --> 37:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Could the
series still have retained its
power and changed it a little

37:38.233 --> 37:42.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
bit that would make it
more -- that you would
be more comfortable
with its depiction of

37:42.233 --> 37:43.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all of this?

37:43.233 --> 37:45.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

37:45.200 --> 37:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINA CONOLLY: They go
through and they talk about
these horrible things that have

37:46.333 --> 37:47.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
happened.

37:47.966 --> 37:50.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And then they -- in the
end, they show Hannah's
death by suicide.

37:50.833 --> 37:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But they don't show, where
can you go to get help?

37:53.833 --> 37:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are things that
adolescents can do when
these things are happening?

37:57.800 --> 38:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They show the substance use,
binge-drinking, drinking and
driving, the rape, the stalking,

38:02.766 --> 38:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all these things, but never
does the show go into, where
can you go and how do you get

38:07.566 --> 38:09.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
help?

38:09.333 --> 38:11.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How does your
friend help others?

38:11.400 --> 38:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you see your friend
who is going through this,
where can they get help?

38:13.866 --> 38:18.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But also that Hannah
more than likely has a
mental health disorder.

38:18.666 --> 38:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Over 90 percent of individuals
who die by suicide have a
mental health disorder, and

38:23.133 --> 38:26.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the show doesn't
discuss that at all.

38:26.066 --> 38:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And mental health disorders
are treatable, and so that,
if we help to treat the mental

38:30.433 --> 38:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
health disorder, that helps
to us prevent suicide.

38:32.733 --> 38:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Dr. Christina Conolly, Sonia
Saraiya, thank you both very

38:36.433 --> 38:37.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

38:37.433 --> 38:38.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

CHRISTINA CONOLLY:
Thank you for having me.

38:39.766 --> 38:44.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SONIA SARAIYA:
Thank you, William.

38:46.166 --> 38:51.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Roughly
25 million people in the
U.S. have active asthma.

38:53.166 --> 38:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For most, it can be controlled
with the right medications
and by avoiding environmental

38:57.800 --> 39:00.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
triggers.

39:00.366 --> 39:03.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet nearly half
of all adults and 40
percent of children have
uncontrolled asthma, which

39:05.000 --> 39:07.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can lead to expensive
medical interventions.

39:07.733 --> 39:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Total annual costs
for the disease are
estimated at $60 billion.

39:12.633 --> 39:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today is World Asthma Day, which
makes it a good moment for this
report by special correspondent

39:19.566 --> 39:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cat Wise about a California
program that's drawing attention
for its way of keeping kids

39:24.633 --> 39:27.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
healthy.

39:27.100 --> 39:32.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Three-year-old Jesus
Cresto (ph) has been to the
emergency room twice in the

39:35.933 --> 39:38.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
past 12 months for
asthma attacks.

39:38.433 --> 39:41.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
His mom, Angelica (ph),
says she isn't getting
much sleep these days.

39:41.466 --> 39:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANGELICA CRESTO, Mother: I
will just be checking on him.

39:42.533 --> 39:44.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is he OK?

39:44.000 --> 39:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's really hard, because
they change your life.

39:46.033 --> 39:50.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I just want to take
care of my kids better.

39:50.266 --> 39:55.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: The Cresto
family lives in East
Oakland, a predominately
low-income community

39:57.233 --> 39:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Alameda County ,which has
some of the highest rates
of asthma in California.

39:59.433 --> 40:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Children with uncontrolled
asthma, especially those from
low-income families, who often

40:04.033 --> 40:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have government-funded health
care insurance, account
for a disproportionate
number of costly

40:08.800 --> 40:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
E.R. visits and hospital stays.

40:10.833 --> 40:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, keeping Jesus and the more
than one million other kids with
asthma in California healthy

40:16.466 --> 40:18.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is a big priority.

40:18.933 --> 40:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Alameda County has
been leading an effort
to do just that, focusing
on the place where

40:23.300 --> 40:27.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
kids spend the most
time, their home.

40:29.566 --> 40:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On a recent morning, a team
of cleaners specializing
in asthma trigger
remediation, arrive at the

40:32.833 --> 40:34.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Cresto home.

40:34.833 --> 40:38.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They cleaned up pest droppings
behind the fridge, removed
mold spots on a bedroom window,

40:38.500 --> 40:41.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and put a dust mite
cover on a mattress.

40:41.366 --> 40:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The cleaning visit was
arranged by Sandra Rodriguez, a
community outreach worker from

40:45.866 --> 40:48.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the county's Healthy
Homes Department.

40:48.533 --> 40:52.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She is part of a unique
collaboration between housing
and public health agencies.

40:52.666 --> 40:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SANDRA RODRIGUEZ, Alameda
County Healthy Homes Department:
Where does Jesus spend a lot of

40:55.133 --> 40:56.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the time?

40:56.666 --> 40:59.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANGELICA CRESTO: He usually
likes to be on the floor.

40:59.066 --> 41:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, how I clean the
house, I use Clorox a lot.

41:03.433 --> 41:04.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SANDRA RODRIGUEZ: OK.

41:04.966 --> 41:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANGELICA CRESTO: Because I think
I want to keep the floors clean.

41:07.733 --> 41:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SANDRA RODRIGUEZ: Using harsh
chemicals like Clorox can really
exacerbate a child's asthma.

41:14.766 --> 41:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we recommend that you try
natural products, just soap and
water, soap and water, and one

41:20.500 --> 41:22.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the additional
is baking soda.

41:22.400 --> 41:24.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANGELICA CRESTO: OK.

41:24.533 --> 41:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: The program, which
began in 2001 and was among
the first of its kind in the

41:28.166 --> 41:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country, is open to all
children in the county who have
been diagnosed with asthma.

41:32.500 --> 41:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Allergen-reducing products
like HEPA filter vacuums are
offered to families who can't

41:36.666 --> 41:40.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
afford them, and the
program will even pay
for minor home repairs.

41:40.100 --> 41:42.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BRENDA RUEDA-YAMASHITA,
Alameda County Public
Health Department: We
saw these very high

41:42.166 --> 41:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rates in our county, and we
didn't want to have residents
who were dealing with issues

41:46.133 --> 41:48.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like that.

41:48.200 --> 41:51.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Brenda Rueda-Yamashita
manages the Public Health
Department's side of the program

41:51.166 --> 41:53.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
called Asthma Start.

41:53.300 --> 41:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She says the up-front costs,
which average about $2,500
per family, depending on the

41:57.700 --> 42:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
needs, are worth spending to
prevent the back-end costs.

42:01.100 --> 42:05.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRENDA RUEDA-YAMASHITA: It's
around $23,000 for a child to
have an asthma hospitalization,

42:05.466 --> 42:10.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and around $3,500 for an E.R.
visit, so that's the highest
impact, mom losing money, dad

42:12.400 --> 42:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
losing money, because they have
to stay home with a child or
take the child to the E.R.,

42:14.833 --> 42:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and their employer
doesn't pay for sick time.

42:17.333 --> 42:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a cost to cities
and/or counties for their fire,
because fire departments show

42:22.233 --> 42:24.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up to 911 calls.

42:24.266 --> 42:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: The other key priority
for the program is educating
families about the importance

42:28.200 --> 42:31.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of taking prescribed
asthma medications.

42:31.233 --> 42:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's where medical social
worker Amy Sholinbeck comes in.

42:41.900 --> 42:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On this day, she is back for
a second visit with 2-year-old
Romani Webb (ph) and his mom,

42:46.733 --> 42:48.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Artency (ph).

42:48.733 --> 42:52.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Romani has had several hospital
stays for asthma attacks,
but after an initial two-hour

42:52.266 --> 42:56.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
visit a month ago, the
family has been on top
of his medications.

42:56.166 --> 42:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY SHOLINBECK, Medical Social
worker: Have you noticed that
he's been having less symptoms

42:59.600 --> 43:01.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
since you have been doing this?

43:01.166 --> 43:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARTENCY WEBB, Mother: At
the nighttime, definitely.

43:02.100 --> 43:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He sleeps a lot better too.

43:03.333 --> 43:04.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY SHOLINBECK: Oh, I'm
so happy to hear that.

43:04.766 --> 43:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's all about his health.

43:06.400 --> 43:09.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We want to keep you out
of the hospital, baby.

43:09.466 --> 43:14.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sometimes, the family ends up
confusing the inhalers, or it
wasn't explained to them in

43:15.066 --> 43:17.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
enough detail.

43:17.100 --> 43:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we're in a calm environment
in their home, and we take a
lot of time to make sure they

43:22.066 --> 43:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
understand what the
medications do in the body.

43:24.366 --> 43:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have special stickers
we put on the medicines, and
we just make sure they really

43:30.066 --> 43:31.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
get it.

43:31.533 --> 43:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: I just want to give
you an update on our numbers.

43:33.033 --> 43:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAT WISE: The program has served
about 250 families each year.

43:37.300 --> 43:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been funded through
a combination of sources,
including grants, taxes, tobacco

43:41.400 --> 43:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
settlement money, and a local
Medicaid managed-care program.

43:44.833 --> 43:49.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A data review by that
organization in 2012
found health care costs
for pediatric patients

43:51.800 --> 43:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ages 0 to 5 were cut in half
during the 12 months after
they went through the program.

43:58.000 --> 44:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those results and the program's
long track record are generating
new interest in Alameda

44:02.500 --> 44:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
County's preventative approach.

44:04.533 --> 44:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDA NEUHAUSER, University of
California, Berkeley: I have
studied a lot of programs,

44:07.400 --> 44:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but when I got introduced
to this program, what I
saw was a very seasoned,
careful intervention

44:14.066 --> 44:18.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that draws on the best
practices that we get
from research to date.

44:20.533 --> 44:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: U.C., Berkeley,
Professor Linda Neuhauser is
leading an in-depth study of

44:23.566 --> 44:25.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the program.

44:25.600 --> 44:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her research is ongoing, but
she believes policy-makers
around the country should pay

44:28.800 --> 44:30.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
attention.

44:30.866 --> 44:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDA NEUHAUSER: It's hard
to estimate the cost savings,
but I think, in Alameda County

44:36.800 --> 44:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alone, we might be able to
save as much as $16 million a
year just on hospitalizations

44:43.066 --> 44:44.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of children.

44:44.533 --> 44:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is an amazing saving
of health care costs.

44:47.300 --> 44:52.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Eight-year-old Mihlen
Michael (ph) is one of those
children who is happy to be

44:52.166 --> 44:54.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out of the hospital.

44:54.066 --> 44:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A year ago, she was in
intensive care after an
especially bad asthma attack.

44:58.233 --> 45:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her mom, Nebiyat Hagos (ph),
says some big changes have
happened since the asthma teams

45:02.633 --> 45:04.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
visited their home.

45:04.166 --> 45:06.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NEBIYAT HAGOS, Mother: Now
she's doing a lot better.

45:06.100 --> 45:08.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She hasn't been to
the E.R. in a year.

45:08.700 --> 45:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They made a great difference.

45:10.733 --> 45:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were living close to a
freeway, and they mentioned
to me how that affects asthma.

45:16.633 --> 45:19.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, we moved away
from the freeway now,
and that also helped.

45:19.200 --> 45:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Hagos is now working
for the program, and using the
training she received to help

45:23.533 --> 45:25.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
other families with asthma.

45:25.600 --> 45:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The home-based asthma program
recently got a temporary boost
in funding from a national

45:29.800 --> 45:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nonprofit and the Alameda
County Board of Supervisors.

45:33.200 --> 45:38.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That money is being used in
part to help an additional
250 families this year.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
a new look at one of the
most controversial American

45:56.866 --> 46:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
presidents in modern history and
a man of many contradictions.

46:00.733 --> 46:04.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has this
latest addition to the
"NewsHour" Bookshelf.

46:04.466 --> 46:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Few presidents,
we read early is a new
biography of Richard Nixon, came

46:09.433 --> 46:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so far, so fast, so alone,
and, we can add, few fell
so far, so fast, so alone.

46:16.433 --> 46:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than that, as "Richard
Nixon: The Life" makes clear,
so much of his political legacy

46:21.233 --> 46:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
continues to permeate today.

46:23.033 --> 46:25.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Author John A.
Farrell joins me now.

46:25.800 --> 46:27.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome to you.

46:27.366 --> 46:28.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN A. FARRELL,
Author, "Richard Nixon:
The Life": Thank you.

46:28.866 --> 46:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let me start
there for some broad context.

46:30.933 --> 46:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In what fundamental way is
Richard Nixon still with us
in our political culture?

46:34.433 --> 46:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN A. FARRELL: Nixon
practiced what I call the
politics of grievance.

46:41.333 --> 46:44.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He came from a very unfortunate
background, almost a Dickensian
childhood, with a mean

46:46.866 --> 46:50.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
father, a very frosty
mother, poverty and
sickness in the household.

46:52.800 --> 46:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he had that ability
to identify in his
audiences, in the electorate
their own resentments,

46:57.000 --> 46:59.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and to tap them.

46:59.033 --> 47:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he didn't realize until the
end, the famous speech where
he talks about hate destroying

47:04.500 --> 47:07.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
yourself, how
dangerous that was.

47:07.100 --> 47:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, by then, this sort
of politics of deliberate
polarization that he
pioneered had taken root.

47:13.900 --> 47:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It was so
interesting to me to see the
younger Nixon, even in his first

47:16.866 --> 47:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time running, where you get
the mix of the kind of sincere
ambition to serve, but already

47:23.900 --> 47:28.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of the tricks, the
bad side of Nixon, it was
there from the beginning.

47:28.600 --> 47:32.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN A. FARRELL: Yes, it's one
of the things I found was that
Nixon, throughout his life,

47:32.100 --> 47:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was always using yellow pads
and making lists, and then
crossing out as he went.

47:36.533 --> 47:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he comes home from war
in 1946, and like lots of the
younger veterans, having seen

47:43.100 --> 47:45.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the sacrifices that
were made, they wanted
to improve their world.

47:45.133 --> 47:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They wanted to make sure those
sacrifices weren't in vain.

47:48.066 --> 47:51.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's where that idealism
that you talked about came from.

47:51.266 --> 47:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, young congressional
candidate, there was also
this dark side already.

47:55.900 --> 47:59.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And he was running
against a fellow named
Jerry Voorhis in 1946.

47:59.766 --> 48:04.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in one of these
yellow lists, as I went
down ticking them off,
you know, get volunteers,

48:06.733 --> 48:10.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
put ads in newspapers,
and there at the bottom
was the instruction,
put spies in Voorhis

48:10.100 --> 48:11.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
camp.

48:11.100 --> 48:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Put spies...

48:12.333 --> 48:14.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN A. FARRELL: Put
spies in his camp.

48:14.133 --> 48:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, right from the
beginning, he had that
inclination towards intrigue.

48:16.700 --> 48:21.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: One bit
of news that you make in
this book is confirming
his role in sabotaging

48:23.466 --> 48:27.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the Paris peace talks,
right, the attempt to
end the Vietnam War.

48:27.100 --> 48:29.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN A. FARRELL: Yes.

48:29.200 --> 48:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He didn't want
his Democratic opponents to
get credit for ending the war.

48:31.366 --> 48:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN A. FARRELL: That's right.

48:33.366 --> 48:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lyndon Johnson desperately
wanted to end the war
before he left office.

48:35.366 --> 48:39.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And in October 1968,
he announced a bombing
halt to bring the North
Vietnamese and the

48:40.600 --> 48:42.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
South Vietnamese to the table.

48:42.666 --> 48:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Nixon got wind of it, and
dispatched a woman named Anna
Chennault, who was one of

48:46.433 --> 48:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his aides in his campaign, to
approach the South Vietnamese
and say, drag your heels,

48:53.100 --> 48:55.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
scuttle the talks, and
you will get a better
deal when I'm elected.

48:55.066 --> 48:57.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he denied it all his life.

48:57.166 --> 49:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He denied it in one of the taped
conversations that you can hear
at the Lyndon Johnson Library.

49:02.166 --> 49:04.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He denied it directly.

49:04.200 --> 49:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I was able to find the
little, tiny jigsaw piece that,
again, one of those yellow legal

49:09.966 --> 49:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pad notes, this time from his
chief of staff, Bob Haldeman.

49:12.466 --> 49:15.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: You end
up calling this his
most reprehensible act.

49:15.733 --> 49:17.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN A. FARRELL: I think it was.

49:17.766 --> 49:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because of the number of lives
that were at stake, for a
presidential candidate to do

49:23.800 --> 49:27.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this, I thought, was really
awful, whereas, in Watergate,
like the bumper stickers always

49:28.633 --> 49:30.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
said, nobody died in Watergate.

49:30.266 --> 49:32.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Certainly, our political
system was tarnished.

49:32.633 --> 49:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But so many lives in the next
four years, next five years,
if you count Cambodia and

49:39.633 --> 49:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Vietnamese boat people,
almost genocide in Cambodia,
and if the war could have been

49:42.566 --> 49:45.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ended in '68, what a
difference it would have been.

49:45.966 --> 49:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Here's a man
who's been written a lot about.

49:48.600 --> 49:52.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
How do you go about
writing a new biography,
and making it fresh?

49:52.333 --> 49:53.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where do you look?

49:53.333 --> 49:55.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN A. FARRELL: Yes.

49:55.466 --> 49:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a great advantage of
being there 40 years later,
because a lot of people have

49:58.600 --> 49:59.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
died.

49:59.700 --> 50:01.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And , privacy
restrictions are lifted.

50:01.833 --> 50:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of the national security
restrictions on documents are
worked through, and the stuff

50:06.766 --> 50:08.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is released.

50:08.733 --> 50:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You know,
throughout, it is this strange
mix of insecure, very human man,

50:14.200 --> 50:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with a very ruthless politician.

50:15.866 --> 50:20.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There is sincerity on
the one hand, mixed with
this kind of cunning.

50:21.600 --> 50:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You humanized him, right?

50:23.800 --> 50:25.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN A. FARRELL: A bit.

50:25.033 --> 50:27.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: You lived
with him a long time.

50:27.166 --> 50:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How did you come to see him?

50:28.500 --> 50:29.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN A. FARRELL: Yes.

50:29.533 --> 50:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I developed sympathy for him.

50:31.633 --> 50:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was a young teenager
during the 1960s and early
'70s, when he was in office.

50:38.633 --> 50:40.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he was a villain.

50:40.733 --> 50:45.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when -- your biography,
inevitably, you open windows
into souls of people, and you

50:47.533 --> 50:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
explore how awful his childhood
was, and you begin to get
this empathy for the person.

50:51.533 --> 50:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then you have to balance
it with a cool analysis of how
Nixon behaved as a politician.

50:58.533 --> 51:02.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there's a lot of really bad
stuff in the book about Nixon,
but I also hope that there's

51:04.000 --> 51:07.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a more humane approach
to him as this sort of
tortured individual.

51:07.666 --> 51:11.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So,
thin-skinned, media-hating.

51:11.000 --> 51:16.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Soon as your book came
out, there were some
obvious comparisons...

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN A. FARRELL:
Yes, us as the enemy.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

51:18.666 --> 51:19.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes,
to our current, our
new president, right?

51:19.466 --> 51:20.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN A. FARRELL: Yes.

51:20.433 --> 51:21.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

51:21.933 --> 51:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But how far
do you make the comparison?

51:22.733 --> 51:24.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where does it end?

51:24.833 --> 51:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN A. FARRELL: While they
both seem to have resentments
growing out of their childhood

51:27.666 --> 51:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a need for public acclaim,
the difference is of the two
men's personalities is very

51:33.133 --> 51:34.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stark.

51:34.066 --> 51:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Nixon was an intellectual.

51:35.633 --> 51:37.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He not only read books.

51:37.633 --> 51:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He actually wrote books and he
was -- had a basic reverence,
despite what he did in

51:43.866 --> 51:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Watergate, for the
institution of the presidency.

51:47.500 --> 51:52.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When he lied, he expected that
you would believe him, whereas,
Trump, I get the idea sometimes

51:54.066 --> 51:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's the actual blatant lie that
he doesn't want you to believe.

51:58.833 --> 52:01.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's just sort of
rubbing it in your face.

52:01.533 --> 52:04.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, those are, I think,
major differences
between the two of them.

52:04.866 --> 52:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they did both practice
what I was talking
about, that politics of
identifying in individuals

52:09.733 --> 52:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or identifying in the voters
resentments of race and class,
and capitalizing on them.

52:16.166 --> 52:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The new book
is "Richard Nixon: The Life."

52:18.533 --> 52:23.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
John Farrell, thank
you very much.

52:23.333 --> 52:27.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN A. FARRELL: My pleasure.

52:27.966 --> 52:29.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

52:29.800 --> 52:33.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tune

"Frontline" examines what

52:39.200 --> 52:41.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
society.

"Second Chance Kids" focuses

52:46.733 --> 52:50.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Supreme Court decision
that found sentences of
mandatory life without
parole for juveniles

52:51.266 --> 52:53.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
unconstitutional.

Anthony Rolon was a teenager
when he was convicted
in the death of Bobby
Botelho in New Bedford,

52:59.066 --> 53:01.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Massachusetts.

53:01.200 --> 53:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Twenty-year-old Bobby
Botelho was stabbed to death
nearly two decades ago.

53:04.333 --> 53:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, his family speaks to
Eyewitness News as they wait
to hear if his killer will stay

53:08.600 --> 53:09.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
behind bars.

53:09.600 --> 53:10.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: It's unfair.

53:10.600 --> 53:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It shouldn't even be happening.

53:12.300 --> 53:15.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And we will fight until
we have to, and we will
do whatever it takes.

ANTHONY ROLON, Convicted
Murderer: I knew that
the victim's family
believed I shouldn't

53:17.500 --> 53:22.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
even be having this
hearing, shouldn't be
having this opportunity
to give this individual

53:23.066 --> 53:24.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a second chance.

53:24.066 --> 53:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Good morning, Mr. Rolon.

53:25.300 --> 53:27.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm chairman of
the parole board.

53:27.433 --> 53:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are here today to consider
your petition for parole from
a first-degree murder sentence

53:32.866 --> 53:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for stabbing and killing
Robert Botelho on January 21.

53:34.900 --> 53:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTHONY ROLON: I wanted to
have respect for the family,
so I didn't want to look over

53:39.133 --> 53:44.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there, but I went there
with the purpose of
having that opportunity
to just say, I'm sorry.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's time to speak the truth.

53:47.766 --> 53:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's time to say what happened.

53:50.933 --> 53:53.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's time to own up.

53:53.000 --> 53:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After being convicted of taking
