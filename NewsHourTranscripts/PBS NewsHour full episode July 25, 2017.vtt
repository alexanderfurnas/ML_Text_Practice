00:04.733 --> 00:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.733 --> 00:06.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.733 --> 00:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:07.733 --> 00:09.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Mr. McCain, aye.

00:09.733 --> 00:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A dramatic
return for John McCain, as
Republicans muster just enough

00:15.866 --> 00:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
votes in the Senate to move
ahead on health care, but the
future of replacing Obamacare

00:19.966 --> 00:20.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is far from clear.

00:20.733 --> 00:22.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Then:

00:22.700 --> 00:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: I am disappointed
in the attorney general.

00:27.900 --> 00:29.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He shouldn't have
recused himself.

00:29.966 --> 00:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
takes aim at Jeff Sessions,
publicly airing frustrations

00:33.433 --> 00:38.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
with his own attorney
general, as talks of
a replacement ramp up.

00:38.333 --> 00:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plus: Mr. Trump's son-in-law
and top adviser, Jared Kushner,
heads back to Capitol Hill.

00:45.400 --> 00:49.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We talk to two members
of Congress who are
asking questions about
Russian meddling.

00:51.966 --> 00:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And feeding children after
the school year - - how a food
bank is helping fill in the

00:56.766 --> 00:58.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gap during summer, so
kids don't go hungry.

00:58.900 --> 01:03.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE CAMBRIDGE, Meal Service
Manager: There's always a whew
when we get it out the door.

01:05.666 --> 01:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then we just hope that
it's getting to kids in need,
and that they're enjoying it,

01:09.300 --> 01:11.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and we do it all
again the next day.

01:11.033 --> 01:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:18.466 --> 01:21.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:21.266 --> 01:26.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The United
States Senate tonight
has begun debating what
to do about Obamacare

01:31.366 --> 01:33.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after weeks of waiting.

01:33.666 --> 01:38.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans finally mustered
the votes to proceed in a
showdown today, with the aid

01:38.166 --> 01:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of a cancer patient and a
vice presidential tiebreaker.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Lisa Desjardins
begins our coverage.

01:44.366 --> 01:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In the Senate
today, high-stakes politics
with high-volume drama.

01:54.100 --> 01:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As the health care vote began,
protesters chanted "Kill the
bill" and "Shame" from the

01:59.033 --> 02:00.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Senate gallery.

02:00.600 --> 02:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
After they were removed, the
vote itself was in doubt.

02:06.933 --> 02:10.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican Senator Susan
Collins of Maine and Lisa
Murkowski of Alaska voted no.

02:10.366 --> 02:13.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
One more no, and the
debate would be blocked.

02:13.100 --> 02:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All eyes were on Wisconsin
Republican Ron Johnson, who
didn't initially vote at all.

02:18.033 --> 02:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He spent minutes speaking with
GOP Leader Mitch McConnell,
before he finally voted yes.

02:22.500 --> 02:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE PENCE, Vice President of
the United States: On this vote,
the yeas 50 and the nays are

02:26.700 --> 02:28.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
50.

02:28.733 --> 02:32.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Senate, being
equally divided, the
vice president votes in
the affirmative, and the

02:32.166 --> 02:34.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
motion is agreed to.

02:34.233 --> 02:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Vice
President Mike Pence cast
the tiebreaking 51st vote.

02:38.733 --> 02:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Majority Leader McConnell:

02:39.733 --> 02:41.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:41.800 --> 02:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader: We have
wrestled with this issue.

02:43.133 --> 02:46.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have watched the
consequences of the status quo.

02:46.200 --> 02:51.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The people who sent us here
expect us to begin this debate.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Adding to the
emotion, the return of Arizona
Senator John McCain following

02:55.900 --> 02:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his diagnosis with brain cancer.

02:57.866 --> 02:59.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He voted for debate.

02:59.366 --> 03:01.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:01.433 --> 03:03.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN MCCAIN (R), Arizona: I
voted for the motion to proceed
to allow debate to continue

03:03.266 --> 03:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and amendments be offered.

03:04.700 --> 03:09.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I will not vote for this
bill as it is today.

03:10.866 --> 03:12.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a shell of
a bill right now.

03:12.133 --> 03:14.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We all know that.

03:14.133 --> 03:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It's still far
from clear what, if any bill
will ultimately emerge from

03:17.300 --> 03:19.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Senate.

03:19.366 --> 03:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The multiple versions include
the original Senate bill, with
dramatic reductions in Medicaid

03:22.900 --> 03:25.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and an end to most
of Obamacare's taxes.

03:25.600 --> 03:30.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Congressional Budget Office
said it would leave 22 million
more people uninsured by

03:31.066 --> 03:33.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2026.

03:33.033 --> 03:37.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last week came talk of a full
repeal bill, with a replacement
to be determined later.

03:37.366 --> 03:42.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That would mean 32 million
more uninsured if no
replacement is ever enacted.

03:44.333 --> 03:47.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, finally, what's
called a skinny repeal,
ending Obamacare's
individual mandate, but

03:48.200 --> 03:49.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not much else.

03:49.633 --> 03:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It would likely add another
15 million uninsured.

03:54.033 --> 03:58.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats remained uniformly
opposed, and their leader, Chuck
Schumer, condemned Republican

03:58.266 --> 03:59.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
maneuvering.

03:59.266 --> 04:01.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:01.366 --> 04:03.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: Now the best the
majority leader's been able to

04:03.466 --> 04:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cook up is a vague plan to
do whatever it takes to pass
something, anything, to get

04:09.233 --> 04:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the bill to a House and Senate
conference on health care.

04:15.366 --> 04:19.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
My colleagues, plain
and simple, it's a ruse.

04:21.833 --> 04:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The likeliest result of a
conference between the House
and Senate is full repeal of the

04:27.400 --> 04:31.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Affordable Care Act, or
something very close to it.

04:31.600 --> 04:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: From the
other end of Pennsylvania
Avenue, President Trump
hailed the vote to

04:35.533 --> 04:37.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
start debate.

04:37.666 --> 04:41.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP, President
of the United States:
I want to congratulate
American people, because

04:41.133 --> 04:43.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we're going to give
you great health care.

04:43.533 --> 04:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're going to get rid of
Obamacare, which should've been
frankly terminated long Ago.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's been a disaster
for the American people.

04:49.900 --> 04:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As for the
House, Majority Leader Kevin
McCarthy said, today, his caucus

04:54.233 --> 04:55.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is waiting for the
Senate's next move.

04:55.933 --> 04:57.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

04:57.633 --> 04:59.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA),
House Majority Leader:
We will be on call.

04:59.733 --> 05:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At any time that the Senate
is able to pass a health care
bill -- we have already passed

05:04.333 --> 05:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one -- that we will call the
House back in to finish the job.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But when
that day might come, if it
comes, remains a mystery.

05:13.966 --> 05:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Again, the vote today
was just to start debate.

05:17.300 --> 05:21.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Over the next two days
and likely nights,
we will see scores of
amendments and amendment

05:21.966 --> 05:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
votes on the Senate floor.

05:23.800 --> 05:25.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Any senator can
offer an amendment.

05:25.900 --> 05:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, Democrat Chris
Murphy says, Judy, he has
got 100 ready to propose.

05:30.133 --> 05:32.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lisa,
tell us more about how
this is going to work.

05:32.966 --> 05:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republicans have
been saying, for example,
there is going to be a
vote on straight repeal.

05:37.300 --> 05:38.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
When would that be?

05:38.300 --> 05:39.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

05:39.700 --> 05:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is going to be important
to follow the process.

05:41.833 --> 05:45.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Votes could happen as
soon as tonight, though
I'm told by sources in
both parties that that's

05:45.200 --> 05:46.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
unlikely at this time.

05:46.766 --> 05:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Here's how it's likely to work.

05:48.666 --> 05:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will see two large amendments
being proposed near the
top of this voting scheme.

05:54.166 --> 05:56.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
One will be that
straight repeal bill.

05:56.200 --> 06:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other will be some version
of the Senate bill that we
have seen crafted recently.

06:02.100 --> 06:04.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Both of those are
expected to fail.

06:04.100 --> 06:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After that, we will see perhaps
a day or many hours of a
flurry of different amendments.

06:09.933 --> 06:11.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Those will generally
require 60 votes.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It will be hard
for those to pass.

06:13.633 --> 06:18.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the very end, Judy, we will
see probably this skinny repeal,
a sort of pared-down version

06:19.066 --> 06:20.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of repeal.

06:20.166 --> 06:21.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It will be the
Republicans' last vote.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They hope to get 50 on that.

06:23.333 --> 06:25.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's not clear yet
how they will do that.

06:25.333 --> 06:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lisa, this
was quite an extraordinary
day, as you just showed in your

06:29.433 --> 06:30.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
piece.

06:30.433 --> 06:32.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You were there.

06:32.500 --> 06:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What does this drama say about
the state of the Senate right
now, this debate, and the

06:37.200 --> 06:38.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
state of governing?

06:38.700 --> 06:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Judy, I have to
tell you, it was breathtaking.

06:41.333 --> 06:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was rather unbelievable
to be in that Senate today.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For one, as Susan Collins and
Lisa Murkowski, the senators who
voted no, cast those opposing

06:49.733 --> 06:50.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
votes, they stood up.

06:50.933 --> 06:52.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They were emphatic
about their positions.

06:52.933 --> 06:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at that time, Judy, looking
around the chamber, it was
clear that Republicans didn't

06:57.033 --> 06:59.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
know if they were going
to pass this bill.

06:59.100 --> 07:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I looked down below me, and I
saw Vice President Pence write
on a sheet of paper, "The Senate

07:03.733 --> 07:05.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will be in recess."

07:05.533 --> 07:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That made it clear that they
were ready to lose this vote.

07:08.666 --> 07:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When Ron Johnson came in to
vote yes, they weren't sure
how it was going to end up.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Judy, I think that's
an indication of where
we are in general.

07:15.300 --> 07:17.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They don't know how
they finish this.

07:17.300 --> 07:20.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They're glad to open
the process, but much
is still in flux.

07:20.033 --> 07:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They also don't know, we don't
know if anyone is willing to
compromise, as Senator McCain

07:24.600 --> 07:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
asked for today on the floor.

07:26.233 --> 07:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So much to watch.

07:28.233 --> 07:30.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins with
another long day at the
Capitol, thank you, Lisa.

07:30.766 --> 07:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: My pleasure.

07:32.800 --> 07:36.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will talk
to Montana Senator Jon Tester
about the day's drama right

07:37.500 --> 07:39.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after the news summary.

07:39.666 --> 07:43.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the day's other news:
President Trump today
kept sawing on the tree
limb where he's recently

07:43.766 --> 07:46.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
placed his attorney
general, Jeff Sessions.

07:46.833 --> 07:51.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He charged that Sessions has
been very weak on investigating
Hillary Clinton, and needs

07:51.766 --> 07:53.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to be -- quote --
"much tougher."

07:53.833 --> 07:57.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As for whether Sessions will
keep his job, the president
said, "Time will tell."

07:57.933 --> 08:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of Mr. Trump's
advisers said he probably
wants Sessions to resign.

08:01.233 --> 08:05.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will have a full report
later in the program.

08:05.066 --> 08:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The State Department denied
today that Secretary of
State Rex Tillerson is
increasingly frustrated

08:10.933 --> 08:12.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in his job.

08:12.933 --> 08:17.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Several news outlets reported
that the former ExxonMobil
chief is chafing at curbs on his

08:18.833 --> 08:20.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
independence.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The reports said he's
told friends that he
may not last a year.

08:23.333 --> 08:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But spokesperson Heather
Nauert rejected any such talk.

08:26.533 --> 08:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HEATHER NAUERT, State Department
Spokeswoman: That is false.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have spoken
with the secretary.

08:30.333 --> 08:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The secretary has been very
clear he intends to stay
here at State Department.

08:33.800 --> 08:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have a lot of work that is
left to be done ahead of us.

08:36.833 --> 08:38.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He recognizes that.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He is deeply engaged
in that work.

08:40.066 --> 08:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nauert said
that Tillerson is currently
taking a little time off.

08:44.133 --> 08:49.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The U.S. House of
Representatives today
voted overwhelmingly to
impose new sanctions on

08:50.500 --> 08:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russia, partly over its
meddling in the 2016 election.

08:53.366 --> 08:58.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This bars President Trump
from relaxing the penalties
without congressional approval.

09:00.333 --> 09:03.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, in the Russia
investigations, the president's
son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met

09:03.600 --> 09:06.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
privately with the House
Intelligence Committee.

09:06.733 --> 09:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And former Trump campaign
manager Paul Manafort spoke
with Senate Intelligence
Committee staffers.

09:13.100 --> 09:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will return to this
story later in the program.

09:15.766 --> 09:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Jerusalem, Muslim
clerics urged worshipers
to keep up protests and
avoid entering a contested

09:22.100 --> 09:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
holy site until further notice.

09:24.400 --> 09:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They had objected to Israel
installing metal detectors at
the Temple Mount/Noble Sanctuary

09:30.266 --> 09:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
site after an attack on police.

09:32.533 --> 09:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Overnight, the Israelis
dismantled the metal detectors,
in favor of high-tech cameras,

09:39.400 --> 09:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but protests continued
and Palestinian officials
remained adamant.

09:42.033 --> 09:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAMI HAMDALLAH, Prime Minister,
Palestinian National Authority
(through translator): We

09:44.600 --> 09:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
condemn all the Israeli
measures that take away our
people's right for worship.

09:48.033 --> 09:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We reject all obstacles that
hinder the freedom of worship
granted by international laws.

09:52.733 --> 09:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we demand that we
return to the situation
where things stood before.

09:56.033 --> 10:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Palestinians
warned that the new cameras
could see through clothing and

10:00.833 --> 10:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
embarrass female worshipers.

10:03.333 --> 10:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Israeli police said they
will not use cameras that
violate anyone's privacy.

10:07.766 --> 10:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An outbreak of cholera
in Yemen was set to reach
400,000 cases today.

10:14.533 --> 10:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has struck a
population already
ravaged by war and hunger.

10:17.333 --> 10:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have a report from Neil
Connery of Independent
Television News.

10:21.100 --> 10:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But be aware, some of the images
are graphic and disturbing.

10:25.200 --> 10:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NEIL CONNERY: Tagrid Tatan
barely has the strength to cry.

10:31.933 --> 10:36.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She's 12 years old.

10:38.966 --> 10:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For months, Yemen's children
have paid the highest price in
a war now in its third year.

10:46.133 --> 10:48.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Zara is 15.

10:48.733 --> 10:52.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is what hunger
has done to her.

10:52.933 --> 10:57.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now a cholera epidemic
is spreading, with more
than 5,000 cases every day.

10:59.800 --> 11:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At Todada (ph) hospital, they're
overwhelmed by cholera victims.

11:06.500 --> 11:10.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
More than 40 percent of
those affected are children.

11:10.700 --> 11:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yemen was already on its
knees, but now a disease which
should have been left in the

11:14.800 --> 11:19.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
19th century is in every
part of the country.

11:21.633 --> 11:25.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the villages, this waterborne
infection is claiming lives,
as one father who lost

11:26.733 --> 11:28.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his 4-year-old
son, Ali, told us.

11:28.766 --> 11:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): My
son died of cholera because the
water is contaminated, and we

11:34.766 --> 11:37.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do not have a solution
for this well.

11:37.900 --> 11:41.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We need a solution to
stop this illness that
has killed our children.

11:41.500 --> 11:46.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NEIL CONNERY: In the
nearby clinic, Tagrid
is finally receiving
help, but, across Yemen,

11:49.433 --> 11:53.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hunger and cholera cast
the darkest of shadows.

11:53.200 --> 11:58.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So hard to watch
that report from Neil Connery
of Independent Television

11:58.166 --> 12:00.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
News.

12:00.333 --> 12:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. and Iran have
had a new confrontation in
the Northern Persian Gulf.

12:03.733 --> 12:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An American patrol ship
fired warning shots today
near an Iranian vessel.

12:08.233 --> 12:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. military officials
said it ignored warnings
and came within 150 yards.

12:15.166 --> 12:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iran's Revolutionary Guard
charged that the U.S. vessel
provoked the incident.

12:20.200 --> 12:23.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's word that North Korea
could field an intercontinental
ballistic missile that

12:23.266 --> 12:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can carry a nuclear warhead
to a target by next year.

12:27.400 --> 12:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Washington Post is reporting
the new Pentagon estimate shaves
two years off the previous

12:33.000 --> 12:35.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
forecast.

12:35.066 --> 12:38.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. intelligence analysts say
that the North could conduct
new missile tests this week

12:38.566 --> 12:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
during a national holiday.

12:41.166 --> 12:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Upbeat corporate profits pushed
Wall Street higher today.

12:44.633 --> 12:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial
average gained 100
points to close at 21613.

12:48.400 --> 12:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose one point,
and the S&amp;P 500 added seven.

12:55.400 --> 12:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Barbara Sinatra died
today at her home in
Rancho Mirage, California.

12:59.900 --> 13:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She became Frank Sinatra's
fourth wife in 1976, and the
union lasted until the legendary

13:06.333 --> 13:09.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
singer's own death in 1998.

13:09.366 --> 13:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With his help, the former
showgirl-turned-socialite
raised millions of
dollars to help abused

13:14.966 --> 13:16.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
children.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Barbara Sinatra
was 90 years old.

13:18.700 --> 13:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what's next for the nation's
health care, the president's

13:25.700 --> 13:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
public criticism of his own
attorney general, Jeff Sessions;
we talk to members of the House

13:30.933 --> 13:34.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Intelligence Committee about
Jared Kushner's contacts
with Russia; and much more.

13:36.433 --> 13:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As we heard, it was a dramatic
and consequential return for
John McCain to the Senate floor,

13:50.533 --> 13:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his first public appearance
since being diagnosed
with brain cancer.

13:54.900 --> 13:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While his vote helped
Republicans open up
debate on health care,
he laid out the difficult

14:01.933 --> 14:04.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
road ahead to replace
the Affordable Care Act,
and he called on his
colleagues to change

14:06.366 --> 14:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the tone and behavior of the
Senate more broadly as well.

14:09.233 --> 14:11.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:11.733 --> 14:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MCCAIN (R), Arizona:
Our deliberations can
still be important and
useful, but I think

14:14.200 --> 14:18.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we'd all agree they
haven't been overburdened
by greatness lately.

14:18.966 --> 14:23.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, right now, they
aren't producing much
for the American people.

14:24.833 --> 14:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Both sides have let this happen.

14:26.733 --> 14:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's leave the history of who
shot first to the historians.

14:29.633 --> 14:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I suspect they will find we
all conspired in our decline,
either by deliberate actions

14:35.333 --> 14:36.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or neglect.

14:36.566 --> 14:38.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have all played
some role in it.

14:38.700 --> 14:40.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Certainly, I have.

14:40.200 --> 14:43.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Sometimes, I have let my
passion rule my reason.

14:43.466 --> 14:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sometimes, I made it harder
to find common ground because
of something harsh I said to

14:49.066 --> 14:51.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a colleague.

14:51.100 --> 14:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sometimes, I wanted to win more
for the sake of winning than
to achieve a contested policy.

14:57.700 --> 15:02.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I hope we can again
rely on humility, on our
need to cooperate, on
our dependence on each

15:04.633 --> 15:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other to learn how to trust
each other again and by so doing
better serve the people who

15:08.600 --> 15:10.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
elected us.

15:10.600 --> 15:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Stop listening to the bombastic
loudmouths on the radio and
television and the Internet.

15:16.300 --> 15:18.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
To hell with them.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

15:19.233 --> 15:20.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:20.800 --> 15:25.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN MCCAIN: They don't
want anything done
for the public good.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's trust each other.

15:27.633 --> 15:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's return to regular order.

15:29.600 --> 15:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have been spinning our
wheels on too many important
issues because we keep trying to

15:35.766 --> 15:38.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
find a way to win without
help from across the aisle.

15:38.500 --> 15:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's an approach that's
been employed by both sides,
mandating legislation from the

15:42.866 --> 15:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
top down, without any support
from the other side, with all
the parliamentary maneuvers

15:48.466 --> 15:49.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that requires.

15:49.666 --> 15:51.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're getting nothing
done, my friends.

15:51.566 --> 15:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're getting nothing done.

15:53.600 --> 15:58.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all we have really done
this year is confirm Neil
Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.

16:00.833 --> 16:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our health care insurance
system is a mess.

16:04.333 --> 16:08.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We all know it, those
who support Obamacare
and those who oppose it.

16:08.166 --> 16:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Something has to be done.

16:10.433 --> 16:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We Republicans have looked for
a way to end it and replace
it with something else without

16:14.733 --> 16:16.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
paying a terrible
political price.

16:16.833 --> 16:19.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We haven't found it yet.

16:19.133 --> 16:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I'm not sure we will.

16:21.133 --> 16:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All we have managed to do is
make more popular a policy that
wasn't very popular when we

16:26.166 --> 16:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
started trying to get rid of it.

16:28.333 --> 16:31.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator
John McCain on the
Senate floor today.

16:31.366 --> 16:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We asked more than 20 Republican
senators to join us tonight.

16:34.966 --> 16:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
None accepted our invitation.

16:37.200 --> 16:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we stay on Capitol Hill
for a Democrat's perspective.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He is Senator Jon
Tester of Montana.

16:42.833 --> 16:44.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He has served in the
Senate since 2007.

16:44.766 --> 16:47.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Senator, we're very glad
to have you join us.

16:47.966 --> 16:51.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What did you make of what
John McCain had to say today?

16:51.266 --> 16:52.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:52.700 --> 16:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JON TESTER (D), Montana:
Well, I think he was spot on.

16:54.733 --> 16:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John's a statesman, and he
certainly has respects from
both sides of the aisle.

16:58.333 --> 17:00.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But this place is broken.

17:00.400 --> 17:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we do need to work across
the aisle, and compromise
shouldn't be a dirty word.

17:05.200 --> 17:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we need to negotiate and
we need to take everybody's
input and come up with the best

17:10.933 --> 17:13.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
possible legislation.

17:13.033 --> 17:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's certainly not what
happened with the health care
bill that we have dealt with

17:16.366 --> 17:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over the last seven months, the
various ones that have come out.

17:19.433 --> 17:21.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the bottom
line is this, Judy.

17:21.533 --> 17:23.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This country was built by
people working together.

17:23.666 --> 17:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Washington, D.C., is far,
far, far too partisan.

17:28.100 --> 17:29.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we need to start
working together.

17:29.666 --> 17:31.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think John McCain
is right on that.

17:31.466 --> 17:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there any sign
that that's going to happen?

17:33.400 --> 17:36.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Is one senator's speech
on the floor going
to make a difference?

17:36.166 --> 17:37.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

17:37.866 --> 17:39.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JON TESTER: Well, no,
I think it's going to
take more than that.

17:39.900 --> 17:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I will just tell you that
I am blessed to be able to
work with a guy by the name

17:42.433 --> 17:44.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Johnny Isakson
on the VA Committee.

17:44.700 --> 17:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And together, a Republican
and a Democrat, along with a
really good committee, have been

17:49.100 --> 17:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
able to pump out some pretty
good bills that the president
has been able to sign.

17:52.833 --> 17:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have done that by
communicating with one another,
not embarrassing one another,

17:59.266 --> 18:01.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but working for the best
interests of our veterans.

18:01.366 --> 18:05.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that if the Senate
would take a look at the
successes we have had over the

18:07.566 --> 18:11.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last many years, it's been
by people communicating
and working together and
negotiating and compromising.

18:13.366 --> 18:16.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I think we start
to doing that more and
more in the Senate.

18:16.400 --> 18:20.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there is no better place
to start than with a bill
that impacts one-sixth of our

18:20.833 --> 18:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
economy, this health care bill.

18:22.300 --> 18:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's talk
about that health care bill.

18:24.400 --> 18:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now that Republicans have
been able to get it on the
floor, debate has begun.

18:28.200 --> 18:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do they have the votes, do you
believe, to get it to a point
where they repeal the Affordable

18:34.633 --> 18:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Care Act and come up with a
substitute that they like?

18:36.600 --> 18:38.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

18:38.566 --> 18:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON TESTER: I have no idea,
because I don't know of anybody
that voted today that knew

18:40.966 --> 18:43.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what they were voting on.

18:43.266 --> 18:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were voting on potentially
a House bill that was going
to be replaced with something

18:47.066 --> 18:49.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
else, but we don't
know what it is.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I will go back to
John McCain's words.

18:51.733 --> 18:55.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Let's go back to the
committee process and
start working together.

18:55.133 --> 18:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that's going to have to be
something that Mitch McConnell
requires, rather than trying

18:59.966 --> 19:04.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to craft something with a
limited number of people and
a limited number of input that

19:06.900 --> 19:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually doesn't move the health
care system forward and make
it more accessible and more

19:08.800 --> 19:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
affordable, especially for
folks in Middle America,
because we really get pounded by

19:13.533 --> 19:17.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
proposals like the House
bill or, what's even
worse, the Senate health
care bill that came

19:17.866 --> 19:19.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forth.

19:19.333 --> 19:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, it could literally shut
down health care facilities.

19:21.966 --> 19:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's what they have told
me as I have gone around the
state and visited face-to-face

19:26.066 --> 19:28.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with these folks.

19:28.133 --> 19:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Senator,
what we're hearing now is what
-- the version that may have the

19:31.100 --> 19:36.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
best chance is what
they're calling skinny
repeal, which wouldn't
do away with everything,

19:37.533 --> 19:39.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but it would do away with
the individual mandate.

19:39.600 --> 19:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would do away, I gather,
with employer mandate penalty
and the medical device tax.

19:45.433 --> 19:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that something that comes
any closer to a consensus?

19:47.266 --> 19:49.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

19:49.333 --> 19:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON TESTER: I don't know that
that's the kind of reform that
we need in our health care

19:51.633 --> 19:53.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
system.

19:53.700 --> 19:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it may be more of
a bait-and-switch to be able to
get a bill that you could get

19:56.700 --> 20:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a number of votes to pass
it out and then take it to
conference and replace with it

20:00.266 --> 20:01.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a really bad bill.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's my concern.

20:03.433 --> 20:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you don't
think that that version, which
some Republicans are saying

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would make them happy, bring
some conservatives on board, and
perhaps entice moderates, you're

20:14.133 --> 20:15.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
saying you don't see
that as moving the ball?

20:15.500 --> 20:17.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JON TESTER: Look, I don't think
it's going the move the ball.

20:18.233 --> 20:20.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think there is
another agenda here.

20:20.233 --> 20:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the agenda is to do some
really bad things with Medicaid
expansion and to block-grant

20:27.133 --> 20:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Medicaid, which really hurts
rural states - - I think it
hurts the whole country -- and

20:30.933 --> 20:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not to address preexisting
conditions and lifetime caps.

20:34.966 --> 20:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if that's the direction
we're headed, then that's not
the direction I want to go.

20:42.466 --> 20:44.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that that skinny
bill, that bait-and-switch
bill, whatever you
want to call it, Trojan

20:44.766 --> 20:49.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
horse repeal bill, that bill
is not where we will end up at.

20:51.266 --> 20:53.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I don't think you get the
conservatives with that bill.

20:53.766 --> 20:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I don't think you
get the moderates either.

20:56.266 --> 21:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think what's
happened here is, you
have got Mitch McConnell,
who has his vote today

21:00.633 --> 21:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on something we don't know
what it is going to end up at,
and him crafting another bill

21:05.033 --> 21:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to put it up to be able to
change the bill in conference.

21:07.800 --> 21:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's all very convoluted,
in the weeds, but that's
where we're headed.

21:11.300 --> 21:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Senator, you
mentioned Medicaid expansion
in your own state of Montana.

21:15.066 --> 21:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm reading an Associated Press
report that talks about the
number of Medicaid enrollees

21:21.500 --> 21:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
having far exceeded the
number that were expected.

21:24.366 --> 21:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A number of people in
your state worrying this
program can't be sustained.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I guess they were expecting
maybe 30,000 to sign up.

21:31.400 --> 21:33.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's been 80,000
who have signed up.

21:33.733 --> 21:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there's worry that
Montana can't continue this.

21:36.800 --> 21:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Isn't this the exact sort
of thing that Republicans
say is what making this
whole process unsustainable?

21:42.300 --> 21:44.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:44.366 --> 21:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON TESTER: I think the
Medicaid expansion has been an
incredible success in Montana

21:46.700 --> 21:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and has really helped people
get health care for the first
time in their life, the working

21:51.433 --> 21:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
folks out there that couldn't
afford health care before.

21:54.333 --> 21:56.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think this is
about priorities.

21:56.400 --> 22:01.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if our priority is to make
sure that people have access
to affordable health care, then

22:04.433 --> 22:06.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we need to move forward.

22:06.533 --> 22:10.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But we have got 77,000
folks that signed up for
Medicaid expansion in
the state of a million

22:10.366 --> 22:12.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and 50,000 people.

22:12.100 --> 22:14.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't think that's
necessarily a bad thing.

22:14.533 --> 22:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's a good thing,
because now we have people
that are going to school that

22:17.500 --> 22:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are healthy, that are going to
work that are healthy, that own
small businesses that healthier,

22:23.633 --> 22:25.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and I think it's an
important step to take.

22:25.033 --> 22:28.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I think it's
about priorities.

22:28.200 --> 22:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need to make health care
a priority in this country.

22:30.666 --> 22:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Democratic
Senator Jon Tester of Montana,
we thank you very much.

22:36.333 --> 22:38.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

22:38.066 --> 22:43.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JON TESTER: Thank you.

22:45.033 --> 22:49.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The escalation
of President Trump's criticism
of Jeff Sessions exposes

22:52.033 --> 22:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a rare public divide between
an American president
and his attorney general.

22:57.800 --> 22:59.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown reports.

22:59.800 --> 23:03.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: I'm disappointed
in the attorney general.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He shouldn't have
recused himself.

23:06.466 --> 23:09.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: The
president's latest salvo
came this afternoon,
at his news conference

23:09.900 --> 23:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with Lebanon's prime minister.

23:11.966 --> 23:16.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That followed a morning
broadside on Twitter, declaring:
"Attorney General Jeff Sessions

23:18.900 --> 23:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has taken a very weak
position on Hillary Clinton
crimes and intel leakers."

23:24.666 --> 23:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, yesterday, another
tweet that called
Sessions "our beleaguered
A.G." and plaintively

23:28.866 --> 23:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
asked why he's not
investigating Hillary Clinton.

23:31.233 --> 23:33.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, what is next?

23:33.400 --> 23:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The president said this today:

23:35.433 --> 23:39.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: I want
the attorney general
to be much tougher on
leaks from intelligence

23:39.766 --> 23:41.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agencies.

23:41.200 --> 23:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will see what happens.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Time will tell.

23:45.166 --> 23:49.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sessions
was a veteran Republican
senator from Alabama,
and in early 2016 became

23:50.433 --> 23:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the first in that body to
endorse the Trump candidacy.

23:56.833 --> 23:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After he won, president-elect
Trump nominated him
as attorney general.

23:59.333 --> 24:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But less than a month after
Sessions' confirmation,
it emerged that,
despite earlier denials,

24:06.233 --> 24:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he had, in fact, met with
the Russian ambassador
during the campaign.

24:08.766 --> 24:12.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS, U.S. Attorney
General: I shouldn't be involved
in any campaign investigation.

24:12.900 --> 24:17.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In early March,
Sessions he recused himself from
Russia-related investigations,

24:19.933 --> 24:23.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a decision still angers the
president, as he made clear to
The New York Times last week.

24:25.033 --> 24:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: How do you take a
job, and then recuse yourself?

24:27.333 --> 24:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If he would have recused
himself before the job, I would
have said, thanks, Jeff, but

24:30.100 --> 24:33.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I can't -- I'm not
going to take you.

24:33.633 --> 24:38.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's extremely unfair,
and that's a mild
word, to the president.

24:38.133 --> 24:41.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: The next
day, Sessions said he
has no plans to resign.

24:41.733 --> 24:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS: We love this job.

24:43.533 --> 24:45.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We love this department.

24:45.066 --> 24:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I plan to continue to do so
as long as that is appropriate.

24:48.833 --> 24:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The attorney
general has not been heard from
since, but several Republican

24:55.033 --> 24:57.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
senators have rallied to
their former colleague.

24:57.033 --> 25:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, South Carolina's Lindsey
Graham called the president's
rebuke of Sessions for not

25:02.966 --> 25:05.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prosecuting Hillary Clinton
highly inappropriate.

25:05.066 --> 25:08.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Utah's Orrin Hatch
said he was surprised.

25:08.300 --> 25:10.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

25:10.366 --> 25:12.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ORRIN HATCH (R), Utah:
Jeff has been very loyal
to the president, and
I think he deserves

25:12.933 --> 25:14.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
loyalty back.

25:14.900 --> 25:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Democrats warned
that forcing out Sessions
would spark a new firestorm.

25:17.800 --> 25:19.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

25:19.900 --> 25:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: Many Americans must
be wondering if the president

25:21.966 --> 25:26.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is trying to pry open the office
of attorney general to appoint
someone during the August

25:28.933 --> 25:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
recess who will fire special
counsel Mueller and shut down
the Russia investigation.

25:35.733 --> 25:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Even so, the
new White House communications
director, Anthony Scaramucci,

25:42.300 --> 25:45.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
told conservative radio
host Hugh Hewitt that
the die may be cast.

25:45.033 --> 25:47.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HUGH HEWITT, Radio Talk
Show Host: It's clear
the president wants him
gone, isn't it, Anthony?

25:47.733 --> 25:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, White House
Communications Director: I have
an enormous amount of respect

25:50.066 --> 25:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the attorney general,
but I do know the
president pretty well.

25:54.833 --> 25:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if there's this
level of tension in the
relationship, that that's
public, you're probably

26:00.500 --> 26:02.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right.

26:02.533 --> 26:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: A Scout is
trustworthy, loyal - - we
could use some more loyalty.

26:06.400 --> 26:08.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I will tell you that.

26:08.500 --> 26:11.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: that level of
tension may have been in play
last night at the Boy Scouts'

26:11.766 --> 26:13.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
National Jamboree.

26:13.866 --> 26:18.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The president brought
with him Cabinet members
and former Scouts Ryan
Zinke and Rick Perry,

26:20.166 --> 26:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but Eagle Scout Jeff Sessions
was nowhere to be seen.

26:23.166 --> 26:26.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A very high-level rift
now out in the open.

26:26.900 --> 26:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We get more from our own John
Yang, reporting from the White
House, and Sari Horwitz, who

26:33.266 --> 26:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
covers the Justice Department
for The Washington Post.

26:34.533 --> 26:37.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
John, you were at that
press conference today.

26:37.533 --> 26:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where does this leave things
as far as Jeff Sessions
holding on to his job?

26:42.066 --> 26:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, you know,
the president rejected
the suggestion of a
reporter that he had been

26:46.600 --> 26:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leaving Jeff Sessions slowly
twisting in the wind, to
use an old Watergate phrase.

26:53.666 --> 26:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, at the same time, as you
heard in your report, he said
he's got no timeline for when

26:57.766 --> 26:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he's going to make a decision.

26:59.800 --> 27:04.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is clear that the president
sees a direct line from Jeff
Sessions' recusing himself

27:06.400 --> 27:10.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the Russia investigation
to the appointment of
Robert Mueller as the
special counsel and

27:11.833 --> 27:15.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this investigation that
is dogging him still.

27:15.033 --> 27:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He told The Wall Street Journal
in an interview before that news
conference, if Jeff Sessions

27:21.966 --> 27:24.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
didn't recuse himself, we
wouldn't even be talking
about this subject.

27:24.966 --> 27:29.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it's clear he is still very
frustrated, very, in his words,
disappointed in his attorney

27:30.800 --> 27:33.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
general.

27:33.333 --> 27:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And,
Sari Horwitz, is there
anything more coming out
of the Justice Department?

27:35.366 --> 27:38.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do we know how the attorney
general is taking all this?

27:38.366 --> 27:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARI HORWITZ, The Washington
Post: Well, you know, it's just
been an extraordinary spectacle

27:41.833 --> 27:43.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
playing out here in Washington.

27:43.866 --> 27:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have been at the Justice
Department all day, and all
indications are that Jeff

27:50.166 --> 27:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sessions is not going to resign
and that he's moving forward
with his conservative agenda.

27:55.200 --> 27:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He, really more than any other
Cabinet member, has been putting
many place, moving quickly,

28:00.200 --> 28:03.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
methodically to undo Holder,
Eric Holder, and Obama policies
at the Justice Department,

28:06.300 --> 28:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and he's moving forward on that.

28:08.333 --> 28:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's compartmentalizing these
disparaging comments by the
president, which I'm being

28:12.300 --> 28:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
told by people at the Justice
Department he's been doing since
he got in as attorney general

28:17.900 --> 28:19.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in February.

28:19.900 --> 28:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, he recused himself
in March, and this has
been going on since March.

28:21.933 --> 28:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sari, you and
your colleagues reported today
on discussions within the White

28:28.100 --> 28:31.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
House about replacing
Jeff Sessions and how
that might happen.

28:31.600 --> 28:33.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, those discussions
are taking place?

28:33.800 --> 28:38.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARI HORWITZ: We heard they
had been taking place up until
now, but it's interesting.

28:38.300 --> 28:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the conservative media,
Breitbart, Rush Limbaugh,
conservative senators came

28:45.300 --> 28:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out and said, we like the
policies Jeff Sessions
has been putting in place.

28:48.000 --> 28:53.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And actually, today, late
afternoon, Jeff Sessions
announced another new
policy, a conservative

28:55.000 --> 28:58.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
policy, to crack down
on so-called sanctuary
cities and tie very
important federal grants

29:00.266 --> 29:04.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to local cities and
states, to tie those
grants to restrictions.

29:04.700 --> 29:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, if the states seem to be
harboring illegal immigrants,
undocumented immigrants, they

29:10.566 --> 29:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
won't give them the money.

29:12.600 --> 29:16.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what we're hearing is,
tomorrow or the next day, he's
going to be announcing that

29:16.566 --> 29:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Justice Department is indeed
doing leak investigations.

29:19.700 --> 29:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: John, what do
you make of the support that
has been ever more vocal today,

29:26.133 --> 29:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in fact, for Jeff Sessions
from friends and allies?

29:28.166 --> 29:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, I think,
Jeff, it really is one of the
conundrums of this, is that

29:32.800 --> 29:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he is extremely popular among
Mr. Trump's base, largely
because of what Sari has just

29:39.600 --> 29:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been talking about, his
stand on illegal immigration,
on sanctuary cities.

29:46.166 --> 29:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Remember that he was actually
Steve Bannon's first choice
to be a presidential candidate

29:51.266 --> 29:53.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because of his
immigration policies.

29:53.333 --> 29:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But then it became clear
that he wasn't going to run.

29:56.400 --> 30:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think that -- and one
of the outside people that
President Trump talked to, has

30:03.300 --> 30:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been talking to about this
tells me that this is something
he did remind him, that Jeff

30:06.733 --> 30:09.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Sessions is very
popular among his base.

30:09.233 --> 30:14.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And you heard it from
a lot of particularly
Southern conservative
Democrats on the hill

30:14.700 --> 30:16.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

30:16.733 --> 30:18.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, John, we
did hear also at the press
conference the president again

30:18.233 --> 30:20.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
raising the issue
of leaks today.

30:20.500 --> 30:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, that remains
connected to all of this.

30:23.300 --> 30:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And you also have
to wonder if that's -- if
what he's talking about with

30:27.700 --> 30:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his tweets -- and, by the way,
you know, as Sari points out,
he is going after a member

30:32.533 --> 30:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of his own Cabinet as if he was
one of his primary opponents
in last year's election

30:40.100 --> 30:42.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
- - if this constant
pressure on Sessions isn't
some sort of leverage to
get the Justice Department

30:45.166 --> 30:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to act on these leaks, which
have been his real bugaboo in
all these stories coming out

30:52.466 --> 30:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the Russia investigation.

30:54.433 --> 30:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sari,
just in our last 30
seconds, what about that?

30:56.400 --> 31:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What about the leaks
connection to all this sort
of public furor we're hearing?

31:00.600 --> 31:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARI HORWITZ: We know Trump is
angry about the leaks, and as
I said, we have been hearing

31:04.900 --> 31:09.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
late afternoon at the Justice
Department that within the next
day or two Attorney General

31:09.566 --> 31:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sessions is going to make an
announcement that the Justice
Department has been doing

31:13.500 --> 31:18.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leak investigations, maybe
showing his tougher side to the
president, and indicating that,

31:20.500 --> 31:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
along with illegal immigration
and criminal justice policy,
he's also moving forward on

31:25.466 --> 31:27.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
finding the leakers.

31:27.600 --> 31:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sari Horwitz of
The Washington Post, and John
Yang, our own, thank you both

31:30.666 --> 31:32.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very much.

31:32.500 --> 31:37.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SARI HORWITZ: Thank you.

31:39.133 --> 31:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

31:47.400 --> 31:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
the difficult task
of feeding low-income
students when school's

31:54.266 --> 31:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out for the summer; and
Seattle's new seawall that
doubles as a science experiment.

31:59.366 --> 32:03.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But first: the investigation
into Russian meddling
in the 2016 election.

32:05.866 --> 32:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Late today, the Senate Judiciary
Committee rescinded its subpoena
for former Trump campaign

32:10.966 --> 32:12.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
manager Paul Manafort.

32:12.833 --> 32:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Negotiations continue on
when and how he will testify.

32:16.466 --> 32:19.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Earlier, it was round
two for Jared Kushner.

32:19.800 --> 32:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president's son-in-law and
senior adviser answered more
questions on Capitol Hill about

32:26.433 --> 32:30.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
his interactions with
Russian officials during
the campaign and beyond.

32:30.066 --> 32:32.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has that.

32:32.466 --> 32:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Yesterday, Kushner released
an 11-page document
detailing several meetings

32:36.000 --> 32:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he had with Russian citizens
and officials while working on
his father-in-law's campaign

32:40.533 --> 32:43.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and transition.

32:43.133 --> 32:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kushner said there was
absolutely no collusion
and no improper contacts,
even though he initially

32:47.000 --> 32:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
failed to disclose these
meetings, as required by law.

32:50.400 --> 32:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more on this, we talk with
two lawmakers who questioned
Kushner today in that closed

32:54.833 --> 32:56.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
session.

32:56.900 --> 32:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, earlier today, I spoke
with Republican Congressman
Chris Stewart of Utah, who's on

32:59.633 --> 33:01.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the House Intelligence
Committee.

33:01.200 --> 33:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I asked him what questions he
had going into today's meeting.

33:04.033 --> 33:06.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

33:06.100 --> 33:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS STEWART (R), Utah: You
know, we wanted to know some
of the details about obviously

33:08.233 --> 33:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his meetings with some of the
people associated with Russia
and who set up those meetings,

33:13.866 --> 33:15.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
what he knew about those
meetings, what came
out of those meetings.

33:15.866 --> 33:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I got to tell you, though, that
for those who are hoping and
looking for the impeachment

33:21.400 --> 33:23.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Donald Trump, Jared
Kushner is not that guy.

33:23.733 --> 33:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, he's not going to
carry that narrative chord.

33:26.433 --> 33:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's very sincere, very honest,
and he just didn't have much
to add to this story in those

33:32.966 --> 33:35.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who are looking for
evidence of collusion.

33:35.066 --> 33:38.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: One
of the issues that I
know came up yesterday,
and I'm assuming today,

33:38.566 --> 33:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was his federal disclosure
form, where he, as an incoming
member of the administration,

33:43.233 --> 33:47.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is supposed to disclose all
these meetings he may have
had with foreign officials.

33:47.466 --> 33:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And apparently he had to
update that document three
different times, saying
he forgot initially.

33:53.933 --> 33:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He chalked it up yesterday to
something of a rookie mistake.

33:56.300 --> 34:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Did your questions to him today
assuage any doubts you might
have about that particular

34:01.100 --> 34:02.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issue?

34:02.100 --> 34:04.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

34:04.200 --> 34:05.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS STEWART: Yes, you
know, that was one things
we did want to talk about.

34:05.766 --> 34:07.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it really was
answered I think to all
of our satisfaction.

34:07.133 --> 34:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's really very simple.

34:08.466 --> 34:11.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The SF-86 is a very
complicated document.

34:11.066 --> 34:12.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I had to do one as
an Air Force pilot.

34:12.800 --> 34:16.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You go back 10 years, in
some cases, more than that.

34:16.266 --> 34:21.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You have to provide in
some cases hundreds of
pages of information.

34:21.200 --> 34:25.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's not at all unusual
for someone to update or
to modify that document.

34:25.600 --> 34:27.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In fact, they expect
that you will.

34:27.866 --> 34:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They expect that, as you kind
of dive into this process,
you're going to remember things.

34:32.533 --> 34:35.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And in this case, the
explanation was even
more simple than that.

34:35.166 --> 34:37.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was more than it is
a complicated document.

34:37.366 --> 34:42.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was that they admit that
they filed that document by
mistake and didn't have some of

34:43.666 --> 34:45.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this information on.

34:45.366 --> 34:48.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But they recognized that
immediately, and within
a day had updated it.

34:48.733 --> 34:51.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so it wasn't just
Russian officials that
they didn't include.

34:51.533 --> 34:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were officials with
-- or meetings with King
Abdullah, a meeting with
some other -- Benjamin

34:57.966 --> 35:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Netanyahu, people that they
clearly would have remembered.

35:00.100 --> 35:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They just didn't have it on that
form, recognized that error,
and, I would say within 24 hours

35:04.500 --> 35:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
had already corrected it.

35:06.533 --> 35:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: There is
also a question about whether
Kushner had participated in

35:10.300 --> 35:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or asked the Russian ambassador
to help set up this back-channel
line of communications

35:16.500 --> 35:18.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with the Russians.

35:18.500 --> 35:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Did you talk with him
about that today, and what
did he say about that?

35:19.933 --> 35:22.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

35:22.066 --> 35:24.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHRIS STEWART: Yes, our
conclusion is that he
didn't intend for there
to be any back-channel

35:24.766 --> 35:27.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
communications.

35:27.300 --> 35:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was just to facilitate
what they thought was
one conversation that
some Russian officials

35:30.366 --> 35:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wanted to have about, you know,
developing relationships with
the incoming administration.

35:37.300 --> 35:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They didn't have any secure
phones, and so they just simply
asked, do you have a secure

35:39.900 --> 35:41.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
phone?

35:41.933 --> 35:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That conversation didn't take
place, and that was really kind
of the beginning and end of

35:45.866 --> 35:47.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

35:47.933 --> 35:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it is one of those things
where you do wonder when you
hear about this and you read

35:49.933 --> 35:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the press reports, but then
when you actually have a chance
to talk to the witness, you

35:54.233 --> 35:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
realize, again, there is a
very reasonable explanation for
it, and there isn't much more

35:59.033 --> 36:01.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to pursue.

36:01.100 --> 36:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Some of your
colleagues and some others
have said that, given the

36:03.200 --> 36:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
questions swirling around
Kushner, that he shouldn't have
a security clearance to see

36:08.166 --> 36:10.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
top-secret national
security information.

36:10.500 --> 36:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think that that's
-- do you think he should
lose his privileges?

36:13.333 --> 36:14.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

36:14.533 --> 36:16.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHRIS STEWART: No, I
just think that's nuts.

36:16.600 --> 36:18.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Look, if he's this done
something wrong and if
someone has evidence
that he did something

36:18.933 --> 36:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wrong and that we can actually
say, OK, that's a security
violation or a security concern,

36:25.100 --> 36:27.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
then, well, let's
deal with that.

36:27.133 --> 36:30.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if your only objection
to him is saying that he had
to add additional information

36:30.866 --> 36:35.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to this form that they
requested, then I just
think it's inappropriate
for someone to say

36:35.633 --> 36:38.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that that would preclude
him from holding a
security clearance.

36:38.233 --> 36:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Lastly,
Congressman, just shifting
gears a tiny bit, the president,

36:42.000 --> 36:45.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
as you know, has been
quite tough recently on
his attorney general.

36:45.933 --> 36:48.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I'm just curious
for your take on that.

36:48.033 --> 36:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As a member of his own party,
what does that atmosphere do
to this ongoing investigation?

36:53.433 --> 36:54.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

36:54.433 --> 36:56.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHRIS STEWART: Yes.

36:56.933 --> 36:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, I support our
president and I defend
him when it's appropriate
when I think that

36:59.166 --> 37:01.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's being, you know, unfairly
attacked or criticized.

37:01.366 --> 37:04.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But, on the other hand,
there are times when
I disagree with him.

37:04.166 --> 37:06.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this is one of those times.

37:06.200 --> 37:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the attorney general
is one of the most honorable,
sincere men in government.

37:10.200 --> 37:12.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's certainly been my
interactions with him.

37:12.200 --> 37:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when you see him testify
and others, I think most
American people feel that that

37:16.100 --> 37:18.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

37:18.200 --> 37:22.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I don't -- just
don't understand why he
wouldn't and I, in fact,
expect that he should

37:23.266 --> 37:25.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
continue as our
attorney general.

37:25.300 --> 37:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Congressman Chris Stewart, thank
you very much for being here.

37:26.733 --> 37:28.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHRIS STEWART: All
right, thank you.

37:30.066 --> 37:31.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And now for
a view from across the aisle,
I'm joined by Congressman

37:31.466 --> 37:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Adam Schiff of California.

37:33.266 --> 37:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's the top Democrat on the
House Intelligence Committee.

37:35.266 --> 37:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Congressman, so, you had chance
to talk to Jared Kushner today.

37:38.933 --> 37:40.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What were your
questions going in?

37:40.600 --> 37:42.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And do you feel like he
answered them satisfactorily?

37:42.466 --> 37:44.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

37:44.866 --> 37:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF (D), California:
We had a variety of
questions certainly
about the four meetings

37:47.400 --> 37:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he disclosed in his public
statement the other day, but
about a lot of other areas

37:52.866 --> 37:55.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as well.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're looking at any of the
Russian active measures that
may have been employed here

37:57.333 --> 38:00.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that we know they
employ in other places.

38:00.333 --> 38:05.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're looking at allegations
concerning the social media
campaign, whether there was any

38:05.233 --> 38:10.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
kind of cooperation or
coordination through
Cambridge Analytica.

38:12.200 --> 38:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're looking at some of the
financial issues, because one
of the things that the Russians

38:14.766 --> 38:18.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do is, they use financial
leverage, or sometimes
they develop what the
Russians call kompromat

38:20.466 --> 38:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by engaging in a list of
transactions with people as a
way of being able to hold that

38:24.033 --> 38:26.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
over their head.

38:26.033 --> 38:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we went, with this witness,
as we do with all, over the
whole range of our concerns

38:32.100 --> 38:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to do the best we can to get to
the bottom of these allegations.

38:35.200 --> 38:37.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let's
talk about some of those
particular allegations.

38:37.933 --> 38:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of them was this issue of
this federal disclosure form,
where he failed initially

38:42.833 --> 38:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to reveal that he had these
meetings with dozens of foreign
nationals, including these

38:48.700 --> 38:50.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
meetings with the Russians.

38:50.666 --> 38:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jared Kushner yesterday said
that this was an innocent
mistake, that this was basically

38:53.600 --> 38:54.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a rookie error.

38:54.866 --> 38:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you buy that as an excuse?

38:57.033 --> 38:58.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

38:58.433 --> 38:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: Well, he doesn't
strike me as a rookie.

38:59.866 --> 39:01.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think he's quite
sophisticated.

39:01.800 --> 39:03.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't want to
characterize his testimony.

39:03.933 --> 39:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We actually don't really go
into the details of testimony.

39:06.733 --> 39:10.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I was surprised that
my colleague was
willing to do that.

39:10.033 --> 39:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will say this, that the holder
of that clearance, I do believe,
needs to investigate this to

39:17.066 --> 39:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
find out whether Mr. Kushner's
explanations are satisfactory,
what the circumstances are,

39:22.966 --> 39:25.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what was disclosed,
what wasn't disclosed.

39:25.433 --> 39:28.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have not yet
obtained the SF-86s.

39:28.266 --> 39:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we're really not in a
position to evaluate what
and when he disclosed
different things.

39:35.233 --> 39:38.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I do believe that other
individuals, not the son-in-law
of the president, if they were

39:40.566 --> 39:44.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to fail to disclose a meeting
that they attended that was with
people acting on behalf of the

39:46.400 --> 39:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian government, promising
dirt on a political opponent, or
a meeting that wasn't disclosed

39:50.533 --> 39:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that involved setting up a
secret back channel at a Russian
diplomatic facility, it is very

39:57.500 --> 39:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unlikely that an ordinary
individual would be allowed
to keep their clearance.

39:59.600 --> 40:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let's touch
on a few other issues that are
swirling in Washington right

40:03.533 --> 40:05.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

40:05.633 --> 40:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obviously, as you have been
hearing in our broadcast, the
president has been very tough

40:08.166 --> 40:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on Attorney General Sessions.

40:10.266 --> 40:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many people believe that the
president would like him to
either leave or would like to

40:13.666 --> 40:15.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fire him.

40:15.666 --> 40:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If that were to happen,
what would that do to these
ongoing investigations?

40:18.833 --> 40:20.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

40:20.100 --> 40:22.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I
think you're right.

40:22.200 --> 40:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In this case, the president
is being very transparent, at
least as far as his intentions

40:25.200 --> 40:27.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are concerned.

40:27.300 --> 40:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wants to force Jeff Sessions
to resign, and, therefore, he
would less have his fingerprints

40:31.233 --> 40:34.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on hit than if he
fired Jeff Sessions.

40:34.133 --> 40:36.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think the motivation
is quite simple.

40:36.900 --> 40:41.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He wants to appoint a
more malleable attorney
general when it comes to
the Russia investigation

40:41.633 --> 40:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who is not recused, who can
tell Bob Mueller, you will look
at this, but you won't look

40:45.733 --> 40:50.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at these other areas that are
evidently so concerning to the
president, including whether

40:50.466 --> 40:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there was any money-laundering
going on with the
Trump Organization.

40:54.500 --> 40:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What should we do about it?

40:56.633 --> 41:01.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If there is any effort
to interfere with Bob
Mueller's investigation,
we may need to reenact

41:03.100 --> 41:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the independent counsel law,
and make sure that Bob Mueller
has a completely free hand

41:08.500 --> 41:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to look at anything relevant
to the Russia investigation
or that arises from it, which

41:14.500 --> 41:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is his charter now, but
something clearly the president
is uncomfortable with.

41:20.400 --> 41:24.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The president needs
to understand this is
not his prerogative
to determine what the

41:26.266 --> 41:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investigators are
investigating when it
involves his own organization.

41:28.200 --> 41:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I'm curious
what you think, though.

41:30.833 --> 41:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president has said --
what's really relevant here is
probably what the GOP would do.

41:37.800 --> 41:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If Sessions were fired, we heard
today many, many senators and
congressmen supporting Jeff

41:44.466 --> 41:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sessions, but we also
heard Speaker Ryan saying
that, in essence, it
is the president's job

41:47.766 --> 41:50.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to determine who
is in his Cabinet.

41:50.100 --> 41:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think if this -- if
Sessions were to be let go, that
the GOP would -- there would

41:56.000 --> 41:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be a revolt in his own party?

41:57.033 --> 41:59.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

41:59.166 --> 42:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: I would certainly
hope that that would be the
case, if he either pushes Jeff

42:01.900 --> 42:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sessions out or he were to
fire Bob Mueller, that both
Democrats and Republicans would

42:08.833 --> 42:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rise to their institutional
responsibility of insisting that
an independent investigation

42:13.166 --> 42:14.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
go forth.

42:14.433 --> 42:16.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think it would be a
constitutional crisis.

42:16.466 --> 42:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have to say, I'm deeply
disappointed once again to
hear the speaker so downplay

42:19.866 --> 42:24.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the significance of this,
because that only encourages the
president to engage in conduct

42:24.833 --> 42:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is, I think, very
seriously at odds with our
system of checks and balances.

42:31.833 --> 42:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When we meet with emerging
democracies, we always
emphasize a couple things.

42:34.633 --> 42:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We emphasize, when you
win an election, you don't
jail the losing party.

42:39.400 --> 42:43.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, here, one of the gripes
apparently the president has
is that Jeff Sessions is not

42:43.966 --> 42:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
acting to try to
investigate and prosecute
his political opponent.

42:48.200 --> 42:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is something you see
in a banana republic, not in
the United States of America.

42:54.600 --> 42:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, members of both
parties need to speak out.

42:56.200 --> 42:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We shouldn't wait until
there is a crisis to do so.

42:59.566 --> 43:02.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I hope the speaker
will think better of
what he just said.

43:02.133 --> 43:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Lastly,
quickly, Congressman,
the president clearly
still chafes at this

43:06.733 --> 43:09.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Russia investigation.

43:09.133 --> 43:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his new communications
director today seemed
to indicate that
the president still

43:15.433 --> 43:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't believe that Russia
was actually involved in trying
to meddle in our election.

43:21.766 --> 43:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Given that huge chasm
between what our intelligence
agencies believe and what
the president believes,

43:26.233 --> 43:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
how can this really go forward?

43:29.033 --> 43:31.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

43:31.100 --> 43:32.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: Well, look, there
is only really one person in
America that doesn't believe

43:32.600 --> 43:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Russians were involved
in hacking our election.

43:34.133 --> 43:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's, unfortunately,
the president.

43:36.200 --> 43:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even Vladimir Putin, of course,
knows exactly what he's done,
so Russia is under no illusion

43:40.300 --> 43:41.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about this.

43:41.833 --> 43:44.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What does this
mean going forward?

43:44.233 --> 43:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It means, of greater
significance to the
country, that we are not
taking the steps to prepare

43:49.700 --> 43:52.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ourselves when the
Russians intervene again.

43:52.166 --> 43:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is very serious,
because there is no
software patch here.

43:56.133 --> 44:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're not going to be able
to make the DNC or the RNC
immune from Russian hacking.

44:00.333 --> 44:03.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're too good, and it's
too difficult to defend.

44:03.600 --> 44:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only real defense the
country has is to bring
the country together
to forge a consensus

44:10.600 --> 44:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, no matter who it helps
or who it hurts, we will
reject foreign interference.

44:13.133 --> 44:17.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And our president is simply
not doing that, and this is
exposing us to further harm.

44:17.966 --> 44:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Congressman Adam Schiff of
California, thanks very much.

44:20.933 --> 44:21.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

44:21.933 --> 44:25.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ADAM SCHIFF: Thank you.

44:25.400 --> 44:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For American
children, summer is supposed
to be a time of fun and games,

44:37.300 --> 44:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but, for many, it is
also a time of true need.

44:40.600 --> 44:45.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During the school year,
roughly 22 million children
in this country get
free and reduced-price

44:46.333 --> 44:47.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lunch.

44:47.766 --> 44:50.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In the summer, those
numbers drop dramatically.

44:50.300 --> 44:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Just under four million have
access to subsidized meals.

44:53.933 --> 44:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are 50,000 locations
providing summer meals, but
reaching those who need the food

44:59.666 --> 45:01.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can be a challenge.

45:01.800 --> 45:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special PBS correspondent Lisa
Stark of our partner Education
Week traveled to Nebraska

45:07.933 --> 45:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to see how one food bank
is trying to fill the gap.

45:11.233 --> 45:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: It's a scorching
summer day in Plattsmouth,
Nebraska, about 40 minutes south

45:17.866 --> 45:22.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Omaha, as the food
truck lumbers into view.

45:22.400 --> 45:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Despite the heat, families are
lining up for lunch at what's
called Kids Cruisin' Kitchen.

BECKY HAM, Parent:
They get milk.

45:29.300 --> 45:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They get fruit and vegetables.

45:31.433 --> 45:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's really a nice program.

45:33.433 --> 45:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Becky Ham and
her children rely on the food
truck a few times a week.

45:37.133 --> 45:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BECKY HAM: We started doing this
about three summers ago when
my husband lost his job right

45:41.166 --> 45:43.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
before the end of
the school year.

45:43.400 --> 45:47.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we were really panicked
about how we were going
to make everything work.

45:47.966 --> 45:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Ham's husband
has a new job, but the
budget remains tight.

45:52.466 --> 45:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The family still qualifies for
free school lunches, and is
thankful for the summer help.

45:57.466 --> 45:59.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BECKY HAM: It's really
helping kids out.

45:59.633 --> 46:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's really helping families
out when they need it.

LISA STARK: Kids Cruisin'
Kitchen was launched six years
ago by Omaha's Food Bank for the

46:06.766 --> 46:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Heartland and Salvation Army.

46:09.200 --> 46:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With four food trucks and
10 fixed locations, it
serves 1,300 children a day.

46:15.366 --> 46:18.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do you get enough to
eat at the food truck?

CHILD: ®MD-U They
give us a lot of meals.

46:21.966 --> 46:23.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: A lot of
meals and a lot of food?

46:23.800 --> 46:24.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHILD: ®MD-U Yes.

46:24.900 --> 46:26.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
LISA STARK: Yes?

Susan Ogborn is the
food bank president.

Who are you trying to help?

46:29.300 --> 46:31.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Who's your target here
for the summer meals?

46:31.300 --> 46:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN OGBORN, President,
Food Bank for the Heartland:
Primarily, the children of the

46:33.033 --> 46:34.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
working poor.

46:34.566 --> 46:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are the folks who won't
tell you that they need help.

46:37.633 --> 46:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are the folks whose
children qualify for free
or reduced price-lunches.

46:41.733 --> 46:46.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: Preparing
these meals begins early
in the morning in an
industrial kitchen run

46:47.666 --> 46:49.700 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
by an Omaha area
school district.

46:49.700 --> 46:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They make meals for Kids
Cruisin' Kitchen and other
summer meal programs.

46:53.566 --> 46:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE CAMBRIDGE, Meal Service
Manager: We do about 3,000
meals a day during the summer.

46:56.933 --> 47:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: In less than three
hours on this morning, corn
dogs are cooked, bananas packed,

47:03.833 --> 47:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chocolate milk readied, sack
lunches bagged, chicken patties,
fruit and veggies prepped

47:07.033 --> 47:08.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for later in the week.

47:08.300 --> 47:10.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JACKIE CAMBRIDGE: It's
the five food groups.

47:10.166 --> 47:13.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's grains, meat,
fruit, vegetables, milk.

47:13.400 --> 47:18.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Meals are paid
for by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, $3.83 each, and

47:20.266 --> 47:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
must meet government nutrition
standards, which are a
bit looser in the summer.

47:26.533 --> 47:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jackie Cambridge manages
this summer meal service.

47:28.500 --> 47:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE CAMBRIDGE: There's
always a whew when we
get it out the door.

47:35.333 --> 47:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then we just hope that
it's getting to kids in need,
and that they're enjoying it,

47:38.833 --> 47:40.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and we do it all
again the next day.

47:40.833 --> 47:45.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Shortly after 9:00
a.m., the Kids Cruisin' Kitchen
truck pulls up to load its

47:46.500 --> 47:48.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
food, hot meals to go.

47:48.533 --> 47:52.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The truck makes four
stops each weekday during
most of the summer break.

47:52.933 --> 47:57.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
After that first stop
in Plattsmouth, it's
off to a public library,
followed by a public

47:57.166 --> 48:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
housing project, then onto an
affordable housing development,
areas where more than half of

48:04.133 --> 48:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
children quality for free
and reduced-price lunch,
although anyone is welcome.

48:08.666 --> 48:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHILD: You got corn dogs today?

48:13.166 --> 48:15.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Bananas.

48:15.233 --> 48:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Summer lunches
are an outgrowth of subsidized
school lunches, which expanded

48:18.833 --> 48:20.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the 1960s.

48:20.800 --> 48:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: A good lunch provides
from a third to one-half of
the student's daily needs.

48:24.366 --> 48:27.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA STARK: As part of President
Lyndon Johnson's war on poverty.

48:27.566 --> 48:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LYNDON JOHNSON, Former President
of the United States: Children
just must not go hungry.

48:33.733 --> 48:35.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: The programs
have grown enormously.

48:35.933 --> 48:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, 85 percent of all
breakfasts served at schools
and 73 percent of school lunches

48:42.900 --> 48:46.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are subsidized by the USDA;
12 million students depend on
breakfast, 22 million on lunch.

48:49.066 --> 48:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nationwide, nearly 20
percent of children under
age 18 live in poverty.

48:54.933 --> 48:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's 14.5 million children.

48:56.933 --> 49:00.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAURA HATCH, No Kid Hungry:
Sometimes, schools are providing
the only meals that kids get

49:00.866 --> 49:02.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
during the week.

49:02.866 --> 49:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Laura Hatch is
With No Kid Hungry, a national
advocacy group trying to reduce

49:07.566 --> 49:08.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
childhood hunger.

49:08.833 --> 49:10.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She says school meals
make a big difference.

49:10.900 --> 49:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAURA HATCH: We know that
kids that eat breakfast
do better on math tests.

49:14.966 --> 49:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know that serving breakfast
as part of the school day can
actually keep kids in their

49:19.900 --> 49:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
seat and lessen absenteeism.

49:21.966 --> 49:25.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: Serving
school meals is easier.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Students are all in one place.

49:26.733 --> 49:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Summer meals are tougher.

49:28.233 --> 49:30.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The food has to get to
where the children are.

49:30.733 --> 49:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To make it work, the food bank
hires 10 temporary staffers, and
relies on 200 volunteers from

49:36.833 --> 49:38.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mutual of Omaha.

49:38.566 --> 49:41.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is Gary Hering's
third year helping out.

49:41.266 --> 49:43.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He understands hunger.

49:43.400 --> 49:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GARY HERING, Volunteer: There
were times when, as a family,
I know we struggled, and we'd

49:46.233 --> 49:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
go visit relatives just to eat,
you know, have food every day.

49:48.900 --> 49:50.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA STARK: Do you think that's
true for some of these kids?

49:50.966 --> 49:51.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Or what do you think?

49:51.966 --> 49:54.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GARY HERING: You bet.

49:54.066 --> 49:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the best part about it
today, that these kids aren't
going to be hungry at lunch.

49:56.233 --> 50:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Despite all this
effort by the food bank and
others, Nebraska ranks near

50:00.333 --> 50:04.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the bottom of all 50 states
when it comes to summer meals.

50:04.466 --> 50:09.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For every 100 children
who depend on the school
lunch program, only
eight are getting help

50:10.700 --> 50:12.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
during the summer.

50:12.833 --> 50:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's according to the Food
Research and Action Network,
which found that, last year,

50:18.866 --> 50:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nationwide, that gap between
filling the need during the
school year and the summer got

50:23.200 --> 50:24.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wider.

50:24.700 --> 50:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's especially difficult to
reach children in rural areas.

50:27.500 --> 50:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are spread out, and USDA
rules require all summer meals
to be served and eaten in

50:33.233 --> 50:35.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
one place at one time.

50:35.600 --> 50:38.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: You guys going to
eat it over here today, OK?

50:38.366 --> 50:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Regulars, like
Michelle Brown and her sisters,
are well aware of the rules.

50:42.266 --> 50:45.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CHILD: You just have to,
like, eat here, and you
have to come on time.

50:45.800 --> 50:50.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: USDA has a pilot
program in seven states and two
tribal areas to help families

50:52.833 --> 50:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in need during the summer
by temporarily increasing
food stamps benefits.

50:58.200 --> 51:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Advocates would like this
program offered more widely.

51:01.300 --> 51:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Agriculture Secretary Sonny
Perdue, who recently visited a
summer meal site in Washington,

51:07.466 --> 51:09.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
D.C., says he's
open to the idea.

51:09.466 --> 51:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SONNY PERDUE, U.S. Agriculture
Secretary: I don't think
any of us want to fast over

51:12.000 --> 51:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the summer, so just because
school stops doesn't mean that
the needs for good, nutritious,

51:18.433 --> 51:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
healthy food and a good
environment doesn't stop.

51:20.500 --> 51:25.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: The food bank's
Susan Ogborn is eager to see
regulations relaxed to make it

51:26.033 --> 51:27.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
easier to expand summer meals.

51:27.566 --> 51:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUSAN OGBORN: The problem is,
children are hungry every day.

51:30.233 --> 51:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we hope that Secretary
Perdue and the rest of his team
at USDA get their rules and

51:37.300 --> 51:39.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
regulations figured
out pretty quickly.

51:39.400 --> 51:43.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: For now, the food
bank will continue to roll along
with its current program, hoping

51:46.166 --> 51:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one day to reach many more
children, but committed
to the mostly satisfied
customers it already

51:50.866 --> 51:52.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
has.

51:52.100 --> 51:53.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What do you think
about the food truck?

51:53.666 --> 51:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHILD: I like it, but I would
love it if they added donuts.

51:59.133 --> 52:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Maybe next summer.

For the "PBS NewsHour" and
Education Week, I'm Lisa
Stark in Omaha, Nebraska.

52:07.733 --> 52:09.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We
love donuts, too.

52:09.733 --> 52:12.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And now to our
"NewsHour" Shares.

52:12.133 --> 52:17.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Seawalls help to protect
developed shorelines,
but they can also
destroy crucial habitat.

52:17.000 --> 52:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One project in Washington
state aims to fix that.

52:20.200 --> 52:24.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Ken Christensen of
KCTS' EarthFix explains.

52:24.100 --> 52:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEN CHRISTENSEN: The Seattle
waterfront is changing
right beneath your feet.

52:31.033 --> 52:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF CORDELL, University of
Washington: When you walk along
Seattle's sidewalk, you will

52:33.266 --> 52:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be walking on glass panels.

52:35.266 --> 52:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEN CHRISTENSEN: But look
deeper, and you will see that
the changes aren't for tourists.

52:40.733 --> 52:42.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're for natives.

52:42.833 --> 52:46.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFF CORDELL: Their
function is to provide
light to help thousands
and thousands of little

52:46.733 --> 52:48.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
baby salmon.

52:48.800 --> 52:52.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KEN CHRISTENSEN: It's
one feature of Seattle's
new seawall, a $400
million infrastructure

52:54.800 --> 52:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
project that's doubling as a
really big science experiment,
the biggest of Jeff Cordell's

52:58.933 --> 53:00.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
career.

53:00.466 --> 53:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFF CORDELL: Nothing has
ever been tried on this scale.

53:02.433 --> 53:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're walking on foot after
foot after foot of new habitat.

53:06.533 --> 53:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEN CHRISTENSEN: Cordell wants
to see if coastal cities can
better coexist with fish.

53:13.533 --> 53:16.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For 80 years, Seattle's seawall
was like most, a flat, concrete
slab that held back the sea,

53:18.200 --> 53:22.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
but destroyed shallow
water habitat that
many species thrive on.

53:22.300 --> 53:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every spring, young salmon
would migrate from Seattle's
Duwamish River to the ocean, and

53:29.300 --> 53:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're hard-wired to stay
close to shore, which means
they run right into this.

53:34.766 --> 53:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the inky darkness
under the pier, life can
get confusing for a fish.

53:38.733 --> 53:42.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFF CORDELL: There's
a good example of a
shadow line from a pier.

53:42.466 --> 53:46.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they don't want to
cross the shadow line, so
they just mill about here.

53:46.066 --> 53:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEN CHRISTENSEN: The new
seawall is supposed to make life
easier, not only by providing

53:50.633 --> 53:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a naturally lit corridor for
fish to pass through on their
way to the ocean, but also

53:55.400 --> 54:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by featuring overhangs and
rocky surfaces along the way
for fish food to grow on.

54:00.233 --> 54:02.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFF CORDELL: Look at
the brown scum here.

54:02.366 --> 54:06.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We love to see that,
because that's where
the little crustaceans
grow that the juvenile

54:06.566 --> 54:08.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
salmon feed on.

54:08.033 --> 54:10.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You can't count out brown scum.

54:10.466 --> 54:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEN CHRISTENSEN: Most seawalls
are still get built like
Seattle's was back in the 1930s.

54:15.433 --> 54:18.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And construction is
expected to increase.

54:18.533 --> 54:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF CORDELL: There's going to
be much more need for coastal
infrastructure and a lot

54:23.233 --> 54:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more thinking about how we can
