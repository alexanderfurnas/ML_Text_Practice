WEEKEND ANCHOR: The first public
testimony of former FBI Director

00:04.166 --> 00:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jim Comey since his firing by
President Trump captured the
Capitol's attention this week,

00:10.233 --> 00:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but there were other significant
developments on the Hill
outside of that spotlight.

"NewsHour Weekend"
special correspondent Jeff
Greenfield joins me from
Santa Barbara, California,

00:16.933 --> 00:18.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to discuss that.

00:18.133 --> 00:20.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, what did we miss?

00:20.133 --> 00:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF GREENFIELD, NEWSHOUR
WEEKEND SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT:
Well, the entire political

00:21.366 --> 00:24.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
universe was focused
on the Comey testimony.

00:24.933 --> 00:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Up on Capitol Hill in the
Senate, Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell took the Republican

00:29.333 --> 00:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
repeal and replace
Obamacare bill and put it
on a so-called fast track.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That means it can go right to
the floor of the Senate with
no committee meetings, no

00:37.533 --> 00:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hearings, virtually no
debate, and it would only
take 50 votes to pass it.

00:41.333 --> 00:43.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There were some
concessions to moderates.

00:43.466 --> 00:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not clear that the most
conservative senators will
sign on, but it represents a

00:47.500 --> 00:49.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
significant step
in that direction.

00:49.966 --> 00:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other side of
the Capitol, the House
passed significant
cutbacks of the Dodd-Frank

00:54.000 --> 00:56.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bill.

00:56.033 --> 00:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's legislation that puts
significant caps on what big
banks can do in the wake of the

00:59.166 --> 01:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
financial meltdown in 2008.

01:01.633 --> 01:06.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That faces some tough sledding
in the Senate, but what it
indicates is that the Republican

01:06.066 --> 01:11.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
majorities in the House
and Senate are determined
to press ahead with the
core Republican agenda

01:13.066 --> 01:17.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on matters ranging from
financial regulation
to the role of health
in the government and

01:17.633 --> 01:19.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
beyond.

01:19.700 --> 01:21.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Is there a
pattern here on how they are
going to pursue this agenda?

01:21.766 --> 01:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREENFIELD: Well, I think the
pattern extends beyond Capitol
Hill, and it indicates why

01:26.433 --> 01:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some congressional Republicans
who might have a lot of problems
with Trump's behavior are

01:31.233 --> 01:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not going to be that willing
to step away from him.

01:33.533 --> 01:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The executive branch has done
all kinds of regulatory changes.

01:37.833 --> 01:42.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They've granted a lot
of exceptions to the
energy industry, to
for-profit colleges.

01:44.833 --> 01:48.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They've appointed into positions
of government representatives
from various interest groups

01:48.800 --> 01:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and have given them exemptions
from conflict of interest rules.

01:52.133 --> 01:56.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They've clearly appointed some
-- or trying to appoint staunch
conservatives to the federal

01:56.466 --> 01:59.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bench.

01:59.066 --> 02:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that suggests that for
congressional Republicans
looking at Trump,
there's a thought that,

02:02.333 --> 02:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well, he may have problems, but
he seems to be pursuing what
we conservatives have wanted

02:09.266 --> 02:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the government to do for some
time, which is why I think
that they will be less inclined

02:12.033 --> 02:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than otherwise to take sides
against him in, say, a fight
with the former director of the

02:16.366 --> 02:17.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
FBI.

02:17.866 --> 02:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: So, where does
this leave the president then?

02:19.766 --> 02:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Thursday, we heard basically
Jim Comey say that the
president in some ways lied,

02:24.433 --> 02:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and then Friday, we explicitly
heard the president refute that.

02:28.800 --> 02:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREENFIELD: Well, you know, I
think in the short run -- and
we've talked about this before

02:32.800 --> 02:35.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
- - the whole impeachment
idea is a nonstarter.

02:35.766 --> 02:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't have a lot of history
about impeachment, but one thing
is as long as the president

02:42.766 --> 02:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
retains the support of his
or her party, removal from
office is almost impossible.

02:48.066 --> 02:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when the president said
publicly he'd be willing to
take -- to testify under oath

02:54.600 --> 02:57.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
before special counsel Mueller,
he may have bought himself
a world of trouble because

02:57.666 --> 03:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
once you testify under oath,
anything you say that's false
can be used as either a source

03:05.066 --> 03:08.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of a criminal indictment
or in the case of a
president, impeachment.

03:08.366 --> 03:12.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And under those
circumstances, I think you
would see congressional
Republicans, particularly

03:12.900 --> 03:16.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
from those in the swing
districts, begin to
move away from him.

03:16.033 --> 03:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fact of the matter is,
right now, whatever his overall
poll numbers are, he is hugely

03:20.600 --> 03:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
popular within his party.

03:21.966 --> 03:24.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SREENIVASAN: Yes.

03:24.066 --> 03:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREENFIELD: But I do think he
set himself up for a potential
problem with that statement

03:26.333 --> 03:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about testifying under oath.

03:27.433 --> 03:28.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SREENIVASAN: All right.

03:28.433 --> 03:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeff Greenfield, thanks so much.

03:29.433 --> 03:29.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GREENFIELD: Yes.
