04:17.467 --> 04:19.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR MR. TRUMP LAST NIGHT BUT

04:19.200 --> 04:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WERE SIGNS OF SLOWING

04:20.500 --> 04:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOMENTUM.

04:21.100 --> 04:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH WHAT

04:22.233 --> 04:23.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENED IN THE PAST MONTH?

04:23.833 --> 04:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

04:24.500 --> 04:26.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAST FEW

04:26.367 --> 04:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAYS, THOSE VOTERS WENT TO CRUZ

04:28.900 --> 04:29.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND RUBIO.

04:29.867 --> 04:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU LOOK AT THE VERY LAST DAY,

04:31.400 --> 04:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE YOU SEE DONALD TRUMP DOING

04:33.233 --> 04:35.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LITTLE BIT BETTER, 22% BUT

04:35.267 --> 04:36.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STILL NOT WINNING.

04:36.467 --> 04:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT'S A BIG CHANGE FROM NEW

HAMPSHIRE.

04:39.433 --> 04:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

LAST MINUTE DECIDERS BY AND

04:42.267 --> 04:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LARGE.

04:42.900 --> 04:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW IS THAT JUST A FACTOR,

04:44.500 --> 04:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED IN SOUTH

04:46.400 --> 04:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAROLINA OR SOMETHING THAT HAS

04:47.833 --> 04:49.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGED ABOUT HOW VOTERS IN

04:49.367 --> 04:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GENERAL LOOK AT DONALD TRUMP?

04:50.700 --> 04:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S NOT CLEAR.

04:51.433 --> 04:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP AS YOU SAID, A

04:53.133 --> 04:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:15.633 --> 05:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO AMERICANS OUTSIDE THE

05:16.600 --> 05:18.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICAN PARTY AS WELL AS IN.

05:18.433 --> 05:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HE'S GOING BACK AND SAYING

05:20.333 --> 05:22.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'M GOING TO TAKE A PREVIOUS

OUR GENERATION-- ARE READY TO DO

05:39.567 --> 05:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THE NEXT GENERATION WHAT

05:41.533 --> 05:43.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RONALD REAGAN DID FOR OURS.

05:43.567 --> 05:45.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO LISA T SOUNDS LIKE SENATOR

05:45.267 --> 05:46.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUBIO IS THINKING ABOUT

05:46.767 --> 05:47.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPANDING THE BASE.

05:47.367 --> 05:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

05:48.133 --> 05:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS ADVISORS ARE ALMOST OBSESSED

05:50.000 --> 05:51.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THAT CONCEPT.

05:51.467 --> 05:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY REALIZE THE REPUBLICAN

PARTY IN THE LONG-TERM IN

05:54.167 --> 05:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS HAS A

05:55.133 --> 05:55.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBLEM.

05:55.767 --> 05:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY THINK THAT MARCO RUBIO

05:57.800 --> 05:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS REALLY THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN

05:59.500 --> 06:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPAND THAT BASE, NOT JUST AMONG

06:01.500 --> 06:03.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOUNG PEOPLE WHERE MARCO RUBIO

06:03.467 --> 06:04.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS STARTING TO GAIN SOME

06:04.567 --> 06:06.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOMENTUM BUT ESPECIALLY WHEN ARE

06:06.367 --> 06:07.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU TALKING ABOUT DIVERSITY.

06:07.767 --> 06:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

NIGHT.

06:17.533 --> 06:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK TO SOME DEGREE HE SEEMED

06:19.300 --> 06:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO HAVE BEEN MORE CHARGED UP

06:21.000 --> 06:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERSONALLY THAN EVER BUT HE

06:21.900 --> 06:23.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STILL HAS TO DEAL WITH DONALD

06:23.667 --> 06:24.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP AND THERE IS A REAL

06:24.767 --> 06:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION OF WHEN DOES HE START

06:26.000 --> 06:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SWINGING IF HE DOES START

06:27.233 --> 06:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SWINGING AND HOW AT THE CURRENT

06:28.933 --> 06:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRONTRUNNER.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> TED CRUZ CAME IN THIRD PLACE.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFTER HAVING COME IN SECOND

06:33.333 --> 06:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACE, IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND

06:34.600 --> 06:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVING WON IN IOWA.

06:35.533 --> 06:36.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT HAPPENED?

06:36.767 --> 06:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> RIGHT, THAT'S NOT THE

06:37.633 --> 06:39.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIRECTION THE CAMPAIGN USUALLY

06:39.067 --> 06:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WANTS TO GO IN.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE CRUZ CAMPAIGN IS SAYING

06:41.767 --> 06:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEY, IT WAS VERY CLOSE.

06:42.900 --> 06:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT WAS.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITHIN A THOUSAND VOTES HERE IN

06:45.233 --> 06:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOUTH CAROLINA.

06:45.900 --> 06:47.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS A CLOSE RACE AM I THINK

06:47.567 --> 06:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BIGGER PROBLEM FOR TED CRUZ

06:49.333 --> 06:51.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS NOT THAT HE PLACED THIRD HERE

06:51.067 --> 06:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT MORE THAT HIS SUPPORT IS A

06:52.833 --> 06:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY SPECIFIC TYPE OF VOTER,

06:54.800 --> 06:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY CONSERVATIVE VOTERS,

06:57.400 --> 06:58.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVANGELICALS THAT WILL PLAY WELL

06:58.700 --> 07:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN A LOT OF THE SOUTHERN STATES

07:00.433 --> 07:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMING UP ON SUPER TUESDAY BUT

07:02.133 --> 07:03.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAST THAT, TED CRUZ MIGHT NEED

07:03.667 --> 07:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BROADEN HIS SUPPORT IN ORDER

07:05.133 --> 07:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO WIN THE NOMINATION WHEN HE

07:06.633 --> 07:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS SOMEONE LIKE DONALD TRUMP ON

07:08.600 --> 07:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE SIDE AND MARCO RUBIO ON THE

07:10.533 --> 07:11.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER.

07:11.367 --> 07:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> LET'S TURN TO THE DEMOCRATS.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HILLARY CLINTON HAD A SOLID WIN

07:14.867 --> 07:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAST NIGHT AFTER A REALLY TOUGH

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BATTLE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THERE COULD BE SIGNS OF

07:18.767 --> 07:19.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEAKNESS.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS A MIXED BAG WHEN IT CAME

07:21.467 --> 07:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO MINORITY VOTERS.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED?

07:24.467 --> 07:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> LOOK AT HOW AFRICAN-AMERICANS

07:26.633 --> 07:28.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTER OVERWHELMINGLY FOR HILLARY

07:28.867 --> 07:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON, 76%.

07:30.233 --> 07:32.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S GETTING INTO AN OBAMA

07:32.100 --> 07:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TYPE AFRICAN-AMERICAN SUPPORT

07:33.400 --> 07:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEVEL.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER RACES,

07:35.633 --> 07:36.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HILLARY CLINTON DID NOT WIN WITH

07:36.933 --> 07:38.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHITE VOTERS.

07:38.267 --> 07:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS EKED OUT A WIN

07:40.133 --> 07:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE AND SHE LOST BY MORE WITH

07:41.933 --> 07:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LATINO VOTERS.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT REALLY WAS THAT

07:44.833 --> 07:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFRICAN-AMERICAN LARGE MAJORITY

07:45.733 --> 07:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT CARRIED HER.

07:47.033 --> 07:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THINK ABOUT A STATE LIKE

07:48.900 --> 07:50.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TEXAS WHERE THERE ARE MORE

07:50.267 --> 07:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LATINO VOTERS.

07:51.333 --> 07:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THINK ABOUT WHERE HILLARY

07:53.200 --> 07:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON IS GOING NEXT, IT'S

07:54.800 --> 07:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TEXAS.
