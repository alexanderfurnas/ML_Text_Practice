JOHN YANG: Good evening.

00:05.739 --> 00:06.706 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm John Yang.

00:06.740 --> 00:07.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Judy Woodruff is away.

00:07.974 --> 00:10.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
another stunning
revelation.

00:11.011 --> 00:16.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The New York Times reports that
President
Trump asked James Comey directly
to shut down

00:17.017 --> 00:20.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the FBI's investigation into
Michael Flynn.

00:20.220 --> 00:23.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's according to memos kept
by the former
FBI director.

00:23.056 --> 00:24.924 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Then:

00:24.958 --> 00:27.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
H.R. MCMASTER, U.S. National
Security Adviser:
The president wasn't even aware
of where this

00:27.761 --> 00:29.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
information came from.

00:29.195 --> 00:31.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wasn't briefed on the sources
or method
of the information either.

00:31.965 --> 00:34.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Shooting from the
hip.

00:34.534 --> 00:38.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump's reported
disclosure of sensitive
intelligence to Russian
diplomats in the Oval

00:38.772 --> 00:44.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Office sparks a firestorm of
questions and
calls by lawmakers for a full
transcript of

00:45.011 --> 00:46.780 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the meeting.

00:46.813 --> 00:50.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus: Amid growing tensions,
Turkey's leader
visits the White House after
clashing over

00:50.784 --> 00:54.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the U.S. decision to arm Kurdish
fighters
in Syria.

00:54.554 --> 01:00.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And rethinking school bus safety
-- how some
states are trying to protect
millions of students

01:00.460 --> 01:02.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on their rides every day.

01:02.429 --> 01:04.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK ROSEKIND, Former
Administrator, National
Highway Traffic Safety
Administration: Three-point

01:04.230 --> 01:08.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seat belts should be the norm on
all new school
buses, because we're talking
about trying

01:08.334 --> 01:09.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to save every life.

01:09.669 --> 01:12.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:12.872 --> 01:17.277 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:17.310 --> 01:30.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: We begin tonight with
a report
that President Trump urged
then-FBI Director

01:30.790 --> 01:37.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
James Comey to drop the
investigation of one
of his campaign aides'
connections to Russia.

01:37.230 --> 01:42.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The New York Times reports that,
at a February
meeting, Mr. Trump told Comey,
"I hope you

01:42.469 --> 01:44.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can let this go."

01:44.304 --> 01:49.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It came the day after the
president fired
National Security Adviser
Michael Flynn for

01:49.242 --> 01:51.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lying about his contacts with
the Russians.

01:51.711 --> 01:54.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president fired Comey last
week.

01:54.848 --> 02:00.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In response, the White House
says that the
report is "not a truthful or
accurate portrayal

02:00.653 --> 02:06.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the conversation" and that
the president
never asked anyone to end any
investigation.

02:06.593 --> 02:09.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more, we turn now to Matt
Apuzzo of The
Times.

02:09.329 --> 02:11.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Matt, thanks for joining us.

02:11.331 --> 02:14.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tell me what the significance of
this memo
is.

02:14.667 --> 02:18.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT APUZZO, The New York Times:
Well, the
significance of the memo, of
course, is just

02:18.505 --> 02:24.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not -- you know, just last week,
the president
fired Jim Comey, the FBI
director, and the

02:24.711 --> 02:26.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
stories kept changing.

02:26.579 --> 02:32.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the back-and-forths
has been, there
was this conversation between
Comey and the

02:32.652 --> 02:36.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president in which the president
said, "I
want your loyalty."

02:36.289 --> 02:37.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Comey wouldn't give him his
loyalty.

02:37.824 --> 02:40.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then the question became,
well, is that
why he got fired?

02:40.527 --> 02:44.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you will remember that the
president tweeted
out, oh, Jim Comey better hope
there's not

02:44.430 --> 02:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tapes of our conversations.

02:46.499 --> 02:52.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, it turns out Jim Comey was
keeping memos
and was keeping contemporaneous
notes on every

02:52.438 --> 02:56.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interaction he had with the
president and
was becoming very concerned
about some of

02:56.142 --> 02:58.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those interactions and sought to
document
those going forward.

02:58.411 --> 03:01.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And he showed these
to colleagues
at the time, right?

03:01.414 --> 03:03.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATT APUZZO: He showed them to
colleagues.

03:03.816 --> 03:06.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He provided them with copies.

03:06.119 --> 03:12.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, my colleague Mike
Schmidt,
who was the primary reporter on
this story,

03:12.458 --> 03:14.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
talked to people who had seen
the memos.

03:14.060 --> 03:17.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That quote you read was read to
us.

03:17.330 --> 03:21.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is -- this is something --
this is a
real -- this is a real dramatic
turn in this

03:21.501 --> 03:28.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
story about, why did Donald
Trump fire Jim
Comey, and what is Donald Trump
attempting

03:28.107 --> 03:33.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do in terms of influencing
the investigation
into his campaign and his
associates?

03:33.713 --> 03:37.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Matt, tell us more
about the specific
meeting that you wrote -- that
is written

03:37.951 --> 03:41.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about The Times, just the story
that was posted
just a little bit OK?

03:41.888 --> 03:46.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT APUZZO: Yes, we know it's a
February
14 meeting, a private meting
between the president

03:47.026 --> 03:49.762 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the FBI director, Jim Comey.

03:49.796 --> 03:55.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in it, the president
mentions how concerned
he is about leaks and actually
makes this

03:55.768 --> 04:00.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remark that, maybe we need to
throw a couple
of reporters in jail anyone to
sort of send

04:00.073 --> 04:01.975 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a message.

04:02.008 --> 04:05.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then they -- the president
brings up Michael
Flynn and says, look, I think
he's a really

04:05.144 --> 04:06.446 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
good guy.

04:06.479 --> 04:08.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you can see your way
clear about it,
just let this go.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let Michael Flynn go.

04:10.149 --> 04:11.818 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's a good man.

04:11.851 --> 04:17.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Now, Comey went back,
apparently, and documented
that conversation.

04:17.056 --> 04:22.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one thing that's interesting
about Comey
is, 10 years ago, Comey was at
the center

04:22.595 --> 04:27.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of another major issue where he
described
this dramatic showdown with the
Bush administration

04:27.300 --> 04:28.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over warrantless wiretapping.

04:28.434 --> 04:31.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the White House denied that
conversation.

04:31.104 --> 04:36.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it turned out that it was
the FBI director
at the time, Bob Mueller, kept
his contemporaneous

04:36.209 --> 04:38.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
notes, and that backed up
Comey's account.

04:38.711 --> 04:42.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, in a lot of ways, this is
what's old is
new again.

04:42.048 --> 04:46.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The FBI director was keeping
contemporaneous
notes on his conversations with
the president.

04:46.886 --> 04:48.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And not just this
conversation,
Matt.

04:48.554 --> 04:52.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do we think he kept these notes
throughout
his conversations with the
president?

04:52.792 --> 04:56.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT APUZZO: Our understanding
is, he documented
every interaction, every meeting
and every

04:56.729 --> 05:01.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
phone call with the president
and, on a number
of occasions, expressed concerns
about the

05:01.868 --> 05:07.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the emerging relationship
between the
White House and the FBI
director.

05:07.073 --> 05:11.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remember, the FBI director is
normally kind
of an arms-length relationship
with the White

05:11.144 --> 05:16.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House for precisely this reason,
because,
sometimes, you know, the FBI can
be investigating

05:16.349 --> 05:19.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things that are politically
problematic for
the White House.

05:19.052 --> 05:24.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Matt Apuzzo, as you
say, this could
be a dramatic turning point in
this relationship

05:24.090 --> 05:27.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and what is going on between the
two men,
between President Trump and
James Comey.

05:27.660 --> 05:28.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for joining us.

05:28.661 --> 05:29.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATT APUZZO: Great to be here.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.431 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thanks so much.

05:31.464 --> 05:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, meanwhile, the
White House
is also standing its ground
tonight in the

05:34.434 --> 05:37.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other uproar swirling around
President Trump
today.

05:37.704 --> 05:42.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At issue in that case,
allegations that he
passed along classified
intelligence from

05:42.608 --> 05:44.877 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
another nation to the Russians.

05:44.911 --> 05:46.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham begins our
coverage.

05:46.779 --> 05:49.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
H.R. MCMASTER, U.S. National
Security Adviser:
What the president discussed
with the foreign

05:49.315 --> 05:54.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
minister was wholly appropriate
to that conversation,
and is consistent with the
routine sharing

05:55.021 --> 05:56.923 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of information.

05:56.956 --> 06:00.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: National
Security Adviser
H.R. McMaster used that phrase,
"wholly appropriate,"

06:01.027 --> 06:06.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nine times today, as he pushed
back against
reports that President Trump
made a damaging

06:06.199 --> 06:09.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
disclosure to Russian diplomats
last week.

06:09.469 --> 06:14.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The storm began Monday evening,
first in The
Washington Post, and quickly
followed by other

06:14.073 --> 06:16.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
major news organizations.

06:16.309 --> 06:21.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All reported that President
Trump told the
Russian foreign minister and
Russian ambassador

06:21.414 --> 06:26.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about highly classified
information given
to the U.S. by an ally in the
Middle East,

06:26.753 --> 06:29.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but without that ally's
permission.

06:29.355 --> 06:35.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It pertained to an Islamic State
plot based
in Syria that involved laptops
on airplanes.

06:35.728 --> 06:40.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The New York Times reported
today that Israel
was the source of that
information, though

06:40.199 --> 06:42.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Israeli officials wouldn't
confirm it.

06:42.068 --> 06:46.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: Mr. President, did you
share classified
intelligence information with
the Russians?

06:46.038 --> 06:50.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The president
himself ignored
questions today as he met with
Turkey's president,

06:50.376 --> 06:52.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in the
Oval Office.

06:52.745 --> 06:54.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Later, though, he said this:

06:54.614 --> 06:56.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Well, we had a very, very
successful meeting

06:56.816 --> 06:59.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the foreign minister of
Russia.

06:59.952 --> 07:04.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our fight is against ISIS, as
General McMaster
said.

07:04.891 --> 07:08.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we want to get as many to
help fight terrorism
as possible.

07:08.895 --> 07:12.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That followed
a series of
tweets this morning, saying: "As
president,

07:12.965 --> 07:17.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wanted to share with Russia,
which I have
the absolute right to do, facts
pertaining

07:17.970 --> 07:21.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to terrorism and airline flight
safety."

07:21.340 --> 07:26.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, as the initial
shockwaves over
this alleged revelation spread
through Washington,

07:26.813 --> 07:28.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
McMaster appeared outside the
White House.

07:28.381 --> 07:32.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
H.R. MCMASTER: The story that
came out tonight,
as reported, is false.

07:32.552 --> 07:38.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At no time, at no time were
intelligent sources
or methods discussed.

07:38.224 --> 07:43.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the president didn't
disclose any military
operations that were not already
publicly

07:43.262 --> 07:45.164 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
known.

07:45.198 --> 07:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But none of
the news accounts
had alleged that the president
revealed sources

07:47.533 --> 07:49.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or methods or military
operations.

07:49.769 --> 07:54.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, McMaster was asked to
respond directly
to what the reports did say,
that the president

07:54.540 --> 07:59.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
revealed highly classified
intelligence to
an American adversary, Russia.

07:59.612 --> 08:02.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
McMaster didn't deny that, but
he did elaborate
just a bit.

08:02.548 --> 08:06.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
H.R. MCMASTER: That the
president wasn't even
aware of where this information
came from.

08:06.552 --> 08:09.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wasn't briefed on the source
or method
of the information either.

08:09.956 --> 08:14.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In Moscow,
Kremlin spokesman
Dmitry Peskov dismissed the
story.

08:14.560 --> 08:18.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DMITRY PESKOV, Spokesman for
Vladimir Putin
(through translator): It's
complete nonsense,

08:18.064 --> 08:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not a subject to be denied or
confirmed.

08:20.099 --> 08:25.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But the
episode raised fears
about how U.S. allies might
react.

08:25.137 --> 08:29.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One European official told the
Associated
Press that his country may stop
sharing intelligence

08:29.942 --> 08:31.811 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Washington.

08:31.844 --> 08:36.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The revelations also rippled
through Congress,
on the heels of the president's
firing of

08:36.182 --> 08:38.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FBI Director James Comey.

08:38.985 --> 08:42.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Senator and Chair of
the Foreign
Relations Committee Bob Corker
said the White

08:42.788 --> 08:47.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House is in "a downward spiral
right now,
and have got to figure out a way
to come to

08:47.760 --> 08:49.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
grips with all that's
happening."

08:49.962 --> 08:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell complained
of yet another distraction from
what Republicans

08:54.534 --> 08:55.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
want to talk about.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.270 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

08:57.303 --> 08:58.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: I
think it would be helpful to
have less drama

08:58.771 --> 09:00.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
emanating from the White House.

09:00.540 --> 09:04.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As for
Democrats, Senate
Minority Leader Chuck Schumer
demanded the

09:04.377 --> 09:08.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House release the full
record of the
Oval Office meeting with the
Russian diplomats.

09:08.347 --> 09:10.283 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

09:10.316 --> 09:14.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: Until
the administration provides the
unedited transcript,

09:14.320 --> 09:20.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
until the administration fully
explains the
facts of this case, the American
people will

09:20.493 --> 09:27.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rightly doubt if their president
can handle
our nations most closely kept
secrets.

09:27.967 --> 09:32.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: With the White
House in
damage control mode, CIA
Director Mike Pompeo

09:32.705 --> 09:36.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
went to the Capitol this evening
to brief
the House Intelligence
Committee.

09:36.342 --> 09:38.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham.

09:38.978 --> 09:43.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: For more on this
story, we are
joined by the "NewsHour"'s Lisa
Desjardins

09:43.382 --> 09:47.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Capitol Hill, and Olivier
Knox, chief Washington
correspondent for Yahoo!

09:47.587 --> 09:48.688 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
News.

09:48.721 --> 09:50.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Olivier, let me start with you
at the White
House.

09:50.923 --> 09:54.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We now have this report from The
New York
Times about the Comey memo.

09:54.794 --> 10:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is sort of the third crisis
that the
White House has tried to deal
with in the

10:00.566 --> 10:02.768 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
past two weeks.

10:02.802 --> 10:11.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How did they do today on the --
on the report
about the intelligence being
shared in the

10:11.377 --> 10:12.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Oval Office with the Russians?

10:12.645 --> 10:14.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How did they -- how did they
fare with that?

10:14.880 --> 10:16.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /OLIVIER KNOX, Yahoo!

10:16.549 --> 10:19.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
News: Well, I think you have to
notice that
their story is evolving a little
bit.

10:19.251 --> 10:24.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
H.R. McMaster, the president's
national security
adviser, came out and said, it's
false.

10:24.590 --> 10:28.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As your reporter pointed out, he
denied things
that were not actually in the
original bombshell

10:28.561 --> 10:30.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Washington Post report.

10:30.062 --> 10:31.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Today, they pivoted, though.

10:31.597 --> 10:35.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now it's not, it's false and
trying to
draw attention away from it.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's, well, maybe it happened,
but it was
entirely appropriate.

10:38.237 --> 10:40.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's a notable shift in
the rhetoric.

10:40.306 --> 10:44.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: And, Lisa, I
understand you have
got some reporting on this Comey
report.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.212 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

10:46.245 --> 10:50.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senators were just finding out
about this
report as they were voting for a
nomination.

10:50.950 --> 10:53.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I talked to Senate
Intelligence Chairman
Richard Burr.

10:53.819 --> 10:56.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said he had been told about
this by Senator
John McCain.

10:56.756 --> 11:00.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when we went through The New
York Times
report with him, he told us: I
believe that

11:00.660 --> 11:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Director Comey might have told
us if a request
like that from the president had
been made.

11:07.066 --> 11:09.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Burr said, it was never
mentioned.

11:09.068 --> 11:13.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
John, essentially, the
intelligence chairman
is questioning The New York
Times report,

11:13.539 --> 11:15.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying he thinks Comey would
have brought
that up.

11:15.808 --> 11:20.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also said that he believes
the onus is
on The New York Times to present
this memo,

11:20.980 --> 11:22.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not just have someone read from
it.

11:22.815 --> 11:27.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He went even further, John,
further, and said
that he thinks there is a very
legitimate

11:28.020 --> 11:31.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
question, in his mind, as to
whether someone
out there in the intelligence
community or

11:31.590 --> 11:33.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
elsewhere is trying to undermine
the president.

11:33.793 --> 11:37.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's one of the strongest
reactions we have
had in the president's favor on
Capitol Hill

11:37.997 --> 11:39.365 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

11:39.398 --> 11:41.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And beginning to
question the intelligence
community.

11:41.767 --> 11:47.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Olivier, all this is happening
as President
Trump is about to leave on his
first overseas

11:47.840 --> 11:48.974 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
trip.

11:49.008 --> 11:50.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you think this is going
to affect the
trip?

11:50.943 --> 11:54.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OLIVIER KNOX: Well, you know,
they were already
pretty much -- pretty stressed
out about this

11:54.447 --> 11:55.414 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
trip.

11:55.448 --> 11:56.415 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's his first foreign trip.

11:56.449 --> 11:57.416 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's big.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's high-stakes.

11:59.251 --> 12:03.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's high-profile, you know,
Riyadh, and Israel,
and the Vatican, and NATO, and a
group of

12:04.023 --> 12:05.725 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
rich countries.

12:05.758 --> 12:07.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know how much it's going
to affect
the trip, except that, if
there's a drip,

12:07.993 --> 12:12.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drip, drip of revelations, which
certainly
The New York Times suggests,
given that Comey

12:12.565 --> 12:16.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
documented every think
interaction he had
with the president, that's
certainly a possibility,

12:16.535 --> 12:20.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think you have to just look at
H.R. McMaster's
briefing today, which was
originally designed

12:20.773 --> 12:22.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as a briefing about the trip.

12:22.475 --> 12:30.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He read us roughly the schedule,
but then
-- with questions about the
intelligence.

12:30.683 --> 12:34.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it's going to be a pretty
big distraction,
I think, from what the
president's -- president

12:34.453 --> 12:36.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wants the agenda to be.

12:36.288 --> 12:39.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Lisa, very quickly,
Senate Majority
Leader Mitch McConnell today
said he wanted

12:39.759 --> 12:43.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a little less drama, a little
less -- more
focus on the agenda.

12:43.162 --> 12:44.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is this getting in the way?

12:44.163 --> 12:46.599 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: It is a
distraction.

12:46.632 --> 12:48.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans tell you that across
the board.

12:48.467 --> 12:52.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are still hoping to get a
health care
plan out of the Senate as early
as July, but,

12:52.505 --> 12:54.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more and more, John, people say
that's optimistic.

12:54.673 --> 12:58.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're now talking about
August, September
for health care and tax reform.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Lisa Desjardins on
Capitol Hill,
Olivier Knox of Yahoo!

13:01.013 --> 13:02.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
News at the White House, thank
you both.

13:02.848 --> 13:08.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And let's keep our
focus on Capitol
Hill and to Republican Senator
James Risch

13:08.320 --> 13:10.189 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Idaho.

13:10.222 --> 13:13.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a member of the Senate
Intelligence Committee
and the Senate Foreign Affairs
Committee.

13:13.459 --> 13:17.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke with him earlier this
evening, just
as the story on the Comey memo
broke.

13:17.863 --> 13:19.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Senator Risch, welcome.

13:19.698 --> 13:24.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to begin by asking you
about a story
that The New York Times has just
posted about

13:24.103 --> 13:31.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a memo, a contemporaneous memo
that former
FBI Director James Comey wrote
after a meeting

13:31.210 --> 13:36.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the president on the day
that Michael
Flynn resigned as national
security adviser.

13:36.482 --> 13:42.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He quotes the president as
asking him to let
the investigation into Flynn go:
"I hope you

13:42.621 --> 13:46.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can see your way clear to
letting this go,
to letting Flynn go."

13:46.759 --> 13:54.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He interprets it, Mr. Comey
interprets it
as asking for an FBI
investigation not to

13:54.333 --> 13:55.968 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
go forward.

13:56.001 --> 13:57.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you have any reaction to
this?

13:57.203 --> 13:58.170 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:58.204 --> 13:59.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES RISCH (R), Idaho: Haven't
seen it.

13:59.205 --> 14:00.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Don't know anything about it.

14:00.206 --> 14:02.041 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Haven't read it.

14:02.074 --> 14:03.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And before I comment on it, I
want a lot more
-- I would want to know a lot
more about it

14:03.609 --> 14:04.577 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than what I do.

14:04.610 --> 14:05.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But thanks for asking.

14:05.611 --> 14:07.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: I understand.

14:07.479 --> 14:11.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, let's move on to the news,
the other news
of the day, the allegations or
the suggestion

14:11.550 --> 14:18.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that President Trump gave --
shared this classified
information with the Russian
officials in

14:18.257 --> 14:19.358 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Oval Office.

14:19.391 --> 14:21.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are you satisfied with the White
House explanation?

14:21.227 --> 14:23.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Or do you have any other further
questions?

14:23.495 --> 14:24.964 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:24.997 --> 14:26.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES RISCH: Oh, I don't really
need the White
House explanation on this.

14:26.732 --> 14:30.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is only one person on the
planet who
can make the decision whether to
declassify

14:30.469 --> 14:35.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something and whether to talk to
someone outside
of those of us that are cleared
with the security,

14:35.140 --> 14:37.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and that's the president of the
United States.

14:38.010 --> 14:41.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If, indeed, it was on the
subject that -- and
I'm neither going to confirm or
deny that

14:41.814 --> 14:47.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was -- but it was on the
subject of airliner
safety, I believe the president,
obviously,

14:47.519 --> 14:48.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had the legal authority to do
it.

14:48.954 --> 14:50.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He can declassify at any time.

14:50.856 --> 14:55.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, secondly, I think he has an
obligation
under his oath as president of
the United

14:56.028 --> 14:59.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States, when he in his judgment
determines
it's in the best interests of
the people of

14:59.598 --> 15:03.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the United States, to declassify
something
and do it.

15:03.168 --> 15:06.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The national media has treated
this story
as if this was a one-off, like
this never

15:06.772 --> 15:08.641 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
happens.

15:08.674 --> 15:11.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, the president of the
United States deals
every day with heads of other
countries, with

15:11.210 --> 15:13.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
high-level people of other
countries.

15:13.412 --> 15:17.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he constantly discusses
classified information
with them.

15:18.017 --> 15:19.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Not only can he do that.

15:19.985 --> 15:24.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He should do that, because we
exchange classified
information with almost every
country on the

15:24.757 --> 15:27.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
face of the Earth, with the
exception of a
couple of them.

15:27.993 --> 15:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we -- even ones that we're
not particularly
friendly with, we do have
overlapping interests

15:33.699 --> 15:36.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in things like airline safety.

15:36.201 --> 15:41.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so if, indeed, that was the
subject, and
that's what's been reported, he
should be

15:41.807 --> 15:42.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
commended for that.

15:42.908 --> 15:45.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The real story here is, there's
a weasel here.

15:45.344 --> 15:49.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is the person who
reported about
this conversation.

15:49.882 --> 15:52.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a person who is a
traitor.

15:52.451 --> 15:55.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They betrayed their own country.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They betrayed their families and
their neighbors.

15:57.756 --> 16:04.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you disclose classified
information,
classified conversations that
you have access

16:04.830 --> 16:07.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to, it is an act of treason.

16:07.399 --> 16:10.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's unfortunate we can't get
that person
identified.

16:10.069 --> 16:16.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he or she should be held to
answer for
that and treated as any
treasonous person

16:16.075 --> 16:17.910 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
would be.

16:17.943 --> 16:20.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Senator, you say that
the president
can declassify any information,
any classified

16:20.679 --> 16:21.914 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
information.

16:21.947 --> 16:24.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I understand that's true for
U.S. intelligence
products.

16:24.183 --> 16:28.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this was an intelligence --
intelligence
developed by another country.

16:28.687 --> 16:33.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can he also declassify material
given by another
country's intelligence service?

16:33.892 --> 16:34.860 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:34.893 --> 16:36.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES RISCH: Of course.

16:36.462 --> 16:41.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't even have laws that
cover classified
information from another
country.

16:41.500 --> 16:45.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People could talk about that
wherever they
want to.

16:45.337 --> 16:46.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You don't generally do that.

16:46.772 --> 16:48.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You treat like it all other
classified information.

16:49.008 --> 16:54.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the president of the United
States is
fully entitled to discuss this
with the people

16:54.079 --> 16:55.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he sees fit to do it.

16:55.981 --> 16:58.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Senator, you're
chairman of the
subcommittee -- Senate Foreign
Affairs Subcommittee

16:58.417 --> 16:59.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the Near East.

16:59.418 --> 17:00.386 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

17:00.419 --> 17:01.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES RISCH: I am.

17:01.487 --> 17:02.955 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

17:02.988 --> 17:04.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The reports are that
this information
product came from Israel.

17:04.723 --> 17:10.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does it give you any concern or
any pause
that this was given to Russia,
an ally of

17:10.295 --> 17:13.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iran, which Israel sees as an
existential
threat?

17:13.699 --> 17:15.434 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

17:15.467 --> 17:17.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES RISCH: Yes, well, first of
all, like
I said, if it was what's been
reported on,

17:17.836 --> 17:22.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is airline safety, it would
have nothing
to do with the relationship
between Iran and

17:22.541 --> 17:25.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIS and Hezbollah and all that
sort of thing.

17:25.477 --> 17:30.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But my position is exactly the
same as the
Israeli ambassador, who was
asked about this

17:30.149 --> 17:34.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
early today and said this will
have absolutely
no effect on the great
cooperation between

17:34.720 --> 17:39.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the security and intelligence
agencies of
the United States of America and
Israel.

17:39.825 --> 17:41.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have been very close.

17:41.827 --> 17:43.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to continue to be
very close.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have concurrent interests.

17:45.664 --> 17:51.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, look, there's been other
times where
there have been embarrassing
lapses and disclosures,

17:51.537 --> 17:53.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and we have worked around it.

17:53.272 --> 17:55.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's not uncommon in these
kinds of
things.

17:55.874 --> 18:00.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And even though the
president said
-- or the president's spokesmen
have said

18:00.512 --> 18:03.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the president did not
discuss methods
and sources...

18:03.215 --> 18:04.183 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

18:04.216 --> 18:06.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES RISCH: Right.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: ... is there a
concern that there
was enough information in what
the president

18:08.253 --> 18:13.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said that the Russians could
figure out the
methods and sources and put that
source at

18:13.492 --> 18:14.460 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
risk?

18:14.493 --> 18:16.261 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

18:16.295 --> 18:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES RISCH: Almost never are
methods and
sources disclosed, unless there
is a reason

18:20.499 --> 18:24.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do that, such as an asset
would be at risk
or someone's life is at risk.

18:24.937 --> 18:30.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it wouldn't be unusual that
the president
did or didn't know what the
methods and sources

18:30.242 --> 18:31.944 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
were.

18:31.977 --> 18:36.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's just -- it's part of this
anti-Trump
fervor that the national media
has to try

18:36.248 --> 18:39.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to make him look bad every time
he turns around.

18:39.284 --> 18:42.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was a good act that he did,
not a bad
act that he did.

18:42.688 --> 18:44.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there was a bad act done
here.

18:44.823 --> 18:50.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Somebody ought to go to the --
to the people
who printed this and say, look,
you're an

18:50.262 --> 18:51.230 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
American.

18:51.263 --> 18:52.364 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm an American.

18:52.397 --> 18:54.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tell us who did this, so we can
put them in
jail.

18:54.233 --> 18:57.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Senator James Risch
of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, thanks
so much for

18:57.202 --> 18:58.170 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
joining us.

18:58.203 --> 18:59.171 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

18:59.204 --> 19:01.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES RISCH: Thank you, John.

19:01.373 --> 19:04.910 align:left position:0%,start line:66.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Now for some insights
on this apparent
disclosure, and the wider
effects on
intelligence-gathering

19:04.943 --> 19:09.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and sharing, I'm joined by two
men with deep
knowledge of the U.S.
intelligence community

19:09.982 --> 19:12.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the partnerships it relies
upon.

19:12.718 --> 19:18.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
James Woolsey served as director
of the CIA
from early 1993 until January
1995.

19:18.957 --> 19:22.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was an adviser to President
Trump's campaign
last year.

19:22.561 --> 19:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Andrew Exum, he was former
deputy assistant
secretary of defense for Middle
East policy

19:28.100 --> 19:29.701 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the Obama administration.

19:29.735 --> 19:32.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's also a former Army Ranger.

19:32.070 --> 19:33.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Woolsey, let me start with
you.

19:33.805 --> 19:36.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You heard Senator Risch say this
was a good
thing the president did, not a
bad thing.

19:36.942 --> 19:38.644 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Do you agree?

19:38.677 --> 19:41.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES WOOLSEY, Former CIA
Director: Well,
it depends on whether the
information gets

19:41.480 --> 19:50.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out and damages our -- either
our relations
with another country or our
ability to keep

19:50.923 --> 19:53.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sources and methods held very
closely.

19:53.659 --> 20:00.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It may be that it will not cause
a major difficulty.

20:00.165 --> 20:08.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think giving anything away
to the Russians
is something that has to pass
about half-a-dozen

20:08.640 --> 20:10.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
levels of scrutiny.

20:10.542 --> 20:13.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the real problem
here.

20:13.345 --> 20:19.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unlike President Reagan, who was
faced with
declassification decisions on
the aircraft

20:19.318 --> 20:25.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that was shot down, the Russian
aircraft,
and so forth, here, we have just
turned it

20:25.557 --> 20:28.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
loose, and to the Russians.

20:28.160 --> 20:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that ought to have been
preceded by a
day or two anyway of high-level
discussions

20:34.700 --> 20:38.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
among top-level officials to
make sure we
knew exactly what we were
turning loose and

20:38.470 --> 20:39.438 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
exactly why.

20:39.471 --> 20:41.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Andrew, what's your
take on this?

20:41.273 --> 20:42.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW EXUM, Former U.S. Deputy
Assistant
Secretary of Defense: Well, no,
that's exactly

20:42.207 --> 20:44.076 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right.

20:44.109 --> 20:47.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With all due respect to the
senator from Idaho,
any time -- and, look, I just
came out of

20:47.512 --> 20:49.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government service at the
Pentagon.

20:49.281 --> 20:53.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know how frustrating leaks can
be, but any
time someone says the real
problem is the

20:53.518 --> 20:56.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
media or leaks, they're usually
trying to
defend the indefensible.

20:56.521 --> 21:01.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the problem here is that I
don't think
the American people realize how
much of our

21:01.693 --> 21:05.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intelligence is actually derived
from our
partners.

21:05.497 --> 21:11.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If our partners cannot feel or
do not trust
that our president will not
divulge that information

21:11.637 --> 21:16.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to, I mean, goodness gracious,
the Russians
in this case, then that could
create real

21:16.174 --> 21:18.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
problems for us going forward.

21:18.277 --> 21:21.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I completely agree with
everything that
Director Woolsey said.

21:21.980 --> 21:26.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that this is a broader
problem, regardless
of how bad the actual leak was.

21:26.985 --> 21:30.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And when you were in
the Obama
administration, there was a lot
of debate

21:30.222 --> 21:33.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over how much intelligence over
Syria to give
to the Russians.

21:33.659 --> 21:34.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANDREW EXUM: Yes, there sure
was.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What were the issues?

21:36.295 --> 21:38.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, we heard Mr. Woolsey say
you have
got to go through a lot of
checkpoints.

21:38.897 --> 21:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What were the considerations you
went through
on that?

21:41.099 --> 21:43.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANDREW EXUM: Well, that's
exactly right.

21:43.035 --> 21:46.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You talk to anybody in the
intelligence community,
and you say, we want to release
some information

21:47.005 --> 21:51.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the Russians, first off,
making something
secret releasable to Russia is
almost a contradiction

21:51.510 --> 21:55.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in terms, because so many of the
sources and
methods that we have developed
over decades

21:55.881 --> 21:58.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are really to allow us to spy on
the Russians.

21:58.483 --> 22:00.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's from the Cold War.

22:00.352 --> 22:05.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there's a lot of worry that,
even in divulge
anything type of information to
the Russians,

22:05.090 --> 22:10.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even if you don't get into
sources and methods,
they're going to
backwards-engineer how you

22:10.262 --> 22:14.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got that information, and thus
learn something
about your own capabilities.

22:14.266 --> 22:19.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So that was a huge concern any
time you start
to discuss sharing information
with the Russians.

22:19.171 --> 22:23.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Mr. Woolsey,
there are reports
now that this information came
from Israel.

22:23.842 --> 22:29.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is that a particular concern of
giving this
information to Russia, who is
allied with

22:29.848 --> 22:34.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iran, who Israel sees as a
mortal threat to
their existence?

22:34.986 --> 22:39.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES WOOLSEY: Yes, but there's
a major footnote,
I think.

22:39.124 --> 22:42.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The yes is because of the way
you formed the
question.

22:42.094 --> 22:50.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, it is a serious matter if
it undercuts
Israel's security at all and if
it disturbs

22:50.502 --> 22:53.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our relations with them.

22:53.138 --> 23:00.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the Israelis, looking at the
shift from
President Obama to President
Trump, would

23:00.946 --> 23:06.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
probably give up a couple of
half-ton trucks
full of classified information
in order to

23:06.218 --> 23:08.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
preserve that switch.

23:08.487 --> 23:14.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are very happy with --
and understandably
so, with the new American
administration.

23:14.626 --> 23:18.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And although they would have
criticisms, and
if there was something really
sensitive in

23:18.597 --> 23:23.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this, they would have been very
upset about
it and would have come in and
talked to the

23:23.602 --> 23:27.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American director of central
intelligence
and explained why they were
really worried

23:27.139 --> 23:29.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and it ought not to happen
again.

23:29.241 --> 23:36.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in terms of quietly seething
and being
really upset and so forth, no,
they're -- I

23:36.648 --> 23:39.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think they're very pleased at
having a Trump
administration.

23:39.651 --> 23:43.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Woolsey, General
McMaster said
that he -- that the president
didn't know

23:43.188 --> 23:45.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where this information came
from.

23:45.557 --> 23:52.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're experienced at briefing
presidents,
and also, quite frankly,
briefing this president.

23:52.664 --> 23:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You worked with him in the
campaign.

23:54.566 --> 23:59.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much information do you give
a president
about a piece of intelligence?

23:59.371 --> 24:05.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES WOOLSEY: Well, I think in
a circumstance
in which he has to make a
decision to disclose

24:05.977 --> 24:12.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
it to some government or
individual that would
be a serious potential problem,
such as to

24:12.484 --> 24:21.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia, I think you owe him a
very thorough
understanding, and you ought not
to just send

24:21.092 --> 24:22.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the paper in as part of a
document.

24:22.961 --> 24:31.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You ought to have enough
leverage over his
schedule to have the time to
say, Mr. President,

24:32.003 --> 24:36.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I hope you haven't decided to
turn any of
this loose, but should you be
thinking about

24:36.074 --> 24:41.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, the way you were back a
few weeks ago,
here are the problems with
turning anything

24:41.746 --> 24:45.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
loose on this subject and on
this subject
and on this subject.

24:45.784 --> 24:48.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He deserves a really thorough
scrubbing.

24:48.987 --> 24:56.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Andrew Exum, so, talk
about, what
is the potential threat to
intelligence gathering

24:56.161 --> 24:57.128 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the future?

24:57.162 --> 24:58.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW EXUM: Yes.

24:59.030 --> 25:00.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, first off, I think that
Director Woolsey
is probably right in terms of
talking about

25:00.732 --> 25:05.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the way in which the Israeli
prime minister
views the switch from Obama to
Trump.

25:05.103 --> 25:09.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't necessarily think he's
speaking for
the Israeli defense and
intelligence establishment.

25:09.608 --> 25:15.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, there, there is a lot
of unease,
precisely because, between 2009
and 2017,

25:15.113 --> 25:19.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we dramatically increased the
amount of military
and intelligence cooperation
with the Israelis.

25:19.985 --> 25:24.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I suspect that you are going
to see a
lot of unease within the Israeli
intelligence

25:24.122 --> 25:25.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and defense establishment.

25:25.924 --> 25:30.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're already starting to see
quotes from
Israelis nervous about what has
potentially

25:30.195 --> 25:32.030 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
transpired.

25:32.063 --> 25:35.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, there, I think the worry
going forward
is that, not just with the
Israelis, but with

25:35.934 --> 25:40.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all of our partners, there's
just going to
be a reluctance to hand over
information to

25:40.138 --> 25:46.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Americans, especially if
it's sensitive,
because, frankly, under our
system, any secret

25:46.278 --> 25:48.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is the president's.

25:48.113 --> 25:51.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president -- you know,
things are classified
at his discretion and at his
pleasure.

25:51.049 --> 25:55.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, legally, the president can
do exactly
what he potentially did a few
days ago in

25:55.420 --> 25:58.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
terms of releasing information
to the Russians.

25:58.089 --> 26:04.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that that's going to be
problematic,
to say the least, for many of
our partners,

26:04.796 --> 26:07.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not only in the region, but
elsewhere around
the globe.

26:07.666 --> 26:09.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES WOOLSEY: I agree with
that.

26:09.434 --> 26:11.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: I know we could talk
much more
about this, but I'm afraid we're
out of time.

26:11.369 --> 26:12.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have got to leave it there.

26:12.637 --> 26:14.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Andrew Exum, James Woolsey,
thank you both
for joining us.

26:14.839 --> 26:21.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES WOOLSEY: Good to be with
you.

26:21.179 --> 26:31.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In the day's other
news: Syria
denied U.S. claims that it's
using a crematorium

26:31.056 --> 26:34.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to conceal mass executions of
thousands of
prisoners.

26:34.893 --> 26:40.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Foreign Ministry called it
categorically
false and said it's a new
Hollywood plot to

26:40.432 --> 26:42.334 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
justify American intervention.

26:42.367 --> 26:47.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The State Department accused
Syria of incinerating
the corpses of executed
prisoners to destroy

26:47.839 --> 26:51.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
evidence that could be used in
war crimes
prosecutions.

26:51.643 --> 26:56.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
North Korea has become the prime
suspect in
the global cyber-attack.

26:56.181 --> 27:02.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A growing number of
cyber-security experts
now say the lines in the
ransomware code are

27:02.187 --> 27:07.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
identical to lines in the code
used by previous
hackers linked to the North.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, they say, there are other
clues.

27:09.494 --> 27:12.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC CHIEN, Symantec Researcher:
It's a bit
unclear on what their ultimate
motivation

27:12.964 --> 27:19.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here is, but it does seem pretty
clear that
this is not the kind of thing a
very professional

27:19.471 --> 27:22.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cyber-criminal would do.

27:22.040 --> 27:27.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, guys who are involved
in these types
of schemes like to run just
under the radar.

27:27.278 --> 27:30.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You want to infect as many
machines as possible,
but still be under the radar.

27:30.849 --> 27:36.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The attack has
infected thousands
of computers and servers in
about 150 countries,

27:36.655 --> 27:41.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but the Department of Homeland
Security says
only a handful were in the
United States.

27:41.493 --> 27:46.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, Senator
John Cornyn
now says he's not interested in
being FBI

27:46.498 --> 27:47.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
director.

27:47.899 --> 27:50.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Texas Republican was
interviewed for the
job over the weekend.

27:50.035 --> 27:53.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, in a statement, he said
he'd rather
stay in the Senate.

27:53.405 --> 27:58.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, South Carolina
Congressman Trey
Gowdy withdrew from
consideration.

27:58.376 --> 28:04.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A new federal study finds that
one in every
five middle and high school
students complained

28:04.149 --> 28:06.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of being bullied in 2015.

28:06.584 --> 28:12.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's despite the fact that the
overall problem
improved over the last decade;
21 percent

28:12.657 --> 28:19.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of students ages 12 to 18 said
they were bullied
in 2015, and reports of sexual
assaults on

28:19.164 --> 28:26.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
college campuses nearly tripled
between 2001
and 2014, to 6,700.

28:26.871 --> 28:31.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Advances in reducing the number
of Americans
without health insurance have
stalled.

28:31.443 --> 28:36.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention
says the number last year was
unchanged at

28:36.247 --> 28:39.184 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
28.6 million.

28:39.217 --> 28:44.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That ends five years of coverage
gains under
the Affordable Care Act, or
Obamacare.

28:44.823 --> 28:47.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Wall Street, stocks had a
lackluster
day.

28:47.659 --> 28:53.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost two
points to close above 20979.

28:53.565 --> 28:59.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 20 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
slipped one point.

Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Turkey's
president visits the White House
amid strained

29:04.442 --> 29:10.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
relations between the two

against requiring seat belts on
school buses;

29:10.782 --> 29:22.827 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and much more.

29:22.861 --> 29:27.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump welcomed Turkish
President
Recep Tayyip Erdogan to the
White House today,

29:27.198 --> 29:31.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
amid heightened tensions for the
longtime

29:31.669 --> 29:35.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Chief foreign affairs

MARGARET WARNER: Despite
tensions between
Washington and Ankara, it was
best foot forward

29:40.378 --> 29:44.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from both leaders at the White
House this
afternoon, at least in public.

29:44.215 --> 29:46.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

Erdogan on achieving peace and

RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, Turkish
President (through
translator): President Trump's
recent election

29:53.358 --> 29:58.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
victory has led to the awakening
of a new
set of aspirations and
expectations and hopes

29:58.496 --> 30:00.265 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in our region.

30:00.298 --> 30:04.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But relations
between the
two NATO allies have
deteriorated sharply.

30:04.035 --> 30:10.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former President Obama grew
critical of President
Recep Tayyip Erdogan's
increasingly authoritarian

30:11.009 --> 30:12.777 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ways.

30:12.811 --> 30:18.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump came to office
calling for
improved ties, but tensions
flared again.

30:18.750 --> 30:23.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The rawest point of contention,
America's
battlefield partnership with the
Syrian Kurdish

30:23.922 --> 30:26.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
militia known as the YPG.

30:26.791 --> 30:30.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the most effective ground
force fighting
ISIS.

30:30.195 --> 30:36.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ankara objects, arguing the YPG
is linked
to Turkey's Kurdish terror group
the PKK.

30:36.401 --> 30:42.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the U.S. announced last week
it will furnish
the YPG with heavier weapons.

30:42.040 --> 30:45.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Defense Secretary James Mattis
sought to soften
the blow to Ankara.

30:45.643 --> 30:49.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATTIS, U.S. Secretary of
Defense: We
are very open to discussions
about options,

30:49.113 --> 30:54.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and we will work together, and
we will work
out any of the concerns.

30:54.052 --> 31:00.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am not concerned at all about
the NATO alliance
and the relations between our
nations.

31:00.925 --> 31:06.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Today, Mr.
Trump cited the
PKK, alongside ISIS, as a
regional terror

31:06.965 --> 31:10.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
group, but he didn't mention the
YPG.

31:10.902 --> 31:14.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Erdogan said neither group
deserves a future
in the region.

31:14.405 --> 31:18.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN (through
translator):
Taking the YPG and its allies in
the region

31:18.309 --> 31:22.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into consideration will never be
accepted,
and it is going to be against a
global agreement

31:23.014 --> 31:24.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that we have reached.

31:24.849 --> 31:29.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Last month,
Turkey conducted
cross-border airstrikes against
the YPG, killing

31:29.354 --> 31:31.189 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more than 20.

31:31.222 --> 31:37.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Internally, Washington is
dismayed by Erdogan's
crackdown on domestic dissent,
especially

31:37.161 --> 31:39.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
since last year's abortive coup.

31:39.464 --> 31:46.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some 47,000 people have been
arrested, and
another 100,000 fired from
government posts.

31:46.404 --> 31:52.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ankara accuses self-exiled
Muslim cleric Fethullah
Gulen of orchestrating the coup
attempt and

31:52.543 --> 31:56.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is furious that the U.S. hasn't
extradited
him.

31:56.214 --> 32:01.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All this follows a referendum
last month greatly
expanding Erdogan's powers.

32:01.452 --> 32:04.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The result sparked widespread
protests.

32:04.489 --> 32:09.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
European monitors criticized it
as below international
standards.

32:09.227 --> 32:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump telephoned Erdogan to
congratulate
him, however, something no other
Western leader

32:15.099 --> 32:16.067 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
did.

32:16.100 --> 32:18.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

32:18.937 --> 32:22.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And now Jeffrey Brown
takes it
from there.

32:22.273 --> 32:25.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, what is
likely to come
of the Trump-Erdogan meeting?

32:25.443 --> 32:28.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And how serious are the tensions
between the
two allies?

32:28.346 --> 32:33.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
To help us answer those
questions, we turn
to Soner Cagaptay of the
Washington Institute

32:33.685 --> 32:35.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for Near East Policy.

32:35.253 --> 32:39.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is the author of "The New
Sultan: Erdogan
and the Crisis of Modern
Turkey."

32:39.290 --> 32:44.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Ali Cinar, president of the
Turkish Heritage
Organization, who's just come
from a meeting

32:44.762 --> 32:45.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with President Erdogan.

32:45.830 --> 32:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, let me start with you, Ali
Cinar.

32:48.099 --> 32:53.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's get right to that question
of the main
dispute, the U.S. decision to
arm a Kurdish

32:53.805 --> 32:55.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
militia fighting in Syria.

32:55.540 --> 32:58.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How much anger did that provoke
in Turkey?

32:58.276 --> 33:03.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALI CINAR, President, Turkish
Heritage Organization:
Well, it was -- it was a really
bad perception

33:03.448 --> 33:09.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the Turkey side, because,
since the terror
attacks increase in Turkey, the
Turkish people

33:09.787 --> 33:14.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got upset with United States,
since U.S. support
PYG.

33:14.392 --> 33:21.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the meeting today between
President Trump
and Erdogan mainly focused on
the PYG issue

33:21.232 --> 33:22.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and extradition of Fethullah
Gulen.

33:22.767 --> 33:27.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there were two important,
major issues
that they discussed noontime.

33:27.138 --> 33:32.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, Soner
Cagaptay, what did
President Erdogan want from this
meeting?

33:32.844 --> 33:34.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And do we know what he got?

33:34.645 --> 33:36.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SONER CAGAPTAY, Director,
Turkish Research
Program, Washington Institute
for Near East

33:36.514 --> 33:39.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Policy: I think he got half of
what he wanted
already, which was to be invited
to Washington.

33:39.450 --> 33:44.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He just won a contested
referendum that has
made him executive-style
president.

33:44.956 --> 33:50.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As I highlight in my latest
book, "The New
Sultan," Turkey is a very
divided country,

33:50.261 --> 33:52.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
largely as a result of Erdogan's
political
trajectory.

33:53.031 --> 33:56.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Half of the country loves him,
and the other
half hates him.

33:56.634 --> 34:00.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the half that loathes him,
they didn't
see the referendum as free and
fair.

34:00.638 --> 34:05.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Erdogan was aching to get a
Western leader
to invite him, so he could
affirm his victory

34:05.576 --> 34:07.278 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as he saw it.

34:07.311 --> 34:10.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, by the mere fact that he was
invited to
the White House, he got more
than half he

34:11.015 --> 34:12.750 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wanted.

34:12.784 --> 34:15.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On top of it, I think, today, he
wanted to
see some concessions regarding
the Kurdish

34:15.853 --> 34:20.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issue and the U.S. policy on the
Kurdish issue,
and he may have gotten that as
well.

34:20.458 --> 34:25.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that the deal President
Trump offered
to Turkish President Erdogan is
that the United

34:25.430 --> 34:31.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States will look -- wants Turkey
to look the
other way as Washington arms the
Syrian Kurds

34:31.035 --> 34:32.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to take Raqqa from ISIS.

34:32.870 --> 34:38.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In return, Washington is willing
to look the
other way as Turkey fights the
Syrian Kurds'

34:38.142 --> 34:42.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ally PKK In Iraq and elsewhere
where it has
strongholds.

34:42.046 --> 34:47.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Ali Cinar, do you
see him,
the president, Erdogan, having
gotten anything

34:47.151 --> 34:52.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of this meeting, because the
U.S. has
stood by its decision to arm the
Kurds?

34:52.657 --> 34:54.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALI CINAR: Right.

34:54.425 --> 34:58.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I don't think you will
see in the
short term -- but what President
Trump said,

34:58.329 --> 35:06.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also, we are going to also let
some Turkish
government use some war -- I
mean, guns to

35:06.304 --> 35:11.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Turkish government, meaning that
Trump said,
we are going to arm Turkey, too.

35:11.676 --> 35:13.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was an interesting statement.

35:13.478 --> 35:19.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, also, it seems like United
States is
going to use PYG on the Raqqa
operation, but

35:20.017 --> 35:27.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the other ground operations,
there might
be a collaboration between
Turkey and United

35:27.091 --> 35:28.960 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

35:28.993 --> 35:33.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's difficult to see right
now, but,
in the long term, you might see
a better cooperation

35:34.031 --> 35:35.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
between the two countries.

35:35.900 --> 35:39.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What about,
staying with you,
Ali Cinar, on the question of
Fethullah Gulen?

35:39.103 --> 35:42.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There, too, Turkey seems to have
been rebuffed.

35:42.573 --> 35:45.209 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ALI CINAR: Yes.

35:45.243 --> 35:51.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the problem is, right
now, the U.S.
side says, OK, Turkey needs to
respect our

35:51.682 --> 35:54.552 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
legal system and process.

35:54.585 --> 36:00.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now Erdogan is insisting
that that was
a treaty agreement, extradition
agreement

36:00.892 --> 36:04.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between Turkey and the United
States signed
in 1979.

36:04.328 --> 36:11.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at least Turkey is asking to
detain Fethullah
Gulen, and the U.S. side is not
doing it right

36:11.369 --> 36:12.336 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

36:12.370 --> 36:15.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So I don't we will see a
solution on this.

36:15.439 --> 36:18.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Turkey continues to insist
on Fethullah
Gulen.

36:18.075 --> 36:22.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Soner Cagaptay,
you mentioned
the human rights issues earlier.

36:22.346 --> 36:25.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that they didn't come
up, at least
publicly.

36:25.483 --> 36:27.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Did that surprise you?

36:27.518 --> 36:29.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Should it have come up?

36:29.353 --> 36:32.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SONER CAGAPTAY: Probably not,
because Turkey
is a large country, and the
Turks don't like

36:32.990 --> 36:35.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be lectured, especially by
outsiders.

36:35.293 --> 36:40.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, if it came up, I would
have preferred
that it came out in private
meetings.

36:40.064 --> 36:41.032 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is an important issue.

36:41.065 --> 36:44.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's not about selling
American values.

36:44.202 --> 36:47.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Erdogan in Turkey has
won elections
on a platform of economic good
governance,

36:47.972 --> 36:52.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but also demonizing groups that
do not vote
for him, ranging from leftists
to liberals

36:52.910 --> 36:54.812 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Kurds.

36:54.845 --> 36:58.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a result, the very is very
deeply polarized
country, as I write in my book
"The New Sultan."

36:58.316 --> 37:03.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the same time, this very
deeply polarized
country is now in a state of
crisis, where

37:03.721 --> 37:08.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
half believe that they live in
heaven, and
the other half believe that they
live in hell.

37:08.526 --> 37:10.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is not sustainable.

37:10.328 --> 37:15.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey is a key ally for the
United States
because it borders Iran, Iraq,
Syria, ISIS,

37:15.333 --> 37:17.068 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and Russia across the Black Sea.

37:17.101 --> 37:21.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whatever U.S. policies are
regarding those
countries or entities, they're
much easier

37:21.372 --> 37:23.107 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Turkey.

37:23.140 --> 37:26.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they're easier with Turkey,
which is a
stable country, not a country
which is in

37:26.844 --> 37:27.945 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
crisis.

37:27.979 --> 37:29.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Erdogan's trajectory has put
Turkey into a
crisis.

37:29.780 --> 37:33.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that the human
rights issues are
not about selling American
values.

37:33.417 --> 37:36.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're about making sure that
Turkey remains
a stable place.

37:36.654 --> 37:41.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the only way for that is, of
course, for
President Erdogan to depolarize
Turkey's landscape,

37:41.926 --> 37:44.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as well as to become a unifier,
after having
won the referendum.

37:44.795 --> 37:47.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I wish and hope that that came
up in the conversation.

37:47.565 --> 37:50.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, Ali Cinar,
finally, to
the extent that today was -- a
big part of

37:50.501 --> 37:55.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today was about trying to mend
fences in what
has been a very tense time,
where do things

37:55.339 --> 37:57.108 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
go from here?

37:57.141 --> 38:02.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALI CINAR: I mean, they are
going to meet
also in Europe for the NATO
summit, and this

38:02.680 --> 38:05.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
talk will continue for their
next meeting.

38:05.983 --> 38:11.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what I see is right now
fighting against
ISIS are the most important
common strategy

38:11.922 --> 38:13.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for both countries.

38:13.858 --> 38:19.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, hopefully, the Turkish army
and the Pentagon
can closely work together, and
then move forward.

38:19.597 --> 38:25.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Otherwise, it will be a
disaster, if they
don't coordinate in the region,
since Turkey

38:25.303 --> 38:28.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is still upset on the U.S.
support to PYG.

38:28.873 --> 38:32.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, hopefully, the dialogue will
continue
between the two countries.

38:32.777 --> 38:34.178 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's my hope.

38:34.211 --> 38:36.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Ali Cinar, Soner
Cagaptay,
thank you both very much.

38:36.213 --> 38:38.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SONER CAGAPTAY: Thank you.

38:38.616 --> 38:46.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALI CINAR: Thank you.

38:46.490 --> 38:51.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Stay with us.

38:51.295 --> 38:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
view from Colorado
-- the state's Democratic
governor weighs

38:56.000 --> 38:58.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in on the health care battle.

38:58.569 --> 39:03.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: Every day, millions
of parents
put their children on buses for
the trip to

39:03.107 --> 39:04.375 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
school.

39:04.408 --> 39:07.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Statistically, buses remain the
safest way
to make that trip.

39:07.712 --> 39:10.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But fatal accidents do happen.

39:10.047 --> 39:15.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just yesterday, an 11-year-old
boy died in
East Texas when the bus he was
riding on collided

39:15.720 --> 39:18.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with another vehicle and rolled
over.

39:18.189 --> 39:22.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent list Lisa
Stark reports
that a record number of states
are trying

39:22.460 --> 39:27.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to improve school bus safety,
part of our
weekly series, Making the Grade.

39:27.732 --> 39:30.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Get in and put your seat
belts on, guys.

39:30.901 --> 39:36.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: This is a sight you
rarely see
on a school bus: students
buckling themselves

39:36.107 --> 39:37.241 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

39:37.274 --> 39:39.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: You feel safer when you
put your
seat belt on.

39:39.110 --> 39:40.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRIS HAFEZIZADEH, Transportation
Director,
Austin Independent School
District: The school

39:40.411 --> 39:44.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bus transportation, we carry the
most precious
cargo, right?

39:44.715 --> 39:49.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Kris Hafezizadeh is
the director
of transportation for the
Austin, Texas, school

39:49.120 --> 39:50.955 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
district.

39:50.988 --> 39:55.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Five years ago, the district
decided every
new bus it bought would come
with lap shoulder

39:55.626 --> 40:01.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
belts, at an extra $8,000 per
bus, and not
because there had been an
accident.

40:01.332 --> 40:06.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRIS HAFEZIZADEH: We thought
that, you know,
we always ask your kids, when
they get inside

40:06.303 --> 40:07.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the car, to put on their seat
belts.

40:07.972 --> 40:13.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, to carry the culture inside
our school
buses, it does add to additional
safety.

40:13.511 --> 40:18.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: But most school
districts have
decided against adding seat
belts.

40:18.516 --> 40:25.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Montgomery County, Maryland,
buses carry
100,000 students a day, and
there has never

40:25.423 --> 40:29.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been an accident in which a
student rider
died.

40:29.160 --> 40:34.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Buying new buses with seat belts
would cost
an extra $1 million a year.

40:34.398 --> 40:38.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Transportation director Todd
Watkins says
it doesn't make fiscal sense.

40:38.235 --> 40:41.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is that a tough position to
take, to try to
explain to people?

40:41.872 --> 40:43.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TODD WATKINS, Transportation
Director, Montgomery
County Public Schools: It is,
because when

40:43.641 --> 40:48.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're talking about anything
that is involving
safety, how can you be against
it?

40:48.078 --> 40:49.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I'm not against it.

40:49.847 --> 40:56.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just don't think it's the best
use of money
right now, because the safety is
at such a

40:56.854 --> 40:58.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
high level in school buses as it
is.

40:58.956 --> 41:03.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Twenty-five million
children ride
school buses every day.

41:03.427 --> 41:08.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Accidents claim around five to
six lives a
year.

41:08.299 --> 41:13.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Statistics show children are
safer riding
to school in a bus than with a
parent.

41:13.337 --> 41:15.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK ROSEKIND, Former
Administrator, National
Highway Traffic Safety
Administration: Those

41:15.105 --> 41:18.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
big yellow buses are the safest
way for all
of our kids to get to school
every single

41:18.943 --> 41:19.910 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
day.

41:19.944 --> 41:21.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The question is, can we make
them safer?

41:21.745 --> 41:25.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Mark Rosekind headed
up the National
Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, or

41:25.916 --> 41:27.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NHTSA, under President Obama.

41:27.785 --> 41:30.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That agency regulates school
buses.

41:30.254 --> 41:36.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Rosekind shocked school
officials by advocating
something no other NHTSA
director ever had.

41:36.827 --> 41:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK ROSEKIND: Three-point seat
belts should
be the norm on all new school
buses, because

41:42.099 --> 41:44.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we're talking about trying to
save every life.

41:44.068 --> 41:47.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: But districts argue
they're getting
a mixed message.

41:47.238 --> 41:52.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There is no federal law
requiring seat belts
on buses, and NHTSA has
concluded -- quote

41:52.343 --> 41:58.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- "that large school buses
without seat belts
do not pose an unreasonable risk
of death

41:58.249 --> 41:59.483 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or injury.

41:59.517 --> 42:03.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We do not find a safety need for
a federal
mandate."

42:03.320 --> 42:05.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK ROSEKIND: You don't need
the government
to tell you to do this.

42:05.256 --> 42:07.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The technology is available now.

42:07.124 --> 42:11.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Whenever there's a
tragedy, such
as the Chattanooga crash last
November, which

42:11.295 --> 42:16.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
killed six children, there is
always an anguished
debate over seat belts.

42:16.667 --> 42:21.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON STOOS, Accident Victim:
It's so frustrating
to me every time I see another
accident.

42:21.605 --> 42:27.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Allison Stoos still
bears the
scars of her accident over a
decade ago.

42:27.344 --> 42:32.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was traveling with her
soccer team in
a small bus chartered by her
Texas high school,

42:32.383 --> 42:36.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
not built to school bus
standards, but also
without seat belts.

42:36.420 --> 42:40.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALLISON STOOS: The bus swerved,
and that's
pretty much all I remember.

42:40.691 --> 42:43.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA STARK: The bus rolled over
on its side.

42:43.727 --> 42:45.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Two teammates died.

42:45.362 --> 42:48.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Three, including Allison, were
seriously injured.

42:48.566 --> 42:52.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She was partially ejected, her
arm trapped
under the bus.

42:52.536 --> 42:56.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Countless surgeries later, she
has limited
use of her left arm.

42:56.574 --> 43:01.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON STOOS: The way it's
impacted my life
and all my friends' lives, and
not just the

43:01.045 --> 43:06.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
girls on the bus, but our entire
school was
just turned upside down.

43:06.817 --> 43:10.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Do you think, if you
would had
had a seat belt, it would have
made a difference?

43:10.120 --> 43:14.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON STOOS: Certainly, in my
injury in
our type of wreck, with a
rollover, I definitely

43:14.925 --> 43:16.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think it would have made a
difference.

43:17.027 --> 43:21.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: For decades, school
buses have
been designed to protect riders
through something

43:21.231 --> 43:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
called compartmentalization.

43:22.666 --> 43:25.269 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The seats are close together.

43:25.302 --> 43:28.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The backs are high and they're
padded.

43:28.172 --> 43:32.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This helps keep the student in
the compartment,
if you will, during an accident.

43:32.509 --> 43:38.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It works well during front and
rear impacts.

43:38.582 --> 43:43.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This crash test shows how
unbelted students
-- that's these test dummies --
stay in their

43:43.787 --> 43:46.924 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
seats after a frontal crash.

43:46.957 --> 43:53.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, in this test, which
simulates a rollover,
very few of the test dummies
stay put.

43:53.497 --> 43:59.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Students can also go flying in
violent side-impact
crashes, as shown in this
onboard video.

43:59.603 --> 44:02.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KRISTIN POLAND, National
Transportation Safety
Board: These severe side-impact
crashes and

44:02.172 --> 44:08.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
high-speed rollover crashes are
very rare
school bus crashes, but, when
they do happen,

44:08.078 --> 44:10.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we find that the children are
vulnerable.

44:10.147 --> 44:15.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Lap-shoulder belts
reduce that
vulnerability, according to
Kristin Poland.

44:15.152 --> 44:19.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She's with the National
Transportation Safety
Board, which investigates school
bus crashes.

44:19.690 --> 44:24.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRISTIN POLAND: In this case, we
had a single
vehicle that left the roadway,
impacted a

44:24.728 --> 44:26.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pole, impacted several trees.

44:26.597 --> 44:32.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: This 2014 crash in
Anaheim, California,
injured the driver and nine
students.

44:32.302 --> 44:34.138 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No one died.

44:34.171 --> 44:38.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRISTIN POLAND: This was the
first crash where
we had a school bus that was
equipped with

44:38.108 --> 44:40.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lap-shoulder belts in all
seating positions.

44:40.444 --> 44:44.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Poland looked at
what might have
been, if two of the more
seriously injured

44:44.615 --> 44:46.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
students were wearing only lap
belts.

44:46.717 --> 44:49.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KRISTIN POLAND: Here, we have
the occupants
interacting with each other.

44:49.620 --> 44:51.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Or no belts at all.

44:51.355 --> 44:54.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRISTIN POLAND: In the unbelted
cases, we
have our occupant that was
seated along the

44:54.792 --> 44:57.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aisle that's come all the way
over and is
now down on the floor.

44:57.861 --> 45:01.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The lap-shoulder belts are
giving the greatest
protection, because they are
keeping the body

45:01.198 --> 45:05.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
upright, keeping the occupant in
the seating
compartment, keeping the
occupants away from

45:05.903 --> 45:07.705 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
each other.

45:07.738 --> 45:11.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Only seven states
have school
bus seat belt laws on the books,
but Louisiana

45:11.442 --> 45:15.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Texas have not approved the
funding and
Arkansas' law is brand-new.

45:15.913 --> 45:22.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even advocates will tell you
installing belts
alone isn't enough.

45:22.252 --> 45:27.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A big challenge is ensuring
students wear
them properly, or at all.

45:27.324 --> 45:28.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you ever ride without it on
the bus?

45:28.425 --> 45:29.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: Sometimes.

45:29.426 --> 45:31.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: Why is that?

45:31.161 --> 45:33.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: Because I feel like --
sometimes,
I forget to put my seat belt on,
sometimes.

45:33.564 --> 45:39.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: But Allison says, at
least these
students have an option.

45:39.403 --> 45:44.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON STOOS: I didn't have the
choice to
sit there and buckle myself up
to protect

45:45.008 --> 45:46.777 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
myself.

45:46.810 --> 45:50.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Allison, with her
dad and others,
helped get the Texas school bus
seat belt

45:50.414 --> 45:52.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
law passed in 2007.

45:52.649 --> 45:56.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're still trying to get it
funded.

45:56.720 --> 45:59.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ultimately, money is the biggest
driver.

45:59.790 --> 46:06.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Education dollars are scarce,
and few districts
believe it pays to have students
buckle up.

46:06.363 --> 46:16.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour" and
Education Week,
I'm Lisa Stark in Austin, Texas.

46:16.940 --> 46:26.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: While President
Trump's troubles
over issues continue to dominate
the headlines,

46:27.017 --> 46:31.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the battle over the future of
health care
is still brewing in the
background.

46:31.622 --> 46:34.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here again, William Brangham
with that story.

46:34.358 --> 46:37.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: With the
passage of the
House Republican bill to repeal
and replace

46:37.961 --> 46:42.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the Affordable Care Act,
President Obama's
signature health care law, the
focus now shifts

46:42.533 --> 46:44.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the U.S. Senate.

46:44.334 --> 46:48.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As part of our ongoing look at
what's at stake
for health care in the U.S., we
are joined

46:48.071 --> 46:51.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
now by Democrat John
Hickenlooper, governor
of Colorado.

46:51.375 --> 46:52.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to the "NewsHour."

46:52.376 --> 46:53.443 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

46:53.477 --> 46:55.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN HICKENLOOPER (D), Colorado:
Nice to be
here.

46:55.145 --> 46:56.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, before we
talk about
health care, can I just get your
reaction

46:56.780 --> 47:00.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to these latest revelations
about the president
and his dealings with the FBI?

47:00.951 --> 47:01.919 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

47:01.952 --> 47:02.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN HICKENLOOPER: Sure.

47:03.020 --> 47:04.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I -- you know, I think it
shows two things.

47:04.922 --> 47:08.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, I got into
politics, I became
mayor of Denver when I was 50.

47:08.859 --> 47:14.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I made all kinds of
mistakes, because
being an executive in business
is very different

47:14.331 --> 47:15.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than an executive in public
life.

47:15.732 --> 47:17.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So I kept doing dumb things.

47:17.534 --> 47:22.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this really kind of shows
how much power
the president of the United
States has.

47:22.206 --> 47:27.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, obviously, he can make
decisions to declassify
information and share it as he
wants.

47:27.411 --> 47:31.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But it has all kinds of
ramifications beyond
what I think he is thinking,
just because

47:31.148 --> 47:32.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he's never been there before.

47:32.916 --> 47:36.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, I look back at some of
the really
dumb things that I did when I
first became

47:36.753 --> 47:39.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mayor, and maybe it got on the
front page
of The Denver Post.

47:39.823 --> 47:41.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that was -- I could dig
myself out.

47:41.558 --> 47:43.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You attribute
this to rookie
mistakes?

47:43.760 --> 47:44.728 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

47:44.761 --> 47:45.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN HICKENLOOPER: Yes.

47:45.762 --> 47:47.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, I think it's a much
broader landscape.

47:47.931 --> 47:53.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think he's used to being
able to throw
-- really lobby, push his weight
around.

47:53.270 --> 47:58.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, the comments to James
Comey, they're
disconcerting.

47:58.809 --> 47:59.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's no question.

47:59.776 --> 48:00.944 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But we will see.

48:00.978 --> 48:02.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, we don't have all the
information
yet.

48:02.946 --> 48:06.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it's -- it's amazing, the
whole thing.

48:06.650 --> 48:07.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Amazing, it
is.

48:07.918 --> 48:09.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's talk about health care.

48:09.786 --> 48:15.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have been a very sharp
critic of the House
GOP's bill that is now before
the Senate.

48:15.259 --> 48:16.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's your principal concern
there?

48:16.727 --> 48:18.595 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

48:18.629 --> 48:21.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN HICKENLOOPER: Well, as
written, that
bill would be, I think, a
disaster for Colorado

48:21.632 --> 48:23.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and most of the country.

48:23.433 --> 48:28.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Really, it in no way improves
the health care
system.

48:28.305 --> 48:31.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is going to make it harder to
get insurance
for people who lose their
coverage.

48:31.975 --> 48:36.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, probably, to finance it the
way the House
wants to, it's going to end up
rolling back,

48:36.413 --> 48:39.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forcing governors to roll back
coverage on
people with Medicaid.

48:39.716 --> 48:44.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Colorado, it will probably
cost us over
-- between $1 billion and $1.5
billion of

48:44.154 --> 48:45.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
additional costs.

48:45.155 --> 48:47.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's just a cost shift to the
states.

48:47.324 --> 48:49.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And what's the real benefit?

48:49.126 --> 48:53.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're doing over 10 years a
trillion-dollar
tax cut for the highest earnings
in America,

48:53.664 --> 48:57.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who the ones I have talked to in
Colorado,
they're not fighting to get this
tax cut.

48:57.267 --> 48:59.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not something they're
seeking.

48:59.770 --> 49:01.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not sure -- I don't get what
the point
of it is.

49:01.939 --> 49:07.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You obviously
know this
is their attempt to undo the
Affordable Care

49:07.344 --> 49:08.779 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Act.

49:08.812 --> 49:12.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What has that law, President
Obama's law,
meant for Colorado thus far?

49:12.349 --> 49:13.784 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

49:13.817 --> 49:16.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN HICKENLOOPER: So, Obamacare
allowed to
us expand Medicaid coverage.

49:16.353 --> 49:21.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We got about 400,000 more people
covered in
that avenue, through that
avenue, and about

49:21.892 --> 49:23.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
200,000 people through our
exchange.

49:23.894 --> 49:29.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We did our own exchange, so much
more coverage,
a lot of that support.

49:29.433 --> 49:31.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I'm the first person --
there were problems.

49:31.902 --> 49:33.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It definitely needs to be
improved.

49:33.971 --> 49:35.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you don't throw the baby out
with the
bath water.

49:35.973 --> 49:42.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, I look at what
the landscape
looks like, and, again, I don't
think the

49:42.145 --> 49:47.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senate will ever pass what came
out of the
House, just because there are
too many both

49:47.417 --> 49:51.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Democratic governors and
Republican governors
that are saying, you know, we're
not -- we

49:51.722 --> 49:53.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
don't want to roll back
coverage.

49:53.523 --> 49:58.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're willing to discuss and
negotiate who
gets how much coverage, and is
the coverage

49:58.261 --> 49:59.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for Medicaid maybe a little too
rich?

49:59.997 --> 50:03.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think all of us agree we have
got to get
our arms around controlling the
incredible

50:03.500 --> 50:08.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inflation that's gone on in
health care for
the last 30 years, independent
of Obamacare.

50:08.438 --> 50:14.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I don't think any of us,
Republican governors,
like John Kasich or Brian
Sandoval, they don't

50:14.878 --> 50:17.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want to roll back Medicaid
coverage, and then
Democrats like myself.

50:17.714 --> 50:20.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, how do you
see this
going forward?

50:20.117 --> 50:24.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, the House bill is
going to be modified
in some way by the Senate, but
let's just

50:24.521 --> 50:29.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
say some version of the
Republicans' ideas
end up coming down to the
states.

50:29.593 --> 50:30.560 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What does that mean for you?

50:30.594 --> 50:32.462 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

50:32.496 --> 50:35.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN HICKENLOOPER: Well, it
would be difficult,
unless there's some change in
how they're

50:35.298 --> 50:40.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thinking of financing this, and
how much of
that new cost they're going to
put on to states.

50:40.470 --> 50:44.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, block grants, fine,
but if you don't
allow it to have some
flexibility, if you

50:44.975 --> 50:49.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't allow it to grow when you
have got disasters
or when there's sudden instances
of medical

50:49.913 --> 50:53.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inflation, then you're really --
you're kind
of handcuffing the states and
tying them to

50:53.550 --> 50:57.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a -- to something they can't
possibly pay
for.

50:57.320 --> 50:58.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's not healthy.

50:58.555 --> 51:01.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It makes governors have to pay
-- make terrible
decisions.

51:01.058 --> 51:05.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think what the Senate
hopefully will do
-- and I think they might do
this -- is sit

51:05.562 --> 51:08.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
down and talk with some
governors, Republicans
and Democrats.

51:08.465 --> 51:09.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It shouldn't be a partisan deal.

51:09.900 --> 51:12.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But governors are the ones who
have to implement
this stuff.

51:12.069 --> 51:16.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's get a group of us to sit
down with a
couple of senators and say, how
do we -- we

51:16.473 --> 51:17.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
all have the same kind of goals.

51:17.474 --> 51:18.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This shouldn't be partisan.

51:18.542 --> 51:19.509 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

51:19.543 --> 51:20.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's all settle down.

51:20.944 --> 51:22.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do we control costs and make
sure we don't
roll back coverage?

51:22.813 --> 51:27.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I appreciate
that, the idea
of bipartisanship, but
bipartisanship -- you

51:27.150 --> 51:31.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have spent a few days this week
in Washington,
D.C. -- it's not high on
anyone's agenda,

51:31.455 --> 51:32.422 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it seems.

51:32.456 --> 51:34.224 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

51:34.257 --> 51:35.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN HICKENLOOPER: Well, there
are a lot of
blockages, and there is a lot of
bitterness.

51:35.692 --> 51:37.461 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

51:37.494 --> 51:42.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's years of attack ads
and, you
know, people -- you know, I was
in the restaurant

51:42.499 --> 51:45.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
business, and we learned early
on that there's
no margin in having enemies.

51:45.669 --> 51:49.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No matter how unreasonable that
person is,
you don't let them leave angry,
whereas, in

51:49.272 --> 51:54.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
politics, so often, people
define themselves
by their enemies and how mean
they can be

51:54.144 --> 51:57.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or how sharp can -- how barbed
can their comments
be about that person?

51:57.981 --> 52:03.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, after that election or
after that specific
policy issue, suddenly, you're
supposed to

52:03.153 --> 52:04.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
work together again.

52:04.521 --> 52:06.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's not always in human
nature.

52:06.323 --> 52:10.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think people should spend
a little more
time looking down the road and
saying, at

52:10.894 --> 52:12.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some point, I'm going to have to
work with
this person again.

52:12.963 --> 52:14.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maybe we should be a little more
cordial.

52:14.764 --> 52:18.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Governor John
Hickenlooper of Colorado, thank
you so much.

52:18.602 --> 52:19.870 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

52:19.903 --> 52:26.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN HICKENLOOPER: No, thank
you.

52:26.510 --> 52:33.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In early 2016, Ammon
Bundy and
his supporters staged an armed
occupation

52:33.850 --> 52:36.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of a national wildlife preserve
in Oregon.

armed militias and patriot
groups across the

This is Ammon

53:01.244 --> 53:02.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How are you doing?

53:03.246 --> 53:04.881 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
How are you?

53:04.915 --> 53:07.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMMON BUNDY: I don't know if you
can tell
there's a little level of
uncomfortable.

And just wanted to make sure

on the same page.

53:12.389 --> 53:14.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Yes, oh, absolutely.

53:14.224 --> 53:15.559 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Quiet on set.

53:15.592 --> 53:16.960 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And roll camera.

53:16.993 --> 53:20.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Did you think you might
have to take
a life?

53:20.430 --> 53:23.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I never did once think I
would have to
take a life.

53:23.500 --> 53:24.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was never armed.

53:24.501 --> 53:26.269 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I mean...

53:26.303 --> 53:28.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: In the interviews,
they wanted to
know who planned the standoff
and who was

53:28.939 --> 53:30.207 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in charge.

53:30.240 --> 53:37.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: How would you put yourself
in the family
rank structure?

53:37.914 --> 53:41.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because it seems to me that
you're very influential
to your family.

53:41.952 --> 53:43.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: So, at this circumstance,

53:44.788 --> 53:46.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: My dad was really
skeptical.

53:46.056 --> 53:47.123 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He really was.

53:47.157 --> 53:49.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I up basically talking my
family into
it.

53:49.359 --> 53:51.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so, you know, they went to
our home.

53:51.795 --> 53:53.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Can you hear me now?

53:53.396 --> 53:54.364 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Testing.

MAN: I think about that.

53:57.200 --> 54:04.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The whole time, my mom's in
there cooking
for them, they're plotting to
destroy our

54:04.341 --> 54:05.609 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
family.

54:05.642 --> 54:08.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That's "Frontline"
tonight on most
PBS stations.

54:08.912 --> 54:13.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Updating our top story: The New

urged then-FBI Director James
Comey to stop
investigating Michael Flynn
after Flynn was

54:19.356 --> 54:21.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fired as national security
adviser.

54:21.691 --> 54:24.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The reports cite Comey's own
notes.

54:24.461 --> 54:29.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House says the story
is not a truthful
or accurate portrayal.

54:29.132 --> 54:31.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president fired Comey last
week.

54:31.434 --> 54:37.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

parties are calling
