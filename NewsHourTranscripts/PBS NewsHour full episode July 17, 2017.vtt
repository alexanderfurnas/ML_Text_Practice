JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.666 --> 00:07.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.566 --> 00:10.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
health care in critical
condition, Republicans forced to

00:10.766 --> 00:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
delay a vote on replacing
Obamacare, putting final
passage in further jeopardy.

00:18.133 --> 00:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: dangerous work --
the perils of shipbuilding,
as the U.S. Navy plans
to expand its fleet.

00:23.933 --> 00:28.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOEY PETTEY, Accident Survivor:
The explosion, when it happened,
it blew doors and hatches

00:30.000 --> 00:32.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and electrical panels,
boom, boom, boom.

00:32.466 --> 00:34.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
When that third one
hit, it blew it out.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
it's Politics Monday.

00:37.066 --> 00:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Amy Walter and Tamara Keith are
here to talk the high stakes
of health care, and what new

00:43.266 --> 00:45.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
polls on the Trump
presidency suggest.

00:45.666 --> 00:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:48.266 --> 00:52.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:52.733 --> 00:57.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Russia
is stepping up pressure
on the United States to
regain two diplomatic

01:06.000 --> 01:09.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
compounds seized in
New York and Maryland.

01:09.633 --> 01:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama ordered them
seized in December in response
to Russian meddling in the 2016

01:15.233 --> 01:17.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

01:17.266 --> 01:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Foreign Minister Sergei
Lavrov called it highway
robbery, and his deputy held a

01:21.100 --> 01:23.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
high-level meeting at
the State Department.

01:23.633 --> 01:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nick Schifrin has been
following the story, and he
joins me now in the studio.

01:27.900 --> 01:31.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, Nick, why are the
Russians so interested
in these two compounds?

01:31.233 --> 01:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: What officials
on both sides are talking
about is bilateral irritants.

01:36.033 --> 01:38.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So these are the compounds.

01:38.166 --> 01:43.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are the Russian diplomats
who were expelled last year as
part of the U.S. response to

01:44.600 --> 01:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Russian hacking, and these
are not the major issues.

01:46.933 --> 01:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
These are not Syria and Ukraine.

01:48.966 --> 01:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the idea is that the fewer
issues you talk about, the
more likely it is you make

01:52.733 --> 01:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at least a little progress.

01:54.900 --> 01:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what are
the prospects that they can
reach any kind of agreement?

01:57.033 --> 02:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: That's exactly
what the Trump administration
is trying to find, any kind

02:00.600 --> 02:03.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of agreement.

02:03.233 --> 02:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are huge headwinds,
as you know, politically
in this country if you
give back those compounds.

02:07.300 --> 02:08.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Huge.

02:08.533 --> 02:10.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And
so -- huge, exactly.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But U.S. officials are
worried about retribution.

02:12.300 --> 02:17.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia says, look, if there's no
deal today in the near future,
three dozen of your diplomats

02:17.166 --> 02:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will be expelled and life
for your diplomats in
Russia will get even worse.

02:21.233 --> 02:25.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have already seen
a campaign of intimidation
against U.S. diplomats.

02:25.466 --> 02:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Russia in June 2016, we
saw a U.S. diplomat outside
of the embassy get beaten up.

02:29.733 --> 02:31.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's not something the
U.S. wants to see there.

02:31.333 --> 02:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, quickly,
where do you see this going?

02:32.900 --> 02:34.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: It's a
chicken and egg problem.

02:34.633 --> 02:37.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The U.S. says, you
hacked, we responded.

02:37.933 --> 02:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If Russia were to say, no,
no, no, we didn't hack, you
kicked our guys out, you seized

02:41.400 --> 02:46.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our compounds for no reason,
then we retaliate, the U.S. has
to say, oh, well, this is a new

02:46.200 --> 02:48.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
retaliation, and yet
another response.

02:48.733 --> 02:50.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's no telling
where that would end.

02:50.300 --> 02:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The U.S. is trying to say, look,
the big issues, keep that aside.

02:55.033 --> 02:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maybe we can make some progress
and at least, I don't know,
save a bad relationship from

02:59.900 --> 03:01.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
getting worse.

03:01.466 --> 03:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Another aspect
of the U.S.-Russia relationship.

03:03.433 --> 03:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Nick Schifrin, thank you.

03:04.433 --> 03:06.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Thanks.

03:06.933 --> 03:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: Officials at
Princeton University insisted
that a Chinese-American

03:10.333 --> 03:13.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
graduate student jailed
in Iran is innocent.

03:13.966 --> 03:18.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Iranian courts announced
on Sunday that Xiyue
Wang was sentenced to
10 years in prison for

03:20.333 --> 03:21.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
spying.

03:21.333 --> 03:22.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was arrested last August.

03:22.966 --> 03:26.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Princeton says that Wang
was conducting research
for his doctorate.

03:26.366 --> 03:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Separately, Iran announced
that President Hassan Rouhani's
brother has been arrested

03:31.200 --> 03:34.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on allegations of
financial misconduct.

In Jordan, a soldier
was sentenced today to
life in prison at hard
labor for killing three

03:40.366 --> 03:42.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
U.S. Army Green Berets.

03:42.300 --> 03:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said he fired on the
military trainers last November
because he thought his base

03:47.133 --> 03:49.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was under attack.

03:49.233 --> 03:53.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
After the sentencing
today, relatives of the
Americans condemned the
sentence, which could

03:53.100 --> 03:55.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
let the killer go
free in 20 years.

JAMES MORIARTY, Father of Slain
Soldier: He gets out -- the
day he gets out, my daughters

04:00.133 --> 04:05.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will serve another 30
years after that without
the love of their brother,
and that's outrageous.

04:07.400 --> 04:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would kill him myself if
I had the ability to do so,
and I wish they had hung him.

04:14.333 --> 04:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The families
were shown security camera
footage of the attack.

04:17.100 --> 04:22.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They say that it shows
the Jordanian soldier
firing for six minutes,
even after the Americans

04:22.966 --> 04:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
had identified themselves.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The United Nations reports
that the war in Afghanistan
is killing more civilians than

04:29.500 --> 04:31.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ever.

04:31.633 --> 04:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

others were wounded.

04:38.833 --> 04:43.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It also says that deaths and
injuries from Taliban suicide
bombings rose by 15 percent.

04:44.466 --> 04:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Taliban dismissed the
report as propaganda material.

04:48.033 --> 04:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The United Arab Emirates flatly
denied today that it hacked
into Qatar's state news agency

04:54.600 --> 04:58.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Web sites in May, and
planted false stories.

04:58.700 --> 05:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Four Arab countries severed
ties with Qatar after its emir
was falsely quoted as praising

05:05.266 --> 05:07.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hamas and Iran.

05:07.366 --> 05:12.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Washington Post reported
the hack, but, in London today,
the UAE's foreign minister

05:12.966 --> 05:15.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pushed back.

05:15.033 --> 05:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANWAR MOHAMMED QARQASH, UAE
Foreign Minister: Our embassy in
Washington has put these denials

05:20.666 --> 05:24.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in place, and I think this is
a crisis and There IS is a lot
of rumors And a lot of false

05:26.333 --> 05:27.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
news and stories.

05:27.700 --> 05:29.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this is going to die out.

05:29.466 --> 05:31.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It is not true.

05:31.500 --> 05:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The FBI
is working with Qatar to
investigate the incident.

two points, and the S&amp;P

Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the Republican health care
bill in limbo -- we break down

07:05.433 --> 07:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of the sticking points;
inside the Iraqi city of Mosul
liberated from ISIS, but left

07:10.800 --> 07:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in ruins; Ivanka Trump's record
on making fashion products
overseas; and much more.

Even as Senate Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell has moved to
delay a vote on a Republican

07:32.233 --> 07:36.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
health care plan, there's
no letup in the battle
behind the scenes.

07:36.933 --> 07:40.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Lawmakers, governors,
interest groups are
all working furiously.

07:40.766 --> 07:45.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A handful of key questions
may decide the bill's fate.

07:45.066 --> 07:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Among them, how many fewer
people would be covered?

07:48.300 --> 07:53.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And will cheaper insurance make
it more appealing or would it
be too skimpy for too many?

Avik Roy, let me start with you.

08:22.866 --> 08:26.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't have an analysis of
this Senate bill, this new
Senate bill by the Congressional

08:26.466 --> 08:30.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Budget Office, but there
was an analysis done by the
health care firm Avalere.

08:30.600 --> 08:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is forecasting that this bill
would lead to federal Medicaid
funding reductions ranging

08:36.733 --> 08:41.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from 29 to 37 percent
in all 50 states.

08:43.333 --> 08:45.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Doesn't that make it
understandable why even
Republicans are still
struggling to support

08:45.733 --> 08:47.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this bill?

08:47.733 --> 08:49.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AVIK ROY, Foundation for
Research on Equal Opportunity:
Well, Judy, there's a bit of

08:49.666 --> 08:53.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
misunderstanding as to exactly
what the source of those
changes to Medicaid are.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There are really two
major components.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is the first, which is the
repeal of Obamacare's expansion
of the Medicaid program,

09:01.466 --> 09:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is replaced by a robust
system of tax credits for those
individuals, those enrollees

09:05.300 --> 09:07.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to buy private coverage.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So that's about 85 to
95 percent of the money
that you're describing.

09:11.733 --> 09:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then there's a small component,
which is per capita reforms,
a Bill Clinton proposal from

09:16.466 --> 09:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
1994, to make the long-term
Medicaid program more
fiscally sustainable.

09:23.400 --> 09:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the piece that really
matters to those governors,
particularly in states that

09:25.433 --> 09:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
didn't expand Medicaid, because
that's going to be a pretty
gradual, but important reform

09:29.900 --> 09:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to make the Medicaid program
fiscally sustainable.

09:32.033 --> 09:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the first piece, the big
piece, replaced by tax credits
to afford coverage for those

09:36.433 --> 09:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
individuals, and the second
piece for the legacy program
a very gradual and sensible

09:40.566 --> 09:42.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and bipartisan approach
to Medicaid reform.

09:42.866 --> 09:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, just so that
I understand, you're saying that
these cuts are not as draconian

09:47.033 --> 09:48.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as they sound?

09:48.033 --> 09:49.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AVIK ROY: Exactly.

09:49.033 --> 09:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

09:50.033 --> 09:51.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Dr. Zeke Emanuel?

09:51.033 --> 09:53.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

09:53.100 --> 09:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EZEKIEL EMANUEL, Former White
House Special Adviser: I don't
know, when you cut $170 billion

09:55.100 --> 09:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out of a program over 10
years, and when the CBO says 15
million people are going to lose

10:00.866 --> 10:02.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Medicaid program.

10:02.366 --> 10:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And let's remember those
who 15 million people are.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're the working poor.

10:06.933 --> 10:10.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're able-bodied people
who are generally working --
two-thirds to three-quarters of

10:10.866 --> 10:12.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
them work at jobs.

10:12.366 --> 10:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's just their employers
don't provide insurance.

10:14.333 --> 10:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Avik says, well, we're going
to give them a subsidy.

10:16.700 --> 10:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Remember, the subsidies are
less than the subsidies that
the Obamacare proposal gives,

10:22.866 --> 10:26.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and they go to a much,
much smaller level.

10:26.733 --> 10:28.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The insurance they
cover is much less.

10:28.733 --> 10:31.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is not comparable.

10:31.100 --> 10:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can't cut $770
billion and say, oh,
it's not going to affect
anything; 22 million people

10:37.166 --> 10:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are going to lose coverage
because of this bill.

10:39.133 --> 10:41.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Avik Roy,
how do you answer that?

10:41.100 --> 10:45.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AVIK ROY: Yes, so the CBO
estimate, this 22 million number
that Zeke is talking about

10:45.966 --> 10:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is largely driven by erroneous
aspects of the Congressional
Budget Office's methodology.

10:50.433 --> 10:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The CBO believes that 15 million
people will drop out of the
insurance market in 2018 because

10:57.500 --> 11:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they will no longer face a fine
for not purchasing coverage, the
individual mandate that we all

11:02.166 --> 11:04.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hear so much about.

11:04.200 --> 11:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, ultimately, about 18
million of that 22 million is
driven by the lack of a fine

11:10.033 --> 11:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forcing people to have
coverage, so it's not
driven by a lack of funding.

11:11.733 --> 11:12.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's robust funding.

11:12.866 --> 11:13.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

11:13.866 --> 11:15.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

11:15.566 --> 11:16.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
EZEKIEL EMANUEL: If you
don't like the message,
attack the messenger.

11:16.233 --> 11:18.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

11:18.300 --> 11:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AVIK ROY: No, but this is
a fundamental problem with
the CBO's methodology.

11:20.366 --> 11:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's the reason why
Obamacare has an individual
mandate in the first place.

11:23.200 --> 11:27.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Obama in 2008, he
opposed having an individual
mandate in his bill.

11:27.166 --> 11:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was only included because
the CBO told him that 16 million
-- the coverage, the statistic

11:31.866 --> 11:34.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of coverage would
be affected by that.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
I don't want to spend
the whole time on the
CBO, the Congressional

11:36.333 --> 11:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Budget Office, but just
a quick response to that.

11:38.700 --> 11:40.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

11:40.733 --> 11:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EZEKIEL EMANUEL: Well, again,
I think he's attacking the
messenger because he doesn't

11:42.033 --> 11:43.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like the message.

11:43.600 --> 11:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the fact is that the CBO
is the independent arbiter.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Their methods aren't universal.

11:49.333 --> 11:52.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't get it
necessarily exactly right.

11:52.033 --> 11:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you're not going to go
from 22 million uninsured down
to a more tolerable number.

11:59.066 --> 12:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It seems unconscionable that
senators could vote to throw 22
million people off of insurance.

12:04.366 --> 12:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now we have the irony that
John McCain is delaying the
vote, a guy who needed surgery

12:09.266 --> 12:12.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that cost $30,000.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He certainly couldn't afford
it just out of nowhere.

12:14.966 --> 12:16.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Insurance has to pay.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And we're going to
get 22 million people
with less insurance.

12:18.733 --> 12:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Another aspect
of this, Avik Roy, is this --
in an effort to make insurance

12:25.333 --> 12:28.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
more affordable, what we
now see is a Senate bill
offering alternatives
that lower premiums,

12:30.433 --> 12:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but they do this by cutting
back on the amount of
coverage, on what is covered.

12:36.100 --> 12:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're creating -- the criticism
here is that you're creating
two markets, one for people

12:39.566 --> 12:44.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who can afford to continue to
get good medical care and those
who would be left out because

12:45.333 --> 12:46.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they can't.

12:46.566 --> 12:49.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How do you defend this
part of the legislation?

12:49.466 --> 12:54.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AVIK ROY: Well, Judy, I would
use -- I would challenge the
accuracy of the description

12:55.666 --> 12:57.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that you just gave
of the measure.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we're talking about
the Ted Cruz amendment to
the Senate health care bill.

12:59.900 --> 13:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what that amendment is
trying to do is say, OK, sick
people are going to have much

13:06.066 --> 13:08.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more expensive coverage because
they consume more health care.

13:08.700 --> 13:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, let's have direct taxpayer
subsidies in this regulated
market to ensure that they

13:13.300 --> 13:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
can find affordable coverage.

13:15.333 --> 13:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the fact, Judy, is that
tens of millions of Americans
who can't afford coverage can't

13:19.666 --> 13:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
afford that coverage not because
they're sick, but because
they're healthy and insurance

13:23.333 --> 13:25.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
costs too much.

13:25.366 --> 13:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Obamacare over the last
four years has doubled or
tripled their premiums.

13:28.400 --> 13:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HHS, Health and Human Services,
researchers have estimated
that premiums have increased

13:33.133 --> 13:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for that population by
at least 100 percent
over the last four years.

13:35.666 --> 13:39.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what Ted Cruz is
trying to do is say
let's make sure there's
coverage that is affordable

13:39.533 --> 13:42.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for healthy people, as
well as for sick people.

13:42.233 --> 13:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you do that by having a
market that really is focused on
covering people who are already

13:46.500 --> 13:50.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sick, which requires a
different kind of insurance,
and people who are
healthy and who need lower

13:50.966 --> 13:51.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
premiums as a result.

13:51.966 --> 13:53.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
EZEKIEL EMANUEL: Let's
make three quick points.

13:55.500 --> 14:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First of all, the subsidies that
the Republicans are going to
give are going to be much less

14:00.100 --> 14:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and smaller, driving up
what people have to pay, and
especially their deductible.

14:06.633 --> 14:10.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They don't do anything
about affordability
in this bill at all.

14:12.200 --> 14:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't change the
long-term trajectory of
health care costs one bit.

14:17.800 --> 14:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Second of all, the fact is
that every medical organization
has come out against this bill

14:22.533 --> 14:24.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and says it's going to
be bad for patients.

14:24.500 --> 14:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the health insurance
industry says that what Avik Roy
just said is basically false.

14:30.233 --> 14:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You will segment the market.

14:31.866 --> 14:34.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You're going to take
healthy people, you're
going to separate them.

14:34.300 --> 14:37.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You're going to put the
sick people in a market,
and then you're going
to reduce the subsidies

14:37.766 --> 14:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you give them to buy insurance,
because the insurance is pegged
at a much skimpier package.

14:44.666 --> 14:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is not a recipe for having
people have good insurance
and decreasing deductibles.

14:51.233 --> 14:52.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's actually going to do
the exact reverse of what
the president pledged.

14:52.966 --> 14:54.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do
you want to respond?

14:54.466 --> 14:56.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AVIK ROY: Absolutely.

14:56.466 --> 14:59.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I would challenge a number
of things that Zeke said
there, as you would expect.

14:59.666 --> 15:03.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The first is that the chief
actuary of the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services,

15:03.866 --> 15:08.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who is an Obama appointee,
published a report a
couple of weeks ago
where he said, in fact,

15:11.366 --> 15:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that this bill would bend
down the cost curve and
reduce overall national
health expenditures

15:14.333 --> 15:17.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by making the health care
system more responsive
and more efficient.

15:17.466 --> 15:22.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, actually, the tax credits
in the Senate health care bill
would expand to ensure that

15:24.466 --> 15:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those individuals who are sick,
who need robust coverage would
be able to afford the premiums

15:26.733 --> 15:28.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they have.

15:28.766 --> 15:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this bill will actually
provide hundreds of billions,
if not trillions of dollars over

15:31.933 --> 15:34.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the long term to ensure
that those people
can afford coverage.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EZEKIEL EMANUEL: It's funny.

15:37.300 --> 15:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're talking about giving
more money, when, in fact, the
bill is cutting back the money

15:39.500 --> 15:41.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's putting into the
health care system.

15:41.366 --> 15:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You can't have it both ways.

15:42.866 --> 15:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One final
to you, Dr. Zeke Emanuel.

15:46.033 --> 15:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many parts of the countries,
we know there are going to
be many counties where, under

15:48.633 --> 15:53.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the ACA, the Affordable
Care Act, there's
only one insurer left.

15:53.066 --> 15:54.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Prices have gone up.

15:54.600 --> 15:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A lot of people have been
priced out of the market.

15:56.133 --> 15:57.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

15:57.133 --> 15:59.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EZEKIEL EMANUEL: Absolutely.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And this is
completely aside from what the
Republicans are trying to do.

16:00.466 --> 16:03.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

16:03.066 --> 16:05.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EZEKIEL EMANUEL: Well,
it's not -- no, I would
disagree with there, Judy,
because the uncertainty

16:05.100 --> 16:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have created in the market,
the Republicans - - Marco Rubio
removed the risk corridors

16:09.500 --> 16:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the re-insurance proposal.

16:12.133 --> 16:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have also created
uncertainty about whether
they are going to pay the
cost-sharing subsidies.

16:14.633 --> 16:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those are subsidies to families
making less than $70,000
to pay their deductibles.

16:20.733 --> 16:22.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That actually
drives premiums up.

16:22.133 --> 16:24.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are simple solutions.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You put the risk corridors in.

16:26.266 --> 16:29.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You give -- you guarantee
you are going to pay the
cost-sharing subsidies.

16:29.266 --> 16:32.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And you give insurance
companies a tax break.

16:32.200 --> 16:36.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You refund them the tax from
the Affordable Care Act if
they go into counties that have

16:36.766 --> 16:38.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
one or fewer insurances.

16:38.766 --> 16:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That will actually stabilize
the insurance markets.

16:41.800 --> 16:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And states that run their
insurance exchanges,
like California and
Idaho, they actually are

16:45.800 --> 16:47.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
running pretty well.

16:47.266 --> 16:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the federal side
that's not running so well.

16:49.366 --> 16:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the federal side is run
by Mr. Trump's associates.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
we're going to have to leave it
there, big subject, much to talk

16:56.000 --> 16:57.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
about.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We are going to continue
to come back to it.

16:58.566 --> 17:00.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Zeke Emanuel, Avik
Roy, we thank you both.

17:00.933 --> 17:02.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

17:02.133 --> 17:06.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
EZEKIEL EMANUEL: Thank
you for having us.

17:07.666 --> 17:12.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AVIK ROY: Thanks, Judy.

17:14.766 --> 17:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One week
ago, Iraqi Prime Minister
Haider al-Abadi proclaimed
victory over ISIS

17:23.433 --> 17:25.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Mosul.

17:25.466 --> 17:28.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But reality on the
ground is different, as
the fight continues in
parts of the Old City

17:28.966 --> 17:31.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
against ISIS holdouts.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As special correspondent
Marcia Biggs and videographer
Alessandro Pavone report, the

17:37.033 --> 17:39.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
human toll of the fighting
is becoming apparent.

17:39.533 --> 17:41.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it is horrific.

17:41.566 --> 17:45.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A warning: Many viewers may
find images and accounts
in this story disturbing.

17:47.900 --> 17:51.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA BIGGS: This is
what so-called liberated
Mosul looks and sounds
like, in a small pocket

18:01.433 --> 18:06.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the Old City, the war
against ISIS seemingly ongoing.

18:06.066 --> 18:11.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is the Old City
from ground level, a scene
of utter devastation,
entire neighborhoods

18:14.700 --> 18:19.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
flattened by coalition
airstrikes, leaving
the few survivors to
search for the remains

18:20.433 --> 18:22.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of their loved ones.

18:22.466 --> 18:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bashar and Ali's families were
together in this house hit
by an airstrike 28 days ago.

18:28.566 --> 18:31.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ali names the dead one by one.

18:31.800 --> 18:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALI, Mosul Resident (through
translator): My mother, three
brothers, three sisters,

18:38.033 --> 18:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
my father, two
sisters-in-law, two nieces.

18:39.833 --> 18:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: And you're the
only one left from your family.

18:42.633 --> 18:44.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALI (through translator): Yes.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Shu Bedak Tamel,
what are you going to do now?

18:46.466 --> 18:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
What can I do?

18:48.900 --> 18:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just want to take the
bodies out and bury them.

18:51.333 --> 18:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Mosul is the
capital of Nineveh Province and
it is the men of Nineveh's civil

18:58.233 --> 19:01.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
defense unit that are
responsible for pulling
the dead out of the rubble.

19:03.333 --> 19:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They arrive with their crude
tools, an ancient jackhammer,
a broken sledgehammer, and when

19:09.800 --> 19:14.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all else fails, they
use their hands.

19:16.766 --> 19:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the family members is
adamant that the family is
under this spot in a washroom.

19:21.466 --> 19:25.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
"Just open the hole,"
this family member says.

19:25.533 --> 19:30.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But trying to drill through
over a foot of concrete proves
impossible and one of the

19:30.466 --> 19:33.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
relatives finds another
way into the house.

19:33.300 --> 19:36.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So we enter the
ruins in the dark.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So this was the washroom
they were talking about.

19:39.466 --> 19:44.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's saying there's
a baby inside.

19:45.600 --> 19:48.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In total, they are
looking for 18 bodies.

19:48.233 --> 19:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There were two families in the
adjoining houses that night.

19:51.633 --> 19:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bashar lost six members of
his family, including his
wife and four children.

19:56.600 --> 20:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BASHAR, Mosul Resident (through
translator): We tried to
escape the day before, but ISIS

20:02.200 --> 20:03.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
shot at us.

20:03.700 --> 20:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We ran back to the house and
the army told us, stay inside.

20:05.933 --> 20:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will evacuate you when
we make the area safe.

20:08.933 --> 20:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the next morning, the
airstrike hit our house.

20:11.333 --> 20:13.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There were two bombs.

20:13.033 --> 20:16.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARCIA BIGGS: Were you
in the house when the
explosion happened?

20:16.633 --> 20:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BASHAR (through translator):
Yes, but I was near the
front door of this house.

20:20.133 --> 20:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was the only one who
didn't get injured, along
with my neighbor's family.

20:23.933 --> 20:26.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And my youngest daughter
was rescued by the army.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She's still alive.

20:28.333 --> 20:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: The
remnants of life that
night are frozen in time.

20:34.333 --> 20:38.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Food sits uneaten on
the kitchen counter, but
the clock still runs.

20:39.366 --> 20:40.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hours pass, then
finally a breakthrough.

20:40.866 --> 20:42.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's a skull.

20:42.633 --> 20:46.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So they're telling me
they have no idea who
that little girl was.

20:46.200 --> 20:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were six or seven little
girls in that room, and the
body is so decomposed, all there

20:50.933 --> 20:53.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is, is a skull.

20:53.133 --> 20:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The search for remains
lasts all day, with
relatives waiting nervously.

20:59.266 --> 21:04.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
"God protect them,"
this one says.

21:05.566 --> 21:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They found four bodies
out of 18, 14 left to go.

21:08.666 --> 21:12.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The smell of death
is unbearable.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the members of Mosul's civil
defense, it's an ordinary day.

21:16.533 --> 21:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The day before, they pulled
19 bodies from the rubble.

21:19.800 --> 21:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rabih Mishaal Mohamed is a
sergeant with the unit, all of
whom are working without pay.

21:27.100 --> 21:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RABIH MISHAAL MOHAMED,
Sergeant (through translator):
The hardest part is when
you see a child under

21:29.633 --> 21:32.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the rubble because he is
innocent, he is a child.

21:32.833 --> 21:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has nothing to do with
the army or ISIS or anyone.

21:35.466 --> 21:37.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARCIA BIGGS: Why
do you do this?

21:37.500 --> 21:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RABIH MISHAAL MOHAMED (through
translator): It is very
difficult for us, but they are

21:40.466 --> 21:44.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like family, our brothers our
fathers, mothers, friends.

21:44.166 --> 21:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If we don't take their bodies
out, who will come and do that?

21:47.033 --> 21:48.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So we withstand it.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have to withstand it.

21:50.133 --> 21:53.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARCIA BIGGS: Withstand
it, they must.

21:53.466 --> 21:58.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a scene that will play
out again and again in the
days to come, a tiny sliver of

22:01.500 --> 22:06.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
comfort to the families,
who are clinging to what
little they can find.

22:08.433 --> 22:11.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Marcia Biggs in the
Old City, West Mosul, Iraq.

22:18.700 --> 22:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At the
White House, it is Made
in America Week, an effort
to highlight President

22:27.666 --> 22:32.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump's goal of boosting U.S.
manufacturing and job creation.

22:32.066 --> 22:37.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, it has again
sparked questions over
Mr. Trump and his family's
businesses, particularly

22:38.233 --> 22:40.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
where their products
are manufactured.

22:40.866 --> 22:42.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has the story.

22:42.866 --> 22:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, the White
House South Lawn was turned into
a showcase for products made

22:48.000 --> 22:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in each of the 50 states.

22:50.033 --> 22:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But not on display, merchandise
sold by the Trump Organization
or Ivanka Trump's fashion

22:54.833 --> 22:56.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
line.

22:56.100 --> 22:58.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Most of those things
are made overseas.

22:58.566 --> 23:03.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Here to talk about how
Ivanka Trump's clothing
is made is Matea Gold
of The Washington Post.

23:06.033 --> 23:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's part of a team of
reporters that investigated
the Ivanka Trump brand's
manufacturing practices.

23:09.666 --> 23:11.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Matea, thanks for joining us.

23:11.766 --> 23:16.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In your story, you said that
the Ivanka Trump fashion line
had retail sales of about $100

23:17.433 --> 23:19.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
million last year.

23:19.500 --> 23:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What does she make, and
where does she make them?

23:21.566 --> 23:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATEA GOLD, The Washington
Post: The Ivanka Trump brand,
which the first daughter still

23:25.333 --> 23:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
owns, but doesn't control
on a day-to-day management,
makes clothes, handmade shoes

23:32.100 --> 23:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in an array of overseas
factories, we found exclusively,
in foreign factories.

23:38.633 --> 23:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We traced her current line
of products to five specific
countries, Bangladesh, China,

23:43.633 --> 23:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
India, Indonesia, and Vietnam.

23:47.066 --> 23:51.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's also customs records
that show that, back in 2013,
some of her shoes were made

23:51.766 --> 23:53.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Ethiopia.

23:53.800 --> 23:58.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the brand told us that,
while they would like to bring
manufacturing back to the United

23:58.066 --> 24:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States, they don't feel like
it's really possible to do
in a large-scale fashion.

24:02.166 --> 24:04.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: And how
does this compare?

24:04.066 --> 24:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We should also note that
the Trump brand, the Trump
Organization brand products made

24:08.733 --> 24:12.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in about 12 different countries,
including Bangladesh and China.

24:12.266 --> 24:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How does this compare with
the rest of the industry?

24:15.133 --> 24:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: Well, the reality
is that the American apparel
industry is very firmly grounded

24:21.333 --> 24:23.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in globalization and
overseas production.

24:23.466 --> 24:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
About 97 percent of the clothes
and shoes sold here in the
United States are made abroad.

24:30.433 --> 24:34.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And industry experts say that
it is going to be incredibly
difficult to reverse that

24:34.266 --> 24:36.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
trend.

24:36.833 --> 24:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the focus in the
industry right now is not
on bringing manufacturing
back in a large-scale

24:42.166 --> 24:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fashion, but rather trying
to give consumers a sense of
confidence that their goods are

24:47.366 --> 24:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not being made by workers
overseas who are being
exploited for their labor.

24:49.733 --> 24:53.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: And how does
the Ivanka Trump fashion
line measure up to the
rest of the industry

24:53.933 --> 24:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that sort of thing in
policing labor conditions
at the factories they use?

25:01.066 --> 25:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: We found that the
Ivanka Trump brand lags behind
many in the apparel industry,

25:07.166 --> 25:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
both large and small
companies, when it comes
to having oversight of
their foreign production.

25:11.933 --> 25:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Up to now, they have really
relied on their suppliers to
certify that they are complying

25:17.400 --> 25:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with their code of conduct, a
code of conduct, I should note,
that they would not publicly

25:20.366 --> 25:22.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
disclose.

25:22.500 --> 25:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are taking measures now
to do greater oversight, the
kind of measures that other

25:28.366 --> 25:32.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
companies already have,
such as bringing in a
group to independently
audit factories and

25:34.266 --> 25:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to provide some programs on the
ground to support some of the
women who make their clothes.

25:39.233 --> 25:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And what did the
Trump people say to you?

25:42.233 --> 25:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Sean Spicer was asked
today about some of this in the
White House briefing, and said

25:45.366 --> 25:50.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it would be inappropriate for
him to talk about a private
business at the White House

25:50.366 --> 25:51.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
podium.

25:51.900 --> 25:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What did they tell you in
response to these things?

25:53.900 --> 25:57.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: Well, the president
of the Ivanka Trump brand,
Abigail Klem, told us that one

25:57.933 --> 26:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the reasons they had not
taken these other measures that
other companies have is because

26:02.000 --> 26:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're a newer and smaller
brand and that they're looking
now to really try to live

26:08.933 --> 26:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their mission of women who
work, which is the motto Ivanka
Trump developed at her company

26:13.233 --> 26:15.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
throughout their
whole supply chain.

26:15.266 --> 26:19.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is something that they
said is evolving and they're
going to continue to strive to

26:19.066 --> 26:21.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do.

26:21.200 --> 26:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Klem also told us that the
goal of bringing manufacturing
back to the United States for

26:24.033 --> 26:29.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
their company was just
unrealistic, that there
aren't trained workers
that work in the apparel

26:29.033 --> 26:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
industry here anymore, and,
in many cases, the machinery
doesn't even exist to do this

26:33.133 --> 26:35.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
kind of production.

26:35.233 --> 26:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Matea, let me ask you
about something else you have
been reporting on for The Post.

26:41.200 --> 26:44.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The financial -- the campaign
spending records of the Trump
2020 campaign shows that they

26:46.300 --> 26:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
paid money to -- they paid
fees to Donald Trump Jr.'s
lawyer before this latest story

26:51.833 --> 26:56.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
broke about the meeting with the
Russian lawyer, and also they
reimbursed the Trump corporation

26:57.700 --> 26:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for legal consulting fees.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's all this about?

27:01.566 --> 27:04.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: So, we don't have a
lot of answers from the campaign
committee, which has declined

27:04.966 --> 27:07.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to answer questions
about these payments.

27:07.166 --> 27:12.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But one thing we saw in the most
recent campaign finance filing
is that the legal fees paid

27:14.066 --> 27:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the campaign committee
skyrocketed in the last quarter,
including a $50,000 retainer

27:19.466 --> 27:23.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
paid to a criminal defense
attorney who is now
representing Donald Trump Jr.

27:23.766 --> 27:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This came in late June, before
President Trump himself said
he knew about this meeting in

27:30.633 --> 27:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which there were several
Russian or Russian-linked
people involved.

27:34.133 --> 27:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it does raise questions
about whether this payment
specifically was connected to

27:38.633 --> 27:40.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Russian probe.

27:40.666 --> 27:44.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there was also this
reimbursement to the
Trump corporation for
legal fees, which is

27:44.266 --> 27:49.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the first time we have
seen Trump's own company
being reimbursed for
those kinds of service.

27:49.066 --> 27:52.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What does the
Federal Election Commission
say about campaign funds being

27:52.933 --> 27:54.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
used for legal fees?

27:54.900 --> 27:58.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: The campaign
committees have a lot of leeway
to spend money on legal fees,

28:01.000 --> 28:04.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as long as the payments are
directly connected to activity
connected to the campaign.

28:06.066 --> 28:10.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So if the expenses wouldn't have
been incurred all but for the
campaign committee, they can

28:11.266 --> 28:13.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pay them.

28:13.333 --> 28:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if they were expenses that
aren't related to political
activity, they're beyond the

28:15.533 --> 28:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
purview of the committee.

28:17.533 --> 28:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fact that these payments
were made through the reelection
committee suggests that they

28:21.166 --> 28:26.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are connected to some sort of
legal investigation or legal
work connected to the campaign.

28:28.133 --> 28:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Matea Gold on legal
fees being paid for by the
campaign and Ivanka Trump's

28:30.433 --> 28:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
businesses, thank you very much.

28:32.933 --> 28:37.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATEA GOLD: Thank you.

28:40.466 --> 28:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On Capitol
Hill, Senate Republicans
continue their internal
fight over the health

28:46.900 --> 28:51.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
care bill, as polls show
strong disapproval of
the Republican plan.

28:54.300 --> 28:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And polling in the past
week indicates historically
low approval for the
president at this point

28:57.900 --> 28:59.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in his first term.

28:59.900 --> 29:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Multiple polls have Mr. Trump's
approval in the 30s or at 40,
and his disapproval rating

29:05.366 --> 29:07.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the 50s.

29:07.433 --> 29:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all that, it's time for
Politics Monday with Tamara
Keith of NPR and Amy Walter of

29:12.800 --> 29:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Cook Political Report.

29:14.233 --> 29:17.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, it's time to talk
about polls again.

29:17.266 --> 29:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't do this every week.

29:18.633 --> 29:20.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We save it for
special occasions.

29:20.500 --> 29:22.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

29:22.466 --> 29:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Amy,
seriously, there are a group of
new polls, three or four polls

29:25.000 --> 29:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out taken in the last week or
so, that do show some slippage
for the president in the

29:31.300 --> 29:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
last few months, particularly
among independents.

29:33.533 --> 29:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a Washington Post poll
that shows, what, a six-point
slippage just since April.

29:38.333 --> 29:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Right, just among --
in general among independents.

29:41.533 --> 29:42.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

29:42.533 --> 29:44.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

29:44.566 --> 29:48.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: When we
first started talking
about the president
after his inauguration,

29:48.166 --> 29:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we said this is a president
who is starting with the lowest
approval rating of any president

29:52.433 --> 29:54.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that's been inaugurated.

29:54.166 --> 29:56.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let's see where
he goes with this.

29:56.900 --> 30:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead of starting with a deep
reservoir of goodwill and a
honeymoon, which most presidents

30:00.366 --> 30:05.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
start with, he started with
a deep -- he didn't have
that reservoir of good will.

30:06.533 --> 30:08.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Was be going to able
to fill up that well?

30:08.600 --> 30:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the reality is, here we
are, six months later, he's
actually 14 points lower than

30:12.633 --> 30:14.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what he was.

30:14.100 --> 30:15.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's not filling it up.

30:15.100 --> 30:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's draining it even more.

30:16.533 --> 30:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And where it's draining
from, it's from independents.

30:19.400 --> 30:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's a danger point here,
not just for the president, but
really for members of Congress

30:23.933 --> 30:25.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who are up in 2018.

30:25.966 --> 30:29.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you're a Republican, you
know your base is still behind
you, Democrats have never

30:29.166 --> 30:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been with you, but independents,
those are the folks,
especially for members who sit

30:36.133 --> 30:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in sort of swing type districts,
those are the people that
they can't afford to be losing

30:40.833 --> 30:43.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by this percentage that
the president's losing by.

30:43.033 --> 30:47.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If he only has a 30, 31
percent approval rating
among independents, it
makes it very difficult

30:47.066 --> 30:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for Republicans up in 2018.

30:49.133 --> 30:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Tam, we
know the Trump folks already
have their campaign committee

30:53.066 --> 30:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
up and running for reelection.

30:55.200 --> 30:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do they look at all this?

30:57.300 --> 31:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: It's not clear what
the campaign is actually doing

31:00.200 --> 31:01.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in terms of moving
toward reelection.

31:01.966 --> 31:04.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's held some rallies.

31:04.266 --> 31:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump tweeted over
the weekend that he thought it
wasn't really that bad, that

31:08.200 --> 31:10.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this poll wasn't so bad.

31:10.500 --> 31:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, the best thing
the president could do to
improve his approval rating -- I

31:15.500 --> 31:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
guess there's probably two
things, one, maybe focus on some
of the people who didn't support

31:22.966 --> 31:25.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him in the beginning and
maybe try doing something,
anything that wouldn't
be seen as strictly

31:26.566 --> 31:28.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
partisan.

31:28.100 --> 31:32.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the other thing would be,
you know, like, start winning.

31:32.066 --> 31:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has -- you know, he
promised you are going
to be so sick of winning.

31:36.433 --> 31:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, you know, he hasn't
had the major legislative
accomplishments.

31:40.666 --> 31:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The health care bill has
gotten totally bogged down.

31:43.200 --> 31:46.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was supposed to be
done maybe by April.

31:46.066 --> 31:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's something that
his base really wanted.

31:48.933 --> 31:53.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But he just has not
done a lot of things.

31:55.966 --> 31:59.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He did the executive orders
that the base liked, but that
turned off the independents

32:00.666 --> 32:02.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and others.

32:02.733 --> 32:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we even --
you and I were just -- we were
just talking a moment ago,

32:06.433 --> 32:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Amy, about when you ask people
even about impeachment, 41
percent in a Monmouth poll

32:13.433 --> 32:15.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
support impeaching
the president.

32:15.500 --> 32:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you were just saying, for
Richard Nixon at this point,
it was much less than that.

32:18.800 --> 32:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: For Richard Nixon
going into the summary of 1973,
his overall approval rating

32:25.200 --> 32:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was basically where Donald
Trump's is right now.

32:27.733 --> 32:32.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The difference is the
intensity of the opposition
or the dislike of President
Nixon among partisans.

32:34.566 --> 32:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had 25 percent approval
rating among Democrats,
Nixon did, in July of 1973.

32:40.866 --> 32:44.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
President Trump has
about 8 percent approval
rating among Democrats.

32:44.066 --> 32:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the intensity of
opposition to the president
has always been an issue.

32:48.600 --> 32:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As Tam points out, he's
not getting the intensity
of support among his base.

32:51.900 --> 32:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he made that decision
when he came into office.

32:54.866 --> 32:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead of trying to grow that
base, he had a very narrow
base of support, very narrow

33:01.333 --> 33:04.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
support among all kinds of
voters, except for Republicans.

33:04.866 --> 33:09.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead of trying to grow it,
he's focused and doubled down
on the small group of people

33:10.733 --> 33:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who supported him all along.

33:12.833 --> 33:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Tam, you're
talking about ways where the
president could put some wins

33:15.733 --> 33:17.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the board.

33:17.233 --> 33:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Health care reform is one of the
issues he has been focused on.

33:20.700 --> 33:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This was another question in
the Washington Post/ABC poll.

33:27.200 --> 33:29.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And this can't be
considered good news
for the administration.

33:29.233 --> 33:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People were asked what
they think about Obamacare
vs. the Republican plan.

33:33.133 --> 33:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
By 2-1, they prefer Obamacare.

33:35.100 --> 33:38.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Which
is pretty remarkable.

33:38.666 --> 33:43.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obamacare has seen -- you know,
it's having better days than
it ever had when President

33:44.400 --> 33:45.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Obama was president.

33:45.866 --> 33:50.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, I was out in Kentucky
last week talking to voters.

33:51.533 --> 33:53.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Just a few little anecdotes.

33:53.500 --> 33:57.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One woman I talked to supported
President Trump, doesn't
like Obamacare, but is deeply

34:00.433 --> 34:04.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
concerned about the Republican
health care bill, in
particular the Medicaid cuts.

34:04.666 --> 34:08.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Another voter I talked
to basically said, why
the -- what's the rush?

34:08.533 --> 34:09.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why are they hurrying?

34:09.766 --> 34:11.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why don't they slow down
and do this together?

34:11.533 --> 34:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was also a Republican.

34:13.566 --> 34:16.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then one other Republican
I talked to said he didn't
really know what was in the

34:16.766 --> 34:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bill, but he was glad it got
rid of the individual mandate.

34:19.400 --> 34:20.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

34:20.666 --> 34:23.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: That's the
big problem right now.

34:23.233 --> 34:24.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There is nobody
selling this bill.

34:24.866 --> 34:26.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Right.

34:26.300 --> 34:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: We're talking
a lot about process.

34:28.366 --> 34:30.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're talking a lot about
members who are supporting
or not supporting it.

34:30.066 --> 34:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is nobody out there
really championing this bill.

34:32.266 --> 34:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even the president himself is
just sending out tweets saying,
I sure hope you guys vote

34:35.966 --> 34:37.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for it.

34:37.433 --> 34:38.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have been saying we're
going to vote for it.

34:38.266 --> 34:39.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's not going out.

34:39.266 --> 34:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's not holding rallies.

34:41.266 --> 34:44.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I looked at the amount of money
that's been spent since the
end of May on ads that talk

34:44.866 --> 34:49.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about this health care bill;
$6 million have been spent so
far in advertising; 5.8 million

34:49.866 --> 34:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of those dollars have been
spent on negative attacks on the
health care or urging senators

34:55.600 --> 34:57.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to vote against it.

34:57.666 --> 35:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, without a champion, it's
not surprising to me at all
that the health care bill that

35:00.666 --> 35:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans are putting forward
isn't particularly popular.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's probably
similar to the ratio of what
was spent against Obamacare

35:06.266 --> 35:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
when that was being debated.

35:08.333 --> 35:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, Tam, this is -- with
the vote now delayed, the
opponents are worried.

35:14.400 --> 35:18.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, the folks who don't want
this are saying it gives them
time to build up opposition,

35:19.533 --> 35:20.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more opposition.

35:20.533 --> 35:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Absolutely.

35:22.533 --> 35:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mitch McConnell didn't
want to take a lot of time
to let this bill stew.

35:25.833 --> 35:28.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He wanted to hurry
and get a vote on it.

35:28.100 --> 35:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's a reason for that,
because the longer it just
hangs out there, the longer

35:31.833 --> 35:36.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
people have to look at
the Congressional Budget
Office score, which is
not out just yet, but

35:36.500 --> 35:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the longer governors have
to put pressure on their
senators, the longer voters have

35:41.333 --> 35:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to call into their Senate
offices every single
day, the harder it gets
to make this happen.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's always
easier to fight something
than it is to support it.

35:50.400 --> 35:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, having said this, Amy,
your point about so much of
this has been done behind closed

35:54.266 --> 35:55.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
doors.

35:55.266 --> 35:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's right.

35:56.900 --> 35:59.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Well, and without --
again, without a real
champion supporting it.

35:59.966 --> 36:01.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But you're right.

36:01.233 --> 36:03.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This has not been
done with committees.

36:03.333 --> 36:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There hasn't been a whole lot of
public discussion or even within
Congress a whole lot of public

36:07.933 --> 36:09.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
debate about this.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Tam is right.

36:11.900 --> 36:14.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
McConnell wanted to get
this done, move on to
something like taxes.

36:14.633 --> 36:17.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I promise
we won't talk about polls
again for a whole year.

36:17.466 --> 36:18.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Fingers crossed.

36:18.466 --> 36:19.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

36:19.466 --> 36:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: I don't believe you.

36:20.666 --> 36:21.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

36:21.900 --> 36:23.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tam
and Amy, thank you.

36:23.933 --> 36:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

36:28.466 --> 36:33.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

36:33.000 --> 36:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As a candidate,
President Trump called for the
largest expansion of the Navy

36:40.066 --> 36:45.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since the Reagan administration,
but his latest budget proposal
contains more modest short-term

36:45.666 --> 36:47.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
increases.

36:47.633 --> 36:51.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still, it would boost business
in the U.S. shipbuilding
industry, which, despite serious

36:53.466 --> 36:57.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
safety violations in the
past decade, continues
to win billions of
dollars in contracts to

36:58.400 --> 37:01.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
build Navy and
Coast Guard vessels.

37:01.400 --> 37:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Aubrey Aden-Buie of Reveal, from
the Center for Investigative
Reporting, has the story.

37:06.366 --> 37:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN WILLIAMS, Injured in
Accident: I love you, baby doll.

37:08.466 --> 37:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WANDA WILLIAMS, Wife of John
Williams: I love you, too.

37:10.833 --> 37:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE:
Wanda Williams' life
changed forever when her
sister-in-law rushed to her

37:14.833 --> 37:16.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
house in 2014.

37:16.333 --> 37:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WANDA WILLIAMS: And she
got out of the car crying.

37:18.833 --> 37:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she said that John got hurt
and he was hurt really bad.

37:22.000 --> 37:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: Wanda's
husband, John, nearly died in an
accident at the shipyard where

37:26.700 --> 37:28.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he worked.

37:28.833 --> 37:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WANDA WILLIAMS: We would have
never thought that this would
have happened to him, because

37:35.100 --> 37:37.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this is things that he
did every single day.

37:37.766 --> 37:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He went to work as my husband,
and he came home as a child.

37:44.400 --> 37:48.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: Wanda
now takes care of her
husband 24 hours a day.

37:49.900 --> 37:54.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The accident happened three
years ago at a VT Halter
Mississippi shipyard.

37:54.300 --> 37:59.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A surveillance camera recorded
as Williams' crane lost balance
and suddenly tipped over.

38:00.566 --> 38:02.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
His co-worker, Willie
Horne, saw it happen.

38:02.633 --> 38:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIE HORNE, Co-Worker: The
boom pulled back and it just
bounced back all kind of ways.

38:07.500 --> 38:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he was just messed up.

38:09.533 --> 38:11.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
His head was crushed.

38:11.566 --> 38:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That stuff like that, it's
just something that you
just can't forget like that.

38:18.366 --> 38:23.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: The
accident crushed Williams'
skull and left him blind.

38:25.300 --> 38:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For months before the accident,
he had complained about the
crane's broken load sensor.

38:28.933 --> 38:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VT Halter re-installed the
sensor two days earlier, but the
Occupational Safety and Health

38:35.866 --> 38:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Administration, or OSHA,
later determined it
wasn't fully operational.

38:41.333 --> 38:44.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is a history of serious
accidents at VT Halter.

38:44.766 --> 38:49.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A few years earlier, two
workers were killed applying
paint thinner inside a tugboat.

38:49.766 --> 38:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this crawlspace, while
working with insufficient
ventilation and without
explosion-proof lights,

38:56.733 --> 39:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vapors built up over 600
times the legal limit,
igniting in a flash fire.

39:02.600 --> 39:04.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Joey Pettey barely
escaped the blast.

39:04.633 --> 39:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOEY PETTEY, Accident Survivor:
The explosion, when it happened,
it blew doors and hatches

39:09.033 --> 39:11.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and electrical panels,
boom, boom, boom.

39:11.600 --> 39:14.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
When that third one
hit, it blew it out.

39:14.600 --> 39:19.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: OSHA
investigated and called
that accident horrific
and preventable, and

39:20.466 --> 39:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fined the company over $800,000.

39:27.133 --> 39:30.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But a month following
the explosion, the Navy
awarded VT Halter the
contract to build this

39:31.300 --> 39:33.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ship, worth $87 million.

39:33.366 --> 39:38.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOEY PETTEY: The contracts
are pretty hefty amounts,
and the fines is really low.

39:40.266 --> 39:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It seems like a slap on the
wrist when you got that kind
of money rolling around.

39:42.933 --> 39:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: We repeatedly
reached out to VT Halter,
but they declined to comment

39:47.266 --> 39:49.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or to be interviewed.

39:49.266 --> 39:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're one of seven major
U.S. shipbuilders that contract
with the Navy and Coast Guard.

39:56.066 --> 39:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our review of federal contracts,
court records, and OSHA files
found that, since 2008, the

40:01.066 --> 40:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
federal government has awarded
more than $100 billion to these
companies, despite serious

40:06.966 --> 40:11.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
safety lapses that have
endangered and killed workers.

40:11.033 --> 40:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In neighboring Mobile, Alabama,
Austal USA is building some
of the country's newest naval

40:17.066 --> 40:19.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
vessels.

40:19.066 --> 40:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Huge aluminum modules are
assembled into warships on
the banks of the Mobile River.

40:27.000 --> 40:32.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But dozens of its workers have
been injured by a power tool
used to cut through metal.

40:33.433 --> 40:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Their own top safety manager
dubbed it the widow maker.

40:36.066 --> 40:40.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARTIN OSBORN, Injured
in Accident: The day
of my accident, I was
using the miller, as

40:40.166 --> 40:41.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it is called at Austal.

40:41.633 --> 40:44.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: Martin
Osborn is a welder at Austal.

40:44.266 --> 40:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN OSBORN: I was up in a
boom lift, as we call it, or a
man lift, up in the air about

40:51.266 --> 40:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
40 feet, cutting a lifting
lug off the side of a module,
and had a violent kickback.

40:56.966 --> 41:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It kicked out of my hands
and went across my left
hand, cutting me pretty bad.

41:03.900 --> 41:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I didn't take my glove off,
because, I knew if I did that,
I would have blood everywhere.

41:09.500 --> 41:12.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: Before
Osborn's accident, Austal
modified the Metabo
grinder by replacing

41:13.933 --> 41:17.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the standard disc with
a sawtooth blade made
by an outside company.

41:17.333 --> 41:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This made the tool more
versatile, able to cut
through aluminum more quickly.

41:21.800 --> 41:26.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the manufacturer of
the grinder specifically
warned against using
these blades, saying

41:28.133 --> 41:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they cause frequent kickback
and loss of control.

41:30.333 --> 41:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN OSBORN: I have seen
pictures of people getting cut
in their face, in their necks,

41:35.933 --> 41:37.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in their thighs.

41:37.466 --> 41:39.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the most dangerous tool
I have ever put in my hands.

41:39.533 --> 41:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: Does
Austal know that the tool
is as dangerous as it is?

41:42.566 --> 41:45.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARTIN OSBORN: Yes,
ma'am, they do.

41:45.100 --> 41:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: Company
e-mails among Austal's
managers obtained by
Reveal show that, even

41:48.333 --> 41:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
before Osborn's accident, they
called the modification lethal,
and the grinders an accident

41:54.400 --> 41:56.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
waiting to happen.

41:56.400 --> 42:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yet, according to Osborn,
Austal workers still
use the grinder daily.

42:00.466 --> 42:04.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARTIN OSBORN: I have
had numerous supervisors
tell me that, you
know, if you don't want

42:04.766 --> 42:07.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to use the tool, go get
a job at Burger King.

42:07.200 --> 42:11.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: Despite
repeated requests,
Austal declined to
comment for this story.

42:13.766 --> 42:17.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The company has received
more than $6 billion in
Navy contracts since 2008.

42:19.300 --> 42:22.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when OSHA concluded the saw
exposed workers to amputations,
severe lacerations, and other

42:24.366 --> 42:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
injuries, they fined the
shipyard just over $4,000.

42:28.766 --> 42:33.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Austal's own records show at
least 50 workers were injured
by the tool in four years.

42:33.100 --> 42:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRIAN DUNCAN, Attorney:
Why would any manufacturer
or any company continue
to use a tool after

42:39.466 --> 42:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dozens and dozens of
people have been injured?

42:41.433 --> 42:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: Attorney
Brian Duncan is representing
Osborn, along with eight others,

42:45.533 --> 42:49.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in a lawsuit which he
hopes will bring more
than just compensation.

42:49.200 --> 42:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRIAN DUNCAN: I hope, when there
are companies out there that
have intentionally, knowingly

42:53.933 --> 42:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
violated safety standards, that
somebody will come in, in that
scenario and will hold those

43:00.500 --> 43:02.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people accountable.

43:02.433 --> 43:06.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: David
Michaels, the head of OSHA under
former President Obama, was

43:06.033 --> 43:09.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
until recently in charge of
enforcing workplace safety laws.

43:09.966 --> 43:14.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He acknowledges that
OSHA's maximum penalties
are insufficient,
capped by federal law.

43:16.933 --> 43:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID MICHAELS, Former OSHA
Director: They're tiny compared
to the contracts that many of

43:18.866 --> 43:21.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
these companies get
from the government and
from the private sector.

43:21.766 --> 43:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: He says
that the real power the
government holds is in
awarding the contracts

43:26.600 --> 43:28.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
themselves.

43:28.566 --> 43:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID MICHAELS: The biggest
fine is a million dollars,
two million dollars.

43:30.533 --> 43:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is petty cash for these
companies that get $100 million,
$200 million, $300 million

43:37.933 --> 43:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contracts from the Defense
Department to build
ships that are protecting
the United States.

43:42.200 --> 43:44.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We need to be protecting
our workers as much as
protecting our shores.

43:44.233 --> 43:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW PAXTON, President,
Shipbuilders Council of America:
I know Navy puts a high priority

43:46.633 --> 43:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on safety, as do our shipyards
that are building those ships.

43:50.066 --> 43:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: President
of the Shipbuilders
Council of America,
Matthew Paxton, says the

43:54.400 --> 43:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government does consider safety
records when awarding contracts.

43:57.700 --> 44:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW PAXTON: I think they
take that into a whole lot of
considerations that they have

44:03.800 --> 44:05.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to figure out on
their contracting end.

44:05.300 --> 44:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there's many requirements
that go into that beyond safety.

44:08.466 --> 44:10.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But safety's in there.

44:10.566 --> 44:13.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: Yet,
the Navy's history of
awarding contracts to
companies with repeated

44:13.933 --> 44:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
violations suggests that
it places little emphasis
on safety records.

44:20.833 --> 44:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NAVSEA, the Naval command
responsible for shipbuilding
contracts, declined an on-camera

44:26.233 --> 44:29.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interview, but a spokesperson
said in an e-mail that
it's up to OSHA, not
the Navy, to enforce

44:30.200 --> 44:32.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
federal safety laws.

44:32.366 --> 44:36.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They added: "We are not
the overlords of private
shipyards when it comes
to workplace safety."

44:38.066 --> 44:40.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID MICHAELS: The
Navy has the power.

44:40.066 --> 44:44.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They can easily say, if
workers are hurt, if you don't
follow the basic commonsense

44:45.400 --> 44:48.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
safety rules, you don't
get any more contracts.

44:48.166 --> 44:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That would have a huge impact.

44:50.233 --> 44:54.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: Former
President Obama signed
an executive order
that required companies

44:54.500 --> 44:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to disclose three years of
safety violations when vying
for large federal contracts.

45:00.766 --> 45:03.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But a federal court
blocked that order.

45:03.400 --> 45:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, this spring, Congress
drafted a resolution to
overturn it altogether.

45:08.133 --> 45:10.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

45:10.033 --> 45:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader: The regulations
aren't issued in a vacuum.

45:12.400 --> 45:17.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They have real economic
consequences that can
harm the middle class.

45:19.366 --> 45:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They can kill jobs, raise
prices, depress wages
and lower opportunities.

45:24.700 --> 45:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: President
Trump signed the resolution into
law, meaning companies don't

45:28.333 --> 45:33.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
have to disclose their
safety records when
competing for contracts.

45:35.300 --> 45:38.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That same month, Senator
Elizabeth Warren asked
the Justice Department
to open a criminal

45:39.566 --> 45:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
investigation into VT Halter.

45:40.733 --> 45:42.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

45:42.800 --> 45:45.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH WARREN (D),
Massachusetts: We want
to get to the bottom
of why people have died

45:45.366 --> 45:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and what kind of responsibility
the company itself has.

45:49.133 --> 45:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: Warren wants
the Navy to scrutinize safety
records when granting contracts

45:53.933 --> 45:54.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to all shipbuilders.

45:54.933 --> 45:56.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

45:56.966 --> 45:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZABETH WARREN: And in the
same way that they look at
how much is it going to cost,

45:59.533 --> 46:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they also need to look
at whether or not this is
a contractor who injures
and kills employees.

46:06.533 --> 46:10.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: At Austal's
shipyard, Martin Osborn still
frequently uses a sawtooth blade

46:13.100 --> 46:15.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
like the one that
cost him his finger.

46:15.633 --> 46:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says nothing will change
unless shipyards are made to
pay a price for putting workers

46:21.433 --> 46:23.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at risk.

46:23.466 --> 46:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN OSBORN: We're not
worried about if you get cut
or the next guy gets cut.

46:26.533 --> 46:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We just put another guy in your
place and move on down the road.

46:29.033 --> 46:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUBREY ADEN-BUIE: For the
"PBS NewsHour," I'm Aubrey
Aden-Buie in Mobile, Alabama.

46:39.833 --> 46:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally,
remembering filmmaker
George Romero, the master
of the zombie movie

46:54.733 --> 46:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a man whose influence
in the business went further
than many moviegoers realize.

47:00.666 --> 47:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our look.

47:02.700 --> 47:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: Medical examination of
victims bodies show conclusively
that the killers are eating

47:10.800 --> 47:12.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the flesh of the
people they kill.

47:12.866 --> 47:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: With a $100,000
in 1968, George Romero brought
the undead back to life in

47:16.133 --> 47:18.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
American culture.

47:18.233 --> 47:22.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
His "Night of the Living
Dead" became a cult
classic, and launched a
modern zombie industry

47:24.533 --> 47:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of soulless ghouls with
a taste for human flesh
popping up everywhere today.

47:29.833 --> 47:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For Romero, his films were
about more than just blood
and graphic violence.

47:32.233 --> 47:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEORGE ROMERO, Director:
This series of films have
been sort of my platform.

47:35.933 --> 47:39.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's ripe for metaphor.

47:39.333 --> 47:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the zombies, to me, have
always represented the people
that are just unwilling to stand

47:47.866 --> 47:49.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

47:49.333 --> 47:52.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, you know, there are a
lot of living dead in America.

47:52.266 --> 47:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Night of the
Living Dead," starring an
African-American actor, was seen

47:57.233 --> 48:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as a kind of social
commentary on racism and the
paranoid mood of its time.

48:04.266 --> 48:07.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A decade later, Romero's
first sequel, "Dawn of
the Dead," played on
the excesses of American

48:09.433 --> 48:11.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
consumerism.

48:11.400 --> 48:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Roger Ebert dubbed it one of
the best horror films ever
made, savagely merciless in its

48:16.100 --> 48:19.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
satiric view.

48:19.133 --> 48:23.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Romero followed up with many
other films, including four
more in the "Dead" series,

48:23.900 --> 48:26.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with varying degrees
of box office success.

48:26.400 --> 48:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the zombie world he
unleashed took on a massive
multibillion-dollar life of its

48:33.433 --> 48:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
own in blockbuster films like
"World War Z," video games,
and AMC's "The Walking Dead."

48:39.300 --> 48:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That, in turn, led Romero
to sour a bit on the genre
he helped popularize.

48:45.033 --> 48:47.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He spoke on NPR in 2014.

48:47.133 --> 48:50.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEORGE ROMERO: It's, all of
a sudden, you can't make a
little zombie film anymore.

48:50.833 --> 48:53.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Has to be special
effects and big budget.

48:53.200 --> 48:55.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I'm not -- I'm just
not interested in that.

48:55.600 --> 48:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Later in life,
he shifted to different media,
including teaming up with

48:59.733 --> 49:02.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Marvel to publish a
comic book series.

49:02.400 --> 49:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
George Romero died Sunday
in Toronto from lung cancer.

49:06.233 --> 49:10.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He was 77 years old.

49:10.933 --> 49:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for more on George Romero
and his impact, I'm joined by
Justin Chang, film critic for

49:15.733 --> 49:17.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The Los Angeles Times.

49:17.200 --> 49:18.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you, Justin.

49:18.833 --> 49:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Zombies, who would have thought?

49:20.966 --> 49:24.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What explains the impact
of those early films?

49:24.133 --> 49:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUSTIN CHANG, The Los Angeles
Times: Well, I think when you
have a film like "Night of

49:27.933 --> 49:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Living Dead," which is, I
think, one of the great debut
films that any director in

49:34.966 --> 49:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or outside the horror genre
has ever given us, you have to
look at the context, you know,

49:40.566 --> 49:43.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vietnam, Martin Luther
King Jr.'s assassination,
the recent assassinations
of the Kennedy brothers.

49:44.800 --> 49:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was a time of, obviously,
great social unrest.

49:46.933 --> 49:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And George Romero found,
unwittingly or not, a perfect
metaphor for that unrest.

49:53.800 --> 49:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it was about the
primitiveness of the filmmaking,
the very raw technique.

50:00.966 --> 50:04.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was shot on a $114,000
budget, which is about
$800,000 today, still
a very small budget.

50:06.066 --> 50:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he achieved this kind
of -- a film that was almost
like a documentary nightmare.

50:12.866 --> 50:16.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it really captured,
I think, a sense of rage
and of pointlessness,
a kind of senseless,

50:18.500 --> 50:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
arbitrary killing that
was really unsettling for
audiences at the time,
and is still enormously

50:23.433 --> 50:25.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
unsettling today.

50:25.433 --> 50:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: His films, of
course, largely done on the
cheap, but somehow a cult thing

50:29.100 --> 50:32.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
grew into a very large
cultural phenomenon.

50:32.666 --> 50:37.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wasn't so crazy -- as
we heard, he wasn't so
crazy about what followed?

50:37.166 --> 50:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUSTIN CHANG: Absolutely.

50:39.133 --> 50:43.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, we live in a culture
where zombies are proliferating
on screens, whether it's

50:45.400 --> 50:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"World War Z" or "The Walking
Dead," which is still hugely
popular, or the remake of

50:50.900 --> 50:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Dawn of the Dead" about 13
years ago, and terrific spoofs
like "Shaun of the Dead,"

50:54.566 --> 50:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which I think is one of the
few that George Romero has
professed to actually liking.

50:58.766 --> 51:03.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, in a way, he was, I think,
understandably disenchanted with
the way that Hollywood really

51:07.000 --> 51:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mainstreamed the zombie film and
the zombie TV show, and in some
ways took out that edginess,

51:14.566 --> 51:18.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that political subtext that he
was so good at putting in there.

51:18.233 --> 51:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think he especially
resented things like
"The Walking Dead,"
because it made it

51:22.533 --> 51:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very difficult for him to get
his own zombie movies financed
on an independent level.

51:29.500 --> 51:33.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he was a consummate
independent filmmaker,
and something of a
Hollywood outsider and

51:34.866 --> 51:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
skeptic, I think, all his
career, which makes his success
all the more remarkable.

51:37.933 --> 51:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For a lot of
people, this stuff goes way too
far, right, the graphic violence

51:45.033 --> 51:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's part of our society
and that's really part of
our entertainment culture.

51:48.200 --> 51:51.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Did he help create that,
for better or for worse?

51:51.633 --> 51:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUSTIN CHANG: I don't think
it's entirely fair to lay that
as George Romero's doorstep.

51:55.500 --> 52:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I say that as someone who's
on the more squeamish side of
the spectrum as far as horror

52:01.266 --> 52:03.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
movie viewers goes.

52:03.300 --> 52:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think you have to look
at his films, a film like
"Dawn of the Dead," which is,

52:06.133 --> 52:08.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think, as great a
masterpiece as "Night
of the Living Dead" is.

52:08.966 --> 52:11.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is always something more
going on beneath the violence.

52:11.400 --> 52:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you're just there
for the splatter and the
viscera, you will get that.

52:15.400 --> 52:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he gives you -- he's
always asking you to look a
little closer, see what's going

52:19.800 --> 52:23.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on, see who these zombies
represent, see who the
real monsters are in a way.

52:23.500 --> 52:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I don't think
it's entirely fair to
say that he's responsible
for the fetishization

52:29.633 --> 52:31.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and exploitation of
violence in our culture.

52:31.700 --> 52:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's using it -- I mean, he's
exploiting violence in his own
way, to very brilliant and very

52:35.900 --> 52:37.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
provocative ends.

52:37.933 --> 52:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Just briefly, I
do want to mention the passing
of another movie figure,

52:40.833 --> 52:43.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the actor Martin Landau.

52:43.366 --> 52:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was known early on, on
television, in "Mission:
Impossible," later in
films, including "Ed

52:48.900 --> 52:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Wood," for which he won an
Oscar for best supporting actor.

52:51.033 --> 52:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's take a look at a short
scene from Woody Allen's 1989
film "Crimes and Misdemeanors."

52:57.533 --> 52:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARTIN LANDAU, Actor: This
is what you plan on doing.

52:59.600 --> 53:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're going to hold on
to me with threats, right,
stupid threats and slander?

53:02.800 --> 53:04.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is your idea
of love, right?

53:04.033 --> 53:05.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ACTRESS: I will
not be tossed out.

53:05.333 --> 53:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I want to speak to Miriam.

53:06.500 --> 53:08.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARTIN LANDAU: Think.

53:08.166 --> 53:11.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For Christ's sake, think
what the hell you are
doing to me, will you?

53:11.433 --> 53:12.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Please.

53:12.933 --> 53:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Justin Chang, a
brief thought on Martin Landau?

53:15.033 --> 53:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUSTIN CHANG: Martin Landau
was such a wonderful actor.

53:18.633 --> 53:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that scene you play sort of,
I think, captures his elegance
and gravitas, his ability

53:24.733 --> 53:28.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to play a silken villain
that we feel for.

53:28.433 --> 53:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In that film, he's an adulterous
husband who contemplates
the murder of his lover.

53:35.333 --> 53:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's -- you know, I'm
reminded, too, of his great
performance many decades earlier

53:41.833 --> 53:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Alfred Hitchcock's "North
By Northwest," where he took
the role of a villain's number

53:44.900 --> 53:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two and made it something
really memorable and really
incisive out of that.

53:51.900 --> 53:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it's not that he could
only play villains, certainly
not, but he had, I think, a real

53:55.533 --> 54:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talent for playing morally
ambiguous characters,
and doing it superbly.

54:00.133 --> 54:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
Justin Chang of The Los Angeles
Times, thank you very much.

54:03.500 --> 54:04.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUSTIN CHANG: Thank you.

54:04.733 --> 54:06.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
we thank you, Jeff.

54:06.433 --> 54:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I was covering my eyes
until we got to Martin Landau.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's
the "NewsHour" for tonight.

54:11.333 --> 54:12.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:12.800 --> 54:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again
right here tomorrow evening.

54:15.200 --> 54:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank you,
and we will see you soon.
