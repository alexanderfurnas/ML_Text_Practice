and in fact will
only make the problem

worse if we recognize
this as a jihadist

have to recognize

that we have to succeed
in being able to

sophisticated about what

Qatar and Saudi Arabia

10:26.833 --> 10:29.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

ever gotten to a point
where they're not

10:31.900 --> 10:34.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
only closing embassies
they're sealing

smaller than the

it's completely

10:53.033 --> 10:55.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of its food supplies
come from Saudi

dramatic unprecedented

10:59.400 --> 11:02.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
escalation it comes
at a time where we

are told that both
the Saudis and the

enough there is almost

camps where Qatar

11:22.333 --> 11:27.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

the Saudi and the

11:31.033 --> 11:33.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

Egyptian camp and this

11:33.666 --> 11:35.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is where things are
going from here so

11:35.800 --> 11:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
among other things we're here

11:37.133 --> 11:38.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that these five
countries are saying

11:38.800 --> 11:42.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Qatar is two
extremists that it that

11:42.366 --> 11:44.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's been sponsoring
terrorism the

11:44.933 --> 11:46.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Qataris are say that
say that's not true

11:46.866 --> 11:50.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what's what's really
going on well it's

11:50.433 --> 11:53.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
again this different
alignment and the

11:53.400 --> 11:56.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Regent post Arab
Spring post 2011 Qatar

11:56.533 --> 12:00.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is seen today as a
host of leaders from

12:00.733 --> 12:05.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hamas from Taliban
actually just tonight

12:05.333 --> 12:07.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Qatari I mean
will Emir will be

12:07.433 --> 12:11.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hosting Shakur dahui
who's a well-known

12:11.400 --> 12:15.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
extremists in the
region for an iftar so

12:15.133 --> 12:20.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Islamic Islamic
cleric so in that

12:20.000 --> 12:23.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sense Qatar is seen
as very close has

12:23.166 --> 12:26.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
box itself in with
these Islamist

12:26.300 --> 12:28.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
movements and this
has been a problem

12:28.466 --> 12:31.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with its relations
with Egypt with with

12:31.900 --> 12:35.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Saudi Arabia and with
Emiratis and what

12:35.200 --> 12:38.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we're seeing unfold
as a clash is a rift

12:38.200 --> 12:41.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
within the GCC on
the direction forward

12:41.766 --> 12:43.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whether it's in
counterterrorism or

12:43.933 --> 12:45.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
other but we know
that some of these

12:45.833 --> 12:47.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
countries that are
accusing Qatar have

12:47.800 --> 12:51.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
themselves at times
supported some of

12:51.733 --> 12:55.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the extremist opposition
forces in Syria

12:55.733 --> 12:59.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for example so is it
so clear that Qatar

12:59.433 --> 13:01.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is doing something
different from what

13:01.433 --> 13:04.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
these other countries
have been it's a I

13:04.366 --> 13:06.733 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
think Syria is a
very complicated

13:06.733 --> 13:08.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
battleground but if
you look at Syria

13:08.966 --> 13:12.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
itself the main group
that is affiliated

13:12.100 --> 13:15.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with al-qaeda formerly
known as jabhat

13:15.833 --> 13:20.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
al-nusra is supported
by Qatar it's the

13:20.633 --> 13:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
head of the group Jelani gives

13:23.300 --> 13:26.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
interviews on an Al
Jazeera there's a

13:26.233 --> 13:29.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Financial Times story
today that Qatar

13:29.100 --> 13:32.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
might have indirectly
paid a ransom of 1

13:32.200 --> 13:35.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
billion dollar that
went to extremists

13:35.400 --> 13:39.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on both sides in in
Syria so this has

13:39.133 --> 13:43.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
become problematic
within the GCC and I

13:43.700 --> 13:46.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think they do feel
bolstered after the

13:46.200 --> 13:48.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trump visit to do
more on that front the

13:48.666 --> 13:50.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
countries that are
because it's true

13:50.266 --> 13:51.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that this is half

13:51.500 --> 13:52.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in just a week or
two after President

13:52.733 --> 13:55.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trump was there in
Saudi Arabia but

13:55.066 --> 13:57.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
listen let's quickly
talk about Joyce

13:57.733 --> 14:00.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about how this
affects the region and

14:00.266 --> 14:02.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
relations with the
u.s. going forward I

14:02.133 --> 14:04.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mean this is a very
tense time in the

14:04.300 --> 14:07.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
region this is an
almost Arab cold war

14:07.033 --> 14:10.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
happening within
the Gulf Cooperation

14:10.133 --> 14:13.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Council I think
the u.s. tried to

14:13.266 --> 14:16.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
distance itself today
a bit the Pentagon

14:16.566 --> 14:18.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reiterated its
defense relations with

14:18.700 --> 14:21.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Qatar that I did air
base continues to

14:21.600 --> 14:24.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be active that the
counter Isis effort

14:24.766 --> 14:28.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will not be impacted
by this as we speak

14:28.400 --> 14:30.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
also Judy I think
the Kuwaitis are

14:30.566 --> 14:33.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
trying to mediate
to find a common

14:33.533 --> 14:36.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ground in the coming
hours the Emir of

14:36.633 --> 14:39.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Kuwait will be heading
to Saudi Arabia

14:39.100 --> 14:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tomorrow if they can achieve a

14:43.000 --> 14:45.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
breakthrough you know
given the list of

14:45.966 --> 14:48.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
demands that Saudi
and UAE have put

14:48.000 --> 14:50.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
together that means
maybe the citizens

14:50.933 --> 14:53.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Qatar will not be
expelled from these

14:53.933 --> 14:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
countries unfair to ask you this

14:55.500 --> 14:57.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
question and ask for
a quick answer but

14:57.433 --> 14:59.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is there fear this
could lead to all-out

14:59.533 --> 15:03.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
war I don't think any
side at this point

15:03.500 --> 15:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is interested in a military

15:05.033 --> 15:08.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
confrontation and
I think Qatar given

15:08.100 --> 15:11.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that it's a small
country and most of

15:11.366 --> 15:15.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Qatar strategic depth
is within the Gulf

15:15.333 --> 15:17.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
region I don't
think Qatar has an

15:17.766 --> 15:22.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
alternative but to
fix this with with

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
its neighbours a Saudi
official tells me

15:28.133 --> 15:29.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that you know the
only way this is there

15:29.833 --> 15:34.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would be an exit is
if Qatar went away

15:36.000 --> 15:40.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and you know forgot
its old habits so

15:40.133 --> 15:41.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we're looking
they're looking at a

15:41.433 --> 15:44.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
change of behavior
from Qatar not just

15:44.366 --> 15:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
demands as it happened in 2014

15:46.966 --> 15:50.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jois Kurama tough
subject thank you very

on an almost daily
basis for the last

two months to demand

who have been taking
to the streets

17:36.266 --> 17:38.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
since early April protesting the

17:38.566 --> 17:40.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
government and its
handling of this

country is deepening
crisis but now that

17:42.700 --> 17:44.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
President Maduro is
pushing ahead with

17:44.900 --> 17:47.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his controversial
plan to convene a

citizen's assembly
and write up a new

constitution opposition
protesters say

17:52.433 --> 17:54.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that a new constitution
will consolidate

17:54.233 --> 17:57.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
government power and
severely shrink the

17:57.066 --> 17:59.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
political space for
the opposition he's

17:59.566 --> 18:01.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
demo we need a solution
to problems that

18:01.666 --> 18:03.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Venezuelans confront
every day like

18:03.866 --> 18:07.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
shortages in security
the streets had

18:07.733 --> 18:11.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
turned violent since
early April over 60

18:11.166 --> 18:13.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people have been
killed and a thousand

18:13.166 --> 18:15.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
injured as a result
of protests related

18:15.533 --> 18:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
violence most protesters marched

18:19.000 --> 18:21.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
peacefully but a
violent minority has

18:21.466 --> 18:23.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

government to detain
people and the

18:42.566 --> 18:46.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
benefit is intimidating
this specific

18:46.133 --> 18:50.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
group of society why
not to demonstrate

18:50.033 --> 18:52.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not to say things
against the government

18:52.666 --> 18:56.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but even intimidation
tactics can't seem

18:56.000 --> 18:57.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to quell the
discontent of so many

sending the economy

would you think
around you there are

19:27.766 --> 19:29.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lots of changes two
years ago we could

19:29.900 --> 19:32.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
make three to four
daily runs today only

19:32.333 --> 19:34.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

have peers who can't

19:43.666 --> 19:45.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pay their tuition
it's more important to

19:45.933 --> 19:49.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
eat in your situation
than to study as

been as well as

the political and

20:05.566 --> 20:08.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
economic conditions
have changed but the

20:08.933 --> 20:10.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
problem is that this
revolution which

20:10.733 --> 20:13.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
right now holds a
minority is trying to

20:13.900 --> 20:17.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
run the country as
if they continue to

20:17.033 --> 20:20.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hold a majority and
as if they still had

20:20.400 --> 20:23.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this hegemonic
sort of impulse of

20:23.633 --> 20:26.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
controlling society
and controlling

institutions opponents
have protested

will favor only his

resident of a caracas
barrio says it is

20:54.766 --> 20:57.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
yet another political
distraction lucky

20:57.433 --> 20:59.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
5th avenue hospital
and you see a lot of

20:59.933 --> 21:02.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
problems here and we
know that this man

21:02.133 --> 21:04.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is inventing fictions
instead of looking

21:04.333 --> 21:06.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for solutions he's
looking to entrench

himself in power we
don't want this what

21:09.200 --> 21:12.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we want are solutions
in my family five

21:12.100 --> 21:14.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people have left
the country fleeing

21:14.333 --> 21:17.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what there's crime
you don't know when

21:17.166 --> 21:19.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you leave when you'll
come back I spent

21:19.466 --> 21:21.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
18 hours to buy
four pounds of corn

21:21.833 --> 21:25.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
flour eighteen hours
that's not human

21:25.233 --> 21:28.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it isn't but she
has a roof over her

21:28.133 --> 21:30.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
head which is more
than this group of

21:30.033 --> 21:32.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people who find
themselves living on the

21:32.200 --> 21:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
streets scavenging for food

21:34.033 --> 21:37.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
amidst the garbage
it's a desperate but

21:37.266 --> 21:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
organized activity they know the

21:39.433 --> 21:41.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
schedule of the
garbage truck and wait

21:41.533 --> 21:43.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at restaurants exactly
when the garbage

21:43.733 --> 21:46.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is taken out carry
the bags over to the

21:46.233 --> 21:49.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Riverside and comb
through it Pedro who

21:49.833 --> 21:51.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
didn't want to be
identified by his full

21:51.900 --> 21:54.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
name used to work as
a graphic designer

21:54.533 --> 21:57.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but can't find work
I found myself short

21:57.100 --> 21:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of money when I was renting

21:58.766 --> 22:01.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the solution was
the streets he says

22:01.300 --> 22:03.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
more and more people
join them every day

22:03.566 --> 22:06.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we'll give you good
yogi year flood

22:06.233 --> 22:08.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
everyone who comes
here rides skinny and

22:08.966 --> 22:11.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gains weight because
in reality people

22:11.766 --> 22:13.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
may say that we eat
garbage but now many

22:13.766 --> 22:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of them envy us because we have

22:15.033 --> 22:19.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
something in our
stomachs as more and

22:19.000 --> 22:20.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
more of Venezuelans
find themselves in

22:20.833 --> 22:23.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
dire situations more
are pulled towards

22:23.333 --> 22:25.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
political groups
in the opposition

22:25.033 --> 22:27.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
coalition in search
of a response to the

22:27.266 --> 22:29.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
crisis like the
voluntad popular party

22:29.966 --> 22:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at its helm is Freddy Guevara

22:32.633 --> 22:35.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one of several young
opposition members

22:35.166 --> 22:37.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Congress who are
playing a key role

22:37.000 --> 22:39.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in organizing the
anti-government

22:39.033 --> 22:41.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
marches we reach
the point where all

22:41.666 --> 22:43.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
constitutional doors
have been closed on

22:43.500 --> 22:47.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
us that's pushed
everyone to head out in

22:48.833 --> 22:50.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Nevada and other
hard-line government

22:50.433 --> 22:52.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
opponents it all
comes down to one

22:52.900 --> 22:56.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
central demand that
Maduro leave there's

22:56.433 --> 22:58.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
no way to solve all
these problems with

22:58.233 --> 23:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Maduro in the head at home in a

23:02.300 --> 23:04.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
high-rise complex of
free housing built

23:04.600 --> 23:07.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
under Chavez Darwin
Ananda's fears a new

23:07.933 --> 23:09.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
government would turn
their back on the

23:09.800 --> 23:12.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
interests of the poor
in particular the

23:12.133 --> 23:13.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mallory will is
young especially more

23:13.766 --> 23:16.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what has the revolution
and socialism

23:16.033 --> 23:18.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
given me well this
humble home where I

23:18.566 --> 23:21.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
am thanks to God
first into Chavez and

23:21.300 --> 23:23.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to Maduro is what
I always wanted a

23:23.733 --> 23:27.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
decent home nothing
else you'd be my

23:27.300 --> 23:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
mouth professor penfold says the

23:30.800 --> 23:32.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
opposition should
not underestimate the

23:32.933 --> 23:36.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
power of chavismo I
don't think you can

23:36.066 --> 23:39.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
move out of this
situation without an

23:39.200 --> 23:42.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
important fracture
go happening within

23:42.433 --> 23:45.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the government coalition
Guevara and the

23:45.533 --> 23:47.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
opposition are
counting on government

23:47.666 --> 23:50.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
dissidents to help
bring down Maduro the

23:50.166 --> 23:52.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
idea is Galatea
that is to say that

23:52.733 --> 23:54.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
every day there are
more players inside

23:54.733 --> 23:56.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the regime that moves
away from Maduro

23:56.400 --> 23:58.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but this way I'm gonna have to

23:58.266 --> 24:01.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
powerfully knows
well done by a like I

24:01.233 --> 24:03.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
did nothing but
until and if that

24:03.033 --> 24:03.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
happens

24:03.966 --> 24:05.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Venezuela is stuck in poetic

24:05.900 --> 24:10.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
deadlock it's it's
also a country and I

24:10.366 --> 24:15.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have to say this
with with horror that

24:15.033 --> 24:20.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can not stay in the
situation it is for

24:21.200 --> 24:24.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

worries over the chaos

24:27.300 --> 24:31.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and insecurity and
her kids what an

24:31.533 --> 24:33.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
employee for example
she escapes and

24:33.833 --> 24:35.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
goes off to the
marches she says mommy

24:35.900 --> 24:37.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
if I tell you I'm
going to the protest

24:37.666 --> 24:41.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you won't let me go
yet us knows that

24:41.300 --> 24:43.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
when her daughter
runs off to marches

24:43.100 --> 24:45.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
she always takes her
cap it's become her

24:45.866 --> 24:47.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
way of checking in
on her daughter's

24:47.800 --> 24:51.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whereabouts I call
her brother I say go

24:51.933 --> 24:53.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to her room and see
if her hat is there

24:53.500 --> 24:57.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I understand her
as a mother how it

24:57.100 --> 24:58.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would be to receive
a call that your

24:58.800 --> 25:00.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
daughter is dead or
your daughter was

25:00.733 --> 25:03.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
attacked but even
so sometimes I go to

25:03.333 --> 25:06.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the protests

25:06.033 --> 25:08.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

Trump agenda that
the administration

25:54.133 --> 25:56.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
still has not been
able to implement his

the ban remains on
hold by federal court

26:04.233 --> 26:05.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
order and the
president this morning

26:05.833 --> 26:08.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
aired out his grievances
once again John

afternoon the White

House deputy press
secretary said it

26:14.700 --> 26:16.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
didn't matter what
president Trump's

26:16.800 --> 26:18.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
executive order on
immigration is called

26:18.866 --> 26:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think that the president isn't

26:20.933 --> 26:22.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
concerned with what
you call it he's

26:22.566 --> 26:24.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
concerned with
national security and

26:24.800 --> 26:27.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
protecting people
in this country this

26:27.000 --> 26:29.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
morning the president
was very concerned

26:29.666 --> 26:32.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
skating people the
lawyers and the

26:32.400 --> 26:34.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
courts can call it
whatever they want

26:34.366 --> 26:36.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but I am calling
it what we need and

26:36.566 --> 26:40.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what it is a travel
ban in fact it was

26:40.300 --> 26:42.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his own aids or
refused to call it that

26:42.300 --> 26:45.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's not a travel
ban it's a it's a

26:45.266 --> 26:47.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
vetting system to
keep America safe

26:47.033 --> 26:49.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's it plain and
simple not a travel

26:49.033 --> 26:51.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ban remember to
travel pause but the

26:51.433 --> 26:53.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president said for
90 days we were going

26:53.833 --> 26:56.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to pause in terms
of people from those

26:56.633 --> 26:58.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
countries coming the
United States that

26:58.300 --> 27:01.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would give me time
to look at additional

27:01.866 --> 27:04.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
vetting mr. Trump
also slammed his own

27:04.866 --> 27:07.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Justice Department
saying it should have

27:07.133 --> 27:09.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stuck with the original
executive order

27:09.333 --> 27:12.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not the watered-down
politically correct

27:12.100 --> 27:14.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
current version even
though it was the

27:14.366 --> 27:16.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
President himself
who revoked the

27:16.233 --> 27:18.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
original version when
he signed the new

27:18.000 --> 27:20.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one mr. Trump has
asked the Justice

27:20.133 --> 27:22.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Department to seek a
quick Supreme Court

27:22.333 --> 27:24.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hearing to reinstate
the order after

27:24.666 --> 27:26.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lower courts blocked
it from taking

27:26.433 --> 27:29.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
effect it's up to the
justices to decide

27:29.066 --> 27:31.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
how quickly they'll

to dupe elections

28:04.766 --> 28:07.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
officials into
handing over login

credentials it's the
first evidence that

28:09.233 --> 28:11.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Moscow tried to go
beyond swaying public

28:11.966 --> 28:14.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
opinion and
interfere in election

28:14.500 --> 28:17.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
machinery for more
on all this and more

28:17.566 --> 28:19.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we turn to politics
Monday with Amy

28:19.633 --> 28:21.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Walter of the cook
Political Report and

28:21.500 --> 28:24.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Tamara Keith of NPR
so Amy at am this is

28:24.833 --> 28:26.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a story that's
just been breaking

28:26.366 --> 28:29.100 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
literally within
the last hour we

28:29.100 --> 28:32.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
learned about this
online magazine Amy a

28:32.066 --> 28:34.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
few hours ago but
now we're learning

28:34.066 --> 28:38.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about the arrests if
it is the case that

28:38.133 --> 28:41.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Russians were
able to in some way

28:41.233 --> 28:43.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
interfere or get
close to interfering

28:43.466 --> 28:45.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with the machinery
of an election what

28:45.233 --> 28:47.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
does that mean well
that's just one more

28:47.766 --> 28:51.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
piece of what has
been this never-ending

28:51.366 --> 28:55.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
puzzle called the
Russian impact on this

28:55.000 --> 28:57.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
election and what's
difficult about

28:57.633 --> 28:59.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sifting through all
of this Judy it's a

28:59.833 --> 29:01.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
little bit like one
of those games where

29:01.666 --> 29:05.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there's a there's a
picture made up of a

29:05.566 --> 29:06.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lot of different
tiles you don't know

29:06.833 --> 29:08.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what that picture is
until you flip over

29:08.333 --> 29:10.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all the tiles to get
the picture and all

29:10.333 --> 29:12.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we're getting is one
tile here and one

29:12.566 --> 29:14.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
tile there and one
tile over here so we

29:14.166 --> 29:16.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have little pieces
but we don't know

29:16.200 --> 29:17.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what the big picture
is and I don't know

29:17.933 --> 29:19.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that we're ever
going to find out the

29:19.666 --> 29:20.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
big picture

29:20.600 --> 29:22.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
then put on top of it all of the

29:22.266 --> 29:24.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
politics around it
whether it's the

29:24.100 --> 29:25.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president saying he
doesn't know really

29:25.900 --> 29:27.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
if the Russians
interfered in this the

29:27.900 --> 29:31.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
push by Democrats to
really politicize a

29:31.566 --> 29:34.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lot of this the
Russian including

29:34.833 --> 29:36.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hillary Clinton
who says that the

29:36.333 --> 29:37.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russian interference
caused her the

29:37.600 --> 29:40.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
election and now of
course we have James

29:40.133 --> 29:41.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Comey the FBI
director coming to the

29:41.966 --> 29:44.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hill to talk more
about this on Thursday

29:44.233 --> 29:46.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and speaking of
which Tim the White

29:46.066 --> 29:48.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
House did announce
today as we reported

29:48.433 --> 29:50.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that the president
is not going to step

29:50.566 --> 29:52.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in and exert too what
we call executive

29:52.633 --> 29:55.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
privilege to prevent
James Comey from

29:55.300 --> 29:57.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
doing that now there
was a question of

29:57.033 --> 29:59.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whether they could
actually assert that

29:59.066 --> 30:01.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
privilege and whether
they would succeed

30:01.566 --> 30:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but yes they're saying that the

30:03.700 --> 30:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
president will not do that

30:05.433 --> 30:07.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there was also a
question of politically

30:07.233 --> 30:08.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whether it was a
good idea for the

30:08.533 --> 30:10.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president to try to
interfere with Comey

30:10.333 --> 30:12.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
testifying because
that would just cause

30:12.200 --> 30:13.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a lot of people to
say well what is he

30:13.633 --> 30:17.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hiding and and and
Amy there was a lot

30:17.033 --> 30:18.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of speculation about
this people saying

30:18.800 --> 30:21.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
if the President
did that it would be

30:21.133 --> 30:23.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
explosive absolutely
I mean let him go

30:23.700 --> 30:26.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and and testify and
then respond to that

30:26.966 --> 30:29.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
if you if you block
him from testifying

30:29.300 --> 30:30.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the first place

30:30.433 --> 30:31.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the first thing
everybody's going to say

30:31.666 --> 30:32.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is well of course
the White House has

30:32.966 --> 30:34.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
something to hide
that's why they don't

30:34.500 --> 30:36.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
want him to testify
so let's go back to

30:36.566 --> 30:38.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Tam to this other
story we've been

30:38.566 --> 30:40.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
dealing with for
several hours today and

30:40.133 --> 30:42.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's the storm of
tweets that you just

30:42.000 --> 30:43.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
heard John yang
reporting on from the

30:43.633 --> 30:46.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president today
basically doubling down

30:46.133 --> 30:48.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on his original
travel ban saying I

30:48.233 --> 30:49.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
don't care what anybody calls it

30:49.566 --> 30:51.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I want the travel
ban and I don't like

30:51.300 --> 30:52.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what the Justice
Department did and so

30:52.966 --> 30:54.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on and so on

30:54.233 --> 30:57.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
does he help himself
with this or is it

30:57.233 --> 30:59.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is there some risk
that a serious

30:59.400 --> 31:02.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
question of you
lawyers would say many

31:02.933 --> 31:05.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lawyers would say
stop talking those

31:05.700 --> 31:08.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lawyers include
George Conway who is

31:08.966 --> 31:11.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
someone who was up
for potentially a job

31:11.266 --> 31:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a high-level job in the Justice

31:12.933 --> 31:14.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Department pulled
out of that job last

31:14.666 --> 31:16.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
week happens to
be the husband of

31:16.333 --> 31:19.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Kellyanne Conway
said in a series of

31:19.333 --> 31:21.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
tweets basically the
president's tweets

31:21.466 --> 31:23.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
may make people feel
good but they are

31:23.266 --> 31:26.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not helping his
legal case also the

31:26.100 --> 31:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lawyer who is
representing Hawaii in one

31:29.000 --> 31:31.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of these cases that
has has led to the

31:31.900 --> 31:33.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
travel ban being
blocked essentially

31:33.700 --> 31:36.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
said Wow Thank You
President Trump

31:36.000 --> 31:38.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you're certainly
helping us didn't

31:38.233 --> 31:40.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
realize you were
going to be co-counsel

31:40.066 --> 31:43.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and that's what part
of the reason that

31:43.000 --> 31:46.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the courts did not
enact the travel ban

31:46.266 --> 31:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the first place was based on

31:48.166 --> 31:50.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
statements that
Trump made on the

31:50.900 --> 31:52.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
campaign trail and
so it's clear that

31:52.900 --> 31:55.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his own words have
made this that much

31:55.566 --> 31:57.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
more difficult that
they the actual text

31:57.966 --> 32:02.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the of the ban is
as much an issue as

32:04.133 --> 32:05.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what he said in
his campaign about

32:05.966 --> 32:08.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wanting to ban Muslims
and now going to

32:08.133 --> 32:11.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Twitter and also
making the case against

32:11.700 --> 32:13.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
himself so he has
made it that much

32:13.633 --> 32:17.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
harder it's not to
get beyond just the

32:17.233 --> 32:19.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
text of this and
on top of all this

32:19.700 --> 32:22.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at the same time
Tam Kellyanne Conway

32:22.833 --> 32:24.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whom you mentioned
a moment ago because

32:24.300 --> 32:26.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
her husband was
tweeting criticism of

32:26.466 --> 32:29.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the president was
telling the reporters

32:29.300 --> 32:30.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this morning she was
interviewed on one

32:30.533 --> 32:32.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the morning
television shows just

32:32.300 --> 32:34.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
don't pay attention
to the tweet that

32:34.166 --> 32:35.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you should be
focused on what the

32:35.500 --> 32:37.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president's getting
done yeah why focus

32:37.433 --> 32:39.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on the tweets she
says well because they

32:39.100 --> 32:40.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are statements of
the President of the

32:40.733 --> 32:42.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
United States and
when the President of

32:42.600 --> 32:44.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the United States
says something it

32:44.233 --> 32:46.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
matters now sometimes
his statements

32:46.566 --> 32:47.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
come on

32:47.833 --> 32:49.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you know letterhead
from the White House

32:49.166 --> 32:50.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that say this is an
official statement

32:50.933 --> 32:52.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the President of
the United States

32:52.166 --> 32:55.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but the reality is
that often he goes on

32:55.533 --> 32:57.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Twitter and contradicts
the things that

32:57.433 --> 32:59.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are on the official
letterhead and and

32:59.000 --> 33:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
really his tweets are are this

33:02.033 --> 33:04.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
unprecedented access
to what is in the

33:04.966 --> 33:06.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mind of the President
of the United

33:06.200 --> 33:09.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
States it is unfiltered
his spokeswoman

33:09.033 --> 33:11.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was asked today
you know are these

33:11.033 --> 33:13.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
tweets being vetted
yet our lawyers

33:13.033 --> 33:15.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
vetting the tweets
and she said I don't

33:15.333 --> 33:18.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think so so actually
this is what the

33:18.800 --> 33:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
president thinks and says and it

33:20.566 --> 33:22.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
shouldn't be any
different if he says it

33:22.000 --> 33:23.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on Twitter than if
he says it as a press

33:23.633 --> 33:25.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
conference or if he
sent up something on

33:25.166 --> 33:27.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
official letterhead
and I should say we

33:27.100 --> 33:28.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at the NewsHour
viewed the tweets as

33:28.533 --> 33:30.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
another form of
statement a bromley

33:30.266 --> 33:31.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president from the
White House I mean

33:31.700 --> 33:33.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there are official
statements there

33:33.133 --> 33:35.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
executive orders in
a number of other

33:35.100 --> 33:36.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ways they can give
interviews they can

33:36.900 --> 33:39.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
make speeches and
Twitter is there's

33:39.666 --> 33:42.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
another one of those
of communicates and

33:42.533 --> 33:46.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
everything he says
as a private citizen

33:46.133 --> 33:48.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is very different
than when he is

33:48.100 --> 33:49.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
President of the
United States no matter

33:49.866 --> 33:51.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what he says in what
venue he says it

33:51.533 --> 33:53.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
carries the way to
the present States it

33:53.366 --> 33:55.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
carries a weight of
being the leader of

33:55.000 --> 33:56.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this country though
I think that he

33:56.766 --> 33:58.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
considers the tweets
to be sort of a

33:58.600 --> 34:01.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
direct message to
his base whereas the

34:01.900 --> 34:03.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
more official
statements are seen for

34:03.733 --> 34:05.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for a wider audience
but I think he sees

34:05.800 --> 34:07.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
those tweets is
going directly to the

34:07.533 --> 34:10.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
base going around the
media but everyone

34:10.433 --> 34:12.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
else is watching
including leaders from

34:12.400 --> 34:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
around the world everybody it is

34:14.333 --> 34:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
watching who focuses on on this

34:16.400 --> 34:18.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
administration quickly
Tim meantime the

34:18.733 --> 34:20.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
White House was trying
today to regroup

34:20.966 --> 34:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they said this is going to be

34:22.200 --> 34:24.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
infrastructure week
they had a little

34:24.400 --> 34:26.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
briefing for the
news media where they

34:26.033 --> 34:27.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
said we're going
to be focusing on a

34:27.700 --> 34:30.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
plan to pour a lot
of effort and money

34:30.533 --> 34:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into rebuilding the nation's

34:32.333 --> 34:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
infrastructure it's still

34:33.800 --> 34:36.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not clear about the
details and the cost

34:36.266 --> 34:37.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but they're trying
to change the subject

34:37.766 --> 34:39.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
yeah infrastructure
week is going really

34:39.533 --> 34:41.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
well it started
with the president

34:41.166 --> 34:43.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
tweeting at 6:00 in
the morning about

34:43.100 --> 34:44.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
something completely
unrelated to

34:44.600 --> 34:47.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
infrastructure but
they did announce a

34:47.900 --> 34:50.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
proposal on

bill signing that

easiest things for
him to do and yet

35:23.533 --> 35:25.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
both by his own
tweet and by the fact

35:25.366 --> 35:27.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that this bill itself
as it stands is

35:27.533 --> 35:28.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not going to get
support from Democrats

35:28.866 --> 35:31.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
also there is
infrastructure bill just

talking about the key
issues in the case

37:36.133 --> 37:39.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
drugs sex and the

acknowledges giving

37:50.333 --> 37:53.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
before he went with
her on a couch and

37:53.533 --> 37:56.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
molested her in her
words of course he

37:56.266 --> 37:58.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
says that they had
consensual sex acts

37:58.233 --> 37:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on the couch that night but the

37:59.900 --> 38:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
prosecution says that she was

38:01.633 --> 38:03.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
frozen paralyzed by
the pills he gave

38:03.700 --> 38:07.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
her unable to stop
him resist refuse or

38:07.033 --> 38:09.666 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
give consent and
from the opening

38:09.666 --> 38:12.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
statements on Cosby's
defense what's the

38:12.866 --> 38:14.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sense of how they're
going to try to

38:14.533 --> 38:19.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rebut these allegations
they're pointing

38:20.800 --> 38:23.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
out discrepancies in
the women's various

38:23.400 --> 38:25.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
statements over
time saying that the

38:25.133 --> 38:26.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
details have changed
the dates have

38:26.833 --> 38:29.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
changed in fact in
the continent for

38:29.066 --> 38:31.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
example in the
constant statement to

38:31.133 --> 38:33.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
police she initially
recalled the

38:33.433 --> 38:36.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
incident occurring
in March of 2004 but

38:36.500 --> 38:39.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
later told investigators
it was January

38:39.200 --> 38:42.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of 2004 so they're
pointing out you know

38:42.500 --> 38:44.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
time discrepancies
other details and

38:44.800 --> 38:46.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they're saying
that both women had

38:46.533 --> 38:49.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
consensual relationships
with Cosby they

38:49.833 --> 38:52.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
said the Cosby and
andrea constand had a

38:52.466 --> 38:55.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
romantic relationship
that spans at

38:55.066 --> 38:56.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
least several evenings
that she had gone

38:56.933 --> 38:59.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to the casino in
Connecticut with him on

38:59.300 --> 39:01.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one trip had been
with him on several

39:01.666 --> 39:03.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
nights for various
social occasions and

39:03.533 --> 39:05.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
again that it was a
romantic and sensual

39:05.866 --> 39:09.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
situation again
the prosecution is

39:09.266 --> 39:10.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
saying that there's
no way she can give

39:10.800 --> 39:13.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
consent after having
taken these pills

39:13.633 --> 39:15.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Andrea constants
case is obviously

39:15.900 --> 39:18.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
echoed by dozens of
other women who have

39:18.200 --> 39:20.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
said over the years
that Bill Cosby did

39:20.100 --> 39:22.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
similar acts to them
I understand that

39:22.933 --> 39:25.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the first witness
today was one of those

39:25.266 --> 39:27.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
other women can you
tell us what she

39:27.133 --> 39:32.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
testified to today
yeah the first

39:33.300 --> 39:35.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
witness called by
prosecutors was the

39:35.000 --> 39:37.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what we call a prior
bad act accuser

39:37.933 --> 39:40.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
she's her name is
Kelly Johnson she

39:40.766 --> 39:42.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
worked for Cosby's
agent at the William

39:42.500 --> 39:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Morris Agency in the 90s and she

39:44.300 --> 39:46.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
described a similar
situation as to

39:46.666 --> 39:48.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
konstanz a day where
she says she was

39:48.833 --> 39:51.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
beckoned to Cosby's
bungalow at the

39:51.466 --> 39:54.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bel-air hotel in
about 1996 and says he

39:54.966 --> 39:57.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
forced her to take
a pill a white pill

39:57.700 --> 40:01.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and then that she
says left her again

40:01.166 --> 40:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dizzy falling in and out of

40:03.433 --> 40:05.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
consciousness she
says she later woke up

40:05.400 --> 40:07.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hours later perhaps
the next morning on

40:07.766 --> 40:09.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a bed with Cosby
where he was forcing

40:09.966 --> 40:12.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
her to do a sex act
but she says she

40:12.366 --> 40:14.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
really resisted
tried not to take the

40:14.200 --> 40:15.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pill

40:15.466 --> 40:16.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to put it under her
tongue only to have

40:16.733 --> 40:18.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
him look at her
tongue and you know

40:18.733 --> 40:21.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
insist on her swallowing
it she she says

40:21.200 --> 40:22.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
she feared that she
would lose her job

40:22.766 --> 40:24.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that she liked
quite a bit at the

40:24.400 --> 40:26.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
William Morris
Agency the defense

40:26.900 --> 40:28.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
questioned her
timing they said that

40:28.966 --> 40:30.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there's a deposition
that exists I

40:30.700 --> 40:31.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
believe in a
workers compensation

40:31.966 --> 40:34.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lawsuit she filed in
which she says that

40:34.733 --> 40:37.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
she went to the hotel
with Cosby in 1990

40:37.933 --> 40:40.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so six years apart
on that they really

40:40.300 --> 40:42.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
questioned her on
other details and she

40:42.800 --> 40:45.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
says as for instance
they said didn't

40:45.400 --> 40:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you Cosby give you $400 for your

40:47.700 --> 40:49.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
grandmother's doctor's
appointment she

40:49.400 --> 40:51.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
did not testify to
that she says she

40:51.366 --> 40:53.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
never remembers him
giving her any money

40:53.100 --> 40:55.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
although she does
remember him referring

40:55.300 --> 40:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
her grandmother to a doctor's

40:56.533 --> 40:58.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
appointment so again
they're pointing

40:58.300 --> 41:00.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
out the consistencies
some small some

41:00.500 --> 41:02.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
maybe less small in
their statements and

41:02.900 --> 41:05.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
while the prosecution
is trying to say

41:05.466 --> 41:08.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to the jury you really
have to look and

41:08.500 --> 41:10.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
try to focus on the
differences between

41:10.300 --> 41:13.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the man and the actor
you saw on TV and

41:13.133 --> 41:16.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the roles that he
created I understand

41:16.166 --> 41:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that Cosby himself will not be

41:17.800 --> 41:21.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
testifying but the
earlier deposition

41:21.633 --> 41:23.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that Cosby gave this
is the deposition

41:23.300 --> 41:25.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that you helped
unearth I understand

41:25.366 --> 41:27.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will be a key piece
of evidence here can

41:27.433 --> 41:30.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you tell us what is
in that deposition

41:32.733 --> 41:35.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
right it was a it
was a deposition that

41:35.566 --> 41:38.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he gave in 2005 and
2006 when andrea

41:38.900 --> 41:40.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
constand filed a
civil lawsuit after

41:40.800 --> 41:43.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
prosecutors at the
time decided not to

41:43.233 --> 41:45.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
charge Cosby in
the case so in that

41:45.433 --> 41:48.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
deposition Cosby
says that he again

41:48.566 --> 41:51.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
acknowledges having
a long series of

41:51.400 --> 41:53.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
relationships with
young women actresses

41:53.333 --> 41:55.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
waitresses flight
attendants various

41:55.933 --> 41:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
women again he says they were he

41:57.300 --> 41:59.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
considers them to be
consensual many of

41:59.800 --> 42:01.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
those women have now
come forward to say

42:01.466 --> 42:02.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that they believe
they were drugged and

42:02.900 --> 42:06.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
molested one of the
big highlights from

42:06.000 --> 42:07.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that deposition was
Cosby acknowledging

42:07.966 --> 42:10.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that in the 70s he
got quaaludes a very

42:10.133 --> 42:12.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
powerful sedative
that the u.s. later

42:12.066 --> 42:14.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
banned he says he
obtained them from his

42:14.633 --> 42:17.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
doctor at least seven
prescriptions he

42:17.066 --> 42:19.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
says he got them
you know in his own

42:19.500 --> 42:21.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
name but get collected
them to give to

42:21.966 --> 42:24.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
women before sex and
that was one of the

42:24.400 --> 42:27.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
things that led
prosecutors into 2015

42:27.366 --> 42:29.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
when this came to
light to reopen the

42:29.500 --> 42:31.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
case and realize they
still had time to

42:31.366 --> 42:34.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to charge Cosby they
arrested him days

42:34.300 --> 42:36.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
before the statute
of limitations ran in

42:36.466 --> 42:37.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
late 2015

42:37.666 --> 42:39.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all right Mary

42:49.966 --> 42:52.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

42:54.500 --> 42:56.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
starting with the
inspirational story of

42:56.800 --> 42:59.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a man who has learned
Drive swim and fly

42:59.700 --> 43:02.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
airplanes all without
arms and legs but

43:02.900 --> 43:04.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
first take a moment
to hear from your

43:04.933 --> 43:07.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
local PBS station
it's a chance to offer

43:07.466 --> 43:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
your support which helps to keep

43:09.233 --> 43:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
programs like ours on the air

43:12.533 --> 43:17.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

43:20.633 --> 43:23.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for those stations
still with us opera

43:23.166 --> 43:25.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lovers were shocked
when a New York

Times profile of
renowned soprano Renee

43:27.966 --> 43:30.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Fleming suggested
that she was nearing

43:30.400 --> 43:33.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the end of her
storied career in fact

43:33.066 --> 43:35.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
her life in the music
world is far from

43:35.600 --> 43:37.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
over just this past
weekend Fleming

43:37.966 --> 43:39.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
partnered with the
director of the

43:39.333 --> 43:41.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
National Institutes
of Health to explore

43:41.800 --> 43:43.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the connections
between music and

medicine during an
event at Washington

43:46.133 --> 43:48.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DC's Kennedy Center
it's one example of

43:48.900 --> 43:51.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the many projects
Renee Fleming plans to

43:51.200 --> 43:53.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
take on in the coming
years she recently

43:53.466 --> 43:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
told Jeffrey Brown in New York

43:55.566 --> 43:56.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

[Music]

44:00.833 --> 44:03.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it is perhaps Renee
Fleming's most

44:03.066 --> 44:06.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
renowned role the
marshal in a beautiful

44:06.333 --> 44:08.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but aging noblewoman
who loves and loses

44:08.833 --> 44:11.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a much younger man
in regard Strauss's

44:11.533 --> 44:14.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
opera der rosenkavalier
this has been my

44:14.400 --> 44:19.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
home since 1992 and
one day when people

44:20.933 --> 44:23.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
said where do you
like to sing the most

44:23.166 --> 44:25.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I always said the
met because it was my

44:25.366 --> 44:30.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
home this may be
the last time Renee

44:31.533 --> 44:33.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Fleming sings this
opera after some 70

44:33.133 --> 44:35.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
performances over
more than two decades

44:35.333 --> 44:38.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but let's make one
thing clear this diva

44:38.966 --> 44:42.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is not departing no
no no that's a very

44:42.166 --> 44:44.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
exciting headline
and certainly I'm

44:44.033 --> 44:46.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
saying goodbye to
the Marschallin and

44:46.033 --> 44:48.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their Rosenkavalier
and to the bulk of

44:48.266 --> 44:49.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the repertoire that
I've sung at the mat

44:49.733 --> 44:53.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so that's already a
sad farewell and a

44:53.600 --> 44:56.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
timely one but I'm
it doesn't really

44:56.133 --> 44:58.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
change my schedule
very much I'm in

44:58.466 --> 45:02.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
great voice I'm a
lifelong gregarious

45:02.066 --> 45:07.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
experience or of new
things now 58 and

45:09.366 --> 45:10.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the mother of two
adult daughters

45:10.700 --> 45:12.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Fleming will continue
to perform in

45:12.866 --> 45:15.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
concerts on stages
around the world and

45:15.133 --> 45:17.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
she's eager to
work with composers

45:17.033 --> 45:19.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
writing new works
including one by Kevin

she's even stepping
onto a new stage

45:28.133 --> 45:30.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this fall making
her Broadway musical

45:30.666 --> 45:33.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
debut in carousel
which she sang for

45:33.333 --> 45:36.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
President Obama's
first inauguration but

45:36.800 --> 45:39.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
she's also taken on
new offstage roles

45:39.300 --> 45:41.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
including as creative
consultant to the

45:41.833 --> 45:45.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Lyric Opera of Chicago
and to polyphony

45:45.733 --> 45:47.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a group bringing
together Jewish and

45:47.766 --> 45:49.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Arab children in
Israel through music

45:49.833 --> 45:52.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and she's participating
in a project

45:52.733 --> 45:54.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with the National
Institutes of Health

45:54.500 --> 45:56.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the Kennedy
Center to study the

45:56.766 --> 45:59.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
influence of music
on the brain when you

45:59.233 --> 46:02.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
start out the ambition
is powerful and

46:02.000 --> 46:03.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's a driving force
and you have a lot

46:03.700 --> 46:06.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to accomplish and
and to get there just

46:06.433 --> 46:09.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to get to the top
and at this point I

46:09.600 --> 46:11.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think it's it's a
really wonderful place

46:11.933 --> 46:13.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to be to begin to
think about okay what

46:13.733 --> 46:16.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do I want to do now
how do I want to

46:16.500 --> 46:18.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
spend my time the
daughter of two music

46:18.900 --> 46:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
teachers in Rochester New York

46:20.666 --> 46:22.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Fleming first gained
attention in the

46:22.500 --> 46:26.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
late 1980s and then
widespread fame in

46:26.533 --> 46:29.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the 90s performing a
variety of roles in

46:29.100 --> 46:31.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
leading opera houses
around the world

46:31.700 --> 46:34.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can I cut that opera
lyrics she also

46:34.400 --> 46:36.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
became the rare
classical singer to

46:36.766 --> 46:39.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
crossover into popular
culture singing

46:39.700 --> 46:44.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
David Letterman's top
10 list performing

46:49.033 --> 46:51.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the national anthem
at Super Bowl xlviii

46:51.333 --> 46:54.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and of course serving
as host for PBS is

46:54.600 --> 46:56.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
great performances
welcome to our

46:56.933 --> 46:59.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
premiere performance
each he told me

46:59.666 --> 47:02.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
does bring changes
one is the dearth of

47:02.133 --> 47:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
roles for her voice in the Opera

47:04.000 --> 47:05.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
repertoire

47:05.266 --> 47:07.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm a lyric soprano
they're young women

47:07.666 --> 47:09.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you know if they're
sort of between the

47:09.333 --> 47:12.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ages of 17 and 25
and so even if my

47:12.966 --> 47:14.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
voice can still sing
these roles really

47:14.900 --> 47:17.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
well which some of
them I can still sing

47:17.200 --> 47:19.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's it sort of
doesn't really make

47:19.533 --> 47:22.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sense in the day of
HD broadcasts and

47:22.333 --> 47:25.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the day of people
really expecting a

47:25.000 --> 47:28.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
visual experience
as well what happens

47:28.166 --> 47:30.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to your voice as you
get older you don't

47:30.433 --> 47:32.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have with the
resilience the physical

47:32.166 --> 47:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
resilience so if I sing a big

47:33.600 --> 47:35.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
performance I don't
want to do it again

47:35.100 --> 47:36.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the next

47:36.033 --> 47:37.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you know it's like we are the

47:37.466 --> 47:41.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
weightlifters of
singers and so that

47:41.200 --> 47:43.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
weightlifters means
we are because it's

47:43.433 --> 47:48.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
power singing
imagine four thousand

47:48.033 --> 47:50.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
seats an orchestra
and a chorus and we

47:50.066 --> 47:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have to be heard over there no

47:51.633 --> 47:54.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
amplification when
you're young you can

47:54.066 --> 47:55.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
keep doing it and
doing it doing it some

47:55.633 --> 47:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
part of it is that just sheer

47:56.833 --> 47:59.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
physicality absolutely
the power exactly

47:59.866 --> 48:02.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
she's experimented
with different kinds

48:02.133 --> 48:05.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of music making a
rock album dark hope

48:05.400 --> 48:08.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
[Music]

48:09.700 --> 48:12.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and she's curated
festivals celebrating

48:12.700 --> 48:16.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the diversity of
American voices so many

48:16.133 --> 48:18.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
projects so much
presence so it was

48:18.933 --> 48:20.600 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
striking to hear
as she showed me

48:20.600 --> 48:23.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
costumes from der
rosenkavalier how

48:23.433 --> 48:25.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
several bouts with
stage fright almost

48:25.533 --> 48:28.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
derailed her career
that same voice that

48:28.300 --> 48:31.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
drives you to achieve
and to get better

48:31.666 --> 48:34.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is also sometimes
telling you you're not

48:34.400 --> 48:36.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
good enough there's
kind of doubts if

48:36.800 --> 48:38.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you don't feel that
you can do it or you

48:38.666 --> 48:40.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
feel that people
are judging you too

48:40.933 --> 48:45.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
harshly it can
quickly spiral into a

48:45.866 --> 48:47.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
situation where you
don't want to be on

48:47.133 --> 48:49.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stage at all and now
when I watch you I

48:49.300 --> 48:50.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mean you know you
don't feel that

48:50.733 --> 48:53.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
anymore do you I
love it I love it

48:53.000 --> 48:54.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because getting
through that the last

48:54.700 --> 48:57.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
time I just said no
I I am grateful to

48:57.933 --> 49:00.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
be here

49:01.366 --> 49:03.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
now Renee Fleming
says she wants to use

49:03.733 --> 49:05.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
her celebrity to
impart lesson she's

49:05.966 --> 49:08.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
learned including
the value of the arts

49:08.233 --> 49:10.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for all Americans
as we looked at

49:10.833 --> 49:12.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
portraits of some
of the Mets greatest

49:12.666 --> 49:15.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stars including
Fleming herself she

49:15.100 --> 49:17.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
showed me a photo a
fan had given her of

49:17.500 --> 49:19.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the would-be diva
in a seventh grade

49:19.666 --> 49:22.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
theater production
and this was my first

49:22.333 --> 49:24.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
musical I Swiss
Eliza Doolittle in my

49:24.566 --> 49:28.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
fair lady you remember
that girl yes yes

49:28.266 --> 49:29.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and partly because
she looks so much

49:29.900 --> 49:32.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
like one of my
daughters that's sort of

49:32.733 --> 49:35.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a shock um it's
interesting because I

49:35.666 --> 49:37.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can see the shyness
there you know and

49:37.766 --> 49:40.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that need to sort of
somehow get out of

49:40.833 --> 49:43.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
myself and I think
performance was a way

49:43.333 --> 49:48.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of doing it one last
performance in this

49:49.533 --> 49:53.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
role with many more
to come for the PBS

Center High School
in Clinton Michigan

50:46.500 --> 50:49.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we kind of figured
he was here for a

50:49.833 --> 50:51.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
purpose

50:51.033 --> 50:52.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
everyone in the
world's gonna know his

50:52.300 --> 50:54.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
name he is different
than anybody else

50:54.533 --> 50:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there's no better word than

50:55.800 --> 50:57.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
inspirational so he
inspires everybody

50:57.033 --> 50:59.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
inspires me Ryan
has taught me how to

50:59.533 --> 51:02.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not worry about the
past don't focus on

51:02.300 --> 51:05.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the future but enjoy
every moment of the

51:05.300 --> 51:07.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
present my name is
Ryan Hudson Peralta I

51:07.800 --> 51:09.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was born with a
disability called

51:09.433 --> 51:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
congenital limb deficiency which

51:11.500 --> 51:13.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
basically is the
shortening of the arms

51:13.566 --> 51:16.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the legs and in
my case I was born

51:16.466 --> 51:20.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
without hands when
I was born the

51:20.366 --> 51:22.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
doctors told my
parents that I would I

51:22.500 --> 51:24.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would never drive
a car or go to a

51:24.366 --> 51:26.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
regular school they
said I'd never have

51:26.300 --> 51:29.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a family so yeah
everyone pretty much

51:29.733 --> 51:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
doubted me when I was a kid

51:31.933 --> 51:34.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
well after Ryan was
born the doctors

51:34.666 --> 51:37.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wouldn't show me him
and all of a sudden

51:37.200 --> 51:39.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they covered up the
mirror and told my

51:39.666 --> 51:41.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
husband and mr. Paul
to leave the room

51:41.700 --> 51:44.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and I didn't understand
why and I said

51:44.300 --> 51:46.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
where's my baby I
want to see my baby

51:46.466 --> 51:50.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and I kind of wanted
to shock and they

51:50.033 --> 51:52.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
told me something was
wrong with his arm

51:52.100 --> 51:54.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and then something
was wrong with this

51:54.233 --> 51:57.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
leg they said well
we'll let you see him

51:57.366 --> 51:59.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in a little bit I
just looked at his

51:59.966 --> 52:02.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
face and he's a fighter
actually I think

52:02.533 --> 52:05.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I saw Ryan Hudson
Peralta before I heard

52:05.833 --> 52:08.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about him so and I
asked somebody I said

52:08.066 --> 52:09.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his way is he working
for us what's he

52:09.500 --> 52:10.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
doing and I think
somebody said well

52:10.933 --> 52:12.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he's a designer you
know the first thing

52:12.866 --> 52:15.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you ask yourself is
you know how does a

52:15.266 --> 52:17.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
man who doesn't have
limbs design stuff

52:17.466 --> 52:20.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on a computer but
that's just really the

52:20.133 --> 52:22.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
first question
because then you see

52:22.166 --> 52:23.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
everything else he
does and you keep

52:23.466 --> 52:24.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
asking how does he do

52:24.666 --> 52:25.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that has to do that
how they do that

52:25.866 --> 52:27.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sooner or later
you stop asking the

52:27.100 --> 52:28.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
question because he
just figures out a

52:28.933 --> 52:31.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
way to do it it's
a so it's truly

52:31.900 --> 52:34.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
remarkable to me and
very shocking and

52:34.633 --> 52:36.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
also inspirational
at the same time

52:36.266 --> 52:37.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
never heard him
complain about nothing

52:37.600 --> 52:40.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he has to work twice
as hard to do daily

52:40.066 --> 52:42.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
tasks like to send
a text message or

52:42.433 --> 52:45.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
just anything and
he never complains

52:45.033 --> 52:49.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about that at all
nothing as a kid I

52:49.266 --> 52:51.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
started to draw with
my pencil between

52:51.566 --> 52:55.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
my my feet and then
I I really realized

52:55.200 --> 52:57.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one day that is going
to be pretty tough

52:57.000 --> 52:58.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
when I go into a bank
and have to hop up

52:58.700 --> 53:01.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on the counter to
sign the sign that

53:01.266 --> 53:04.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
deposit slip so I
moved the pencil from

53:04.600 --> 53:06.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
my feet to my chin
and shoulder and I

53:06.966 --> 53:10.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
started to draw that
way 2013 I started

53:10.266 --> 53:11.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
working for Quicken
Loans and the family

53:11.833 --> 53:13.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
companies as a web
and user interface

53:13.900 --> 53:15.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
designer and about
nine months after

53:15.766 --> 53:17.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
working there I got
an email from Dan

53:17.966 --> 53:19.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Gilbert Steam asking
me to speak at

53:19.566 --> 53:22.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
these events he has
ever about every

53:22.500 --> 53:24.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
month we want Ryan
to talk about our

53:24.133 --> 53:25.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
philosophy and
how that plays out

53:25.833 --> 53:28.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
through him and his
story and he does a

53:28.066 --> 53:30.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
great job because
again for everybody in

53:30.333 --> 53:31.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the audience is
probably their first

53:31.600 --> 53:34.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
time seeing Ryan and
and just saw such a

53:34.533 --> 53:36.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
unique individual
that every time people

53:36.933 --> 53:39.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
see him and see
he's just a regular

53:39.266 --> 53:41.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
normal guy who just
gets it done just

53:41.733 --> 53:43.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you know different
kinds of challenges I

53:43.233 --> 53:45.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think that inspires
everybody in a big

53:45.766 --> 53:48.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
big way he is a
testament a living

53:48.500 --> 53:50.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
testament to that
with the way that he

53:50.800 --> 53:52.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
interacts with people
the way that he

53:52.500 --> 53:54.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
approaches work the
way that he builds

53:54.866 --> 53:57.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
community around him
he understands the

53:57.166 --> 53:58.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
power of relationship
and he also

53:58.966 --> 54:00.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
understands the
power of people bad

54:00.866 --> 54:02.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
things are going to
happen to you every

54:02.500 --> 54:05.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
day in your life and
no matter what if

54:05.300 --> 54:07.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you stay positive
you're going to get

54:07.000 --> 54:09.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
through I mean I could
look at every day

54:09.566 --> 54:11.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of my life as something
negative being

54:11.866 --> 54:13.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
born without hands
it's not the greatest

54:13.300 --> 54:15.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
thing that could
happen to somebody but

54:15.533 --> 54:17.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have a choice every
day that I wake up

54:17.366 --> 54:20.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I can either look at
myself as you know

54:20.266 --> 54:22.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a poor guy with a
disability or somebody

54:22.766 --> 54:25.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that can go out and
inspire people and

54:25.900 --> 54:29.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what an inspiration
Ryan is remarkable
