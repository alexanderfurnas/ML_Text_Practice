JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.839 --> 00:07.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.607 --> 00:11.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
President Trump
claims to be the victim of a
witch-hunt, as

00:11.177 --> 00:16.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Justice Department appoints
a special
counsel to investigate possible
Russian ties

00:16.950 --> 00:18.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the Trump campaign.

00:18.418 --> 00:24.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then: We travel to Iran ahead of
a pivotal
presidential election there.

00:24.424 --> 00:31.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plus: part two of our look at
how gender stereotypes
influence the jobs we take.

00:31.064 --> 00:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meet the football coach who
teaches second
grade.

00:33.733 --> 00:36.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAROLD JOHNSON, Elementary
School Teacher:
Everybody looking like, hey what
you doing

00:36.703 --> 00:37.670 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here?

00:37.704 --> 00:40.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, this isn't P.E. or
anything.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.908 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I'm just like, I know.

00:41.941 --> 00:43.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's reading and how to teach
kids how to
read.

00:43.843 --> 00:45.645 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what I'm here for, to
learn that.

00:45.678 --> 00:48.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:48.548 --> 00:52.919 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:52.952 --> 01:05.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
is rejecting
the need for an independent
investigator into

01:05.732 --> 01:08.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his alleged ties with Russia.

01:08.301 --> 01:12.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's also again denying any
wrongdoing in
connection with Russia.

01:12.338 --> 01:18.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He spoke out today, as a newly
appointed special
counsel began looking into just
that.

01:18.344 --> 01:20.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham begins our
coverage.

01:20.213 --> 01:22.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Well, I respect the move, but
the entire thing

01:22.649 --> 01:24.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has been a witch-hunt.

01:24.684 --> 01:27.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
president's displeasure
with the naming of a special
counsel was crystal-clear

01:27.854 --> 01:31.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at his joint White House news
conference with
the visiting president of
Colombia.

01:31.424 --> 01:36.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: There is no
collusion between
certainly myself and my
campaign.

01:36.362 --> 01:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I can always speak for
myself and the
Russians.

01:39.966 --> 01:40.934 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Zero.

01:40.967 --> 01:42.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think it divides the country.

01:42.969 --> 01:47.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we have a very divided
country because
of that and many other things.

01:47.740 --> 01:52.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In a sudden
shift last night,
Deputy Attorney General Rod
Rosenstein appointed

01:52.846 --> 01:58.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
former FBI Director Robert
Mueller to investigate
Russian meddling in the
election, alleged

01:58.318 --> 02:03.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
collusion with the Trump
campaign and any
other related matters that may
arise.

02:03.890 --> 02:07.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rosenstein said he acted to
restore the public's
trust.

02:07.427 --> 02:11.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That trust was certainly tested
in a series
of bombshell developments in
recent days.

02:11.965 --> 02:17.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, there was the president's
sudden firing
of FBI Director James Comey last
week, then

02:17.403 --> 02:23.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reports that Mr. Trump leaked
classified information
about the Islamic State group to
Russian diplomats,

02:23.676 --> 02:28.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and finally allegations that he
urged Comey
back in February to drop the
investigation

02:28.481 --> 02:30.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Michael Flynn.

02:30.350 --> 02:34.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Flynn had just been fired as
national security
adviser for lying about his
contacts with

02:34.587 --> 02:35.989 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Russians.

02:36.022 --> 02:38.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president was asked directly
about Comey
today.

02:38.725 --> 02:43.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: Did you at any time
urge former
FBI Director James Comey in any
way, shape

02:43.129 --> 02:48.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or form to close or to back down
the investigation
into Michael Flynn, and also as
you look...

02:48.434 --> 02:50.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: No, no.

02:50.103 --> 02:51.871 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Next question.

02:51.905 --> 02:56.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: As you look back over
the past six
months or year, have you had any
recollection

02:56.543 --> 03:00.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where you have wondered if
anything you have
done has been something that
might be worthy

03:00.613 --> 03:01.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of criminal charges?

03:01.648 --> 03:03.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I think it's
totally ridiculous.

03:03.383 --> 03:05.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everybody thinks so.

03:05.251 --> 03:08.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Democrats had
for weeks
pressed for an independent
commission or special

03:08.087 --> 03:10.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
counsel, and most welcomed
Mueller's selection.

03:10.423 --> 03:12.091 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: Mr.
Rosenstein has done the right
thing.

03:13.826 --> 03:18.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I applaud his decision for both
its correctness
and its courage.

03:18.598 --> 03:24.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I now have significantly greater
confidence
that the investigation will
follow the facts,

03:25.004 --> 03:26.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wherever they lead.

03:26.839 --> 03:31.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Most
Republicans had resisted
naming a special counsel, but,
today, House

03:31.110 --> 03:33.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Speaker Paul Ryan and others
applauded the
move.

03:33.646 --> 03:35.348 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: The
appointment of a special
counsel, I think,

03:37.383 --> 03:42.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
helps assure people and the
Justice Department
that they are going to go do
their jobs independently

03:42.589 --> 03:45.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and thoroughly, which is what we
called for
all along.

03:45.625 --> 03:47.360 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:47.393 --> 03:50.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CORNYN (R), Texas: Robert
Mueller is
perhaps the single most
qualified individual

03:50.430 --> 03:55.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to lead such an investigation,
in my view,
and he's certainly independent.

03:55.134 --> 03:59.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Mueller ran
the FBI for
12 years, taking over just days
before the

03:59.839 --> 04:04.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
9/11 attacks, and served both
Democratic and
Republican presidents.

04:04.043 --> 04:06.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Journalist Garrett Graff is the
author of
a Mueller biography.

04:06.779 --> 04:10.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARRETT GRAFF, Journalist: Bob
Mueller's entire
history is as a tenacious
prosecutor.

04:10.316 --> 04:15.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so he will follow the Russia
investigation
wherever it leads.

04:15.054 --> 04:18.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the good news for Donald
Trump is, he's
also the only person perhaps in
America who

04:18.958 --> 04:24.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could end up declaring that
there's no there
there, and having people believe
that.

04:24.197 --> 04:28.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Back at the
Capitol this
afternoon, Deputy Attorney
General Rosenstein

04:28.067 --> 04:32.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
briefed the full Senate in a
closed session
on the firing of Comey and the
handling of

04:32.672 --> 04:34.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Russia investigation.

04:34.507 --> 04:39.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rosenstein wrote the memo that
the president
used as a basis to dismiss
Comey.

04:39.445 --> 04:44.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Missouri Democrat Claire
McCaskill says Rosenstein
acknowledged that the memo he
wrote on Comey

04:44.584 --> 04:46.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wasn't, in fact, what triggered
the firing.

04:46.886 --> 04:48.788 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:48.821 --> 04:51.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLAIRE MCCASKILL (D), Missouri:
He did acknowledge
that he learned Comey would be
removed prior

04:51.891 --> 04:53.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to him writing his memo.

04:53.559 --> 04:54.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION: Say that again?

04:54.827 --> 04:55.795 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
He what?

04:55.828 --> 04:57.664 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:57.697 --> 05:00.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLAIRE MCCASKILL: He knew that
Comey was going
to be removed prior to him
writing his memo.

05:00.600 --> 05:04.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Republican
Lindsey Graham
praised the Mueller selection,
but also voiced

05:04.904 --> 05:05.872 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
misgivings.

05:05.905 --> 05:07.674 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:07.707 --> 05:09.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South
Carolina: You couldn't
have picked a better man to do
the job.

05:09.542 --> 05:14.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think most people in that
meeting are
generally OK with the idea of a
special counsel.

05:14.547 --> 05:19.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what they don't quite
understand yet is
I think this has really limited
what Congress

05:19.218 --> 05:20.753 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
can do.

05:20.787 --> 05:24.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All of this as
new revelations
surfaced about Michael Flynn.

05:24.123 --> 05:29.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The New York Times reports the
Trump transition
team knew Flynn was under
investigation weeks

05:29.829 --> 05:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
before the inauguration for
secretly working
as a paid lobbyist for Turkey.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The McClatchy News Service
reported that,
during the transition, Flynn
blocked a military

05:39.639 --> 05:43.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plan against the Islamic State
that was opposed
by Turkey.

05:43.609 --> 05:46.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was later approved after his
ouster.

05:46.179 --> 05:51.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Reuters reports Flynn and
other Trump
campaign advisers had contact
with Russian

05:51.050 --> 05:56.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officials at least 18 times
during the last
seven months of the presidential
campaign.

05:56.856 --> 06:01.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, the House
Intelligence Committee
became the latest congressional
panel to ask

06:01.260 --> 06:06.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for more documents on the ouster
of Comey
and his conversations with the
president.

06:06.432 --> 06:08.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham.

06:08.501 --> 06:13.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we turn now
to our Lisa
Desjardins on Capitol Hill and
John Yang at

06:14.006 --> 06:14.974 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the White House.

06:15.007 --> 06:16.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa, I'm going to start with
you.

06:16.843 --> 06:20.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were just hearing from those
senators as
they came out of the briefing
with the deputy

06:20.079 --> 06:21.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
attorney general.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What more are you hearing from
that?

06:22.949 --> 06:26.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right, those
senators emerged
with one unified theme, that the
deputy attorney

06:26.119 --> 06:28.755 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
general was a very cautious man.

06:28.788 --> 06:33.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he, on many questions,
actually deferred,
saying he couldn't answer them,
that it was

06:33.259 --> 06:35.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up to the new special counsel,
Mueller.

06:35.528 --> 06:39.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, Judy, that left
Republicans, they said,
with a sense of confidence that
here was a

06:39.999 --> 06:44.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deputy attorney general who was
trying to
remove politics and Congress
from this investigation.

06:44.670 --> 06:46.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats, however, they were
frustrated.

06:46.606 --> 06:51.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said they're worried that,
as this goes
forward, they may not get many
details about

06:51.711 --> 06:53.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what is happening with this
investigation.

06:53.212 --> 06:56.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Lisa, other
questions
the senators were asking today?

06:56.282 --> 06:58.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The big one.

06:58.117 --> 07:03.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They asked repeatedly, who told
Deputy Attorney
General Rosenstein to write that
letter about

07:03.256 --> 07:05.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
why FBI Director Comey should be
fired?

07:05.992 --> 07:07.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They asked him again and again.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.928 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we're told he didn't answer.

07:08.961 --> 07:10.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So it's a question still in the
air.

07:10.863 --> 07:15.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, John, at the
White House,
they were fielding questions
about a new FBI

07:15.201 --> 07:16.169 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
director.

07:16.202 --> 07:17.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I know I was there.

07:17.437 --> 07:21.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president had a session with
television
news anchors.

07:21.073 --> 07:25.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, clearly, one of the
questions on their
mind is getting to the choice of
this new

07:25.645 --> 07:26.612 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
FBI director.

07:26.646 --> 07:28.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: That's right.

07:28.481 --> 07:32.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at a photo opportunity with
the Colombian
president, he repeated what he
told you and

07:32.118 --> 07:38.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the other anchors at lunch, that
he expects
to name a new FBI director very
soon.

07:38.124 --> 07:42.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, he doesn't say exactly what
that means,
if that's going to be as soon as
before he

07:42.562 --> 07:46.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leaves on his first foreign trip
tomorrow
afternoon.

07:46.566 --> 07:51.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And aides say that he's holding
this rather
close to his vest, but he has
indicated that

07:51.804 --> 07:55.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Joe Lieberman is a leading
candidate.

07:55.074 --> 07:57.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lieberman said that this is a
bit of a surprise
to him.

07:57.944 --> 08:01.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He came in, spoke to the
president yesterday
afternoon.

08:01.514 --> 08:06.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said he didn't seek this,
that he had been
invited, he had been invited to
come speak

08:06.352 --> 08:09.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the president just the day
before.

08:09.489 --> 08:15.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This wouldn't only be something
of a bipartisan
selection, but sort of a
pan-partisan selection.

08:15.294 --> 08:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was, of course, Al Gore's
running mate
on the Democratic ticket in
2000.

08:19.899 --> 08:27.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He ran for reelection after
losing the Democratic
primary as an independent in
2006, and then,

08:27.173 --> 08:32.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2008, sort of broke with the
party, went to
the Republican Convention, and
endorsed John

08:32.845 --> 08:36.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
McCain against President Barack
Obama's reelection
campaign.

08:36.415 --> 08:38.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

08:38.117 --> 08:40.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, Lieberman, a longtime
Democratic
senator from the state of
Connecticut.

08:40.286 --> 08:43.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Lisa, what's the reaction on
the Hill
to this talk?

08:43.256 --> 08:44.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

08:44.257 --> 08:46.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's another one of these
reverse worlds.

08:46.125 --> 08:49.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Democrats who would have
elected Lieberman
as vice president told me today
they're not

08:49.562 --> 08:51.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sure he should be FBI director.

08:51.430 --> 08:55.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said again and again they
think it should
be someone who has never held
elected offices,

08:55.301 --> 08:57.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
someone outside of politics.

08:57.203 --> 09:01.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans, on the other hand,
say they love
the choice of Joe Lieberman.

09:01.107 --> 09:05.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In particular, John McCain said
on the question
of experience, quote to me: "Joe
Lieberman

09:05.678 --> 09:10.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has more experience than the
rest of my Democratic
colleagues combined, and you can
quote me."

09:10.983 --> 09:14.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly
to John, the
White House trying to turn the
focus today

09:14.987 --> 09:17.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the president's overseas
trip, which starts
tomorrow.

09:17.790 --> 09:24.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: This is a big trip,
eight days,
four nations, and sort of high
stakes any

09:24.130 --> 09:28.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
time the president goes
overseas, but I think
for the first trip for a
president, it's always

09:28.501 --> 09:29.936 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
closely watched.

09:29.969 --> 09:32.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The planning seems to be a
little ragged.

09:32.171 --> 09:36.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have been having a little
trouble getting
the details, all the details
that the television

09:36.509 --> 09:42.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
networks in particular need to
have in order
so that they can plan, so that
they can bring

09:42.148 --> 09:45.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the pictures of that trip back
to the United
States.

09:45.117 --> 09:49.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But ready or not, he leaves
tomorrow afternoon,
first stop, Saudi Arabia.

09:49.422 --> 09:52.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will be
talking about
that some more in a few minutes.

09:52.458 --> 09:58.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Yang at the White House,
Lisa Desjardins
at the Capitol, thank you.

09:58.264 --> 10:02.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the day's other news: The
chairman
of the House of Representatives
Oversight

10:02.234 --> 10:06.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Committee, Jason Chaffetz,
announced that
he's resigning from Congress at
the end of

10:06.872 --> 10:08.741 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
June.

10:08.774 --> 10:12.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
His decision came as the
committee is investigating
the Trump campaign's contacts
with Russia.

10:12.712 --> 10:17.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Utah Republican said that he
wants to
spend more time with his family
and possibly

10:17.583 --> 10:19.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
run for governor.

10:19.719 --> 10:26.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One person was killed and 22
hurt in New York's
Times Square today when a car
plowed into

10:26.492 --> 10:28.227 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pedestrians.

10:28.260 --> 10:32.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The driver, a 26-year-old Navy
veteran, was
taken into custody and underwent
tests for

10:32.932 --> 10:34.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
alcohol and drugs.

10:34.734 --> 10:39.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The car drove the wrong way up a
street, and
then up on the sidewalk for
three blocks,

10:40.006 --> 10:43.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and finally came to rest with
two wheels in
the air.

10:43.709 --> 10:47.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Police said there's no
indication that terrorism
was involved.

10:47.480 --> 10:53.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The founder of FOX News, Roger
Ailes, died
today in Palm Beach, Florida,
several days

10:53.219 --> 10:56.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after hitting his head in a fall
in his home.

10:56.455 --> 11:01.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He transformed the business and
built the
network into a dominant
presence, but his

11:01.694 --> 11:03.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
career ended in scandal.

11:03.729 --> 11:06.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
P.J. Tobia has our report.

11:06.132 --> 11:09.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Today, America lost one of
its great
patriotic warriors.

11:09.368 --> 11:13.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: FOX News Channel
announced the
death of the cable network's
longtime leader.

11:13.639 --> 11:18.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: He has dramatically and
forever changed
the political and the media
landscape singlehandedly

11:18.144 --> 11:19.645 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for the better.

11:19.679 --> 11:23.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Neither will ever be the same
again, as he
was a true American original.

11:23.816 --> 11:28.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Ailes left a huge
imprint on both
American politics and media.

11:28.754 --> 11:34.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He created the 24-hour FOX News
network in
1996 from scratch to compete
with CNN and

11:34.326 --> 11:37.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other TV networks he saw as too
liberal.

11:37.363 --> 11:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Within a few short years, FOX
dominated cable
and helped shape politics with
its fair and

11:41.534 --> 11:42.968 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
balanced credo.

11:43.002 --> 11:46.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
FOX News would have an
explicitly conservative
take to its coverage.

11:46.138 --> 11:47.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Fair and balanced.

11:47.740 --> 11:51.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Ailes said this in a
2004 interview
with C-SPAN's Brian Lamb:

11:51.944 --> 11:53.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROGER AILES, FOX News Founder:
Well, we have
changed the business a little
bit.

11:53.946 --> 12:00.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think FOX News has come on the
scene and
identified itself as fair and
balanced.

12:00.086 --> 12:01.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We try to do that every day.

12:02.021 --> 12:08.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think others, instead of
trying to get more
fair and balanced, probably are
offended by

12:08.060 --> 12:10.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that or worried about it.

12:10.262 --> 12:15.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Early in his career,
Ailes helped
launch a little-known big band
singer named

12:15.101 --> 12:19.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mike Douglas, who became a
household name
with his afternoon variety show.

12:19.205 --> 12:22.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was there that Ailes first
met Richard
Nixon.

12:22.374 --> 12:26.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ailes offered to become Nixon's
media adviser
before he ran for president a
second time

12:26.545 --> 12:28.380 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 1968.

12:28.414 --> 12:31.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He would go on to advise and
work for the
winning candidacies of Ronald
Reagan and George

12:32.017 --> 12:33.786 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
H.W. Bush.

12:33.819 --> 12:38.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Bush tweeted today: "He
wasn't perfect,
but Roger Ailes was my friend
and I loved

12:38.324 --> 12:39.658 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Not sure I would have been
president without
his great talent.

12:41.727 --> 12:42.795 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Loyal help.

12:42.828 --> 12:44.029 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Rest in peace."

12:44.063 --> 12:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ailes also served as a one-time
adviser to
Donald Trump.

12:47.399 --> 12:52.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After a falling out, the two men
mended fences
in 2016, when Ailes jumped on
the Trump bandwagon.

12:52.471 --> 12:55.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At FOX, Ailes reigned supreme
for two decades.

12:55.875 --> 12:59.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But after sexual harassment
allegations by
former anchor Gretchen Carlson
became public

12:59.812 --> 13:03.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last year, Ailes' career and
legacy began
to unravel.

13:03.149 --> 13:06.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 20 other women came
forward with
allegations.

13:06.585 --> 13:12.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So far, 21st Century FOX has
paid $45 million
in relation to those charges,
with more pending.

13:12.625 --> 13:18.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
21st Century Fox corporate head
Rupert Murdoch
and his sons ousted Ailes last
July, only

13:18.230 --> 13:21.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hours before Mr. Trump accepted
the GOP nomination.

13:21.767 --> 13:23.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Roger Ailes was 77 years old.

13:23.969 --> 13:29.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Late today, the
medical examiner
in Palm Beach County, Florida,
said that Ailes

13:29.542 --> 13:32.211 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
died of bleeding on the brain.

13:32.244 --> 13:36.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. Treasury Department is
imposing new
sanctions on Venezuela.

13:36.348 --> 13:41.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're aimed at the chief judge
and seven
other members of the country's
Supreme Court.

13:41.887 --> 13:47.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's retaliation for the court's
rulings against
the opposition-controlled
congress.

13:47.359 --> 13:51.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The rulings have triggered
ongoing protests
and violence.

13:51.397 --> 13:56.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Trump administration
formally alerted
Congress today of its plans to
renegotiate

13:56.802 --> 13:59.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NAFTA, the North American Free
Trade Agreement.

13:59.772 --> 14:04.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The president initially
threatened to pull
out of the 23-year-old trade
pact with Mexico

14:04.777 --> 14:06.045 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Canada.

14:06.078 --> 14:10.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has said since that he hopes
to negotiate
a better deal.

14:10.182 --> 14:15.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today's announcement came as
Secretary of
State Rex Tillerson and his
Mexican counterpart

14:15.454 --> 14:17.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
met in Washington.

14:17.223 --> 14:20.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary of
State: Trade
is an important, extremely
important issue.

14:20.559 --> 14:26.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the filing of the
authorities
with the Congress this morning
to start moving

14:26.632 --> 14:29.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
towards fast-track authority is
a very positive
move.

14:29.235 --> 14:32.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUIS VIDEGARAY, Mexican Foreign
Minister:
The government of Mexico
welcomes this development.

14:32.771 --> 14:34.673 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We are prepared.

14:34.707 --> 14:42.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are ready just to work
together with both
the governments of the U.S. and
Canada to

14:42.181 --> 14:43.983 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
make our trade agreement better.

14:44.016 --> 14:49.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The announcement
sets in motion
90 days of consultations with
Congress.

14:49.388 --> 14:52.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then negotiations begin with
Mexico and
Canada.

14:52.925 --> 14:57.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street, stocks
rallied a minor
drubbing after yesterday's
drubbing.

14:57.830 --> 15:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 56
points to close at 20663.

15:01.467 --> 15:08.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose nearly 44, and
the S&amp;P 500
added eight.

15:08.908 --> 15:13.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what's at
stake during President Trump's
trip abroad;

15:13.512 --> 15:19.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the choice between moderate and
hard-line
candidates in Iran's upcoming
presidential

15:19.685 --> 15:32.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
election; and much more.

15:32.131 --> 15:37.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We return now to the
investigations into Russia's
role in last year's election and
the relationship,

15:38.003 --> 15:40.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
any relationship with the Trump
campaign.

15:40.439 --> 15:45.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Angus King of Maine
attended this
afternoon's closed briefing with
the deputy

15:45.144 --> 15:47.746 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
attorney general, Rod
Rosenstein.

15:47.780 --> 15:51.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator King sits on the Select
Committee
on Intelligence.

15:51.050 --> 15:53.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he joins us now from Capitol
Hill.

15:53.319 --> 15:55.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator King, thank you very
much for joining
us.

15:55.454 --> 15:59.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of people have many
questions for the
deputy attorney general.

15:59.058 --> 16:00.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What did you learn from today's
briefing?

16:00.926 --> 16:02.561 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:02.594 --> 16:04.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGUS KING (I), Maine: Well, I
think there
were a couple things that we
learned.

16:04.363 --> 16:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One that came out actually in
his opening
statement, which I think caught
everybody

16:08.167 --> 16:13.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a little bit by surprise, he
said that he
learned that President Trump had
intended

16:13.739 --> 16:20.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to fire Director Comey before he
wrote the
memo, which, of course, was then
used later

16:20.879 --> 16:25.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on by the White House and by
President Trump
in his letter to Director Comey
as the justification

16:26.018 --> 16:27.586 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for the firing.

16:27.619 --> 16:31.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I -- he was asked about it
two or three
times, as I mentioned.

16:31.056 --> 16:33.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As I say, he mentioned it in his
opening statement.

16:33.258 --> 16:34.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that was a little bit
surprising.

16:35.027 --> 16:39.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, we knew that the White
House changed
the justification for the
firing.

16:39.798 --> 16:43.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump changed it
himself two or
three days later, but, at the
time, the whole

16:43.635 --> 16:46.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
argument was the firing was
based upon the
memo.

16:46.438 --> 16:47.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

16:47.439 --> 16:49.341 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:49.375 --> 16:51.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGUS KING: Now we learn that
the firing decision
had been made before the memo
was written.

16:51.143 --> 16:55.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Did he then
explain, did the
deputy attorney general go on to
explain why

16:55.981 --> 16:57.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he did so, why he wrote the
memo?

16:57.916 --> 16:58.884 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:58.917 --> 17:00.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANGUS KING: Well, he didn't.

17:00.919 --> 17:04.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wouldn't answer questions
about any details
about why he wrote it, who wrote
it, who contributed

17:04.990 --> 17:07.359 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to it, whether there were edits.

17:07.393 --> 17:11.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this was sort of second
thing that came
out of the meeting, because he
said this may

17:11.930 --> 17:16.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be part of Robert Mueller's
investigation.

17:16.635 --> 17:21.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This whole -- the whole firing
of Comey may
be part of that investigation,
so, therefore,

17:21.907 --> 17:27.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can't talk about it, which I
think that
was also somewhat surprising,
that he views

17:27.212 --> 17:33.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the scope of Robert Mueller's
investigation
as pretty broad, which now
apparently includes

17:33.452 --> 17:36.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the circumstances surrounding
the firing of
James Comey.

17:36.355 --> 17:41.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, this is
a subjective
question, but did you get the
sense from Mr.

17:41.527 --> 17:45.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rosenstein that he -- he feels
he may have
done something wrong here?

17:45.631 --> 17:46.598 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

17:46.632 --> 17:47.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANGUS KING: No, I didn't.

17:47.633 --> 17:50.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was -- he wasn't apologetic.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He was quite assertive,
actually.

17:52.671 --> 17:54.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he stood by his memo.

17:55.007 --> 17:59.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then, when he was pressed
about, why did
you write it and how did it
actually come

17:59.578 --> 18:04.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about and who talked about it,
that's when
he said, I can't answer that
question, and

18:04.049 --> 18:11.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he said that probably 10 times,
because this
may be part of Robert Mueller's
FBI investigation.

18:11.423 --> 18:16.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What does that
tell you, though,
Senator, about what -- how much
the Senate

18:16.862 --> 18:22.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Intelligence Committee, any of
these investigative
committees, are going to be able
to find out,

18:22.134 --> 18:26.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if that's going to be the answer
you get as
you try to get to the bottom of
some of these

18:26.972 --> 18:27.940 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
hard questions?

18:27.973 --> 18:29.942 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

18:29.975 --> 18:31.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGUS KING: Well, I don't think
that's necessarily
the answer that we're going to
get, particularly

18:31.176 --> 18:32.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a closed session.

18:32.478 --> 18:35.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
By the way, I'm not sure why
this session
today was closed.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think there was anything
said that
was classified.

18:38.050 --> 18:39.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
At least I didn't hear it.

18:39.685 --> 18:45.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he stated himself that the
opening statement
that I cited wasn't classified.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.359 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But we will be having sessions.

18:47.392 --> 18:50.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, one of the things -- I
talked with
one of the members of the
committee right

18:50.929 --> 18:52.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
after the meeting this
afternoon.

18:52.898 --> 18:57.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our committee has to sit down
with Robert
Mueller and talk about how we
will coordinate

18:57.736 --> 18:59.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the two investigations.

18:59.071 --> 19:01.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't want to get in each
other's way.

19:01.773 --> 19:05.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't want to offer immunity
or have them
offer immunity that would
compromise either

19:05.477 --> 19:07.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
one of our investigations.

19:07.179 --> 19:11.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, basically, you have two
investigations
running in parallel.

19:11.450 --> 19:19.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their -- the FBI is a law
enforcement agency,
and they're looking at whether
laws were broken

19:19.057 --> 19:21.026 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this country.

19:21.059 --> 19:29.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're a fact-finding agency, and
-- or committee,
and we will -- the -- as I say,
the two investigations

19:29.334 --> 19:34.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are running in the same
direction, and we're
going to try to deconflict and
be in touch

19:34.072 --> 19:35.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as we move forward.

19:35.541 --> 19:37.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that's certainly
possible to do.

19:37.576 --> 19:39.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, that's my
question.

19:39.344 --> 19:42.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How concerned are you that
you're going to
able to do that, given what
you're already

19:42.814 --> 19:44.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
discovering today from Mr.
Rosenstein?

19:44.616 --> 19:46.418 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

19:46.451 --> 19:49.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANGUS KING: Well, he was
reluctant -- I mean,
he wasn't answering questions
because he said

19:49.254 --> 19:51.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this may be part of this
investigation.

19:51.757 --> 19:57.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to be talking to
Director Mueller
about the investigation.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think we're going to be
able to get the
information that we need.

19:59.865 --> 20:04.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have gotten good cooperation
thus far from
the FBI, from the CIA, from the
NSA, from

20:04.803 --> 20:06.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the other intelligence agencies.

20:06.371 --> 20:08.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think this is going to
be a problem.

20:08.807 --> 20:13.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's one that it's going to
take some
discussion and some work in
order to be sure

20:13.078 --> 20:18.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that we're -- we are not
stepping on each
other's toes, because we're all
headed in

20:18.050 --> 20:19.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the same direction.

20:19.751 --> 20:22.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, remember, this
investigation, all the
attention is to the Trump
campaign.

20:22.487 --> 20:23.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

20:23.488 --> 20:25.224 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:25.257 --> 20:28.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGUS KING: This is about a
foreign government
interfering in our democratic
process.

20:28.694 --> 20:32.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And let's always remember that
that's what
it is, and that's why it's so
important.

20:32.231 --> 20:38.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But is it also
about a potential
obstruction of justice or a
potential effort

20:38.270 --> 20:43.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to stop an investigation that
might be harming
the president?

20:43.108 --> 20:44.943 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:44.977 --> 20:47.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGUS KING: Well, I'm not going
to -- I mean,
that's going to be part of the
investigation.

20:47.112 --> 20:52.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's certainly what the deputy
attorney
general indicated today, was
that the investigation

20:52.351 --> 20:56.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the FBI is going to undertake
-- or is
undertaking.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's been going on for some
time.

20:58.490 --> 21:00.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's going to be very broad in
scope.

21:00.859 --> 21:03.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, all the facts are going to
be on the table.

21:03.795 --> 21:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And whenever you begin an
investigation, you
never know exactly where it's
going to lead

21:08.233 --> 21:09.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or what the facts are going to
be.

21:10.002 --> 21:15.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But my goal is to get the
information so that,
ultimately, we can report to the
American

21:15.374 --> 21:19.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people -- and hopefully a lot of
our hearings
will be in public, so the
American people

21:19.544 --> 21:25.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will travel this road with us --
what happened,
why it happened, how it
happened, and, most

21:25.584 --> 21:29.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
importantly, how do we keep it
from happening
again?

21:29.087 --> 21:31.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Judy, this is not a one-off for
the Russians.

21:31.890 --> 21:33.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is what they do.

21:33.792 --> 21:38.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are going to try to
continue to be
involved in our democratic
process here, whether

21:38.664 --> 21:43.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's state election processes or
national
elections.

21:43.035 --> 21:44.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have got to figure out
how to defend
ourselves.

21:44.903 --> 21:48.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, so just
finally, Senator,
today, President Trump said
again that he

21:48.807 --> 21:53.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has no business dealings with
Russia, no connections
with Russia.

21:53.512 --> 21:56.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that in any sense reassuring
to you?

21:56.114 --> 21:57.816 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:57.849 --> 22:00.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGUS KING: Well, if that were
the end of
the matter, we would all have to
say we're

22:00.485 --> 22:02.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not going to do these
investigations.

22:02.654 --> 22:07.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, clearly, there are --
there's information
that we need to get to the
bottom of.

22:07.659 --> 22:13.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I'm delighted that he
takes that position,
and hope that he's proven
correct.

22:13.565 --> 22:19.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, if that's true, if he
is correct,
then they should be falling all
over themselves

22:19.104 --> 22:22.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to help with us this
investigation in order
to clear the air on this.

22:22.808 --> 22:27.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have got to follow the
facts in order
to reassure the American people
as to what

22:27.846 --> 22:29.681 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
went on here.

22:29.715 --> 22:31.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, as I'm sure
you know,
the president today called it
all a witch-hunt,

22:31.883 --> 22:36.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said that people are after
information that
he said is a big waste of time.

22:36.555 --> 22:38.457 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

22:38.490 --> 22:42.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANGUS KING: I wouldn't
participate in a witch-hunt,
Judy, nor would I participate in
a whitewash.

22:42.794 --> 22:45.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a very serious matter.

22:45.097 --> 22:49.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it deserves serious work and
consideration.

22:49.267 --> 22:51.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what we're going to
do.

22:51.203 --> 22:55.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Angus
King, a member
of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, Senator,

22:55.240 --> 22:56.775 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thank you.

22:56.808 --> 22:58.343 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

22:58.377 --> 23:06.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANGUS KING: Thank you, Judy.

23:06.351 --> 23:12.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump,
as we have
been reporting, leaves tomorrow
for his first

23:12.624 --> 23:15.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
overseas trip, and it's a long,
intense schedule.

23:15.961 --> 23:21.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He will travel to Saudi Arabia,
Israel, the
West Bank, the Vatican for an
audience with

23:21.333 --> 23:27.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the pope, on to NATO
headquarters in Brussels,
and, finally, next Friday, to
Sicily for a

23:27.272 --> 23:29.074 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
G7 meeting.

23:29.107 --> 23:33.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A short time ago, I spoke to two
people with
lengthy experience in American
diplomacy and

23:33.779 --> 23:38.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
foreign affairs, former
Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who served
in the Bill

23:38.250 --> 23:43.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton administration, and
Stephen Hadley,
who was George W. Bush's
national security

23:43.155 --> 23:44.990 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
adviser.

23:45.023 --> 23:48.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I started by asking Secretary
Albright about
her expectations for the
president's ambitious

23:48.927 --> 23:50.695 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
trip.

23:50.729 --> 23:51.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT, Former U.S.
Secretary
of State: Well, I think it's a
very complicated

23:51.863 --> 23:53.665 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
trip.

23:53.698 --> 23:56.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just think about it, going to
Saudi Arabia,
meeting with a lot of Muslim
leaders, as well

23:56.802 --> 24:03.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as the leadership there, then in
Israel, then
meeting with President Abbas,
then going to

24:03.475 --> 24:08.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rome, the Vatican, to meet with
the pope,
then going to NATO, then the G7.

24:08.580 --> 24:11.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What could possibly go wrong?

24:11.249 --> 24:13.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it is a very tiring trip.

24:13.819 --> 24:19.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the question is,
what is the purpose
of it in terms of showing
support for what's

24:19.391 --> 24:20.826 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going on in the Middle East?

24:20.859 --> 24:23.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the question is what
they want
to accomplish.

24:23.728 --> 24:30.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think it has -- I don't
think we should
have a low bar for it, however,
because there's

24:30.302 --> 24:32.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an awful lot that needs to be
done.

24:32.437 --> 24:34.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's just a very long trip.

24:34.306 --> 24:37.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you think,
Steve Hadley,
that the possibilities for
success are greater

24:37.576 --> 24:39.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than the pitfalls?

24:39.411 --> 24:44.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I'm reading a lot in the
coverage of -- running
up to the trip that the
expectation is there

24:44.416 --> 24:46.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are many places where there
could be a problem.

24:46.685 --> 24:49.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN HADLEY, Former U.S.
National Security
Adviser: Well, yes and no.

24:49.521 --> 24:54.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it will be the first
time that the
world will see President Trump
as president

24:54.759 --> 24:56.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the world stage.

24:56.761 --> 25:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's important that it succeeds
for him and
for our country that it
succeeds.

25:01.099 --> 25:06.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the first part of the
trip, you know,
the people in the Middle East
really want

25:06.071 --> 25:14.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have a strong relationship
with this administration,
want it -- our policy to go in a
little bit

25:14.279 --> 25:18.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a different direction, being
a little more
confrontational with Iran, being
a little

25:18.950 --> 25:23.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more aggressive against ISIS,
reconnecting
with the traditional allies.

25:23.555 --> 25:30.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think Israel, Saudi,
the Palestinians,
they all have an interest in
making this trip

25:30.996 --> 25:33.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
successful for their own
purposes.

25:33.565 --> 25:39.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, meeting with the
pope, you
know, is usually a win for any
president.

25:39.704 --> 25:43.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think the first half of
the trip ought
to go pretty well.

25:43.909 --> 25:49.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More concerned about late in the
trip, when
the president's a little tired,
more problematic

25:49.614 --> 25:52.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
meeting with the E.U., meeting
with NATO.

25:52.050 --> 25:57.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
G7, again, probably ought to be
a little downhill
because it's with our
traditional friends

25:57.155 --> 25:58.123 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and allies.

25:58.156 --> 25:59.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it's -- but it's going to be
grueling.

26:00.025 --> 26:01.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a long period of time.

26:01.826 --> 26:05.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president hasn't done this
kind of trip
as president.

26:05.530 --> 26:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The days are long and the
agenda.

26:07.599 --> 26:10.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it's going to be -- this is
not easy.

26:10.035 --> 26:16.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he's someone who, you know,
knows how
to be in front of the camera,
and is comfortable

26:16.708 --> 26:19.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
being in that position.

26:19.177 --> 26:21.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I think it will probably go
pretty well.

26:21.246 --> 26:24.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Secretary
Albright, so, while
the president is taking off on
this trip,

26:24.249 --> 26:30.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of controversy he's
leaving behind here
at home over the firing of the
FBI director,

26:31.022 --> 26:35.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the naming of a special counsel
to look into
the Russia -- potential Russia
connections

26:35.694 --> 26:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between his campaign, the
leaking, alleged
leaking of classified
information to Russian

26:41.099 --> 26:43.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
officials by the president
himself.

26:43.368 --> 26:48.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much does all that back home
hang over
a trip when a president travels?

26:48.406 --> 26:50.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: I think it
definitely
does hang on it.

26:50.809 --> 26:55.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the other part that I think
people don't
recognize often, you take press
with you,

26:55.513 --> 26:57.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and it's American press.

26:57.382 --> 27:02.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I know from various times
that I traveled
is issues that are going on at
home are asked

27:02.754 --> 27:04.122 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by the American reporters.

27:04.155 --> 27:07.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so it's very hard to
insulate yourself
from that.

27:07.258 --> 27:13.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the question will be, I
think he can probably
be very calm in terms of talking
about what

27:13.064 --> 27:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the foreign policy agenda is.

27:14.966 --> 27:19.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He may get irritated at some of
the ways that
the questions are asked about
what's going

27:19.137 --> 27:20.538 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on at home.

27:20.572 --> 27:23.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then it isn't as if the
Russians are just
going to be silent.

27:23.375 --> 27:29.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are having a very good time
kind of observing
the turbulence that's going on.

27:29.681 --> 27:33.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And something that you ran
yesterday, it was
very clear that they said they
looked at the

27:33.752 --> 27:36.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
turbulence of information with
pleasure.

27:36.121 --> 27:44.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stephen Hadley,
what about
this question about so much
smoke, controversy

27:44.295 --> 27:46.131 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
here at home?

27:46.164 --> 27:50.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much do those headlines and
those -- does
that follow him, the president,
when he travels?

27:50.435 --> 27:54.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN HADLEY: As Madeleine
says, it follows
him, because he takes a press
corps with him.

27:54.472 --> 28:00.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, in all these trips,
the press
is more interested in asking the
president

28:00.278 --> 28:05.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
questions about the issues that
are driving
the debate in Washington, and
less interested

28:05.583 --> 28:13.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in asking about the trip, which
is the challenge,
to try to get their message
through in terms

28:13.291 --> 28:15.026 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of this trip.

28:15.060 --> 28:18.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they will do it by what the
president
says, about the meetings, about
the visuals,

28:18.396 --> 28:21.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the deliverables from --
come to the
trip.

28:21.332 --> 28:27.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the challenge will be to get
the message
from the trip and the success
they hope to

28:27.472 --> 28:33.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get from this -- the trip to
make it back
to the United States and back to
the American

28:33.044 --> 28:37.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people, over the effort by the
press to make
it all about what's going on in
Washington.

28:37.315 --> 28:40.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, one of the
things -- I
was at a briefing at the White
House today,

28:40.351 --> 28:45.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary Albright, and they are
talking about,
you know, how pleased they are
to be bringing

28:45.323 --> 28:50.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
together so many Muslim
countries to step
up the fight against terrorism.

28:50.528 --> 28:56.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If that's what they're able to
do with this
meeting in Saudi Arabia, how
significant is

28:56.401 --> 28:58.036 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that?

28:58.069 --> 29:00.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Well, I
think it would
be significant, but it's not
easy.

29:00.205 --> 29:05.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, basically, if they have all
the Muslims,
there will be Sunni and Shia,
which is then

29:05.243 --> 29:08.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reflected in their relationship
with Iran.

29:08.113 --> 29:13.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iran will be a sub-subject, no
matter what,
basically it's basically -- I
think, whenever

29:13.084 --> 29:17.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have been with the Saudis, it
is very clear
that that is their number one
nemesis.

29:17.388 --> 29:21.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the question is how the
president works
his way through that.

29:21.659 --> 29:26.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think that what Steve said
is absolutely
right, is they are -- the Saudis
want to have

29:26.631 --> 29:28.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a good meeting.

29:28.099 --> 29:32.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are about to get a very
large deliverable,
which is an arms sale.

29:32.303 --> 29:35.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then they want to be the
center of new
activity.

29:36.007 --> 29:39.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Actually, I think, Steve, they
might have
read our report, in terms of...

29:39.410 --> 29:41.312 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

29:41.346 --> 29:43.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: ... we were
talking about
the importance of having a
regional organization.

29:43.748 --> 29:47.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are talking, and so is the
president,
about doing something about
that.

29:47.185 --> 29:49.020 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So they do want to make it work.

29:49.053 --> 29:54.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the Muslim part of this is
complicated,
especially since there are
Muslims who believe

29:54.392 --> 29:57.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that President Trump doesn't
like Muslims.

29:57.896 --> 30:00.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I -- if I were a journalist,
I would ask
about the ban.

30:00.632 --> 30:05.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and which
the president
talked about during the
campaign, but has

30:05.036 --> 30:07.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
soft-pedaled as president.

30:07.605 --> 30:12.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Steve Hadley, if -- again, if
the administration
is able to pull together of
something together

30:12.610 --> 30:16.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the way of an announcement
from a group
of Muslim countries that they
are spending

30:16.881 --> 30:19.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more on counterterrorism, how
significant?

30:19.384 --> 30:21.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEPHEN HADLEY: I think it will
be significant.

30:21.486 --> 30:25.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think what the president
is going to
try to do -- and I think one of
the most important

30:25.256 --> 30:29.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
pieces of this trip, I
understand he's going
to give a speech in Saudi
Arabia.

30:29.427 --> 30:31.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that speech will be very
important.

30:31.529 --> 30:39.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what they want to do is
to show that
they are working with and
rallying the Muslim

30:39.170 --> 30:48.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world to be in solidarity
against the extremists,
to have the capabilities to cut
off their

30:48.546 --> 30:54.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
money, and to really be in
solidarity, and
committed in a way that many
Americans think

30:54.986 --> 30:58.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Muslim countries in that region
have not been
committed against terrorism.

30:58.256 --> 31:01.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If he can come back with that
message, I think
that's a win for him.

31:01.492 --> 31:04.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is that
something, though,
that makes a difference in the
fight against

31:04.395 --> 31:06.197 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
terrorism?

31:06.231 --> 31:09.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Well, I
think it would
if it really has everybody
working together.

31:09.400 --> 31:15.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think it's very important
to get the
Muslim community to recognize
that ISIS is

31:15.340 --> 31:19.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- has hijacked a religion that
is a peaceful
religion.

31:19.544 --> 31:26.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So -- but I think the
difficulties of writing
a speech such as this one and
kind of touching

31:26.050 --> 31:30.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the bases and using the right
adjectives and
a number of different things
that we have

31:30.255 --> 31:34.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all been through, it is a --
it's not going
to be simple.

31:34.158 --> 31:39.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think that there are
possibilities here,
the whole kind of Arab
initiative initially

31:39.264 --> 31:44.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on the Middle East peace
process, the extent
to which the president is
willing to get into

31:44.435 --> 31:46.304 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

31:46.337 --> 31:49.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is nothing more
dangerous than making
a mistake on some of the issues,
because they

31:49.941 --> 31:53.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all have a great history, and
you really do
have to study it.

31:53.444 --> 31:54.846 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I think we did.

31:54.879 --> 31:57.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so that's the question about
how much
homework the president has done.

31:57.882 --> 32:00.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly,
Steve Hadley,
that is another message coming
from the White

32:00.885 --> 32:04.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House today, from a White House
official,
saying they have high hopes,
that, yes, it's

32:04.656 --> 32:09.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just the beginning, but they do
believe they
can start to make progress on an
Israeli-Palestinian

32:09.193 --> 32:10.161 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agreement.

32:10.194 --> 32:11.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEPHEN HADLEY: I think that's
right.

32:11.696 --> 32:14.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think we shouldn't have
too exaggerated
expectations of this trip.

32:14.332 --> 32:18.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think you ought to think about
it as, it's
a debut for the president to
show himself

32:18.369 --> 32:24.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as president on the world stage,
and to try
to set the table now for some
initiatives

32:24.442 --> 32:29.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and strategies that will be
fully developed
in the weeks and months ahead
that might achieve

32:29.247 --> 32:30.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
some off these objectives.

32:30.548 --> 32:33.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they can do those two things,
it will be
a successful trip.

32:33.284 --> 32:35.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we will all
be watching
very closely.

32:35.954 --> 32:39.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: And I think
we wish him
well for the United States, for
the sake of

32:39.490 --> 32:41.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the United States and the Middle
East.

32:41.392 --> 32:42.360 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEPHEN HADLEY: Absolutely.

32:42.393 --> 32:43.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you, both.

32:43.394 --> 32:44.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Thank you.

32:44.662 --> 32:46.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Secretary
Madeleine Albright,
Steve Hadley.

32:46.164 --> 32:52.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEPHEN HADLEY: Nice to be with
you.

32:52.904 --> 33:02.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The people of
Iran go to the
polls tomorrow to vote in a
controlled, but

33:02.447 --> 33:05.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
still heated presidential
election.

33:05.149 --> 33:09.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
From Tehran, special
correspondent Reza Sayah
reports.

33:09.287 --> 33:14.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REZA SAYAH: It's the closing
stretch in Iran's
presidential race.

33:14.592 --> 33:21.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the capital, Tehran, is at
fever pitch,
from the streets, to sports
arenas, and campaign

33:21.933 --> 33:23.301 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
headquarters.

33:23.334 --> 33:27.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The candidates' foot soldiers
make a final
push to win over voters.

33:27.972 --> 33:33.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an election that will pit
liberals vs.
conservatives, determine
domestic policy,

33:33.144 --> 33:36.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and shape Iran's relations with
the West.

33:36.381 --> 33:41.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Zeinab Asgharpour wants another
four years
from incumbent President Hassan
Rouhani.

33:41.652 --> 33:45.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZEINAB ASGHARPOUR, Iran (through
translator):
These last days can make a huge
difference.

33:45.923 --> 33:48.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's up to us to whip up
excitement.

33:48.292 --> 33:51.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we do that, God willing, we
will have good
results.

33:51.262 --> 33:55.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REZA SAYAH: Rouhani's government
signed the
historic nuclear deal with the
U.S. and other

33:55.900 --> 34:02.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world powers in 2015, the first
agreement
involving Washington and Tehran
since Iran's

34:02.440 --> 34:04.776 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
1979 revolution.

34:04.809 --> 34:09.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The deal lifted international
sanctions, giving
Iran access to global markets.

34:09.280 --> 34:12.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HASSAN ROUHANI, Iranian
President (through
translator): Have them tell you
what they

34:12.717 --> 34:14.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have done for the past 38 years.

34:14.419 --> 34:17.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What I have done in the past
four years is
quite clear.

34:17.688 --> 34:21.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REZA SAYAH: But Iran's economy
is still struggling.

34:21.125 --> 34:26.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The moderate reformer and his
supporters say,
let's be patient and move
forward.

34:26.097 --> 34:30.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAMIDEH ASHOURI, Iran (through
translator):
Maybe we didn't have an actual
war, but there

34:30.134 --> 34:31.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was a domestic struggle.

34:31.335 --> 34:33.304 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We faced harsh sanctions.

34:33.337 --> 34:34.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
People suffered to survive.

34:34.705 --> 34:36.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The last thing we want is to go
backwards.

34:36.541 --> 34:39.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
REZA SAYAH: But Rouhani
supporters are nervous.

34:39.477 --> 34:45.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a serious conservative
challenge
from hard-line cleric Ebrahim
Raisi.

34:45.883 --> 34:52.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Come this weekend, Rouhani is
gone," cries
rally leader Mahdi Armaghani.

34:52.056 --> 34:55.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAHDI ARMAGHANI, Iran (through
translator):
We believe we are standing by
the side of

34:55.960 --> 34:58.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
God, and God will definitely
stand by us.

34:58.362 --> 35:04.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REZA SAYAH: Raisi is Iran's
former top prosecutor,
linked to mass executions of
political dissidents

35:04.702 --> 35:06.571 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 1988.

35:06.604 --> 35:11.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's never been elected to
office, but is
backed by the clerical
establishment, an important

35:11.542 --> 35:13.311 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
endorsement.

35:13.344 --> 35:17.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some say he's being groomed to
succeed Iran's
supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei.

35:17.615 --> 35:24.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In campaign speeches, Raisi
accuses Rouhani
of ignoring the poor and failing
to deliver

35:24.055 --> 35:26.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the promised benefits of the
nuclear agreement.

35:26.557 --> 35:30.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EBRAHIM RAISI, Iranian
Presidential Candidate
(through translator): Most of
our challenges

35:30.294 --> 35:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can be solved with our nation's
resources,
our potential, strong
leadership, our people's

35:35.266 --> 35:36.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
revolutionary values.

35:37.001 --> 35:43.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REZA SAYAH: At this Raisi rally,
a film taunts
President Rouhani, suggesting he
sold out

35:43.141 --> 35:46.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his revolutionary values to cozy
up to Washington.

35:46.110 --> 35:48.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MORTEZA JAVID, Iran (through
translator):
All these sanctions are in
place.

35:48.379 --> 35:49.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We lost our dignity.

35:49.514 --> 35:51.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's no doubt it's time for
change.

35:51.449 --> 35:57.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REZA SAYAH: Raisi's backers are
mostly conservative,
devoted to Iran's revolutionary
values and

35:57.088 --> 35:58.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
deeply suspicious of the West.

35:58.956 --> 36:04.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MOGHADAM, Iran: His main
attention will be
on us, inside the border.

36:04.462 --> 36:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REZA SAYAH: Some still chant
"Death to America."

36:09.433 --> 36:12.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rouhani's supporters want to
silence those
chants.

36:12.537 --> 36:17.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They demand social and political
reform and
better relations with the West.

36:17.475 --> 36:23.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say a vote for Raisi is a
return to isolation
and confrontation.

36:23.481 --> 36:26.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HAMIDEH ASHOURI (through
translator): America
is bad, but it's not all bad.

36:26.817 --> 36:31.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we keep fighting and beating
ourselves
up, nothing will ever get done.

36:31.355 --> 36:35.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REZA SAYAH: Tehran-based
political analyst
Mohammad Marandi says President
Donald Trump's

36:35.726 --> 36:41.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aggressive tone towards Iran,
coupled with
some U.S. sanctions still in
effect, have

36:41.098 --> 36:43.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
put Rouhani's reelection in
jeopardy.

36:43.568 --> 36:49.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just this week, the Trump
administration imposed
new sanctions against Iran over
its ballistic

36:49.840 --> 36:51.609 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
missile program.

36:51.642 --> 36:54.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHAMMAD MARANDI, Political
Analyst: They
have not abided by their side of
the bargain.

36:54.312 --> 36:59.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And by doing so, they hurt
President Rouhani,
his credibility.

36:59.984 --> 37:05.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REZA SAYAH: Marandi says, no
matter who wins
the vote, U.S.-Iran relations
will remain

37:05.156 --> 37:08.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
icy, and, he says, there is
little chance
of confrontation.

37:08.459 --> 37:13.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHAMMAD MARANDI: The Iranians
recognize that
the United States is in a very
difficult position,

37:13.130 --> 37:17.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that it cannot launch another
war.

37:17.101 --> 37:20.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think that there is any
chance of
military conflict.

37:20.204 --> 37:23.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REZA SAYAH: In Northern Tehran
this week,
this has been a nightly ritual,
people in

37:23.374 --> 37:29.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cars, on foot making a lot of
noise for their
favorite candidate.

37:29.380 --> 37:39.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe one of the most surprising
aspects this
campaign is how tolerant
security forces have

37:39.423 --> 37:44.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe one of the most surprising
aspects this
campaign is how tolerant
security forces have

37:44.528 --> 37:46.230 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
been.

37:46.264 --> 37:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People are able to gather,
demonstrate, and
chant slogans, even slogans that
were very

37:49.934 --> 37:51.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
taboo just eight years ago.

37:51.736 --> 37:56.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When an estimated 25,000 Rouhani
supporters
packed Tehran's main sports
arena this week,

37:56.674 --> 38:03.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the loudest cheers were for Mir
Hossein Mousavi,
the reformist candidate whose
defeat in 2009

38:03.481 --> 38:06.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sparked mass protests by the
Green Movement.

38:06.284 --> 38:11.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government crushed the
protests, but the
color green sits next to the
Rouhani campaign's

38:11.155 --> 38:15.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
purple banners, still
symbolizing the demand
for democratic change.

38:16.027 --> 38:22.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
No matter who voters are
supporting, their
number one demand is for the
next president

38:22.400 --> 38:24.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to make life more affordable.

38:24.201 --> 38:28.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHAMMAD MARANDI: I think that
the important
thing for Iranians right now is
the state

38:28.439 --> 38:29.674 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the economy.

38:29.707 --> 38:32.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REZA SAYAH: Three out of 10
young Iranians
don't have jobs.

38:32.910 --> 38:35.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many can't afford to get married
or buy a
home.

38:35.813 --> 38:38.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rouhani wants more time to fix
the economy.

38:38.616 --> 38:43.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The lifting of international
sanctions increased
oil sales and curbed inflation,
but the billions

38:43.821 --> 38:48.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of dollars in foreign investment
President
Rouhani promised have yet to
arrive.

38:48.893 --> 38:53.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Raisi says he will fight
corruption, build
low-income housing, and double
cash subsidies

38:53.864 --> 38:55.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the poor.

38:55.733 --> 39:00.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REZA SAYAH: Former banker and
economic analyst
Sadegh Samii says Iran's economy
will continue

39:00.571 --> 39:06.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to struggle as long as U.S.
sanctions continue
to block Iran from the
international banking

39:06.143 --> 39:07.845 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
system.

39:07.878 --> 39:09.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SADEGH SAMII, Economic Analyst:
If I want
to transfer $1,000 to my
children to Canada

39:09.880 --> 39:12.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
through the banking system, it's
impossible.

39:13.017 --> 39:20.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even European banks are afraid
of being fined
by the U.S. Treasury if they
work with Iran.

39:20.157 --> 39:24.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Without the Western money,
without the Western
banking system, nothing, nothing
can possibly

39:24.662 --> 39:26.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
function within this country.

39:26.397 --> 39:30.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REZA SAYAH: No incumbent
president in Iran
has failed to win a second term
since the

39:30.434 --> 39:32.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
1979 Islamic Revolution.

39:32.837 --> 39:38.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Zeinab Asgharpour and fellow
Rouhani supporters
roam Tehran's streets, pleading
for voters

39:38.909 --> 39:40.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to keep that streak alive.

39:40.544 --> 39:49.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Reza
Sayah in
Tehran.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Now special
correspondent Charlayne
Hunter-Gault has a story on how
a once-segregated

39:59.430 --> 40:03.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pocket of a small Southern town
is making
a comeback.

40:03.334 --> 40:05.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of our Race Matters
series.

40:05.403 --> 40:10.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: The
city's historic
African-American business
district, known

40:10.307 --> 40:15.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as the Hot Corner, helped foster
commerce
in a place once steeped in
segregation.

40:15.813 --> 40:22.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Athens native Homer Wilson, who
owns a popular
barbershop, explains how the Hot
Corner developed

40:23.020 --> 40:24.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the Jim Crow era.

40:24.889 --> 40:30.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOMER WILSON, Owner, Wilson's
Styling Shop:
It was all-black from -- we call
it the bottom,

40:30.828 --> 40:32.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all the way down.

40:32.830 --> 40:34.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're just black business.

40:34.732 --> 40:37.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: What
type of businesses?

40:37.601 --> 40:42.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOMER WILSON: Funeral home
businesses, dentists,
lawyers, motels, you name it.

40:42.907 --> 40:46.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: That was
essential
for the black community, which
had few other

40:46.744 --> 40:51.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
choices and could not use the
then white-only
businesses uptown.

40:51.248 --> 40:55.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fifty-six years ago, when I was
one of first
two black students at the
University of Georgia,

40:55.920 --> 40:59.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I couldn't come into Athens and
go to a movie
theater like this.

40:59.490 --> 41:05.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I couldn't even take bowling
because the bowling
alley was here, and it was
segregated.

41:05.196 --> 41:10.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But after flourishing, many Hot
Corner businesses
moved to malls farther out
during the '70s

41:10.734 --> 41:12.603 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or died.

41:12.636 --> 41:17.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Homer Wilson held on to his
family's property,
home to Wilson's Soul Food, for
three decades.

41:17.741 --> 41:18.709 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And then:

41:18.742 --> 41:21.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is your place here?

41:21.111 --> 41:26.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Forty-one-year-old David Eduardo
came knocking,
in search of a place to rent for
his restaurant

41:26.484 --> 41:28.552 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he calls The World Famous.

41:28.586 --> 41:32.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID EDUARDO, Owner, The World
Famous: The
Hot Corner is a great place to
do business.

41:33.023 --> 41:34.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: What
drew you to it?

41:34.959 --> 41:38.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID EDUARDO: The fact that
there was a restaurant
there before that had a strong
30-plus-year

41:38.996 --> 41:41.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
run of success was very
encouraging.

41:41.699 --> 41:46.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They a had great reputation, and
we could
only hope to be half as
successful as they

41:46.971 --> 41:48.205 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
were.

41:48.239 --> 41:49.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So, you
went to Mr.
Wilson and said?

41:49.840 --> 41:52.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID EDUARDO: And begged him
for the opportunity
to open up shop next door.

41:52.343 --> 41:55.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And what
did you think
about that, Mr. Wilson, the
white boy coming

41:55.145 --> 41:56.280 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in?

41:56.313 --> 42:00.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOMER WILSON: Well, you know, he
wasn't the
first one.

42:00.251 --> 42:02.086 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:02.119 --> 42:08.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOMER WILSON: So, we had a lot
of great chances
to rent it to a lot of people,
but David was

42:08.259 --> 42:09.593 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more persistent.

42:09.627 --> 42:12.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID EDUARDO: The fact that it
is so coveted
is not lost on me.

42:12.496 --> 42:17.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know that with that space
comes tremendous
responsibility and history.

42:17.334 --> 42:21.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we have to be good stewards
for the community.

42:21.639 --> 42:25.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm very, very happy that the
Wilson family
gave us the green light.

42:25.476 --> 42:30.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: A green
light to gentrification,
a turnoff to those who helped
build this area,

42:30.881 --> 42:33.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but the spreading of the welcome
mat to people
from new communities.

42:33.984 --> 42:38.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID EDUARDO: We have cuisine
from everywhere
around the world, our live
entertainment.

42:38.088 --> 42:42.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On any given night, you can find
hip-hop,
comedy, singer-songwriters.

42:42.259 --> 42:45.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want to be a place for
everyone, not just
anyone.

42:45.162 --> 42:52.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOMER WILSON: This end of town
is coming back
to where it used to be, where we
had all this

42:52.102 --> 42:54.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that would go on, on our corner.

42:54.738 --> 42:59.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Both men
agree the
Hot Corner, rich in history,
good and bad,

42:59.577 --> 43:01.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is a special pace.

43:01.412 --> 43:06.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOMER WILSON: There is a spirit
that hovers
over this place makes things,
people mix and

43:06.984 --> 43:11.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mingle different down here than
they do other
places.

43:11.255 --> 43:24.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This togetherness, it can work
if we can learn
to supply the right information
to people.

43:24.535 --> 43:26.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Like
what?

43:26.704 --> 43:32.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOMER WILSON: It's all right to
be white.

43:32.509 --> 43:34.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's all right to be black.

43:34.345 --> 43:35.312 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

43:35.346 --> 43:36.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID EDUARDO: Amen.

43:36.680 --> 43:39.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would encourage folks to just
get out of
their comfort zone.

43:39.984 --> 43:46.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Folks from all cultural
backgrounds, gender,
socioeconomic classes, they
gravitate to this

43:46.523 --> 43:47.491 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
side of town.

43:47.524 --> 43:49.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a very welcoming
environment, I think.

43:49.727 --> 43:53.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Where
once people
were kept from mixing, now the
Hot Corner

43:53.897 --> 43:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has become a hot spot for all.

43:56.367 --> 44:04.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In Athens, Georgia, I'm
Charlayne Hunter-Gault
for the "PBS NewsHour."

44:05.009 --> 44:15.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A question that
has been raised
here: Why aren't more men going
into fields

44:15.819 --> 44:17.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
dominated by women?

44:17.788 --> 44:22.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stigma is a big part of the
answer, our economics
correspondent, Paul Solman,
reported last

44:22.826 --> 44:24.028 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
week.

44:24.061 --> 44:28.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, he focuses on one man
many might
want to emulate.

44:28.065 --> 44:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of our weekly series
Making Sense.

44:30.034 --> 44:32.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAROLD JOHNSON, Elementary
School Teacher:
We already got a man outside,
and I need you

44:32.436 --> 44:34.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be outside, especially at
will linebacker.

44:34.371 --> 44:39.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Harold Johnson
coaches linebackers
for the Ridge View Blazers in
Columbia, South

44:39.543 --> 44:42.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Carolina, where high school
football is a
rite of masculine passage.

44:42.746 --> 44:46.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMOS MYLES, Football Coach: You
start getting
tired, then you start getting
lazy in your

44:46.650 --> 44:47.618 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mind-set.

44:47.651 --> 44:48.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now, hey, you can't think.

44:48.652 --> 44:50.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have to be focused.

44:50.688 --> 44:53.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have to get control of your
breathing.

44:53.123 --> 44:55.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Amos Myles is the
bad cop.

44:55.926 --> 44:58.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Harold Johnson isn't exactly
the good
one.

44:58.295 --> 44:59.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAROLD JOHNSON: Downhill first.

44:59.430 --> 45:00.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't ever attack lateral.

45:00.798 --> 45:01.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're playing linebacker.

45:01.799 --> 45:03.434 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Downhill first.

45:03.467 --> 45:06.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Pretty much every
high school
football coach is a guy, of
course.

45:06.036 --> 45:10.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And men are no rarity in
secondary school
classrooms either.

45:10.140 --> 45:15.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA BAUM, Educator: It's
about 40 percent
of male teachers at high school
level.

45:15.612 --> 45:21.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But in elementary
school, says
educator Angela Baum, the
percentage is minuscule.

45:21.085 --> 45:25.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA BAUM: So, between 1
percent and 5 percent
of early childhood teachers are
male.

45:25.489 --> 45:29.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Do you guys like
having a man
for your teacher?

45:29.693 --> 45:31.462 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENTS: Yes!

45:31.495 --> 45:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Their teacher is
Harold Johnson,
the linebacker coach, whose main
job turns

45:36.633 --> 45:42.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out to be running this second
grade classroom,
after six years teaching
kindergarten.

45:42.039 --> 45:47.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Early education teacher is a job
for which,
given the labor market for men,
especially

45:47.745 --> 45:52.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the South, qualified guys
would be hired
right away.

45:52.382 --> 45:55.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Harold Johnson has taken
advantage ever since
college.

45:55.152 --> 45:57.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HAROLD JOHNSON: I just decided I
wanted to
be an early childhood major.

45:57.688 --> 46:02.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Smart move, he
learned, as good
male gigs were proving ever
harder to come

46:02.226 --> 46:04.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by in the wake of the crash of
'08.

46:04.061 --> 46:08.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAROLD JOHNSON: The dean of the
colleges came
in to just greet all the
freshmen and stuff,

46:08.499 --> 46:10.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and he kind of walked in, and he
looked around,
and he was giving his speech.

46:10.801 --> 46:12.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He just stopped me.

46:12.536 --> 46:13.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His speech was like, hey that
guy right there
is going to get a job before all
you all.

46:13.103 --> 46:14.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And so I just laughed.

46:14.104 --> 46:15.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I'm looking round, like, me?

46:16.006 --> 46:18.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he was just like, yes, it's
you.

46:18.709 --> 46:24.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But eight years
later, coach
Johnson still has surprisingly
scant competition,

46:24.715 --> 46:27.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when he attends yearly childhood
conferences,
for example.

46:27.584 --> 46:30.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HAROLD JOHNSON: Everybody
looking like, hey
what you doing here?

46:30.420 --> 46:32.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, this isn't P.E. or
anything.

46:32.422 --> 46:34.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I'm just like, I know.

46:34.825 --> 46:37.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's reading and how to teach
kids how to
read.

46:37.194 --> 46:38.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what I'm here for, to
learn that.

46:38.562 --> 46:39.730 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
So...

46:39.763 --> 46:41.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And then they get
embarrassed,
I assume?

46:41.431 --> 46:43.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HAROLD JOHNSON: Yes, there's
somewhat of embarrassment
and somewhat of intrigue.

46:43.500 --> 46:46.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're like, what made you want
to do that,
or like, what made you want to
teach?

46:46.904 --> 46:48.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Same thing that made you want to
teach.

46:48.472 --> 46:50.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Like, you enjoy it.

46:50.340 --> 46:53.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Especially when I was a
kindergarten teacher,
it was definitely like, nobody
could believe

46:53.043 --> 46:54.378 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

46:54.411 --> 46:58.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was just like a, ahhh, kind
of sympathetic
kind of situation.

46:58.115 --> 46:59.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Oh, aren't you
sweet?

46:59.349 --> 47:00.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HAROLD JOHNSON: Yes, aren't you
sweet?

47:00.584 --> 47:03.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: So is there
something different
about him?

47:03.187 --> 47:08.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, he's patient, more patient
than fellow
coach Amos Myles perhaps.

47:08.325 --> 47:11.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But even the ever so macho Myles
says:

47:11.829 --> 47:13.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMOS MYLES: I think patience is
key.

47:14.031 --> 47:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With that, you have to have
patience with
kids.

47:16.400 --> 47:18.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It doesn't matter what level
you're on.

47:18.168 --> 47:21.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUDENT: I really love my
country.

47:21.438 --> 47:26.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HAROLD JOHNSON: First of all,
what was happening?

47:26.810 --> 47:28.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Before we even got to the
passage, what was
happening?

47:28.712 --> 47:32.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: You don't think
there's a difference
in the patience required to be a
kindergarten

47:32.216 --> 47:34.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
teacher, as opposed to, say, a
TV journalist?

47:34.484 --> 47:35.452 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:35.485 --> 47:36.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HAROLD JOHNSON: I personally
don't.

47:36.920 --> 47:39.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just feel like you got the
patience for
what you got patience for.

47:39.356 --> 47:41.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You hold them to a high
standard, then they
will perform.

47:41.491 --> 47:43.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of times, it's like, oh,
they're only
5, they're only 5.

47:43.493 --> 47:46.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, that's why you don't have
patience for
them, because you treat them
like they're

47:46.129 --> 47:47.931 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
only 5.

47:47.965 --> 47:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you treat them like, no,
you're 5, you're
not 4 anymore, you know how to
do this, then

47:49.666 --> 47:51.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you get a better result.

47:51.068 --> 47:53.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think it's just -- the mind
frame of
going into it is one thing.

47:53.136 --> 47:56.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People say patience, but I think
it's not
really patience.

47:56.707 --> 47:59.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Just, you got to teach what you
want to happen.

47:59.176 --> 48:02.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So what Johnson
seems to have
is a different mind frame.

48:02.946 --> 48:06.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAROLD JOHNSON: I feel like that
one thing
people just having the wrong
impression.

48:06.516 --> 48:10.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just, oh, they're little kids,
they're dirty,
they got snot hanging out, they
don't know

48:10.988 --> 48:13.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how to tie their shoes, they
always ask for
something, always whining.

48:13.123 --> 48:16.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I always tell them, OK, I'm
pretty sure
you have got a co-worker there
always asking

48:16.693 --> 48:20.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you for stuff, that's always
aggravating,
that always, maybe not being
dirty, might

48:20.197 --> 48:21.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have snot running out their nose
too.

48:21.565 --> 48:23.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She was too smart at that
school.

48:23.500 --> 48:25.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She don't have any way to help
her.

48:25.235 --> 48:29.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In fact, what
struck me after
spending a day with Harold
Johnson is that,

48:29.206 --> 48:35.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
while he's exceptional at his
job, he's much
like the best side of any of us,
and his gender

48:35.145 --> 48:37.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is a help, not a hindrance.

48:37.347 --> 48:43.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: Boy teachers are more
nice, and they
understand more, and they're not
as mean as

48:43.654 --> 48:44.621 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
girl teachers.

48:44.655 --> 48:46.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: Yes, exactly.

48:46.223 --> 48:50.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: They understand you
better because
you're a boy and they're men?

48:50.193 --> 48:51.161 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: Yes.

48:51.194 --> 48:52.429 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: Yes.

48:52.462 --> 48:55.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Now, girls, in my
experience,
are lots of fun.

48:55.899 --> 48:57.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I have two daughters.

48:57.434 --> 48:59.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're a lot of fun.

48:59.269 --> 49:05.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So why is the boy teacher more
fun than the
girl teacher?

49:05.108 --> 49:09.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: Because boys do more
awesome stuff
than girls.

49:09.546 --> 49:11.281 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: No!

49:11.315 --> 49:17.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: On behalf of you
girls, I do
not think boys do more awesome
stuff than

49:17.554 --> 49:19.323 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
girls.

49:19.356 --> 49:22.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But educator Angela Baum says
male teachers
do bring something different to
the table,

49:22.492 --> 49:24.361 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or to the floor.

49:24.394 --> 49:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA BAUM: Some experts
suggest that perhaps
men play with children
differently than women

49:30.334 --> 49:31.868 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do.

49:31.902 --> 49:34.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, men may be more likely to
engage in what
we call rough-and-tumble play.

49:34.237 --> 49:38.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's that vigorous chasing,
wrestling kind
of play.

49:38.675 --> 49:41.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's good for young
children, both young
boys and young girls.

49:41.912 --> 49:46.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: There's one last
aspect of Johnson's
teaching worth mentioning,
especially for

49:46.650 --> 49:48.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a Making Sense segment.

49:48.752 --> 49:54.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He teaches economics to second
graders, including
lessons in managing a work
force.

49:54.524 --> 49:59.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAROLD JOHNSON: We did supply
and demand,
and then we talked about wants
and needs.

49:59.463 --> 50:02.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We brought the materials to make
something,
so they had instructions.

50:02.332 --> 50:07.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So one was a sugar cookie, one
was some cocoa
mix, one was a winter mix.

50:07.204 --> 50:09.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so they had a factory
assembly line.

50:09.039 --> 50:10.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, somebody got behind.

50:10.841 --> 50:13.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, you know, the people at
the front
was finished, the people at the
back were

50:13.810 --> 50:16.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
overworked, and the person in
the middle was
kind of slowing down.

50:16.480 --> 50:18.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the people at the end, they
were like,
well, can we get some help?

50:18.115 --> 50:19.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was like, no, they finished
their job.

50:19.383 --> 50:21.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, then they really got
frustrated with the
middle people.

50:21.118 --> 50:22.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I asked them, well, how did that
feel?

50:22.552 --> 50:23.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they was like, man, that's
hard work.

50:23.553 --> 50:24.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's a lot of pressure on
you.

50:24.855 --> 50:26.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I was like, and imagine, you
all was making
sugar cookies.

50:26.757 --> 50:29.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Imagine if you really was doing
something,
building a car or something.

50:29.426 --> 50:31.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, we talked about that.

50:31.294 --> 50:35.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: OK, one last
question for those
men out there who might possibly
be considering

50:35.265 --> 50:36.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
if this job is for you.

50:36.933 --> 50:38.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How gratifying is this work?

50:38.502 --> 50:40.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HAROLD JOHNSON: Oh,
tremendously.

50:40.437 --> 50:45.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the thing that I enjoy
the most is
when you see a kid have the aha
moment or

50:45.442 --> 50:47.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
either change their whole
perception of something.

50:47.811 --> 50:54.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, I have seen boys who hated
reading are
running to go read first.

50:54.751 --> 50:57.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it's just like, man, you
know, I had
something to do with that.

50:57.554 --> 51:02.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or if I can take this 180 days
and make a
lifetime of difference, then
that's all worth

51:02.492 --> 51:03.527 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

51:03.560 --> 51:05.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's all worth it for me.

51:05.395 --> 51:08.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: For the "PBS
NewsHour" at Lake
Carolina Elementary School in
Blythewood,

51:08.999 --> 51:15.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
South Carolina, I'm economics
correspondent
Paul Solman.

51:15.572 --> 51:20.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Brief But Spectacular

51:20.877 --> 51:27.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to another in
our Brief
But Spectacular series.

51:27.584 --> 51:30.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from Michael
Eric Dyson.

51:30.387 --> 51:36.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He teaches at Georgetown and is
the author
of "Tears We Cannot Stop: A
Sermon to White

51:36.827 --> 51:38.595 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
America."

51:38.628 --> 51:40.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL ERIC DYSON, Author,
"Tears We Cannot
Stop: A Sermon to White
America": One of the

51:40.397 --> 51:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
greatest privileges of being
white in this
country is to encounter a police
person on

51:43.366 --> 51:50.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the street and live to tell
about it.

51:51.007 --> 51:55.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When many people say, let's get
rid of political
correctness, that's a shorthand
for, let me

51:55.178 --> 51:57.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
keep on being bigoted the way I
was before.

51:57.781 --> 52:03.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the great philosopher Shawn
Carter said,
you was who you was before you
got here, player,

52:03.453 --> 52:06.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and you might change, but that's
just the
top layer.

52:06.323 --> 52:10.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you think about want
collective white
fragility of many white
Americans, you know,

52:10.560 --> 52:12.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
black people, brown people, red,
yellow people,
you know what we do?

52:12.329 --> 52:15.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm going to break a secret to
you.

52:15.665 --> 52:19.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're very cautious and careful
about how
you might interpret things,
because you're

52:19.870 --> 52:20.837 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very fragile.

52:20.871 --> 52:22.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Your feelings might get hurt.

52:22.072 --> 52:25.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have had 44 of 45
presidents.

52:25.609 --> 52:29.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most CEOs of American Fortune
500 companies
have been white.

52:29.279 --> 52:31.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where are the tears of white
America coming
from?

52:31.648 --> 52:34.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To be white is to be seen as,
I'm just a human
being.

52:34.784 --> 52:36.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm just an American.

52:36.119 --> 52:37.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why can't you guys do the same?

52:37.654 --> 52:41.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, many white brothers and
sisters don't
understand they possess a race.

52:41.057 --> 52:42.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When you hear gender, what do we
think?

52:42.726 --> 52:44.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Oh, that must be the women.

52:44.261 --> 52:46.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't think, hey, I possess a
masculinity.

52:46.296 --> 52:49.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, often, it's a toxic
masculinity.

52:49.266 --> 52:53.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many white brothers and sisters,
when they
hear the issue of race, they
think the other.

52:53.370 --> 52:55.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They never think themselves.

52:55.071 --> 52:59.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was the great, late Gore
Vidal who said,
we live in the United States of
amnesia.

52:59.309 --> 53:01.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, America is obsessed with
history when,
what?

53:02.012 --> 53:06.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a reenactment of the Civil
War, some
battle that was lost in the
South.

53:06.416 --> 53:09.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when it's about black
history, why don't
you people get over that?

53:09.486 --> 53:11.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Stop obsessing about slavery.

53:11.221 --> 53:13.323 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Stop talking about reparations.

53:13.356 --> 53:15.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Stop speaking about historical
repression.

53:15.659 --> 53:17.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Talk about what's going on now.

53:17.260 --> 53:20.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When it makes America look
great, claps, applause.

53:20.096 --> 53:22.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When it doesn't, get out of my
face.

53:23.033 --> 53:24.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Stop living in the past.

53:24.401 --> 53:27.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
My role is, for many
communities, a paid pest.

53:27.871 --> 53:28.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what I do.

53:28.872 --> 53:30.106 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm a professor.

53:30.140 --> 53:32.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I get paid to think about
stuff that is
pestiferous.

53:32.042 --> 53:33.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I try to use humor.

53:33.410 --> 53:37.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I try to use self-deprecation,
but the ultimate
goal is the same.

53:37.080 --> 53:42.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can we challenge the forces of
unconscious
white privilege and implicit
bias to come

53:42.319 --> 53:45.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out of the closet and to be held
accountable?

53:45.255 --> 53:47.023 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's my job.

53:47.057 --> 53:51.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of my white students, after
reading a
book that horrendously detailed
the tragedies

53:51.928 --> 53:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and horrors of white violence
against black
people, said, "For the first
time in my life,

53:57.234 --> 53:59.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I feel ashamed to be white."

53:59.169 --> 54:04.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I didn't want him to get stuck
in a pocket
of misery and guilt, because
white guilt ultimately

54:04.708 --> 54:06.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will not fix anything.

54:06.109 --> 54:08.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're going to get into circles
that I will
never get into.

54:08.178 --> 54:10.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're going to go home to
Thanksgiving.

54:10.113 --> 54:15.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Go home and talk to granny, not
before you
eat the turkey or the stuffing
or the pumpkin

54:15.118 --> 54:16.886 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pie.

54:16.920 --> 54:19.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But after, then say to her, you
know what,
I have got black and brown and
red and yellow

54:20.023 --> 54:21.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
friends, and it's not what you
say.

54:21.424 --> 54:24.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or say to your cousin and your
uncle, this
is not how it goes down.

54:24.094 --> 54:28.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when we do that, we can get
rid of the
amnesia that has blocked a white
grappling

54:28.665 --> 54:33.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with its own problems and
issues, and tell
the truth about race in America.

54:33.737 --> 54:35.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My name is Michael Eric Dyson.

54:35.505 --> 54:39.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And this is my Brief But
Spectacular challenge
to white America.

54:39.643 --> 54:44.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
