IS AND PAT TOOMEY FAILS TO HAVE

04:55.100 --> 04:56.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COURAGE TO SAY THIS IS

04:56.767 --> 04:57.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WRONG, THIS IS BENEATH HUMAN

>> I THINK PENNSYLVANIA VOTERS

05:11.767 --> 05:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE TOTALLY CAPABLE OF

PRESIDENTIAL RACE, WHICH HAS IN

05:17.100 --> 05:19.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MY VIEW, TWO VERY BADLY FLAWED

05:19.600 --> 05:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CANDIDATES, AND THE SENATE RACE,

05:20.733 --> 05:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT

05:24.400 --> 05:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THING.

05:24.733 --> 05:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:26.167 --> 05:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I HAVE FROM DAY ONE.

I'VE BEEN AN INDEPENDENT VOICE,

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK THAT PENNSYLVANIANS

05:30.000 --> 05:32.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL MAKE A SEPARATE JUDGMENT.

05:32.467 --> 05:33.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

12:01.500 --> 12:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S BEEN UGLY.

12:03.200 --> 12:04.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT DOES MAKE IT MORE

12:04.267 --> 12:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFICULT.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE GIVE

12:06.067 --> 12:08.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UP.

12:08.167 --> 12:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

BETWEEN TOOMEY AND McGINTY

12:13.367 --> 12:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

A HANDFUL OF PENNSYLVANIA VOTERS

12:17.000 --> 12:23.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

CLOSE NEXT YEAR.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

BROKE THE NEWS, KEACH HAGEY.

13:17.967 --> 13:18.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WHY DID THEY DO THIS?

13:18.667 --> 13:19.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THE REASON IS BOTH

13:19.600 --> 13:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPANIES ARE FACING RAPIDLY

13:22.633 --> 13:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

13:27.967 --> 13:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY HAVE GOTTEN IT

13:29.333 --> 13:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENT WAYS.

13:30.500 --> 13:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ITS SIDE.

13:32.467 --> 13:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY NEED TO GROW BY ACQUIRING

13:34.500 --> 13:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUSINESSES.

13:35.433 --> 13:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS WE'VE SEEN THEM DO, THEY

ACQUIRE DIRECTV.

13:38.833 --> 13:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND TIME WARNER IS STRUGGLING

13:40.600 --> 13:42.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE

13:42.567 --> 13:43.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

13:46.300 --> 13:48.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE GOING ON TO STREAMING

SERVICES, TO NETFLIX AND THEIR

13:50.033 --> 13:51.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUSINESS IS BEING CRAMPED.

13:51.467 --> 13:52.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE OTHER THING IS TIME

13:52.800 --> 13:53.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WARNER IS ONE OF THE PRETTIEST

13:53.667 --> 13:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

13:58.333 --> 13:59.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE A COMPANY THAT COULD BE

13:59.100 --> 13:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOUGHT.

13:59.433 --> 14:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND AS THE INDUSTRY IS FACING

14:01.133 --> 14:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS CONSOLIDATION, THEY'RE

14:02.800 --> 14:04.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO BE THE FIRST ONE TO GO.

14:17.433 --> 14:18.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE ARE HUGE COMPANIES NOW

14:18.667 --> 14:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WE DIDN'T REALLY SEE A

14:19.700 --> 14:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.

14:21.933 --> 14:24.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

VERTICAL INTEGRATION IT SEEMS

14:25.733 --> 14:26.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE REGULATORS ARE OKAY WITH

14:26.867 --> 14:27.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THEM.

14:36.833 --> 14:38.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING THAT'S

14:38.367 --> 14:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WAY THAT FOLKS ARE BULKING

14:41.400 --> 14:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE DISTRIBUTION MECHANISM IS SO

15:02.367 --> 15:05.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO WHETHER

15:14.400 --> 15:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

15:20.200 --> 15:23.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAW COMCAST BUY-- AND THE

15:23.833 --> 15:24.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REGULATORS DID PUT CONDITIONS

15:24.867 --> 15:26.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH WAS THAT WHEN COMCAST

ABOUT THOSE AND THOSE

15:32.800 --> 15:34.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONDITIONS DIDN'T WORK OUT SO

15:34.167 --> 15:34.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELL.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WERE A LOT OF LESSONS TO

CONSUMER STANDPOINT F I HAVE,

15:48.567 --> 15:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR EXAMPLE, AN AT&amp;T PHONE THAT

15:50.633 --> 15:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I COULD HAVE ACCESS TO HBO OR

FREE, THAT IS GREAT IF I'M AN

15:54.200 --> 15:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT&amp;T CONSUMER BUT IT MIGHT NOT

15:56.033 --> 15:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE THAT GREAT IF I'M A T MOBILE

17:44.000 --> 17:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHALLENGING TO REACH PEOPLE.

17:46.933 --> 17:47.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOST OF THE PEOPLE ARE STILL IN

17:47.967 --> 17:50.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITIES OR IN THE CITY CENTERS.

17:50.867 --> 17:54.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE TALK MAYBE ABOUT AROUND 5,000

17:54.167 --> 17:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FAMILIES OR PERSONS WHO COULD

17:55.833 --> 17:57.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEAVE FROM THE VILLAGES.

17:57.067 --> 17:59.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THEY ARE NOT YET AT THE

17:59.367 --> 18:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUTSKIRTS.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THERE ARE CHALLENGES.

18:02.200 --> 18:03.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE KNOW THERE IS DISPLACEMENT

18:03.967 --> 18:06.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING ON.

18:06.267 --> 18:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS-- SMOKE WHICH IS TOXIC

18:09.900 --> 18:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UP TO A CERTAIN EXTENT.

18:12.033 --> 18:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS ALSO AFFECT THE RESIDENTS

18:13.600 --> 18:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE VILLAGES WHICH ARE

18:15.233 --> 18:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AROUND, OR PEOPLE DISPLACED TO

THESE CAMPS, WHICH MAKES

18:20.833 --> 18:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERYTHING-- BECAUSE WE HAVE TO

18:22.133 --> 18:23.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOK AT THE SAFETY OF OUR STAFF.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT STILL TRY TO DISPATCH

18:25.433 --> 18:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEDICAL SUPPLIES TO THIS AREA

18:27.200 --> 18:29.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH ARE NOW UNDER AN

18:29.467 --> 18:30.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADDITIONAL STRESS.

SAFETY CORRIDORS OR AVENUES

18:33.933 --> 18:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE CIVILIANS COULD GET OUT AS

18:35.500 --> 18:37.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TROOPS ADVANCE CLOSER AND

18:37.700 --> 18:39.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLOSER TO THEIR CITIES.

18:39.667 --> 18:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> MOST OF THE PLACES HAVE NOT

18:41.733 --> 18:43.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEN MASSIVE DISPLACEMENT OF

CIVILIANS.

18:44.800 --> 18:48.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT GENERALLY THEY TRY, OR THEY

18:48.167 --> 18:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRY TO HAVE A SAFE PASSAGE OPEN.

18:50.700 --> 18:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW THIS IS GOING TO WORK OUT

18:52.233 --> 18:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THOUSANDS OF

18:54.800 --> 18:56.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CIVILIANS, I THINK IT IS NOT YET

18:56.367 --> 18:59.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY CLEAR.

18:59.167 --> 19:00.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE MAKING PLANS OF OPENING

19:00.767 --> 19:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAFE PASS AGES FOR CIVILIANS TO

19:02.200 --> 19:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEAVE.

19:03.133 --> 19:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: HOW QUICKLY

19:04.433 --> 19:05.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFTER THE CITY IS UNDER THE

19:05.967 --> 19:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTROL OF IRAQI FORCES CAN

19:08.400 --> 19:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HUMANITARIAN AID AGENCIES GET IN

19:09.833 --> 19:11.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE AND TRY TO EITHER TREAT

19:11.700 --> 19:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WOUNDED OR EVACUATE WHO

19:13.433 --> 19:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEEDS TO BE?

19:14.433 --> 19:16.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF

19:16.667 --> 19:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPERIENCE WITH THE SITUATION

19:17.933 --> 19:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HAPPENED IN RAMADI AND

19:20.633 --> 19:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FALLUJAH.

19:21.600 --> 19:23.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT JUST

19:23.767 --> 19:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO THINK THAT WE CAN GO QUICKLY

19:25.900 --> 19:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSIDE.

19:26.233 --> 19:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE WE DO EXPECT THERE MIGHT

19:29.800 --> 19:32.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE HEAVY MINES, CONTAMINATION OF

19:32.267 --> 19:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MINES OR BOOBY TRAPS OR MAYBE

19:35.200 --> 19:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STILL SOME SECURITY CONCERN FOR

19:37.833 --> 19:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE HUMANITARIAN WORKERS.

19:38.833 --> 19:41.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK THE THE FIRST THING

19:41.067 --> 19:43.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PREFERABLY IS TO CLEAR AND THAT

19:43.633 --> 19:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PEOPLE WE CAN ASSIST MIGHT

19:45.533 --> 19:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT BE IN FRONT OF THE FRONT

19:46.700 --> 19:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

19:47.333 --> 19:48.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: FINALLY,

19:48.367 --> 19:50.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT'S THE MOST IMMEDIATE

19:50.567 --> 19:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPRESSING CONCERN.

19:52.200 --> 19:53.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS A CITY GETS CUT OFF LIKE

19:53.867 --> 19:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS, WHAT HAPPENS TO WATER OR

19:55.000 --> 19:56.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACCESS TO FOOD OR CERTAINLY

19:56.167 --> 19:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEDICINE WHEN THERE'S NOT ANY

19:57.700 --> 19:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOODS OR SERVICES COMING

19:59.833 --> 20:00.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN OR OUT.

20:00.567 --> 20:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IF IT IS A CITY IN ISOLATION

20:02.200 --> 20:06.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVER A LONG PERIOD, THIS MIGHT

20:06.000 --> 20:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUT LOTS OF PRESSURES ON THE

20:07.633 --> 20:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CIVILIANS WHICH WE HAVE SEEN

20:08.733 --> 20:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALSO IN FALLUJAH.

20:10.533 --> 20:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT I THINK THAT THE MAJOR

20:14.300 --> 20:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCERN IS TO GET ACCESS TO THE

20:15.600 --> 20:18.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PEOPLE, TO EVACUATE THE

20:18.067 --> 20:20.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOUNDED AND GET TREATMENT AND I

20:20.000 --> 20:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK IF NOBODY WORKS ANY MORE

20:21.533 --> 20:25.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE HOSPITALS OR CAN GO

20:25.067 --> 20:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAFELY, IT MAKES IT A REAL

20:26.200 --> 20:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCERN AND I THINK PEOPLE WILL

20:27.133 --> 20:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOSE LIFE JUST BECAUSE THEY

20:28.500 --> 20:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CANNOT ACCESS HOSPITALS AND

20:30.200 --> 20:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
