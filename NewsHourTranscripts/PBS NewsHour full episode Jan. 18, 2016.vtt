JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:04.771 --> 00:06.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: major
breakthroughs
in Iran's relationships with the
United States.

00:06.573 --> 00:06.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We examine the prisoner release,
new missile
sanctions, and implementation of
the nuclear

00:06.874 --> 00:08.675 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
deal.

00:08.709 --> 00:09.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: reviewing the final
Democratic primary
debate before Iowa, and more
news from the

00:09.843 --> 00:11.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trail with only two weeks left
until voting
begins.

00:11.745 --> 00:12.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And methane gas from a leaking
pipe overtakes
a Southern Californian town,
forcing residents

00:12.045 --> 00:13.914 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to flee.

00:13.947 --> 00:15.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAULA CRACIUM, President, Porter
Ranch Neighborhood
Council: There's this enormous
stain on the

00:15.782 --> 00:16.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community right now caused by
this leak, and
a stain that's not going to go
away the day

00:16.650 --> 00:17.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
after the leak's fixed,
unfortunately.

00:17.918 --> 00:18.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:18.218 --> 00:19.953 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:19.987 --> 00:21.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Washington and
Tehran faced
each other in a new light today,
but it was

00:21.288 --> 00:23.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clear that decades of division
will not disappear
overnight.

00:23.056 --> 00:23.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The latest point of dispute: new
sanctions
that appeared, even as old ones
melted away.

00:23.957 --> 00:25.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan begins our
coverage.

00:25.726 --> 00:26.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The new
sanctions aimed
at Iran's ballistic missile
program sparked

00:26.994 --> 00:29.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fresh criticism from Tehran,
after a weekend
of milder words.

00:29.463 --> 00:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOSSEIN JABERI ANSARI, Iranian
Foreign Ministry:
The Islamic republic of Iran, as
it has made

00:33.834 --> 00:38.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clear in the past, will respond
to such acts
of propaganda and harassment by
following

00:38.672 --> 00:43.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its legitimate missile program
more seriously
and boosting its defensive and
national security

00:43.777 --> 00:45.646 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
capabilities.

00:45.679 --> 00:49.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The limited
sanctions announced
Sunday followed a missile test
in October

00:49.783 --> 00:55.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that violated a United Nations
ban. Far more
sweeping sanctions are ending,
after Saturday's

00:55.322 --> 01:00.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
announcement that Iran's nuclear
program has
complied with a landmark
agreement.

01:00.394 --> 01:04.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama hailed the
accord's formal
implementation in a Sunday
appearance at the

01:04.164 --> 01:05.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
White House.

01:05.966 --> 01:07.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Under the nuclear deal that we,
our allies

01:07.768 --> 01:13.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and partners reached with Iran
last year,
Iran will not get its hands on a
nuclear bomb.

01:13.974 --> 01:18.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Under the
agreement, Iranian
technicians removed the reactor
core at the

01:18.111 --> 01:23.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Arak nuclear site, effectively
ending its
production of plutonium for a
possible weapon.

01:23.884 --> 01:28.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The regime also cut the number
of centrifuges
at its Fordow and Natanz sites
for enriching

01:28.956 --> 01:34.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
uranium. And it shipped tons of
low-enriched
uranium materials to Russia.

01:34.528 --> 01:40.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the nuclear deal came to full
power, Iran
released four imprisoned
Iranian-Americans.

01:40.600 --> 01:46.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They include Washington Post
reporter Jason
Rezaian, former U.S. Marine Amir
Hekmati,

01:46.106 --> 01:51.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Pastor Saeed Abedini.
Rezaian, Hekmati
and Abedini are now undergoing
physical and

01:51.545 --> 01:57.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
psychological evaluations at the
U.S. military's
Landstuhl Regional Medical
Center in Germany.

01:57.217 --> 01:59.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Family members gathered there
today to be
reunited.

01:59.886 --> 02:01.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rezaian's brother was among
them.

02:01.722 --> 02:05.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALI REZAIAN, Brother of Jason
Rezaian: Jason
is in good spirits. He obviously
is concerned

02:05.792 --> 02:10.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make sure that he works hard
to get better.
But he is also the same guy. He
is not too

02:11.031 --> 02:14.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
depressed. He really seems to be
in a good
state of mind.

02:14.735 --> 02:19.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also released
in the deal,
Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari,
who opted to

02:19.506 --> 02:24.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remain in Iran, and, separately,
a detained
student, Matthew Trevithick, who
returned

02:24.778 --> 02:26.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
home Sunday to Boston.

02:26.613 --> 02:31.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In exchange, the U.S. Justice
Department is
releasing seven Iranians being
held in the

02:31.118 --> 02:36.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. and dismissing charges
against 14 fugitives.
The swap went through despite
last week's

02:36.990 --> 02:41.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seizure of 10 American sailors
by Iran in
the Persian Gulf.

02:41.128 --> 02:45.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of State John Kerry
acknowledged
today he'd been angry and
frustrated by Iran's

02:45.265 --> 02:50.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
action. But both he and
President Obama say
the new improved relations with
Iran helped

02:50.537 --> 02:52.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
resolve it quickly.

02:52.305 --> 02:55.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Some folks here in
Washington
rushed to declare that it was
the start of

02:55.342 --> 03:00.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
another hostage crisis. Instead,
we worked
directly with the Iranian
government and secured

03:00.347 --> 03:02.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the release of our sailors in
less than 24
hours.

03:03.016 --> 03:06.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now the focus
turns back
to the nuclear deal and
inspections to ensure

03:07.020 --> 03:11.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iran's compliance. The head of
the U.N. nuclear
watchdog met today with
President Hassan Rouhani

03:11.892 --> 03:13.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to discuss a way forward.

03:13.827 --> 03:18.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, as sanctions end,
it's been widely
reported the Islamic republic
will see a windfall

03:18.732 --> 03:25.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of up to $150 billion. Secretary
Kerry said
today it's actually closer to
half or a third

03:25.138 --> 03:30.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of that amount. The end of
sanctions also
means Iran will pump more oil.
The government

03:30.444 --> 03:35.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
announced today it's ramping up
production
by 500,000 barrels a day.

03:35.115 --> 03:37.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

03:37.084 --> 03:42.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will have a
full analysis
of all of this after the news
summary.

03:42.222 --> 03:48.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two Iranian poets who faced
heavy prison terms
have fled the country. Fatemeh
Ekhtesari and

03:48.428 --> 03:54.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Mehdi Mousavi told the
Associated Press that
they escaped, but declined to
say where. The

03:54.334 --> 04:00.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pair had been convicted of
anti-government
propaganda and -- quote --
"insulting sanctities."

04:00.073 --> 04:07.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition to prison terms,
they'd been sentenced
to 99 lashes for shaking hands
with the opposite

04:07.247 --> 04:08.982 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sex.

04:09.015 --> 04:13.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Security forces in Iraq fanned
out across
part of Baghdad today, after
three Americans

04:13.653 --> 04:19.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disappeared over the weekend.
Iraqi officials
said they were kidnapped on
Friday and taken

04:19.126 --> 04:23.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to the heavily Shiite
neighborhood known as
Sadr City.

04:23.363 --> 04:27.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A key Sunni figure strongly
condemned the
growing wave of abductions.

04:27.267 --> 04:31.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHEIKH ABDUL-LATIF AL-HIMAIM,
Sunni Religious
Endowments (through translator):
We reject

04:31.972 --> 04:36.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any kidnap operation. We fully
support the
government, stability and
security. We absolutely

04:36.943 --> 04:41.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
condemn and reject anyone who
violates the
law and disturbs security and
stability. We

04:41.414 --> 04:45.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
denounce outlawed acts and
kidnappings. Such
acts are rejected from any
party.

04:45.752 --> 04:50.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: An Iraqi lawmaker
said the
missing Americans worked for a
private company.

04:50.724 --> 04:55.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. Embassy didn't identify
them or say
what they were doing in Iraq.

04:55.795 --> 05:01.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Afghanistan, a second round
of talks unfolded
in Kabul, aimed at ending the
war with the

05:01.468 --> 05:07.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Taliban. Officials from
Afghanistan, Pakistan,
China and the United States
gathered to lay

05:07.841 --> 05:12.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the groundwork for future
negotiations, and
called for the Taliban to step
up.

05:12.812 --> 05:17.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALAHUDDIN RABBANI, Afghani High
Peace Council
(through translator): Any delay
by the Taliban

05:17.484 --> 05:22.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the negotiating table will
isolate them
more in the eyes of the Afghan
people. Those

05:22.589 --> 05:27.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who missed the chance to join
the peace process
clearly proved that they do not
want an Afghanistan

05:27.694 --> 05:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with sovereignty, independence,
stability
and welfare and their aim is
insurgency and

05:33.200 --> 05:34.668 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
destruction.

05:34.701 --> 05:38.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: An earlier
attempt at negotiations
collapsed last summer.

05:38.972 --> 05:43.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Great Britain, lawmakers
debated today
whether Republican U.S.
presidential candidate

05:43.810 --> 05:49.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump should be banned
from their country.
The House of Commons took up the
topic after

05:49.416 --> 05:55.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than 500,000 people signed
a petition
to bar Trump. It's a response to
his call

05:55.088 --> 05:59.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to stop Muslims from entering
the United States.

05:59.192 --> 06:04.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, an Arctic
air mass brought
bitter cold to parts of the
Upper Midwest,

06:04.497 --> 06:10.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and pushed east. Temperatures
sat in the single
digits or below zero in
Wisconsin, Michigan

06:10.604 --> 06:16.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Illinois. Much of Minnesota,
meanwhile,
saw windchills today between
minus-20 and

06:16.977 --> 06:22.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
minus-40. Streets in Minneapolis
were left
nearly bare, except for a
heavily bundled-up

06:22.849 --> 06:25.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
few who braved the cold.

06:25.885 --> 06:31.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This Martin Luther King holiday
brought an
air of change, especially in
Columbia, South

06:31.191 --> 06:36.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carolina. Crowds marked the day
for the first
time since the Confederate Flag
was removed

06:36.496 --> 06:38.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from the state capitol grounds.

06:38.498 --> 06:43.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Washington, FBI Director
James Comey laid
a wreath at the King Memorial,
and called

06:44.004 --> 06:47.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for both police and minorities
to put aside
distrust.

06:47.607 --> 06:51.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY, FBI Director: We
have to also
understand that all of us, law
enforcement

06:51.578 --> 06:57.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and non-law enforcement, carry
with us implicit
biases. We react differently to
a face that

06:57.083 --> 07:00.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
looks different than our own. We
have to stare
at that and own that.

07:00.587 --> 07:05.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For their part,
President and
Mrs. Obama visited an elementary
school in

07:05.191 --> 07:11.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Washington, where they planted
gardens and
gave books and supplies to needy
students.

07:11.398 --> 07:18.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street was closed for the
holiday, but
oil prices slipped below $29 as
Iran increased

07:18.438 --> 07:23.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its output. Meanwhile, French
President Francois
Hollande declared a state of
economic and

07:23.877 --> 07:30.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
social emergency. He announced a
$2.2 billion
plan to jump-start jobs and
growth.

07:30.517 --> 07:34.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANCOIS HOLLANDE, French
President (through
translator): In a country
capable of facing

07:34.587 --> 07:40.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the most horrible challenges
such as terrorism,
a country plagued by high levels
of unemployment,

07:40.160 --> 07:44.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it must be capable of reforming
itself, creating
a solid and demanding economic
and social

07:44.998 --> 07:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
system and belief in progress.

07:47.267 --> 07:52.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also today, the
value of the
Russian ruble fell again, this
time to an

07:52.205 --> 07:54.607 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all-time low.

07:54.641 --> 08:00.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a passing of note. Rock
musician Glenn
Frey died today in New York,
after a long

08:00.480 --> 08:06.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
illness. The guitarist
co-founded the Eagles
with drummer Don Henley in the
early 1970s,

08:06.686 --> 08:12.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and together, they wrote such
hits as "Hotel
California" and "Life in the
Fast Lane." Glenn

08:12.292 --> 08:16.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what could
be a new era in Iranian
relations and prisoners

08:25.872 --> 08:33.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
freed with Iran's sanctions
lifted; Democrats
battle it out just two weeks
before Iowa;

08:33.079 --> 08:43.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
California's methane leak that's
gone on for
nearly three months; and much
more.

08:43.123 --> 08:49.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
California's methane leak that's
gone on for
nearly three months; and much
more.

08:49.195 --> 08:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we have reported, the former
Iranian-American
prisoners returning to the
United States are

08:53.967 --> 08:57.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now at a military base in
Landstuhl, Germany.

08:57.637 --> 09:00.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My colleague Jeffrey Brown picks
up the story
from there.

09:00.473 --> 09:04.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I'm joined by
U.s. Representative
Dan Kildee, who is in Landstuhl,
Germany,

09:04.878 --> 09:09.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tonight, after meeting with Amir
Hekmati.
He is the former U.S. Marine who
was released

09:09.182 --> 09:14.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by from Iran on Saturday after
four-plus years
of imprisonment. Congressman
Kildee represents

09:14.220 --> 09:18.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hekmati's home district in
Michigan and has
long worked for his release.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And thanks so much for joining
us.

09:20.059 --> 09:23.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you met with Amir Hekmati
today. Tell
us about the meeting. What was
his condition?

09:23.963 --> 09:26.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. DAN KILDEE (D), Michigan:
Well, first
of all, it was a great day.

09:26.199 --> 09:30.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was the first time I had
actually ever
met Amir Hekmati, despite the
fact that I

09:30.069 --> 09:33.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been working on his case
for so long
and feel like I have come to
know him. I gave

09:33.239 --> 09:39.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him a great big hug, told him
how proud I
was of him.

09:39.212 --> 09:43.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And really we spent time
together just talking
and chatting. He told me a
little bit about

09:43.683 --> 09:48.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the time he was in prison. But,
mostly, we
just talked about how great it
is for him

09:48.922 --> 09:54.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be free. We had dinner
together tonight
with his two sisters and his
brother-in-law.

09:55.028 --> 09:59.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He looks pretty good, for a guy
who has spent
the last four-and-a-half years
in one of the

09:59.365 --> 10:01.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
worst prisons in the world.

10:01.100 --> 10:06.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You would expect him to not look
so strong.
He's lost some weight, at least
according

10:06.139 --> 10:11.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to what we can tell from the
pictures. I hadn't
met him before. He looks
thinner. But he looks

10:11.478 --> 10:16.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
good. And he sounds strong. It
will take time
for him to come back home and be
fully reintegrated,

10:16.683 --> 10:18.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but I think is he in good shape.

10:18.518 --> 10:22.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: We have a
photograph Amir Hekmati
in the prison in Iran. It was
provided to

10:22.589 --> 10:27.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
us by Maziar Bahari, a
journalist and former
prisoner there.

10:27.327 --> 10:31.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there were reports even in
recent days
of Amir being treated for a
medical condition.

10:31.564 --> 10:35.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What did he tell you about his
treatment there
and his medical condition?

10:35.201 --> 10:38.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. DAN KILDEE: Yes, it was
tough. Any time
you are not able to move around
-- and he

10:38.872 --> 10:42.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a young, athletic guy -- it
has a -- it
takes a physical toll.

10:42.308 --> 10:47.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And not being able to exercise,
as he had
become accustomed, I think, had
an effect

10:47.614 --> 10:53.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on his health. It has been a
tough four-and-a-half
years. He was in solitary
confinement for

10:53.853 --> 10:58.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a part of it. For a number of
months, he was
facing a death sentence. So, the
physical

10:58.925 --> 11:03.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
strain, but also the
psychological impact
of that kind of an experience
obviously is

11:03.863 --> 11:05.665 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tough.

11:05.698 --> 11:11.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I was impressed by his
spirit. He's anxious
to get back home and restart his
life. He's

11:11.271 --> 11:16.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a young man. He's got a long
future ahead
of him. You know, and, again,
he's got a whole

11:16.943 --> 11:23.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community that loves him, and is
looking forward
to help him -- welcoming him
back home and

11:23.316 --> 11:24.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
helping him restart his life.

11:25.018 --> 11:29.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Was he aware and,
for that
matter, Congressman, were you
aware of the

11:30.023 --> 11:34.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
negotiations? Did he know how
close he was
to a release or that this might
be in the

11:34.427 --> 11:36.195 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
works?

11:36.229 --> 11:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. DAN KILDEE: Well, he had
heard that it
might happen a few days before.
But he had

11:40.300 --> 11:44.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
heard that before. So I think he
put it in
that same context.

11:45.004 --> 11:48.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what he told me, it wasn't
until he was
actually taken to the airport
that he knew

11:48.908 --> 11:54.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that this time it was going to
be different.
I had been in contact, of
course, with the

11:54.180 --> 11:58.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State Department and the White
House for the
last few years working on this.
And we had

11:58.585 --> 12:03.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a sense that things were getting
close through
the discussions that we had.

12:03.156 --> 12:08.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But these situations are always
delicate until
they happen. And so obviously we
were just

12:08.828 --> 12:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
absolutely thrilled when we
discovered that,
yes, this time, he's actually
coming home.

12:13.833 --> 12:18.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And let may ask
you finally,
you know there are critics of
the swap aspect

12:18.738 --> 12:23.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the deal, people who think
that the U.S.
should have demanded
unconditional release

12:23.509 --> 12:25.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the prisoners in Iran. What
is your response?

12:25.812 --> 12:29.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. DAN KILDEE: Well, in a
perfect world,
we would get everything we want.
We would

12:29.582 --> 12:33.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have our way and we would hold
everybody else
to the standards that we would
like to hold

12:33.886 --> 12:37.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ourselves to. But we don't live
in a perfect
world.

12:37.490 --> 12:42.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I look at Amir Hekmati
coming home, and
I understand that we had to do a
lot. We had

12:43.029 --> 12:48.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to fight to get him home. When I
sat with
Amir Hekmati and had dinner with
him tonight,

12:48.101 --> 12:53.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was absolutely clear to me
that it was
consistent with our American
principles to

12:53.039 --> 12:55.642 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
get him home.

12:55.675 --> 13:01.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think any critic of this
really has
to ask themselves whether or not
they're living

13:01.080 --> 13:05.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the world that we live in or
the one they
would like to live in. The
people who are

13:05.051 --> 13:09.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in positions of authority
actually have to
get things done. And I commend
the president,

13:09.322 --> 13:12.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the secretary of state and
others who worked
on this.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a happy day, and I'm
thrilled about it.

13:15.395 --> 13:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Congressman Dan
Kildee of Michigan
from Landstuhl, Germany, thank
you so much.

13:19.699 --> 13:21.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REP. DAN KILDEE: Thank you.

13:21.501 --> 13:24.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And now we get
the perspective
from one of the
Iranian-Americans released

13:25.004 --> 13:26.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by the United States as part of
this deal.

13:27.006 --> 13:33.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For that, I am joined by
attorney Joel Androphy,
the attorney for Bahram
Mechanic, a dual U.S.-Iranian

13:33.246 --> 13:38.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
national who co-owns companies
in Houston
and in Iran. Mechanic was
accused of selling

13:38.751 --> 13:43.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
millions of dollars of
electronics to Iran
that aided the country's nuclear
program.

13:43.956 --> 13:47.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was granted a full pardon and
released
from prison yesterday.

13:47.060 --> 13:49.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Attorney Androphy is in Houston.

13:49.962 --> 13:51.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thank you so much for joining
us.

13:51.798 --> 13:56.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has been reported that you
were contacted
even months ago by an Iranian
official to

13:56.869 --> 14:02.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ask about the possibility of
this kind of
deal for your client. Is that
correct? And

14:02.075 --> 14:03.142 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what was said?

14:03.176 --> 14:05.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOEL ANDROPHY, Attorney for
Bahram Mechanic:
Yes.

14:05.078 --> 14:11.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the last four or five
months, my associate
and I have been trying to get a
visa to go

14:11.751 --> 14:19.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Iran and investigate our
case. And we were
told to deal with the Iranian
consul in Washington,

14:19.992 --> 14:25.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
D.C., and we have been pursuing
that with
them. And about two months ago,
the head of

14:25.665 --> 14:32.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
legal affairs contacted Rachael
Thompson and
myself and told us that there
was a possibility,

14:32.705 --> 14:37.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only at that time a possibility,
that we were
involved in a prisoner exchange
that had been

14:37.477 --> 14:39.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
advertised throughout the press.

14:39.345 --> 14:42.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, so that
means Mr. Mechanic
knew that this deal was in the
works. What

14:42.982 --> 14:45.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was his reaction over the
weekend?

14:45.184 --> 14:50.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOEL ANDROPHY: Well, this was a
couple of
months ago that this happened.
Things transpired

14:50.089 --> 14:55.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after that that gave us more
convincing thought
that we were part of the deal.

14:55.728 --> 15:02.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Two months ago, it was a
possibility. It was
like a lottery ticket. About 10
days ago,

15:02.235 --> 15:07.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the same council people, the
head of legal
affairs came down and told us
that it was

15:07.173 --> 15:11.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to become more of a
reality. He didn't
know the timing of it. He
thought it could

15:11.577 --> 15:16.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be within the next 60 days, but
he gave us
pretty good assurances that we
were on the

15:16.482 --> 15:21.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
list and that we would be
exchanged for Americans
held in Iran.

15:21.954 --> 15:23.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Mr. Mechanic
has...

15:23.422 --> 15:24.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOEL ANDROPHY: It wasn't
until...

15:24.357 --> 15:26.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. I'm sorry.
Go ahead.

15:26.159 --> 15:29.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOEL ANDROPHY: It wasn't until
last Wednesday
that we got confirmation that it
was going

15:29.428 --> 15:31.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to happen right away.

15:31.230 --> 15:36.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. attorney's office in
Houston got
confirmation from the attorney
general and

15:36.202 --> 15:40.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president of the United
States. And they
were told to contact us to
communicate to

15:40.773 --> 15:43.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our client the fact that the
president was
giving him a pardon.

15:43.409 --> 15:47.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let me ask you.
Mr. Mechanic
has maintained his innocence all
along. Is

15:47.346 --> 15:53.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his claim that none of the
technology he sold
to Iran was used for military
purposes, or

15:53.186 --> 15:55.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that it didn't defy any of the
sanctions?
What exactly?

15:55.855 --> 16:00.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOEL ANDROPHY: Well, first of
all, we didn't
sell any -- his company has
never sold anything

16:00.960 --> 16:02.762 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to Iran.

16:02.795 --> 16:06.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His company is on the black
list. His company
is not allowed to do business in
Iran with

16:06.732 --> 16:13.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Iranian government or the
Iranian police.
So any allegations made like
that were basically

16:13.172 --> 16:18.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
false. And allegations were made
to what's
called the International FISA
Court.

16:18.878 --> 16:23.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a court called the FISA
Court. It's
Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance court. And

16:23.482 --> 16:28.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they go make application to that
court to
get a warrant to do surveillance
on somebody.

16:28.621 --> 16:34.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And in order to get that
warrant, they lied.
They lied to the secret judge
who gave them

16:34.660 --> 16:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a secret warrant to get secret
information.
And it was all built on lies,
because he doesn't

16:40.499 --> 16:42.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do business with the Iranian
government.

16:42.668 --> 16:47.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Is he planning --
what are
his plans now? Will he stay in
the United

16:47.840 --> 16:51.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States? Will he continue to run
the Iranian
company?

16:51.477 --> 16:56.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOEL ANDROPHY: Well, he plans to
stay in the
United States and run his
business here.

16:56.449 --> 17:02.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He has a very successful
business here that
sells similar products to his
Iranian company.

17:02.521 --> 17:07.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The business here sells to
businesses in the
United States. The Iranian
company sells to

17:07.860 --> 17:14.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
consumers in Iran. It has a
storefront. And
they're two different
businesses. But they

17:14.800 --> 17:17.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
market similar products.

17:17.069 --> 17:22.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're all legal products.
And they have
nothing to do with national
security or anything

17:22.808 --> 17:28.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like that. These are surge
protectors that
everybody has on their computers
that you

17:28.047 --> 17:33.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could buy at Wal-Mart, you could
buy at any
store. You can go online and buy
these type

17:33.586 --> 17:35.354 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of apparatus.

17:35.388 --> 17:39.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Joel
Androphy, attorney
for Bahram Mechanic, thank you
so much.

17:39.258 --> 17:41.027 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOEL ANDROPHY: Thank you.

17:41.060 --> 17:46.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For what all the
weekend's
developments on Iran mean for
the future of

17:46.365 --> 17:52.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S.-Iran relations and Iran's
role in the
region, I'm joined now by Robin
Wright. She

17:52.138 --> 17:56.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
writes for "The New Yorker." Her
former research
assistant at the Woodrow Wilson
International

17:56.642 --> 18:00.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Center was one of the Americans
released by
the Iranians.

18:00.880 --> 18:06.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ray Takeyh, he was a senior
adviser on Iran
at the State Department during
President Obama's

18:06.752 --> 18:12.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first term. He's now a senior
fellow at the
Council on Foreign Relations.
Reuel Gerecht,

18:12.425 --> 18:17.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's a former case officer at
the CIA. He's
now a senior fellow with the
Foundation for

18:17.930 --> 18:24.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Defense of Democracies. And
Karim Sadjadpour,
he's a senior associate at the
Carnegie Endowment

18:24.537 --> 18:26.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for International Peace.

18:26.072 --> 18:28.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome all of you to the
program.

18:28.140 --> 18:32.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, let me -- let's -- let me
ask you first
about this release -- and I will
start with

18:32.511 --> 18:38.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you, Karim -- of these five
Iranian-Americans.
Was this inevitable, given the
fact that this

18:39.018 --> 18:42.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
nuclear deal was being
concluded? Was it just
going to happen?

18:42.788 --> 18:45.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARIM SADJADPOUR, Carnegie
Endowment For International
Peace: The timing wasn't
inevitable, but I

18:45.424 --> 18:50.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think at some point, after
three, four years
in prison, it was inevitable
that these folks

18:50.096 --> 18:51.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
were going to be released.

18:52.031 --> 18:57.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's important to
note that there
still is an Iranian-American in
Evin prison

18:57.636 --> 19:04.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Tehran, Siamak Namazi. It is
a very important
case because is he someone who
has been an

19:04.610 --> 19:07.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
energy consultant. He is very
well-known by
international corporations.

19:07.913 --> 19:12.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think as people see Iran,
the sanctions
have now been lifted, they are
looking to

19:12.251 --> 19:16.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do business with Iran. Siamak's
case is an
important one, because I think
that is going

19:16.122 --> 19:18.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to continue to deter companies
from doing
business in Iran.

19:18.691 --> 19:22.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Reuel Gerecht,
how do you see
the decision on Iran's part to
release these

19:22.361 --> 19:24.196 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people?

19:24.230 --> 19:25.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REUEL MARC GERECHT, Senior
Fellow, Foundation
for the Defense of Democracies:
Well, I think

19:25.965 --> 19:28.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the first thing you have to say
is, it is
a renewable pool. They can
release hostages

19:28.467 --> 19:30.536 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and take more.

19:30.569 --> 19:38.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hostage-taking is as old as the
Islamic Republic.
So, I don't think that this
exchange is strategically

19:38.911 --> 19:46.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very astute. I think the notion
of trading
essentially innocent Americans
who were seized

19:46.519 --> 19:52.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Iran and allowing individuals
who were
convicted of sanctions
violations, who were

19:52.358 --> 19:57.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aiding, abetting illicitly the
Iranian nuclear
program and otherwise engaging
in what you

19:57.129 --> 20:00.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
might call technical espionage
isn't wise.

20:00.366 --> 20:06.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think dropping people from
Interpol,
it sets a very, very bad
precedent. And I'm

20:06.305 --> 20:09.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sure the Iranians will abuse it
in the future.

20:09.408 --> 20:11.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Robin, how do you
see this
swap?

20:11.310 --> 20:13.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBIN WRIGHT, Senior Fellow,
U.S. Institute
of Peace: Well, I think both the
nuclear agreement

20:13.679 --> 20:19.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the prisoner swap are
probably very important
developments in what has been a
fraught relationship

20:19.251 --> 20:20.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
now for four decades.

20:20.986 --> 20:25.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It wasn't perfect, but prisoner
swaps, spy
swaps have gone on through the
ages. It's

20:25.357 --> 20:29.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not something new or different.
Many of those
who were released by the United
States were

20:29.929 --> 20:35.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
convicted of crimes that are no
longer technically
illegal. So, it wasn't at a huge
cost.

20:35.901 --> 20:39.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bigger picture, I think, is
really important
when it comes to what kind of
cooperation

20:39.738 --> 20:44.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we might have with Iran and
others, notably
Syria. Peace talks begin this
month, and that

20:44.310 --> 20:48.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the next big challenge we
face on whether
we can really do business with
Iran or not.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I want to ask
you all about
that.

20:50.516 --> 20:54.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Ray Takeyh, what about this
decision
to swap these Iranian-Americans
in prison

20:54.720 --> 20:56.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the Iranians in the U.S.?

20:56.722 --> 20:59.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RAY TAKEYH, Former State
Department Official:
The issue of American hostages
always exercises

20:59.658 --> 21:03.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an emotive burden, emotional
burden on any
U.S. president.

21:04.029 --> 21:11.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it did so with Ronald Reagan
when he essentially
traded arms for American
hostages in Lebanon.

21:11.103 --> 21:16.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, as this deal unfolds,
you begin to
see the humanitarian aspects of
it and the

21:16.976 --> 21:20.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
possible emotional burden it
imposes on the
president.

21:20.179 --> 21:24.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as you step back from it, in
hindsight,
you begin to see the problematic
aspects of

21:24.216 --> 21:29.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it, which I think we all alluded
to. For one
thing, it violates the
administration's own

21:29.121 --> 21:33.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
red line. They had suggested
that all these
prisoners have to be released
immediately,

21:33.325 --> 21:37.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is another way of saying
unconditionally.
And, essentially, then you see a
trade take

21:37.496 --> 21:39.398 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
place.

21:39.431 --> 21:44.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, also, money changed hands.
So the components
of a deal are problematic, but
the humanitarian

21:44.670 --> 21:46.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
aspect of it are quite American.

21:46.205 --> 21:48.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You are saying
money changed
hands over these prisoners?

21:48.107 --> 21:52.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAY TAKEYH: Well, there is a
report of $1.7
billion going into some accounts
that Iran

21:52.344 --> 21:56.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had going back to shah's time
because of the
disputed -- because of the
military sales

21:56.815 --> 21:58.851 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and contracts and so forth.

21:58.884 --> 22:03.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that could be another aspect
of this deal.
But even if you just look at it
from a prisoner-to-citizen

22:03.989 --> 22:08.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hostage swap, it has problematic
aspects to
it, but you have to juxtapose
that to the

22:08.661 --> 22:10.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
humanitarian aspects of it.

22:10.462 --> 22:16.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What does it say,
Karim, about
the balance of power in Tehran,
about -- you

22:16.202 --> 22:22.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, we are told there is the
very conservative
faction and the more moderate
faction. Whatever

22:22.041 --> 22:27.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- however it is described, what
does it say
about the power balance there?

22:27.213 --> 22:32.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARIM SADJADPOUR: Well, I think
we can't underestimate
the Iranian civil society and
the vast majority

22:32.751 --> 22:37.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Iran's 80 million population
that is very
eager for change and
reconciliation with the

22:37.623 --> 22:39.425 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
outside world.

22:39.458 --> 22:43.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, we shouldn't
underestimate
the forces of darkness in Iran,
the supreme

22:43.429 --> 22:48.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leader of the Revolutionary
Guards, who are
deeply entrenched. They haven't
gone anywhere.

22:48.467 --> 22:54.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they actually thrive in
isolation. Rapprochement
with the United States,
international economic

22:54.139 --> 22:57.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
integration would be more of a
threat to them
than continued hostilities.

22:57.676 --> 22:59.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I think that fight will
continue in Iran.

22:59.912 --> 23:02.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Regardless of
this new deal.

23:02.314 --> 23:07.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, let me pick up on that,
because, Reuel
Gerecht, some people were
surprised that this

23:07.253 --> 23:13.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nuclear deal was implemented as
quickly as
it was. How do you read that?
Why did Iran

23:13.859 --> 23:19.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
move as relatively quickly as
they did? Or
do you not see it as a
relatively quick implementation?

23:19.298 --> 23:23.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REUEL MARC GERECHT: No, I think
they moved
quickly. I think people expected
implementation

23:23.269 --> 23:29.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
day to be later, even as late,
say, as July.
They want the money. I mean, I
think that's

23:29.108 --> 23:31.076 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pretty clear.

23:31.110 --> 23:37.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The price of oil keeps dropping.
They need
the money desperately. They have
-- I mean,

23:37.683 --> 23:42.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have to afford Syria, the
war in Syria.
They have to -- they spend a lot
of money

23:42.588 --> 23:45.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Iraq. They spend some money
in Yemen.

23:45.190 --> 23:51.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think you have seen an
accentuation of what
you might call Iranian
imperialism and sectarian

23:51.930 --> 23:56.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
warfare, and they have to
support that. And
then there are also the domestic
needs. I

23:56.702 --> 24:02.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think one needs to be very
careful about paring
moderates and hard-liners in
Iran. I think,

24:02.808 --> 24:06.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on this issue, they are marching
more or less
in synch.

24:06.412 --> 24:10.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Robin Wright,
how do you
see that divide or split as it
exists in Tehran?

24:10.949 --> 24:14.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBIN WRIGHT: Well, it's a very
profound split,
and it's really over the future
course of

24:14.286 --> 24:19.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the revolution. Is the country,
first and
foremost, an Islamic State, or
is it a modern

24:19.558 --> 24:21.327 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
republic?

24:21.360 --> 24:24.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That has been the issue that has
been debated
since the very beginning of the
revolution.

24:24.463 --> 24:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it will play out again next
month when
Iranians go to the polls. And I
think one

24:28.133 --> 24:32.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the reasons in terms of the
timing of when
the nuclear deal and the
prisoners were released

24:32.905 --> 24:37.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has a lot to do with public
perception at
home, momentum to show that
President Rouhani

24:37.509 --> 24:39.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has been more effective than
some of the hard-liners.

24:39.945 --> 24:44.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have to remember this is
an opening
to the outside world, but it is
not an opening

24:44.183 --> 24:50.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inside the country. Today, the
Iranian government,
Guardian Council, which vets all
candidates,

24:50.756 --> 24:55.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disqualified over 60 percent of
the candidates
who want to run for Parliament
next month.

24:55.461 --> 24:57.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is still a very closed
society.

24:57.329 --> 25:03.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we shouldn't have any
illusions that these
very two important steps are
going to change

25:03.602 --> 25:05.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the political dynamics
significantly.

25:05.437 --> 25:11.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I mean,
that gets me
to the question I wanted to ask
next, Ray

25:11.210 --> 25:17.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Takeyh. Do we expect Iran to
change as a result
of this, a nuclear deal, the
release of these

25:17.082 --> 25:18.851 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
prisoners, and the rest of it?

25:18.884 --> 25:21.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RAY TAKEYH: I think that
certainly, as Karim
was saying, the fear of the
supreme leader

25:21.120 --> 25:27.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and those around him, that this
particular
opening can presage a moderation
of Iran and

25:27.459 --> 25:29.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
modernization of its politics.

25:29.428 --> 25:32.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
this is why they are
disqualifying the people
that they are. This is why you
have an extraordinary

25:33.031 --> 25:37.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
degree of repression inside the
country today,
because the fear that they have
is an opening

25:37.636 --> 25:41.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will essentially subvert the
revolution, because
they understand as well as
anyone the dynamics

25:42.007 --> 25:45.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of their society and the
demographics of their
society. And they essentially
want to close

25:46.011 --> 25:47.846 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
off those paths.

25:47.880 --> 25:52.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Karim, what
do we look
for next? I mean, does Iran
change its position

25:52.050 --> 25:56.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on Syria? I mean, Robin
mentioned Syria. I
mean, they are involved in so
many different

25:56.955 --> 26:02.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pieces of the very messy puzzle
in the Middle
East right now. What do we
expect to change,

26:02.861 --> 26:04.663 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
if anything?

26:04.696 --> 26:07.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARIM SADJADPOUR: I don't think
Iran's external
policies are going to change.
And at least

26:07.433 --> 26:12.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the near term, I think there
is a valid
concern that they will become
even more repressive

26:12.037 --> 26:17.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
domestically to send a signal to
their population,
don't confuse our external
flexibility for

26:17.843 --> 26:19.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
internal weakness.

26:19.645 --> 26:24.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that these momentous
peace deals
in the Middle East, the
momentous events in

26:24.450 --> 26:28.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Middle East really have to
be judged over
a period of many years. And I
think that trying

26:28.987 --> 26:34.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to crack open Iran, the fact
that it's Iranian
civil society and modern forces
who are happy

26:34.526 --> 26:39.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about this nuclear deal and the
hard-liners
who are concerned, I think it
increases the

26:39.665 --> 26:43.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chances, even if small, about
the prospects
for change in Iran.

26:43.635 --> 26:46.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
the prospects
for change, Reuel Gerecht?

26:46.772 --> 26:50.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REUEL MARC GERECHT: I think it
is going to
get worse.

26:50.375 --> 26:55.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think this nuclear deal is
likely to do
the opposite of what President
Obama hopes

26:55.147 --> 27:00.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it will do. I think the Iranians
will become
more aggressive in the region.
And I think,

27:00.819 --> 27:03.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
domestically, they will hit very
hard.

27:03.388 --> 27:05.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why?

27:05.157 --> 27:08.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REUEL MARC GERECHT: Because, as
Karim and
Ray, said, I think the supreme
leader, the

27:08.494 --> 27:13.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Revolutionary Guard Corps and
many others
really do feel the penetration
of a Western

27:13.065 --> 27:17.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
wedge, that the Western
businessmen come,
et cetera, et cetera. They are
bringing the

27:17.836 --> 27:20.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plague of Western culture and
the whole regime
will start to unravel.

27:21.006 --> 27:24.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, are you
saying, on balance,
the nuclear deal and the
prisoner release

27:24.109 --> 27:26.011 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were a bad idea?

27:26.044 --> 27:30.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REUEL MARC GERECHT: Yes. I
think, on balance,
if your objective is to stop
them from developing

27:30.215 --> 27:34.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a nuclear weapon permanently,
the nuclear
deal is certainly not going to
do that.

27:34.353 --> 27:40.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What it does at best is kick
down the road
eight to 10 years this question
of the nuclear

27:40.792 --> 27:42.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- development of a nuclear
weapon, at best.

27:42.728 --> 27:44.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
the future Iran?

27:44.663 --> 27:48.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBIN WRIGHT: Well, I actually
think the nuclear
deal was a very important step
and that it

27:48.600 --> 27:53.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
takes the danger of a nuclear
weapon off the
table for a lot longer than
eight to 10 years,

27:53.372 --> 27:57.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
25 years, in some cases, on some
of the most
important issues, and longer,
because Iran

27:57.643 --> 27:59.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has to sign an agreement.

27:59.444 --> 28:03.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And if it violates that
agreement any time,
even after 25 years, it's liable
for military

28:03.048 --> 28:08.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
action. The military option is
not off the
table. It is off the table for
now. But this

28:08.387 --> 28:12.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
is still a revolutionary
society. And -- but
it does have interests.

28:12.925 --> 28:17.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when it comes to interests,
self-interests,
Iran has taken some practical
steps over the

28:17.262 --> 28:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last week. The big question is,
is it willing
to take more? And it will face a
lot of tests

28:21.833 --> 28:27.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in -- particularly across the
region. Can
it -- is it willing to walk away
from President

28:27.773 --> 28:32.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Assad in the name of peace and
stopping the
Islamic State, which has gotten
as close as

28:32.811 --> 28:34.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
25 miles from the Iranian
border?

28:34.546 --> 28:39.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are afraid of it too. Can
they solve
-- are they willing to tolerate
some kind

28:39.551 --> 28:44.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of peace arrangement in Yemen?
What is going
to happen in Iraq? There are
places that we

28:44.523 --> 28:49.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually have common interests
with the Iranians
these days, which is a far cry
from the way

28:49.528 --> 28:51.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's been for most of the last
40 years.

28:51.129 --> 28:54.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ray Takeyh, do
you anything
positive coming out of this?

28:54.333 --> 28:59.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAY TAKEYH: Well, there is a
contest playing
itself out in Iran, two visions.
They are

28:59.271 --> 29:01.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
both impractical.

29:01.073 --> 29:04.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is a vision of Ali Khamenei,
namely, Iran
can shield itself from external
influences,

29:04.343 --> 29:09.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can develop its local economy
and regional
economy as a means of economic
growth, trade

29:09.948 --> 29:14.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Iraq, Afghanistan, Central
Asia, and
it doesn't require the Western
commerce.

29:14.786 --> 29:18.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is Hassan Rouhani's
vision, namely,
that we can do a sort of a China
model, have

29:18.991 --> 29:24.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
commerce without democracy. They
both are
impractical visions and neither
one can succeed.

29:24.830 --> 29:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iran cannot be self-sufficient,
nor can it
essentially insulate itself from
outside influence.

29:28.367 --> 29:33.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Islamic Republic today feels
like the
Soviet Union of the 1970s, a
stagnant bureaucratic

29:33.238 --> 29:38.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state incapable of reforming
itself and presaging
its probable implosion at some
point.

29:38.310 --> 29:40.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you're saying
that is going
to change?

29:40.078 --> 29:42.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAY TAKEYH: I think that's a
good thing. It's
probably...

29:42.080 --> 29:43.849 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

29:43.882 --> 29:45.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAY TAKEYH: Now, I don't know
when that is
going to happen, but Islamic
Republic cannot

29:46.018 --> 29:49.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reform itself. It's too wedded
to its ideology
verities to do so.

29:49.054 --> 29:53.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On balance,
Karim, a good move
over the weekend, what the
Iranians did, or

29:53.992 --> 29:54.660 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
not?

29:54.693 --> 29:56.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KARIM SADJADPOUR: I think so.

29:56.495 --> 29:58.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, when you are in this
business, if
are you opposed to something,
you have to

29:58.730 --> 30:02.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
propose a better alternative.
And I think
that we're hard-pressed to come
up with a

30:02.934 --> 30:05.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
better alternative, and we have
to see what
happens.

30:05.837 --> 30:09.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we will all
be watching.
And I know the four of you,
nobody watching

30:09.541 --> 30:15.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
closer than you, Ray Takeyh,
Karim Sadjadpour,
Robin Wright, Reuel Gerecht, we
thank you.

30:15.714 --> 30:20.185 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REUEL MARC GERECHT: Pleasure.

30:20.218 --> 30:25.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KARIM SADJADPOUR: Thank you,
Judy.

30:25.824 --> 30:31.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

30:31.463 --> 30:37.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
impact of
the ongoing gas leak in Los
Angeles; and a

30:37.169 --> 30:41.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rare recording of Martin Luther
King released
to the public.

30:41.173 --> 30:46.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, first, two
weeks from
tonight, voters in Iowa will
gather to caucus

30:46.578 --> 30:50.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and cast the first votes in the
race for president.

30:50.082 --> 30:54.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last night, the Democratic
candidates debated
one last time before voting.

30:54.553 --> 30:59.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"NewsHour" political director
Lisa Desjardins
reports how the tightening race
sparked the

30:59.224 --> 31:02.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats' most tense debate
yet.

31:02.694 --> 31:09.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The three
Democratic candidates
entered the stage, and a debate,
with substance

31:09.334 --> 31:11.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and swipes, both.

31:11.169 --> 31:13.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
This should not be a political
issue.

31:13.071 --> 31:17.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The first
topic, guns, was
close to home for the
Charleston, South Carolina,

31:17.275 --> 31:23.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
crowd, where nine black
churchgoers were killed
by a white gunman in June.

31:23.315 --> 31:29.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NBC's Lester Holt asked Bernie
Sanders about
his 2005 vote to protect gun
makers and gun

31:29.154 --> 31:34.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sellers from lawsuits. Sanders
replied he
was now for a bill that would
roll back some

31:34.493 --> 31:36.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of those protections.

31:36.294 --> 31:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: What we
also said, is
a small mom and pop gun shop who
sells a gun

31:41.867 --> 31:47.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
legally to somebody should not
be held liable
if somebody does something
terrible with that

31:47.706 --> 31:49.541 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
gun.

31:49.574 --> 31:52.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what I said is, I would
re-look at it.
We are going to re-look at it
and I will support

31:52.344 --> 31:53.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
stronger provisions.

31:54.012 --> 31:57.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Hillary Clinton
pounced at
the chance to be to the left of
Sanders.

31:57.082 --> 32:01.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
He has voted with the NRA, with
the gun lobby

32:01.987 --> 32:07.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
numerous times. He voted against
the Brady
Bill five times. He voted for
what we call

32:07.926 --> 32:13.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Charleston loophole. He
voted for immunity
from gun makers and sellers.

32:13.431 --> 32:18.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Third on stage,
and a distant
third in the polls, Martin
O'Malley hit at

32:18.236 --> 32:20.038 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
both rivals.

32:20.071 --> 32:21.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARTIN O'MALLEY (D),
Presidential Candidate:
they've both been inconsistent
when it comes

32:21.973 --> 32:22.741 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to this issue.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.543 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

32:24.576 --> 32:28.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN O'MALLEY: I'm the one
candidate on
this stage that actually brought
people together

32:28.046 --> 32:30.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to pass comprehensive gun safety
legislation.

32:30.382 --> 32:35.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Another clash
came on health
care. Clinton said political
reality makes

32:35.754 --> 32:40.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
another health care overhaul
impossible right
now, and, instead, President
Obama's Affordable

32:40.892 --> 32:42.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Care Act must be protected.

32:42.727 --> 32:47.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: There
are things we
can do to improve it, but to
tear it up and

32:47.232 --> 32:52.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
start over again, pushing our
country back
into that kind of a contentious
debate, I

32:52.838 --> 32:54.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
think, is the wrong direction.

32:54.539 --> 32:58.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But Sanders
insisted the
U.S. should strive to cover
everyone.

32:58.476 --> 33:02.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: No one is
tearing this
up. We're going to go forward.
But with the

33:03.014 --> 33:08.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
secretary neglected to mention,
not just the
29 million still have no health
insurance,

33:08.620 --> 33:13.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that even more are underinsured
with huge
co-payments and deductibles.

33:13.391 --> 33:17.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The volleying
came hours
after Sanders released this, an
outline of

33:17.829 --> 33:23.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his Medicare-for-all plan.
Sanders would replace
the current system, private
insurers, with

33:24.002 --> 33:31.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a single government-run system.
The price
tag, $1.4 trillion a year, his
campaign says.

33:31.676 --> 33:37.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders would pay for that a few
ways: Employers
and most taxpayers would each
pay a percentage

33:37.148 --> 33:43.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of income as a kind of premium.
But the biggest
chunk comes from a sweeping
income tax change.

33:43.722 --> 33:50.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders would raise rates for
those making
over $250,000. They'd rise to a
52 percent

33:50.061 --> 33:54.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
income tax for the very top,
multimillionaires.

33:54.332 --> 33:58.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That touched off a dispute over
whether the
middle class would come out
ahead or behind

33:58.570 --> 34:00.372 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from the plan.

34:00.405 --> 34:03.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I'm the
only candidate
standing here tonight who has
said I will

34:03.842 --> 34:05.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not raise taxes on the middle
class.

34:05.744 --> 34:09.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: It's one
thing to say
I'm raising taxes. It's another
thing to say

34:09.748 --> 34:14.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we are doing away with
private health
insurance premiums.

34:14.052 --> 34:18.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: With each
exchange, the candidates
were fighting to define
themselves and each

34:18.623 --> 34:23.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other. Sanders pushed his
anti-Wall Street
message and Clinton's donations
from banks.

34:23.795 --> 34:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: It's easy
to say, well,
I'm going to do this and do
that, but I have

34:27.966 --> 34:32.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doubts when people receive huge
amounts of
money from Wall Street.

34:32.270 --> 34:36.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In her defense,
and through
the night, Clinton clung to
President Obama

34:36.908 --> 34:38.777 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more than ever.

34:38.810 --> 34:45.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: He's
criticized President
Obama for taking donations from
Wall Street,

34:45.050 --> 34:50.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and President Obama has led our
country out
of the great recession. Senator
Sanders called

34:51.022 --> 34:52.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
him weak, disappointing.

34:52.857 --> 34:57.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The candidates
did talk foreign
policy, but the real divides
were domestic

34:57.996 --> 35:03.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and sharper than seen before, a
sign of a
tightening race, with voting in
Iowa just

35:03.568 --> 35:05.070 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two weeks away.

35:05.103 --> 35:07.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

35:07.605 --> 35:13.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: With more on last
night's debate
and the race among the
Republican candidates,

35:13.278 --> 35:18.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Politics Monday, we turn to
Tamara Keith
of NPR, and, filling in for Amy
Walter, Susan

35:18.383 --> 35:20.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Page of USA Today.

35:20.385 --> 35:21.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

35:21.486 --> 35:23.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Thank
you.

35:23.288 --> 35:26.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, they didn't
hold back,
Tamara. Did either one of them
land any lasting

35:26.358 --> 35:28.093 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
blows?

35:28.126 --> 35:30.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: I think that they
both came
out and they defined themselves
the way that

35:30.795 --> 35:36.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they wanted to be defined, which
is Hillary
Clinton came out, and she really
was the pragmatic

35:36.134 --> 35:41.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one, the one who said, you know,
I have fought
this fight, and this is going to
be tough,

35:41.740 --> 35:47.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and tried to paint Senator
Sanders of idealistic
and out of touch.

35:47.145 --> 35:52.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Senator Sanders did a
pretty good
job of painting her as willing
to settle for

35:52.784 --> 35:57.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
less, and why should the U.S. do
what it's
done before and sort of settle
for what the

35:58.023 --> 36:00.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Washington establishment says is
possible?

36:00.158 --> 36:03.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think they both came out and
they were themselves.

36:03.061 --> 36:04.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan?

36:04.996 --> 36:07.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau
Chief, USA Today:
Such a different tone from the
previous three

36:07.165 --> 36:07.832 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
debates.

36:07.866 --> 36:09.601 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Really different.

36:09.634 --> 36:11.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Remember that first
debate, when
Bernie Sanders said, "We're sick
and tired

36:11.302 --> 36:14.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of hearing about your damn
e-mails," and they
shook hands and everybody
smiled?

36:14.239 --> 36:18.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Days of smiling with each other
were over,
two weeks until the Iowa
caucuses, margin

36:18.877 --> 36:24.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of error races in both Iowa and
New Hampshire.
So you really saw them really
fiercely attacking

36:24.983 --> 36:26.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one another in ways that we
haven't even before.

36:26.785 --> 36:30.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Did you think
that anything
that was said did real damage?

36:30.488 --> 36:37.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Yes, I do. I think
that the -- that
the -- Bernie Sanders did some
damage to Hillary

36:37.062 --> 36:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton by saying, I have an
idealistic vision
for coverage for all, health
care coverage

36:41.699 --> 36:45.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for all. That is going to appeal
to voters
who are in the Democratic -- who
vote in Democratic

36:45.603 --> 36:47.372 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
primaries.

36:47.405 --> 36:50.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I thought Hillary Clinton,
by embracing
Barack Obama in a way that she
hasn't done

36:50.708 --> 36:56.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before, helped her in states
like South Carolina,
where Barack Obama has a 90
percent approval

36:56.548 --> 37:02.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rating among Democrats in South
Carolina,
and raising issues about the
criticism that

37:02.854 --> 37:04.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bernie Sanders has made of Obama
in the past.

37:04.622 --> 37:07.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think, in that way, both
of them did
some of the damage they came in
intending

37:07.959 --> 37:09.194 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to do.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why, Tamara,
didn't we see
this earlier?

37:11.329 --> 37:14.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I ask because there was a --
I think a
New York Times story over the
weekend that

37:14.666 --> 37:19.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said there are some in the
Clinton camp who
think maybe they should have
gone after Sanders

37:19.137 --> 37:20.872 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
earlier.

37:20.905 --> 37:23.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And it's not clear
to me that
those people are really inside
the Clinton

37:23.575 --> 37:29.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaign, as much as maybe
friends of the
Clintons or people in the orbit.

37:29.747 --> 37:35.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was inevitable. This race
has gotten
closer. And, also, people are
paying attention

37:35.553 --> 37:40.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now. I went to a bunch of events
in Iowa last
week. And every voter I met
said, oh, this

37:40.825 --> 37:45.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the first campaign event I'm
going to this
cycle. People are paying
attention now and

37:45.296 --> 37:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the candidates are making their
closing arguments.

37:48.166 --> 37:52.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it can't be all hugs and
kumbaya at the
very end. They need to define
themselves.

37:52.937 --> 37:57.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An interesting question for
Bernie Sanders
is, does defining himself, does
trying to

37:58.009 --> 38:03.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
define Hillary Clinton make him
seem more
like a politician? People expect
Hillary Clinton

38:03.681 --> 38:08.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be like a politician. It's
not as clear
that people expect Bernie
Sanders to do the

38:08.486 --> 38:10.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
politician thing.

38:10.321 --> 38:14.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Susan, how
much is Hillary
Clinton being pulled to the left
by Sanders,

38:14.225 --> 38:18.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who, as we need remind no one,
has called
himself a Democratic socialist?

38:18.863 --> 38:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: You know, I don't
know if Bernie
Sanders will get the nomination
or not, will

38:22.267 --> 38:25.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
win the war, but -- will win the
battle, but
he's won the war.

38:25.670 --> 38:31.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton already has been
pulled significantly
to the left on a whole series of
issues, including

38:31.743 --> 38:34.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- including saying she wants to
change the
health care system, even though
she hasn't

38:34.879 --> 38:38.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really laid out any details on
how she wants
to improve and build on
Obamacare.

38:38.516 --> 38:43.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On other issues well, she's
including income
inequality and treatment of Wall
Street. We

38:43.855 --> 38:46.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have seen her pulled to the left
because of
this challenge from Bernie
Sanders.

38:47.025 --> 38:49.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's talk for a
few minutes
about the Republicans.

38:49.961 --> 38:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it's getting tougher, Tamara,
on the Democratic
side, it's clearly getting
tougher on the

38:55.233 --> 39:01.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican side between these
two front-runners,
at least in Iowa, Ted Cruz and
Donald Trump.

39:01.472 --> 39:06.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In that case, is it the same
dynamic at work,
that we're getting close to
voting and it's

39:06.144 --> 39:07.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just getting nasty as a result?

39:07.779 --> 39:09.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: We are getting
close to voting.

39:09.781 --> 39:17.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Ted Cruz had said he had
sort of predicted
this, that he was going to hug
Donald Trump

39:17.355 --> 39:24.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
until he didn't anymore. Donald
Trump has
not fallen as Ted Cruz sort of
expected him

39:24.195 --> 39:29.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to. And so he's starting to go
on the attack
and say, hey, look, Donald Trump
isn't a real

39:30.001 --> 39:32.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conservative. He used to be a
Democrat.

39:32.303 --> 39:38.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, Donald Trump,
whenever someone
is on his heels, turns around
and begins attacking.

39:38.509 --> 39:42.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is not a surprise. One
interesting
thing today that sort of gives a
sense of

39:42.547 --> 39:47.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the state of the race, Donald
Trump was at
Liberty University, the
evangelical university,

39:47.252 --> 39:52.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
giving a speech, and Ted Cruz is
now in New
Hampshire, where Donald Trump
has a solid

39:52.056 --> 39:55.460 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lead, on a 17-stop bus tour.

39:55.493 --> 39:58.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, they are going -- going for
each other's
strengths there.

39:58.796 --> 40:02.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What -- Susan,
how do you see
this race between the two of
them? Is it really

40:02.700 --> 40:05.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between the -- is it down to the
two of them
now?

40:05.270 --> 40:09.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Well, it's down to
the two of
them to be the front-runner. And
who would

40:09.507 --> 40:12.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have thought six months ago,
when these people
were announcing, that we would
get two weeks

40:12.510 --> 40:16.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before the Iowa caucuses and the
two leading
candidates nationwide and in the
first two

40:16.981 --> 40:20.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states would be Donald Trump and
Ted Cruz?
I don't think any of us would
have predicted

40:20.551 --> 40:22.287 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

40:22.320 --> 40:24.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It just shows how remarkable
this race has
been. There's a battle between
the two of

40:24.756 --> 40:29.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
them to be the outsider
candidate who has
-- that have been leading the
field from the

40:29.594 --> 40:34.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
start. There is a second race
going on to
be the surviving establishment
figure, whether

40:34.299 --> 40:40.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's John Kasich or Chris
Christie or Jeb
Bush or Marco Rubio, to be the
alternative

40:40.571 --> 40:41.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
once that battle is won.

40:41.839 --> 40:43.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That separate
lane.

40:43.775 --> 40:47.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But are the -- do issues matter
at this point,
Tamara? Are voters -- and you
have been talking

40:47.278 --> 40:51.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to voters in Iowa. I mean, are
they asking
about the candidates' positions,
or is it

40:51.816 --> 40:53.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who do they like?

40:53.551 --> 40:56.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: I still think that
it's -- so
much of politics comes down to
who do you

40:56.954 --> 41:01.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like and who would you like to
have a beer
with some day.

41:01.959 --> 41:06.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's certainly an element of
that. I think
that issues matter too. But I
think that there

41:06.831 --> 41:15.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
may not be a really strong cry
for details
and specifics. It is not clear
yet, but it

41:15.073 --> 41:18.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sure seems like this could be a
passion election.

41:18.042 --> 41:25.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Susan, we
hear, we read,
we understand that Ted Cruz has
a pretty good

41:25.083 --> 41:29.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaign organization in Iowa.
How much does
that matter in the final...

41:29.320 --> 41:33.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: It could really
deliver for him
in Iowa, because Donald Trump
has tried to

41:33.691 --> 41:37.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
build an organization, but Ted
Cruz has the
traditional Iowa organization
that can turn

41:37.929 --> 41:39.664 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
people out.

41:39.697 --> 41:41.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I would just say, look at
what hasn't
mattered this year. Money hasn't
mattered,

41:41.566 --> 41:45.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or Jeb Bush would be leading. I
don't think
that issues have mattered so
much. It's really

41:45.336 --> 41:51.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been, who can channel my anger?
Who can shake
things up, especially on the
Republican side?

41:51.509 --> 41:55.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it may be a year in which
organization
matters less. We're just going
to have to

41:55.146 --> 41:56.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
find out in two weeks.

41:56.948 --> 42:00.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And are we
seeing, just quickly,
Tamara, New Hampshire waiting to
see what

42:00.084 --> 42:02.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iowa does, or is New Hampshire
already making
up its mind?

42:02.687 --> 42:05.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: I don't think New
Hampshire
would ever say that they are
waiting to see

42:05.490 --> 42:07.859 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what Iowa does.

42:07.892 --> 42:13.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, there is, like, a real
intense campaign
happening there, just as there
is in Iowa,

42:13.931 --> 42:16.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and especially in the
establishment lane on
the Republican side.

42:16.934 --> 42:19.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it doesn't
get any more
exciting than this.

42:19.370 --> 42:22.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But it will be even more
exciting next week.
Tamara Keith, Susan Page, we
thank you.

42:22.540 --> 42:26.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: Thank you.

42:26.911 --> 42:32.750 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

42:32.784 --> 42:39.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we turn to
the natural
gas leak in Southern California.

42:39.724 --> 42:44.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier this month, Governor
Jerry Brown declared
a state of emergency for
residents of the

42:44.495 --> 42:49.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Porter Ranch neighborhood of Los
Angeles,
many of whom have been suffering
from health

42:49.400 --> 42:56.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
impacts since the leak began in
late October.
Relief well drilling efforts
continue at the

42:56.107 --> 43:01.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
site, but Southern California
Gas Company,
which owns the well, says it
could be late

43:01.078 --> 43:05.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
February or March before they
are able to
stop all leaks.

43:05.817 --> 43:10.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Cat Wise
recently visited
Porter Ranch, and she filed this
report.

43:10.988 --> 43:17.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: On the surface, it
seems a serene,
picturesque Southern California
town, with

43:17.728 --> 43:23.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gated communities and views. But
Porter Ranch,
which is home to 30,000
residents in Northern

43:23.401 --> 43:27.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
L.A., is anything but serene
these days.

43:27.171 --> 43:33.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An invisible environmental
disaster is unfolding
in the hills above the
community, where natural

43:33.211 --> 43:38.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gas, seen in this infrared video
taken by
an environmental group, is now
spewing out

43:38.449 --> 43:43.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from one the country's largest
underground
gas storage facilities called
Aliso Canyon.

43:43.187 --> 43:47.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE CONLEY, University of
California, Davis:
This one leak is roughly
equivalent to the

43:47.291 --> 43:53.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
entire Los Angeles Basin. It
will change California's
emissions for the year,
substantially.

43:53.264 --> 43:58.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Steve Conley an
atmospheric scientist
with the University of
California, Davis,

43:58.603 --> 44:03.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
owns one of only a handful of
planes in the
country with specialized
equipment that can

44:03.508 --> 44:07.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
measure gas leaks from the air.

44:07.712 --> 44:12.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the last several months,
he's been flying
the skies over Porter Ranch to
monitor methane

44:12.316 --> 44:19.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
emissions for the state.
Methane, a greenhouse
gas, is the main component of
natural gas.

44:19.156 --> 44:24.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's extremely potent. It's
more efficient
at trapping radiation and heat
than carbon

44:24.395 --> 44:26.130 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
dioxide.

44:26.163 --> 44:31.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE CONLEY: That first flight,
we measured
something like 44,000 kilograms
per hour.

44:31.502 --> 44:36.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The best number that I have come
up with to
give people a perspective, it's
close to 100,000

44:36.240 --> 44:40.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pounds an hour. Every month,
it's the weight
of an aircraft carrier.

44:40.211 --> 44:44.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My first thought was tapping the
instruments,
there's something wrong, because
we have never

44:44.282 --> 44:47.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seen anything like that on any
of our flights
in the past.

44:47.385 --> 44:52.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: In recent weeks, as
the Southern
California Gas Company has begun
to drain

44:52.523 --> 44:57.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the reservoir where gas is
stored, and reduce
the pressure, the amount being
released in

44:57.562 --> 45:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the air has come down by as much
as 60 percent,
according to spokesman Mike
Mizrahi.

45:02.166 --> 45:05.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the company is still unclear
why it happened.

45:05.269 --> 45:08.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE MIZRAHI, Southern
California Gas Company:
We really won't know what caused
the leak

45:08.105 --> 45:10.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
until we're able to stop it.

45:10.441 --> 45:17.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have estimated that,
about 500 feet
down the well, there was a break
through the

45:17.715 --> 45:24.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
encasement around the pipe
that's used to
inject and withdraw gas, and
that natural

45:24.155 --> 45:29.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gas is seeping through that
encasement, up
through the ground, and then
coming up right

45:29.694 --> 45:31.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about at the wellhead.

45:31.562 --> 45:37.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The well causing all
the havoc was
built in 1953. Like other
natural gas wells

45:37.234 --> 45:42.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the area, which are regulated
by the state,
it underwent yearly inspections
and weekly

45:42.173 --> 45:47.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pressure testing, but the
day-to-day monitoring
was done by personnel who
smelled the air

45:47.979 --> 45:52.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and listened for the sound of
gas escaping.
And that's how this leak was
discovered.

45:52.917 --> 45:57.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Much focus has been on a safety
valve that
was removed by the company and
not replaced

45:57.488 --> 45:59.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
back in the late '70s.

45:59.290 --> 46:05.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE MIZRAHI: The regulations do
not require
that we put valves or sensors
all the way

46:05.630 --> 46:09.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down. The Department of Oil and
Gas also has
said we were in total compliance
at the time

46:09.767 --> 46:15.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this leak. It's speculative
as to whether
a valve in this well would have
made any difference.

46:15.072 --> 46:19.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: You were in
compliance, and yet,
when public safety, public
health is at risk,

46:19.744 --> 46:21.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
why not exceed that?

46:21.679 --> 46:26.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE MIZRAHI: Well, in fact, we
have a filing
before the California Public
Utilities Commission

46:26.717 --> 46:37.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that dates to 2014, where we
will be enhancing
our inspection protocols, as
well as our pressure

46:37.061 --> 46:42.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
testing protocols, that will
hopefully give
us the funding to be able to
move forward.

46:42.500 --> 46:48.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The well that is
leaking is about
a mile-and-a-half over that hill
behind me.

46:48.172 --> 46:52.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some residents here have no
problems with
the gas, but thousands have been
sickened

46:52.610 --> 46:56.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the strong odorants added to
methane to
make it detectable.

46:56.681 --> 47:02.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Local health officials say there
are no long-term
health impacts, but many
residents remain

47:02.286 --> 47:09.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concerned. The Cohens are among
those families.
For the past month, they have
been staying

47:09.226 --> 47:14.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at a hotel about 30 miles from
their home
in Porter Ranch. They decided to
move after

47:14.532 --> 47:19.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all four of them experienced
health issues
that they attributed to the gas
leak, including

47:19.203 --> 47:21.338 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
nausea.

47:21.372 --> 47:26.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are one of about 4,000
households that
have relocated, or are in the
process of relocating,

47:26.944 --> 47:29.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to temporary housing paid for by
the gas company.

47:29.680 --> 47:32.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRIAN COHEN, California: We're
still kind
of figuring things out as we go.
Everything's

47:32.717 --> 47:35.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the fly right now. Our normal
routine is
not there.

47:35.386 --> 47:39.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STACEY COHEN, California: We
have to make
the best of it. And we have to
be positive

47:39.590 --> 47:45.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and be there for our children
and for everybody
else in the community.

47:45.896 --> 47:50.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: On the morning we
caught up with
them, the Cohens were heading
out for 7-year-old's

47:50.167 --> 47:54.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Weston's (ph) first day back at
school after
the winter break.

47:54.638 --> 48:00.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Weston wasn't returning to
his neighborhood
school. He and nearly 2,000
other Porter Ranch

48:00.277 --> 48:05.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
students have been relocated to
two temporary
schools miles away.

48:05.583 --> 48:11.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
L.A. Unified School District got
these portable
classrooms set up in just three
weeks, a project

48:11.756 --> 48:17.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that would normally take six
months. The costs
so far exceeds $5 million, and
the district

48:17.695 --> 48:21.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
expects that the gas company
will foot the
bill.

48:21.832 --> 48:26.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All the disruption has been
tough on the community,
according to Paula Cracium,
president of the

48:27.004 --> 48:28.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Porter Ranch Neighborhood
Council.

48:28.906 --> 48:31.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAULA CRACIUM, President, Porter
Ranch Neighborhood
Council: There's this enormous
stain on the

48:31.308 --> 48:34.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community right now caused by
this leak, and
a stain that's not going to go
away the day

48:34.512 --> 48:36.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
after the leak's fixed,
unfortunately.

48:36.413 --> 48:40.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Property values have been
enormously impacted.
Small businesses have been
impacted, and the

48:40.851 --> 48:42.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
question is whether or not they
will even
survive.

48:42.720 --> 48:47.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Cracium has been a
driving force
in the effort to bring attention
to the leak,

48:47.691 --> 48:52.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including securing a meeting
with Governor
Jerry Brown that led in part to
his emergency

48:52.263 --> 48:54.031 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
declaration.

48:54.064 --> 48:58.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she is also pushing for
better safety
regulations at Aliso Canyon
going forward.

48:58.402 --> 49:03.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she says the long-term
solution isn't
easy, because millions in the
L.A. area depend

49:03.574 --> 49:06.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the gas stored there for
their for energy
needs.

49:06.177 --> 49:09.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAULA CRACIUM: We can't flip on
a switch and
say no fossil fuels tomorrow. I
mean, that's

49:09.647 --> 49:14.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just not a realistic approach to
being able
to provide for people and their
needs.

49:14.752 --> 49:18.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's a certain percentage
of the community
that is very confident that it
can be made

49:18.722 --> 49:21.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
safe, and they're comfortable
with it being
up there.

49:21.158 --> 49:26.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Resident Matt Pakucko
definitely
isn't comfortable with the wells
above his

49:26.197 --> 49:34.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
home. Pakucko, who is a music
producer with
a recording studio in his
garage, is the co-founder

49:34.738 --> 49:40.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a group called Save Porter
Ranch. They
have been advocating that the
entire storage

49:40.044 --> 49:42.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
facility be closed, even before
the leak started.

49:42.980 --> 49:44.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As we talked, the wind blew in
the gas.

49:44.982 --> 49:46.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT PAKUCKO, Save Porter Ranch:
You can smell
the gas right now, right?

MATT PAKUCKO: Nice breeze and
gas.

49:50.221 --> 49:53.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People are smelling gas and oil
outside their
homes in these neighborhoods. It
has been

49:53.824 --> 49:57.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going on for years and decades.
You can't
have this -- these kind of
things next to

49:57.661 --> 50:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
residential neighborhoods. They
say that,
even if we had that safety
valve, it may not

50:02.466 --> 50:08.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prevent this. Are you telling us
that you
can't stop a well blowout? Shut
the place

50:08.172 --> 50:09.974 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
down.

CAT WISE: For scientist Steve
Conley, the
priority is better monitoring of
future leaks.

50:14.778 --> 50:20.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE CONLEY: As long as we are
relying on
fossil fuels, as long as we have
houses that

50:20.417 --> 50:24.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are using natural gas, we have
to have a storage
system. We have to store it.

50:24.788 --> 50:28.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if we store it, we're going
to have leaks.
One of the things I feel like we
have learned

50:28.425 --> 50:33.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from this is that, nationally,
we should have
a system in place to rapidly
respond to these

50:33.864 --> 50:36.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kind of events, because they're
going to happen.

Cohen family
and another displaced Porter
Ranch family

50:44.642 --> 50:49.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are hoping it doesn't happen
again, and that
they can go home soon.

JUDY WOODRUFF: The case in
Southern California
is dramatic, but not unique.
Experts say that

50:58.856 --> 51:05.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many smaller and mid-size leaks
occur across
the country, and while not as
huge, combined,

51:05.262 --> 51:09.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
can add up to serious
environmental damage.

research on our

Here is an excerpt:

51:46.136 --> 51:49.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN LUTHER KING JR., Civil
Rights Leader:
We have learned to fly the air
like birds

51:49.106 --> 51:56.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and swim the sea like fish, but
we have not
learned the simple art of living
together

51:56.380 --> 51:59.516 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as brothers.

51:59.550 --> 52:09.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every man lives in two realms,
the internal
and the external. The internal
is that realm

52:09.760 --> 52:19.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of spiritual ends expressed in
art, literature,
morals, and religion. The
external is that

52:19.903 --> 52:21.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
complex of devices,

52:21.705 --> 52:28.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the hearts of men, we
will come to
that great and glad day when men
all over

52:28.512 --> 52:35.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the world will be able to join
hands, black
and men and white men, Jews and
gentiles,

52:35.219 --> 52:42.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Protestants and Catholics,
Hindus and Muslims,
and sing in the words of the old
Negro spiritual,

52:42.292 --> 52:48.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
free at last, free at last.
Thank God all
mighty, we are free at last.

52:48.298 --> 52:49.299 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

On the "NewsHour" online: For
poet Ashlee
Haze, having black female role
models makes

53:01.412 --> 53:06.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all the difference to young
girls like her.
So she penned a poem and
dedicated it to one

53:06.517 --> 53:12.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of her heroes, rapper Missy
Elliott. The songwriter
was touched, and actually
surprised Haze with

53:12.856 --> 53:14.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a visit to her home.
