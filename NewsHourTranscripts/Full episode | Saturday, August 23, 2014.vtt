>>ON THIS EDITION FOR SATURDAY

00:12.012 --> 00:14.481
AUGUST 23: ISIS GAINS MORE

00:14.481 --> 00:16.350
CONTROL IN SYRIA AS THE UNITED

00:16.350 --> 00:18.252
STATES WEIGHS MILITARY OPTIONS;

00:18.252 --> 00:20.087
TENSIONS BETWEEN UKRAINE AND

00:20.087 --> 00:22.222
RUSSIA CONTINUE TO RISE; AND IN

00:22.222 --> 00:23.457
OUR SIGNATURE SEGMENT, THE

00:23.457 --> 00:25.459
ACCURACY OF BACKGROUND CHECKS

00:25.459 --> 00:18.552
DESIGNED TO KEEP THE WORKPLACE

00:18.552 --> 00:27.527
SAFE.

00:27.527 --> 00:29.062
>> I’M THINKING, THIS IS NOT

00:29.062 --> 00:30.330
RIGHT.

00:30.330 --> 00:31.398
YOU GUYS HAVE MADE A MAJOR

00:31.398 --> 00:32.599
MISTAKE, AND THIS NEEDS TO BE

00:32.599 --> 00:33.433
FIXED.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.869
>>NEXT ON PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.507
>>FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS

00:40.507 --> 00:42.175
IN LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:42.175 --> 00:43.610
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:44.411 --> 00:44.978
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING.

00:44.978 --> 00:45.579
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:45.579 --> 00:47.114
WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH SYRIA,

00:47.114 --> 00:48.115
WHERE THE EXTREMIST MILITANT

00:48.115 --> 00:49.750
GROUP ISIS HAS INCREASED ITS

00:49.750 --> 00:51.385
CONTROL IN PARTS OF THAT COUNTRY

00:51.385 --> 00:53.253
AND IN NEIGHBORING IRAQ.

00:53.253 --> 00:54.588
THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT CONTINUES

00:54.588 --> 00:55.689
TO BATTLE THE MILITANTS, WHO

00:55.689 --> 00:56.857
HAVE TAKEN CONTROL OF THREE

00:56.857 --> 00:59.059
MILITARY BASES IN RECENT WEEKS.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.260
LATE THIS WEEK, THE GOVERNMENT

01:00.260 --> 01:01.528
SENT IN REINFORCEMENTS TO

01:01.528 --> 01:03.163
MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE TABQA

01:03.163 --> 01:05.098
AIR BASE IN EASTERN SYRIA, THE

01:05.098 --> 01:06.833
GOVERNMENT’S LAST STRONGHOLD IN

01:06.833 --> 01:07.734
THE REGION.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.303
AFTER ISIS RELEASED A VIDEO ON

01:09.303 --> 01:10.904
TUESDAY SHOWING THE BEHEADING OF

01:10.904 --> 01:12.439
AMERICAN JOURNALIST JAMES FOLEY,

01:12.439 --> 01:13.573
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

01:13.573 --> 01:14.408
ANNOUNCED THAT IT IS

01:14.408 --> 01:16.109
RECONSIDERING ITS MILITARY

01:16.109 --> 01:17.377
STRATEGY, INCLUDING THE

01:17.377 --> 01:19.012
POSSIBILITY OF AIR STRIKES IN

01:19.012 --> 01:19.980
SYRIA.

01:19.980 --> 01:21.548
THIS FOLLOWING A NEW UNITED

01:21.548 --> 01:22.883
NATIONS REPORT WHICH PUTS THE

01:22.883 --> 01:24.551
DEATH TOLL FROM THE CONFLICT IN

01:24.551 --> 01:27.754
SYRIA AT MORE THAN 191,000.

01:27.754 --> 01:28.889
IN THE LAST YEAR, THE NUMBER OF

01:28.889 --> 01:29.990
CASUALTIES HAS MORE THAN

01:29.990 --> 01:30.824
DOUBLED.

01:30.824 --> 01:32.025
FOR SOME ANALYSIS OF THE SYRIAN

01:32.025 --> 01:33.293
SITUATION AS THE UNITED STATES

01:33.293 --> 01:35.162
CONSIDERS ITS OPTIONS AGAINST

01:35.162 --> 01:36.563
ISIS, WE ARE JOINED FROM

01:36.563 --> 01:38.165
WASHINGTON BY DOUGLAS OLLIVANT.

01:38.165 --> 01:39.433
HE IS A SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY

01:39.433 --> 01:40.534
STUDIES FELLOW AT THE NEW

01:40.534 --> 01:42.336
AMERICA FOUNDATION AND A PARTNER

01:42.336 --> 01:44.304
AT MANTID INTERNATIONAL.

01:44.304 --> 01:45.238
DOUG, LET ME START WITH THAT

01:45.238 --> 01:47.808
U.N. REPORT-- 191,000 DEAD.

01:47.808 --> 01:48.942
JUST TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE,

01:48.942 --> 01:50.310
THAT’S THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF

01:50.310 --> 01:52.346
SALT LAKE CITY GONE.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.947
>> SYRIA JUST CONTINUES TO

01:53.947 --> 01:54.514
BLEED.

01:54.514 --> 01:57.050
THE CIVIL WAR GOES ON AND ON,

01:57.050 --> 01:59.052
NEW REINFORCEMENTS SEEM TO BE

01:59.052 --> 02:01.555
COMING TO EACH SIDE, AND THERE

02:01.555 --> 02:03.557
DOES SEEM TO BE NO END IN SIGHT.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.158
IT’S A CONTINUING HUMANITARIAN

02:05.158 --> 02:06.126
DISASTER.

02:06.126 --> 02:06.994
>> Sreenivasan: AND SO, HOW

02:06.994 --> 02:08.261
SIGNIFICANT IS IT IF THEY GAIN

02:08.261 --> 02:10.864
CONTROL OF THIS AIRBASE?

02:10.864 --> 02:12.199
>> ANY TIME YOU LOSE A PIECE OF

02:12.199 --> 02:14.067
INFRASTRUCTURE, IT’S VERY

02:14.067 --> 02:14.735
SERIOUS.

02:14.735 --> 02:15.535
AND THIS APPEARS TO BE THE

02:15.535 --> 02:17.070
GOVERNMENT’S REAL LAST

02:17.070 --> 02:19.573
STRONGHOLD IN THE EAST, AND

02:19.573 --> 02:20.774
THEY’RE DIRECTLY CONFRONTING

02:20.774 --> 02:22.476
ISIS FOR CONTROL OF THIS KEY

02:22.476 --> 02:23.443
TERRAIN.

02:23.443 --> 02:23.977
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT KIND OF

02:23.977 --> 02:25.712
CONTROL DOES ISIS HAVE IN THE

02:25.712 --> 02:26.513
ENTIRE COUNTRY?

02:26.513 --> 02:27.581
IS IT BASICALLY, THE ENTIRE

02:27.581 --> 02:28.749
NORTHERN END THEY’VE TAKEN

02:28.749 --> 02:30.851
CONTROL OVER, SIMILAR TO IRAQ?

02:30.851 --> 02:32.519
>> WELL, THEY CERTAINLY HAVE

02:32.519 --> 02:35.322
LOOSE CONTROL OVER MUCH OF THE

02:35.322 --> 02:36.590
NORTHEASTERN PART, EVERYTHING

02:36.590 --> 02:39.526
BETWEEN THE REGIME AND THE KURDS

02:39.526 --> 02:41.628
WITH OCCASIONAL SMATTERINGS OF

02:41.628 --> 02:44.798
FREE SYRIAN ARMY CONTROLLED

02:44.798 --> 02:46.600
AREAS AND ISLAMIC FRONT

02:46.600 --> 02:47.734
CONTROLLED AREAS.

02:47.734 --> 02:49.436
BUT IN SHORT, THEY HAVE SOME

02:49.436 --> 02:51.538
CONTIGUOUS TERRITORY IN SYRIA

02:51.538 --> 02:52.672
THAT ADJOINS WHAT THEY

02:52.672 --> 02:54.041
CONTROL IN IRAQ.

02:54.041 --> 02:54.674
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ARE SOME

02:54.674 --> 02:55.942
OF THE OPTIONS HERE FOR THE

02:55.942 --> 02:56.643
U.S.?

02:56.643 --> 02:57.444
AIR STRIKES HAVE BEEN

02:57.444 --> 02:58.178
SOMETHING THAT’S BEEN

02:58.178 --> 02:58.745
CONSIDERED.

02:58.745 --> 03:00.313
WE’RE HEARING CONVERSATIONS OF

03:00.313 --> 03:02.549
TRYING TO ASK CONGRESS FOR THE

03:02.549 --> 03:04.284
AUTHORIZATION OF UNLIMITED USES

03:04.284 --> 03:07.020
OF FORCE.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.088
>> I THINK AS THE ADMINISTRATION

03:08.088 --> 03:09.856
LOOKS AT THE PROBLEM AS A WHOLE,

03:09.856 --> 03:11.925
THE ISIS THREAT IN BOTH IRAQ AND

03:11.925 --> 03:13.627
SYRIA, YOU START TO REALIZE THAT

03:13.627 --> 03:15.495
IF YOU ONLY ATTACK THEM IN IRAQ

03:15.495 --> 03:16.997
AND LEAVE THEM A SAFE HAVEN IN

03:16.997 --> 03:18.965
SYRIA, THAT’S JUST NOT GOING TO

03:18.965 --> 03:19.633
WORK.

03:19.633 --> 03:20.600
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE PRECEDENCE FOR

03:20.600 --> 03:21.068
THIS.

03:21.068 --> 03:23.136
THE TALIBAN AND HAQQANIS HAVING

03:23.136 --> 03:24.871
THEIR SAFE HAVENS IN PAKISTAN,

03:24.871 --> 03:26.339
AND, GOING BACK FURTHER, THE

03:26.339 --> 03:27.841
VIET CONG WITH THEIR SAFE HAVENS

03:27.841 --> 03:28.842
IN CAMBODIA.

03:28.842 --> 03:29.943
IF YOU JUST STRIKE THEM ON ONE

03:29.943 --> 03:31.111
SIDE OF THE BORDER AND LEAVE

03:31.111 --> 03:33.046
THEM A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN REST

03:33.046 --> 03:35.148
AND REFIT AND BE SAFE, YOUR

03:35.148 --> 03:38.885
CHANCE OF SUCCESS ARE VERY SLIM.

03:38.885 --> 03:39.419
>> Sreenivasan: YESTERDAY, BEN

03:39.419 --> 03:41.521
RHODES MADE THIS QUOTE "WE’RE

03:41.521 --> 03:43.056
NOT GOING TO BE RESTRICTED BY

03:43.056 --> 03:44.458
BORDERS," WHICH IS A FAIRLY

03:44.458 --> 03:45.492
AGGRESSIVE FOREIGN POLICY

03:45.492 --> 03:47.227
STANCE.

03:47.227 --> 03:47.727
>> THAT’S CERTAINLY THE FIRST

03:47.727 --> 03:49.229
TIME WE’VE HEARD THAT, AND I

03:49.229 --> 03:50.597
THINK THE ADMINISTRATION IS

03:50.597 --> 03:53.033
STARTING TO RECALCULATE EXACTLY

03:53.033 --> 03:55.135
WHAT’S INVOLVED IN SOME OF ITS

03:55.135 --> 03:57.637
INTERNAL PREFERENCES IT MAY HAVE

03:57.637 --> 03:59.773
TO OVERCOME TO EFFECTIVELY

03:59.773 --> 04:01.475
CONFRONT THE ISIS THREAT.

04:01.475 --> 04:03.210
>> Sreenivasan: AND HERE’S HOW

04:03.210 --> 04:04.077
IT GETS A LITTLE TRICKY IN THE

04:04.077 --> 04:05.178
MIDDLE EAST IN THE SENSE THAT

04:05.178 --> 04:07.047
LAST YEAR, THERE WASN’T ENOUGH

04:07.047 --> 04:08.248
SUPPORT BY THE INTERNATIONAL

04:08.248 --> 04:09.716
COMMUNITY TO GO AFTER THE ASSAD

04:09.716 --> 04:10.383
REGIME.

04:10.383 --> 04:11.651
AND NOW, IF WE ESSENTIALLY

04:11.651 --> 04:13.420
ATTACK AN ENEMY OF OUR ENEMY,

04:13.420 --> 04:14.855
ARE WE ESSENTIALLY HELPING

04:14.855 --> 04:16.623
BASHAR AL-ASSAD?

04:16.623 --> 04:18.158
>> THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES,

04:18.158 --> 04:19.626
AND THAT’S WHAT MAKES THIS SO

04:19.626 --> 04:20.760
COMPLICATED.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.162
THIS IS WHY WE’VE NOT STRUCK

04:22.162 --> 04:24.164
ISIS IN SYRIA AS NO ONE HAS

04:24.164 --> 04:25.398
WANTED TO GIVE EVEN THE

04:25.398 --> 04:28.235
APPEARANCE OF GIVING AID AND

04:28.235 --> 04:30.871
SUPPORT TO THE ASSAD REGIME.

04:30.871 --> 04:32.272
BUT I THINK WE’RE NOW COMING TO

04:32.272 --> 04:34.307
A RELUCTANT ACCEPTANCE OF THE

04:34.307 --> 04:36.343
FACT THAT AS BAD AS THE ASSAD

04:36.343 --> 04:38.111
REGIME IS-- AND NO ONE IS

04:38.111 --> 04:39.779
DOWNPLAYING HOW AWFUL THE ASSAD

04:39.779 --> 04:42.415
REGIME IS-- THE ISIS THREAT IS

04:42.415 --> 04:44.217
BOTH WORSE AND A MORE REAL

04:44.217 --> 04:45.785
DANGER TO THE UNITED STATES AND

04:45.785 --> 04:46.753
ITS INTERESTS.

04:46.753 --> 04:47.154
>> Sreenivasan: DOUGLAS

04:47.154 --> 04:47.888
OLLIVANT JOINING US FROM

04:47.888 --> 04:49.589
WASHINGTON, THANKS SO MUCH.

04:49.589 --> 04:51.391
>> THANK YOU, HARI.

04:51.391 --> 04:51.791
>> Sreenivasan: TENSIONS

04:51.791 --> 04:53.059
CONTINUE TO MOUNT IN THE RUSSIA-

04:53.059 --> 04:56.329
UKRAINE CRISIS AS 227 TRUCKS

04:56.329 --> 04:58.098
FROM A RUSSIAN AID CONVOY

04:58.098 --> 04:59.466
DEPARTED UKRAINE TODAY AND

04:59.466 --> 05:00.901
RETURNED TO RUSSIA.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.402
THE CONVOY ENTERED UKRAINE ON

05:02.402 --> 05:03.803
FRIDAY THROUGH A REBEL-HELD

05:03.803 --> 05:05.238
BORDER, A MOVE THE UKRAINIAN

05:05.238 --> 05:06.239
GOVERNMENT CALLED AN ACT OF

05:06.239 --> 05:07.174
INVASION.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.542
THE MISSION OF THE CONVOY HAS

05:08.542 --> 05:10.377
BEEN CONSISTENTLY DISPUTED.

05:10.377 --> 05:11.478
IN QUESTION: WHAT THE TRUCKS

05:11.478 --> 05:12.979
CONTAINED, AND IF THEY ACTUALLY

05:12.979 --> 05:14.714
DELIVERED ANY HUMANITARIAN AID

05:14.714 --> 05:16.449
TO THE REBEL-HELD CITY OF

05:16.449 --> 05:17.384
LUHANSK.

05:17.384 --> 05:18.552
ON FRIDAY, NATO SAID IT HAD

05:18.552 --> 05:20.253
EVIDENCE THAT RUSSIAN TROOPS ARE

05:20.253 --> 05:22.022
OPERATING INSIDE UKRAINE, AN

05:22.022 --> 05:23.256
ACCUSATION THAT MOSCOW’S

05:23.256 --> 05:25.425
AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N. DENIED.

05:25.425 --> 05:26.860
AS GOVERNMENT FORCES CONTINUED

05:26.860 --> 05:28.528
THEIR FIGHT TO RECLAIM THE

05:28.528 --> 05:30.597
REBEL-HELD CITY OF DONETSK,

05:30.597 --> 05:31.831
UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT PETRO

05:31.831 --> 05:32.966
POROSHENKO MET WITH GERMAN

05:32.966 --> 05:33.667
CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL TODAY

05:33.667 --> 05:35.535
IN KIEV.

05:35.535 --> 05:37.237
MERKEL MADE THE TRIP AS A SHOW

05:37.237 --> 05:39.406
OF SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE AND TO

05:39.406 --> 05:40.407
URGE A PEACEFUL POLITICAL

05:40.407 --> 05:43.743
SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS.

05:43.743 --> 05:44.945
PRESIDENT PETRO POROSHENKO IS

05:44.945 --> 05:46.413
SET TO MEET WITH RUSSIAN

05:46.413 --> 05:48.348
PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN IN

05:48.348 --> 05:49.516
MINSK ON TUESDAY FOR THEIR FIRST

05:49.516 --> 05:52.152
ENCOUNTER SINCE JUNE.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.453
FOR MORE, WE’RE JOINED BY STEVE

05:53.453 --> 05:54.554
SESTANOVICH, A SENIOR FELLOW

05:54.554 --> 05:55.589
FROM THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN

05:55.589 --> 05:56.656
RELATIONS IN WASHINGTON, D.C.,

05:56.656 --> 05:58.358
AND AUTHOR OF THE BOOK

05:58.358 --> 05:59.793
"MAXIMALIST: AMERICA IN THE

05:59.793 --> 06:04.297
WORLD FROM TRUMAN TO OBAMA."

06:04.297 --> 06:05.232
SO, DID VLADIMIR PUTIN WIN IN

06:05.232 --> 06:07.000
THE WORLD OF WAR OF PERCEPTION,

06:07.000 --> 06:09.903
SO TO SPEAK, OR DID HE BACK

06:09.903 --> 06:09.970
DOWN?

06:09.970 --> 06:10.937
>> HE CERTAINLY DID SOMETHING

06:10.937 --> 06:12.706
THAT WAS UNEXPECTED.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.774
YESTERDAY, EVERYBODY WAS

06:14.774 --> 06:15.875
PREDICTING THAT MAYBE WE WERE

06:15.875 --> 06:17.744
FINALLY GOING OVER THE CLIFF TO

06:17.744 --> 06:20.347
WAR, THAT THIS TIME THE RUSSIANS

06:20.347 --> 06:22.549
WERE SERIOUS ABOUT AN INVASION,

06:22.549 --> 06:24.217
AND ALL HELL WAS GOING TO BREAK

06:24.217 --> 06:25.518
LOOSE.

06:25.518 --> 06:27.020
TODAY, THEY ARE TAKING THE

06:27.020 --> 06:29.456
TROOPS BACK, AND PUTIN HAS NOT

06:29.456 --> 06:31.458
DONE THE BIG THING THAT HE

06:31.458 --> 06:32.592
SEEMED TO BE THREATENING, WHICH

06:32.592 --> 06:36.663
WAS TO MAKE HIS TROOPS, HIS MEN,

06:36.663 --> 06:38.832
HIS TRUCKS A SHIELD FOR THE

06:38.832 --> 06:41.034
SEPARATISTS IN EASTERN UKRAINE.

06:41.034 --> 06:43.336
AND THE SAME LANDSCAPE IS REALLY

06:43.336 --> 06:45.105
THERE NOW THAT WAS THERE BEFORE

06:45.105 --> 06:48.275
THIS TRUCK CONVOY STORY.

06:48.275 --> 06:51.177
PUTIN HAS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

06:51.177 --> 06:53.480
SUPPORT THE SEPARATISTS WHO ARE

06:53.480 --> 06:57.284
BASICALLY GOING DOWN WITHOUT

06:57.284 --> 06:58.785
OVER-INVOLVEMENT THAT WILL

06:58.785 --> 07:00.687
EXCITE TOO MUCH OPPOSITION FROM

07:00.687 --> 07:03.156
THE WEST AND EMBROIL HIM IN A

07:03.156 --> 07:05.325
BIG MESS THAT HE WANTS TO STAY

07:05.325 --> 07:06.026
OUT OF.

07:06.026 --> 07:06.593
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT DOES THE

07:06.593 --> 07:08.828
WEST DO ABOUT IT?

07:08.828 --> 07:09.963
>> WELL, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

07:09.963 --> 07:12.032
THE WEST DID YESTERDAY, EUROPEAN

07:12.032 --> 07:13.633
AND AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS WERE

07:13.633 --> 07:16.503
REALLY LOUD IN THEIR CRITICISM

07:16.503 --> 07:21.341
OF WHAT RUSSIA DID, AND MADE IT

07:21.341 --> 07:23.410
CLEAR THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE

07:23.410 --> 07:26.112
NEW TROUBLE AHEAD IF HE

07:26.112 --> 07:28.048
PERSISTED AND TRIED TO REALLY

07:28.048 --> 07:30.617
INTERPOSE RUSSIAN FORCES INTO

07:30.617 --> 07:33.653
THIS FIGHT IN EASTERN UKRAINE.

07:33.653 --> 07:34.654
I THINK THAT’S GOT TO BE ONE OF

07:34.654 --> 07:36.690
THE REASONS THAT MADE IT SUCH A

07:36.690 --> 07:40.260
QUICK ROUNDTRIP FOR THESE TRUCKS

07:40.260 --> 07:42.128
IN AND OUT OF LUHANSK.

07:42.128 --> 07:42.462
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT DOES

07:42.462 --> 07:43.830
PRESIDENT POROSHENKO DO ON

07:43.830 --> 07:45.098
TUESDAY WHEN HE MEETS WITH

07:45.098 --> 07:45.699
PUTIN?

07:45.699 --> 07:47.434
>> WHAT HE SAID IS HE WANTS TO

07:47.434 --> 07:48.301
TALK PEACE.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.937
HE SAID WE’VE HAD ENOUGH OF WAR,

07:50.937 --> 07:54.207
BUT HE’S LAID OUT SOME IMPORTANT

07:54.207 --> 07:57.077
CONDITIONS IN HIS CONVERSATIONS

07:57.077 --> 07:58.478
TODAY WITH CHANCELLOR MERKEL OF

07:58.478 --> 08:00.447
GERMANY, WHO IS VISITING, GIVING

08:00.447 --> 08:02.015
HIM A SHOW OF SUPPORT.

08:02.015 --> 08:05.218
HE SAID HE WANTS TO HAVE AN

08:05.218 --> 08:07.987
OPPORTUNITY TO... FOR DIALOGUE

08:07.987 --> 08:10.056
WITH EASTERN UKRAINIANS, BUT HE

08:10.056 --> 08:11.858
WANTS ALL THE MERCENARIES OUT,

08:11.858 --> 08:13.360
MEANING THE RUSSIAN MILITARY,

08:13.360 --> 08:15.929
INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS AND

08:15.929 --> 08:17.364
SOLDIERS OF FORTUNE WHO HAVE

08:17.364 --> 08:19.632
SHOWN UP IN EASTERN UKRAINE.

08:19.632 --> 08:23.670
HE IS DEMANDING THAT PUTIN PULL

08:23.670 --> 08:26.840
BACK AND STOP MEDDLING, STOP THE

08:26.840 --> 08:29.342
FLOW OF ARMS AND MEN INTO

08:29.342 --> 08:31.378
EASTERN UKRAINE.

08:31.378 --> 08:33.880
HE’S GOT THE WIND AT HIS BACK IN

08:33.880 --> 08:34.781
SOME WAYS.

08:34.781 --> 08:36.316
HE’S HAD A MILITARY OFFENSIVE IN

08:36.316 --> 08:37.283
EASTERN UKRAINE THAT’S BEEN

08:37.283 --> 08:38.685
PRETTY SUCCESSFUL.

08:38.685 --> 08:40.620
SO, HE DEALS WITH PUTIN ON A

08:40.620 --> 08:42.088
STRONGER FOOTING THAN MANY WOULD

08:42.088 --> 08:44.124
HAVE EXPECTED A FEW WEEKS AGO.

08:44.124 --> 08:44.624
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT’S THE END

08:44.624 --> 08:46.359
GAME FOR PUTIN HERE?

08:46.359 --> 08:48.228
>> THIS IS A LITTLE HARD TO SAY.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.129
THERE IS A RANGE OF

08:49.129 --> 08:50.363
POSSIBILITIES.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.932
HE COULD BE LOOKING AT A KIND OF

08:52.932 --> 08:55.668
PERMANENT FERMENT IN EASTERN

08:55.668 --> 08:58.138
UKRAINE, SOMETHING LIKE THE

08:58.138 --> 08:59.639
SUPPORT THAT RUSSIA HAS GIVEN

08:59.639 --> 09:02.108
OVER MANY YEARS TO SEPARATISTS

09:02.108 --> 09:05.578
IN MOLDAVIA, IN GEORGIA AND

09:05.578 --> 09:07.147
ELSEWHERE.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.815
THAT’S NOT A REALLY GOOD OUTCOME

09:08.815 --> 09:10.183
BECAUSE IT DOESN’T GET HIM OFF

09:10.183 --> 09:12.018
THE HOOK WITH THE WEST.

09:12.018 --> 09:12.952
IT MEANS A LOT OF THESE

09:12.952 --> 09:14.788
SANCTIONS PROBABLY STAY IN PLACE

09:14.788 --> 09:16.990
FOR A LONG TIME.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.691
A BETTER OUTCOME WOULD BE ONE IN

09:18.691 --> 09:21.594
WHICH HE GETS SOME KIND OF

09:21.594 --> 09:23.363
CONCESSIONS FROM POROSHENKO

09:23.363 --> 09:24.864
ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF UKRAINIAN

09:24.864 --> 09:26.933
POLITICS, SOME KIND OF

09:26.933 --> 09:28.535
ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT THERE HAS TO

09:28.535 --> 09:30.170
BE DECENTRALIZATION.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.538
POROSHENKO HAS OFFERED ALL OF

09:31.538 --> 09:32.939
THAT, BUT HE HASN’T OFFERED TO

09:32.939 --> 09:35.074
DO IT IN A WAY THAT LOOKS ENOUGH

09:35.074 --> 09:37.277
TO PUTIN LIKE A REAL VICTORY.

09:37.277 --> 09:37.677
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT.

09:37.677 --> 09:38.545
STEVE SESTANOVICH, A SENIOR

09:38.545 --> 09:40.146
FELLOW OF THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN

09:40.146 --> 09:41.147

09:41.147 --> 09:42.182
WASHINGTON, D.C., THANKS SO

09:42.182 --> 09:43.016
MUCH.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.484

09:44.484 --> 09:45.518
>> Sreenivasan: VIOLENCE IN GAZA

09:45.518 --> 09:46.553
CONTINUED TODAY AS EGYPT CALLED

09:46.553 --> 09:48.021
FOR PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS TO

09:48.021 --> 09:49.989
RETURN TO PEACE TALKS.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.624
THE REQUEST FROM EGYPT’S FOREIGN

09:51.624 --> 09:53.460
MINISTRY CAME AFTER PALESTINIAN

09:53.460 --> 09:55.094
PRESIDENT MAHMOUD ABBAS MET WITH

09:55.094 --> 10:00.066
THE EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT IN CAIRO.

10:00.066 --> 10:00.567
>> (translated): WHAT MATTERS

10:00.567 --> 10:02.335
TO US NOW IS TO STOP THE FLOW OF

10:02.335 --> 10:03.970
BLOOD AND TO STOP THESE ACTS

10:03.970 --> 10:06.306
THAT CAUSE MORE SACRIFICES.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.941
AND AS SOON AS IT STOPS, WE MUST

10:07.941 --> 10:09.776
SUPPORT THE HUMANITARIAN EFFORT

10:09.776 --> 10:12.979
AND RECONSTRUCTION OF GAZA.

10:12.979 --> 10:13.480
>> Sreenivasan: THE ISRAELI

10:13.480 --> 10:15.181
GOVERNMENT DECLINED TO COMMENT.

10:15.181 --> 10:16.449
MORE THAN 2,000 PALESTINIANS AND

10:16.449 --> 10:17.784
MORE THAN 60 ISRAELIS HAVE BEEN

10:17.784 --> 10:19.118
KILLED SINCE THE CONFLICT IN

10:19.118 --> 10:20.787
GAZA BEGAN ON JULY 8.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.255
EGYPT IS REQUESTING AN OPEN-

10:22.255 --> 10:23.756
ENDED CEASE FIRE.

10:23.756 --> 10:24.958
THE IVORY COAST IS THE LATEST

10:24.958 --> 10:26.192
COUNTRY IN WEST AFRICA TO CLOSE

10:26.192 --> 10:27.694
ITS BORDERS TO PREVENT THE

10:27.694 --> 10:29.295
SPREAD OF THE MOST DEADLY EBOLA

10:29.295 --> 10:30.830
OUTBREAK ON RECORD.

10:30.830 --> 10:31.898
THE IVORY COAST IS FLANKED BY

GUINEA AND LIBERIA, BOTH HIT

10:33.967 --> 10:35.602

PETIT LARCENY AND FORGERY, AND

14:20.293 --> 14:21.728
TWO STINTS IN JAIL.

14:21.728 --> 14:23.529
A FEW DAYS LATER, JONES GOT A

14:23.529 --> 14:25.031
LETTER IN THE MAIL SAYING UNLESS

14:25.031 --> 14:26.466
HE COULD CLEAR THE MATTER UP,

14:26.466 --> 14:29.001
HIS JOB OFFER WAS BEING REVOKED.

14:29.001 --> 14:30.403
DO YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF CRIMINAL

14:30.403 --> 14:31.104

14:31.104 --> 14:32.038
>> NONE.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.072
NEVER.

14:33.072 --> 14:34.307
EVER.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.209
I WAS UPSET AND, OF COURSE,

14:36.209 --> 14:37.310
EMBARRASSED, YOU KNOW.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.979
I’M THINKING, THIS IS NOT RIGHT.

14:39.979 --> 14:40.913
YOU GUYS HAVE MADE A MAJOR

14:40.913 --> 14:42.048
MISTAKE, AND THIS NEEDS TO BE

14:42.048 --> 14:43.349
FIXED.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.351
MONTHS OF PHONE CALLS WITH NO

14:45.351 --> 14:47.086

14:47.086 --> 14:48.654
LAWYER TO SORT IT OUT.

14:48.654 --> 14:50.556
BUT BY THEN, THE DAMAGE HAD BEEN

14:50.556 --> 14:51.691
DONE.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.459
SO, EARLIER THIS YEAR, HE BECAME

LEAD PLAINTIFF IN A CLASS ACTION

14:55.061 --> 14:56.863
LAWSUIT AGAINST STERLING,

THE IDEA IS TO AVOID PROBLEMS

AND KEEP THE WORKPLACE SAFE.

I MEAN, HASN’T THE DAMAGE THEN

20:54.920 --> 20:56.188
ALREADY BEEN DONE?

20:56.188 --> 20:57.790
>> WITH THAT INITIAL NOTICE THAT

20:57.790 --> 20:58.991
COMES OUT, YOU THEN HAVE THE

20:58.991 --> 21:01.427
OPPORTUNITY AS A CONSUMER TO

21:01.427 --> 21:02.928
DISPUTE THAT INFORMATION.

21:02.928 --> 21:03.562
>> Reporter: SORENSON SAYS

21:03.562 --> 21:04.797
SCREENERS HAVE A DUTY TO

21:04.797 --> 21:06.298
REINVESTIGATE IF A DISPUTE IS

21:06.298 --> 21:07.733
MADE, BUT THERE ARE NO

21:07.733 --> 21:09.235
REQUIREMENTS ABOUT WHAT A

21:09.235 --> 21:11.170
REINVESTIGATION ENTAILS.

21:11.170 --> 21:13.472
AND IF A JOB APPLICANT DOES GET

21:13.472 --> 21:15.107
A MISTAKE FIXED, THAT

21:15.107 --> 21:16.876
INFORMATION ISN’T NECESSARILY

21:16.876 --> 21:18.144
SHARED AMONG THE OTHER

21:18.144 --> 21:19.044
COMPANIES.

21:19.044 --> 21:20.012
>> BACKGROUND SCREENING

21:20.012 --> 21:21.714
COMPANIES OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY.

21:21.714 --> 21:24.016
AND IT’S POSSIBLE THAT IF

21:24.016 --> 21:24.884
SOMETHING CAME BACK ON A

21:24.884 --> 21:27.419
BACKGROUND SCREEN FOR A

21:27.419 --> 21:28.921
PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL AND THEN

21:28.921 --> 21:30.656
ANOTHER SCREENING COMPANY

21:30.656 --> 21:33.058
PERFORMED A SCREEN, THE SAME

21:33.058 --> 21:34.827
INFORMATION COULD SHOW UP.

21:34.827 --> 21:35.628
>> Reporter: AND THAT’S EXACTLY

21:35.628 --> 21:36.795
WHAT KEVIN JONES SAYS HE’S

21:36.795 --> 21:38.097
WORRIED ABOUT.

21:38.097 --> 21:38.864
>> IF IT HAPPENED ONCE, IT COULD

21:38.864 --> 21:40.499
HAPPEN AGAIN.

21:40.499 --> 21:41.800
IF... IT’S UNFORTUNATE TO FEEL

21:41.800 --> 21:44.303
THAT WAY, BUT IT HAPPENED, SO

21:44.303 --> 21:46.372
I... I HAVE TO FEEL THAT WAY.

21:46.372 --> 21:46.972
>> Reporter: JONES IS NOW

21:46.972 --> 21:48.474
WORKING FULL-TIME AND SAYS HE

21:48.474 --> 21:49.742
HOPES HIS LAWSUITS WILL HELP

21:49.742 --> 21:51.010
PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING TO

21:51.010 --> 21:52.178
SOMEBODY ELSE.

21:52.178 --> 21:53.879
HIS CASES ARE CURRENTLY PENDING

21:53.879 --> 21:55.948
IN NEW YORK DISTRICT COURT.

21:57.983 --> 21:59.051
>> SHOULD BACKGROUND CHECKS BE

21:59.051 --> 22:01.220
USED TO REVIEW JOB APPLICANTS?

22:01.220 --> 22:02.288
TAKE OUR POLL.

22:02.288 --> 22:04.823
VISIT newshour.pbs.org.

22:09.361 --> 22:11.664
>>THIS IS PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND

22:11.664 --> 22:12.831
SATURDAY.

22:17.736 --> 22:18.837
>> Sreenivasan: MALALA YOUSAFZAI

22:18.837 --> 22:20.472
BECAME A GLOBAL CRUSADER FOR

22:20.472 --> 22:22.608
GIRL’S EDUCATION AFTER SHE WAS

22:22.608 --> 22:24.443
SHOT IN THE HEAD BY THE TALIBAN

22:24.443 --> 22:26.378
ON HER WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL IN

22:26.378 --> 22:28.380
PAKISTAN IN 2012.

22:28.380 --> 22:29.748
SINCE RECOVERING, THE 17-YEAR-

22:29.748 --> 22:31.417
OLD HAS BEEN TRAVELING THE WORLD

22:31.417 --> 22:32.918
ADVOCATING FOR THE MILLIONS OF

22:32.918 --> 22:34.486
CHILDREN ACROSS THE GLOBE WHO

22:34.486 --> 22:36.855
DON’T HAVE ACCESS TO EDUCATION.

22:36.855 --> 22:38.023
I SAT DOWN WITH HER THIS WEEK

22:38.023 --> 22:39.358
WHILE SHE WAS IN NEW YORK

22:39.358 --> 22:40.859
PROMOTING THE RELEASE OF A NEW

22:40.859 --> 22:41.894
EDITION OF HER BOOK, "I AM

22:41.894 --> 22:43.596
MALALA," FOR YOUNG READERS.

22:43.596 --> 22:44.697
HERE IS AN EXCERPT FROM THAT

22:44.697 --> 22:46.432
CONVERSATION.

22:46.432 --> 22:47.600
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO YOUNG WOMEN

22:47.600 --> 22:49.802
AND GIRLS IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES

22:49.802 --> 22:50.970
WHO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY?

22:50.970 --> 22:53.172
HOW DO YOU INSPIRE THEM TO GET

22:53.172 --> 22:54.640
THE SAME FIRE IN THE BELLY ABOUT

22:54.640 --> 22:56.108
EDUCATION THAT YOU HAVE OR

22:56.108 --> 22:57.810
PEOPLE FROM DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

22:57.810 --> 23:00.379
WHO HAVE NEVER SEEN IT HAVE?

23:00.379 --> 23:02.147
>> SO THE FIRST THING IS THAT IN

23:02.147 --> 23:03.816
THE DEVELOPING COUNTRY, THERE

23:03.816 --> 23:05.417
ARE SO MANY CHILDREN, SO MANY

23:05.417 --> 23:06.552
GIRLS WHO ARE RAISING THEIR

23:06.552 --> 23:08.554
VOICES, WHO ARE SPEAKING UP FOR

23:08.554 --> 23:10.122
EDUCATION, AND THEY WANT TO GO

23:10.122 --> 23:10.589
TO SCHOOL.

23:10.589 --> 23:11.357
THIS IS THEIR DREAM.

23:11.357 --> 23:13.259
THEY DO NOT DREAM FOR AN iPAD

23:13.259 --> 23:14.827
OR FOR A PLAYSTATION OR FOR AN

23:14.827 --> 23:16.328
X-BOX.

23:16.328 --> 23:18.130
THEIR ONLY DREAM IS JUST TO GO

23:18.130 --> 23:18.764
TO SCHOOL.

23:18.764 --> 23:20.799
AND HERE CHILDREN IN THE U.K.,

23:20.799 --> 23:21.867
IN THE U.S.A., IN THE DEVELOPED

23:21.867 --> 23:23.335
COUNTRIES, THEY HAVE GOT THIS

23:23.335 --> 23:24.903
OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO GOOD

23:24.903 --> 23:26.805
SCHOOLS AND THEY GET FREE

23:26.805 --> 23:27.606
EDUCATION.

23:27.606 --> 23:28.607
SO I THINK THEY SHOULD BE VERY

23:28.607 --> 23:30.442
THANKFUL FOR IT.

23:30.442 --> 23:34.980
BECAUSE WHEN I WENT TO KENYA, I

23:34.980 --> 23:36.282
HEARD THAT THERE WERE SO MANY

23:36.282 --> 23:37.516
GIRLS WHO ARE DEPRIVED OF

23:37.516 --> 23:39.485
EDUCATION, AND ONLY ONE OUT OF

23:39.485 --> 23:42.087
TEN GIRLS GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO

23:42.087 --> 23:43.289
GO TO SCHOOL.

23:43.289 --> 23:44.757
SO IT’S QUITE DIFFICULT IN MANY

23:44.757 --> 23:45.924
COUNTRIES FOR GIRLS TO GO

23:45.924 --> 23:46.392
FORWARD.

23:46.392 --> 23:47.860
EVEN FOR BOYS, IT IS QUITE

23:47.860 --> 23:49.128
DIFFICULT TO GO FORWARD

23:49.128 --> 23:51.664
AND MAKE THEIR DREAMS COME TRUE

23:51.664 --> 23:52.865
BECAUSE THEY ALSO WISH TO BECOME

23:52.865 --> 23:54.533
DOCTORS, TO BECOME TEACHERS AND

23:54.533 --> 23:56.001
ENGINEERS, BUT BECAUSE OF THE

23:56.001 --> 23:57.169
DIFFICULTIES THEY CAN NOT

23:57.169 --> 23:58.771
ACHIEVE THEIR DREAMS AND THEY

23:58.771 --> 24:00.306
CANNOT BE WHAT THEY WANT TO BE.

24:00.306 --> 24:02.274
SO HERE, IF YOU’VE GOT THIS GOOD

24:02.274 --> 24:03.409
OPPORTUNITY, THEN YOU CAN

24:03.409 --> 24:05.244
FULFILL YOUR DREAMS, AND YOU CAN

24:05.244 --> 24:06.745
CONTRIBUTE TO A SOCIETY BY

24:06.745 --> 24:08.347
BECOMING WHAT YOU REALLY WANT.

24:17.690 --> 24:18.457
>> Sreenivasan: AND FINALLY

24:18.457 --> 24:19.658
TONIGHT, PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS

24:19.658 --> 24:21.593
ORDERED A REVIEW OF WEAPONS USED

24:21.593 --> 24:23.095
BY STATE AND LOCAL POLICE

24:23.095 --> 24:25.030
DEPARTMENTS WHICH OFTEN INCLUDE

24:25.030 --> 24:26.465
MILITARY-GRADE EQUIPMENT

24:26.465 --> 24:28.067
PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT,

24:28.067 --> 24:28.667
ACCORDING TO A SENIOR

24:28.667 --> 24:30.069
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL.

24:30.069 --> 24:31.403
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTS THE

24:31.403 --> 24:32.738
PRESIDENT WAS AFFECTED BY

24:32.738 --> 24:34.340
PICTURES OF HEAVILY ARMED POLICE

24:34.340 --> 24:36.075
CLASHING WITH PROTESTERS IN

24:36.075 --> 24:37.309
FERGUSON, MISSOURI.

24:37.309 --> 24:38.410
JOIN US ON AIR AND ONLINE

24:38.410 --> 24:39.178

24:39.178 --> 24:40.379
FROM THE PHILIPPINES, WILL A NEW

24:40.379 --> 24:41.613
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE LAW

24:41.613 --> 24:43.816

24:43.816 --> 24:44.683
BIRTH RATES?

24:44.683 --> 24:45.584
THAT’S IT FOR THIS EDITION OF

24:45.584 --> 24:46.919
PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

24:46.919 --> 24:48.053
I’M HARI SREENIVASAN.

24:48.053 --> 24:49.688
THANKS FOR WATCHING.
