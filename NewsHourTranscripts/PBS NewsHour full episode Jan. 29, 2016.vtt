JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff
in Iowa, where we take a close
look at women

00:08.976 --> 00:13.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voters as we head into the final
weekend of
campaigning before the caucuses.

00:13.947 --> 00:16.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan
in Washington, D.C.

00:16.783 --> 00:21.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Also ahead on tonight's
"NewsHour": David
Brooks and E.J. Dionne talk
yesterday's Republican

00:21.421 --> 00:24.424 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
debate and a full week of news.

00:24.524 --> 00:29.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, Barbie gets a makeover:
Toy maker Mattel
introduces three new body types
and various

00:29.396 --> 00:32.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
skin tones for the classic doll.

00:32.232 --> 00:37.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And how a ballet in Denmark
tells the story
of asylum seekers by using a mix
of professional

00:37.671 --> 00:39.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
dancers and refugees.

00:39.506 --> 00:43.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHAMMED AL-ISHAQ, Refugee: This
will help
people in thinking differently
for refugees.

00:43.443 --> 00:47.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They look at us as normal human
beings, the
way we are, not just a parasite.

00:47.147 --> 00:54.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:54.955 --> 00:57.691 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:57.791 --> 01:06.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: American
consumers spent
less, businesses invested less
and companies

01:06.767 --> 01:12.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exported less at the end of
2015. As a result,
the economy slowed markedly.
Government data

01:12.506 --> 01:17.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
released today put overall
growth at an annual
rate of just seven-tenths of a
percent from

01:17.210 --> 01:21.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
October through December. For
the year as
a whole, the economy grew 2.4
percent, about

01:21.915 --> 01:23.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the same as the previous year.

01:24.017 --> 01:29.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street rallied on the news,
hoping that
weak growth might delay interest
rate hikes.

01:29.389 --> 01:32.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Strong earnings by tech firms
helped as well.
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained nearly

01:32.693 --> 01:41.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
400 points to close at 16466.
The Nasdaq rose
107 points, and the S&amp;P 500
added 47. But,

01:41.568 --> 01:47.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the month, the Dow and the
S&amp;P lost 5
percent. The Nasdaq fell almost
8 percent.

01:47.574 --> 01:51.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The State Department confirmed
today that
Hillary Clinton's private server
held 22 e-mails

01:51.912 --> 01:57.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are now deemed top secret.
The Associated
Press reported State is
withholding those

01:57.684 --> 02:02.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
e-mail chains from a batch being
released
today. Clinton used her own
server as secretary

02:02.656 --> 02:07.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of state. She has said none of
the material
she received was marked
classified.

02:07.194 --> 02:11.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Department spokesman John Kirby
said today
it's still not clear why that
happened.

02:11.665 --> 02:17.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KIRBY, State Department
Spokesman: It's
certainly possible that, for any
number of

02:17.471 --> 02:23.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reasons, traffic can be sent
that's not marked
appropriately for its
classification. I am

02:23.410 --> 02:27.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not making any judgment about
this. That's
why we're doing a review here at
the State

02:27.314 --> 02:31.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Department to look at the
classification at
the time the traffic was sent.

02:31.551 --> 02:35.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All I can tell you definitively
is it wasn't
marked classified at the time it
was sent.

02:35.322 --> 02:39.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A Clinton
campaign spokesman
criticized the decision to
withhold the e-mail

02:39.459 --> 02:44.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chains as overclassification run
amok. The
announcement came three days
before the Iowa

02:45.032 --> 02:50.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
presidential caucuses. We will
hear from Judy
in Iowa after the news summary.

02:50.170 --> 02:54.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Talks aimed at ending Syria's
civil war got
off to a shaky start in Geneva
today. After

02:54.408 --> 02:59.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
days of uncertainty, the main
opposition group
announced it will send a
delegation to meet

02:59.212 --> 03:03.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with a U.N. special envoy, but
not with Syrian
officials.

03:03.116 --> 03:07.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Today, the envoy met with
representatives
from Bashar al-Assad's
government, and he

03:07.821 --> 03:11.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
urged the opposition to engage
if it wants
to be heard.

03:11.858 --> 03:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STAFFAN DE MISTURA, Special
United Nations
Envoy for Syria: We have been
strongly suggesting

03:20.600 --> 03:26.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to them that the best way to
actually discuss
the implementation of such type
of discussion

03:27.074 --> 03:30.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and therefore of improvement is
to be done
here and to do it with us, as
proxy talks

03:30.777 --> 03:33.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or directly, whatever is the
format.

03:33.280 --> 03:36.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The talks are
the first
since negotiations collapsed in
2014. The

03:36.750 --> 03:41.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syrian civil war has killed more
than 250,000
people and displaced millions.

03:42.089 --> 03:46.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's word U.S. military
leaders will ask
President Obama to send hundreds
of additional

03:46.660 --> 03:51.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
troops to Iraq and Syria. The
New York Times
reports top commanders believe
it will take

03:51.431 --> 03:56.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more trainers, advisers and
commandos to defeat
the Islamic State group.

03:56.570 --> 04:00.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At the White House today,
spokesman Josh Earnest
rejected suggestions that the
president feels

04:00.874 --> 04:04.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the military has pressured him
and he resents
it.

04:04.144 --> 04:08.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
My eyebrows raised in the same
way that yours

04:08.615 --> 04:13.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
apparently did when you read
that. What I
can tell you is the president is
quite pleased

04:13.220 --> 04:17.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the kind of advice that he
gets from
his national security team. I
assure you that,

04:18.024 --> 04:25.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if anything, it is the leaders
at the Department
of Defense who are feeling
pressure from the

04:25.365 --> 04:30.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
commander in chief to find new
ideas and new
ways to further intensify those
elements of

04:30.403 --> 04:32.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our strategy that are working.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There are
currently some
3,700 American troops in Iraq
and a small

04:35.242 --> 04:38.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
contingent of special forces in
Syria.

04:38.211 --> 04:43.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. Navy has confirmed that
Iran flew
a surveillance drone over the
aircraft carrier

04:43.850 --> 04:48.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Harry S. Truman in the Persian
Gulf this month.
Iranian state TV showed footage
today, and

04:48.889 --> 04:53.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said it came from the unarmed
drone. An Iranian
commander called the pictures
beautiful and

04:53.894 --> 04:58.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
accurate. U.S. officials branded
the move
abnormal and unprofessional, but
said the

04:58.798 --> 05:02.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
drone posed no danger to flight
operations.

05:02.369 --> 05:07.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Oregon, the last four armed
occupiers were
still holding out today at a
national wildlife

05:07.874 --> 05:12.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
refuge. But, overnight, the FBI
released drone
video of the fatal shooting of
LaVoy Finicum.

05:12.946 --> 05:16.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was the militia spokesman
killed Tuesday
by Oregon troopers.

05:16.850 --> 05:22.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special agent Greg Bretzing said
Finicum fled
from a traffic stop, then ran
into a roadblock,

05:23.089 --> 05:24.925 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
seen in this graphic footage.

05:25.025 --> 05:28.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREGORY BRETZING, FBI Special
Agent in Charge:
The truck gets stuck in the
snowbank. Finicum

05:28.161 --> 05:32.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaves the truck and steps
through the snow.
On at least two occasions,
Finicum reaches

05:32.799 --> 05:38.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his right hand toward a pocket
on the left
inside portion of his jacket. He
did have

05:38.738 --> 05:45.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a loaded .9-millimeter
semiautomatic handgun
in that pocket. At this time,
OSP troopers

05:45.612 --> 05:47.380 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
shot Finicum.

05:47.480 --> 05:50.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finicum had
said he'd rather
die than go to jail, but other
members of

05:50.717 --> 05:54.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the militia have claimed he did
nothing to
provoke the shooting. Ten other
members of

05:54.754 --> 05:59.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the group are already in
custody. Late today,
a federal judge ordered the
occupation's organizer,

05:59.159 --> 06:03.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ammon Bundy, and his brother
Ryan held without
bail.

06:03.530 --> 06:07.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Operations stopped at the
largest port complex
on the East Coast this morning,
after thousands

06:07.500 --> 06:11.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of longshoremen walked off the
job. The Port
Authority of New York and New
Jersey said

06:11.538 --> 06:16.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it had no advance notice. A
union spokesman
said the longshoremen are
rebelling against

06:16.743 --> 06:21.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interference in port operations
by an anti-corruption
commission.

06:21.948 --> 06:26.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And President Obama has unveiled
new efforts
to close the pay gap between men
and women.

06:27.020 --> 06:32.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Proposed rules would mandate
that companies
with 100 or more employees
report salary data

06:32.459 --> 06:38.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by gender, race and ethnicity.
The information
would be used to enforce
existing discrimination

06:38.298 --> 06:40.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
laws.

06:40.100 --> 06:43.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
countdown
to the Iowa caucuses, why women
could hold

06:43.937 --> 06:49.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the winning votes for Hillary
Clinton or Bernie
Sanders; and what last night's
debate means

06:49.609 --> 06:58.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the GOP; plus Barbie's new
look, toy manufacturers
picking up on diversity; and
much more.

06:58.818 --> 07:12.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And now to the
race of the
White House. It's crunch time
for the candidates

07:12.599 --> 07:16.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Iowa as they make their final
push to Monday's
caucuses.

07:16.569 --> 07:21.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans, minus Donald Trump,
battled on
the debate stage last night. For
the Democrats,

07:21.441 --> 07:24.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there is a last-minute push for
women voters.

07:24.544 --> 07:26.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Judy Woodruff joins us now from
Des Moines.

07:26.613 --> 07:31.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy, what's the mood now, as
the clock ticks
down toward the caucuses, less
than 72 hours

07:31.551 --> 07:32.085 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
away?

07:32.185 --> 07:33.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hi, Hari.

07:34.020 --> 07:38.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I did just get here last
night, but I
think it's safe to say that
everybody in the

07:38.525 --> 07:43.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state of Iowa, including the
majority of people
here who will not be
participating in the

07:44.030 --> 07:48.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
caucuses Monday night, is very
aware there's
a presidential race under way.
Whether they

07:49.002 --> 07:54.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are a Republican or Democrat or
something
in between, they're aware that
this is a contest

07:54.841 --> 07:56.609 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like no other.

07:56.710 --> 08:01.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have got a tight race in
both parties.
On the Republican side, that
phenomenon named

08:01.381 --> 08:08.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump has managed to up
end the contest.
He's managed to, frankly, define
the way other

08:08.488 --> 08:12.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidates are seen. When you
ask people,
even if they're not supporting
Donald Trump,

08:12.492 --> 08:17.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they will talk about their
candidate in relation
to Mr. Trump.

08:17.464 --> 08:23.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Democratic side, what was
supposed
to be a fairly predictable
contest, Hillary

08:23.303 --> 08:27.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton presumed to be the
front-runner, has
faced a really stiff challenge
from Senator

08:27.841 --> 08:31.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bernie Sanders. And that one's
turned out
to be a nail-biter too.

08:31.511 --> 08:36.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Judy, in
nail-biters, there's
often little things that make
that big difference.

08:36.282 --> 08:39.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here it is, Friday afternoon
before the Iowa
caucuses. The State Department
says there's

08:39.953 --> 08:45.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
22 more e-mails from the private
server that
she kept these e-mails in that
have been declared

08:45.325 --> 08:49.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
top secret and won't be
released. Any reaction
from the Clinton camp today?

08:49.396 --> 08:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Hari,
they're pretty
much reacting the way they have
to all these

08:54.033 --> 09:00.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other e-mail stories about the
private server
that she had at her home in New
York.

09:01.040 --> 09:06.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are saying, first of all,
that all these
e-mails, whether they were
received by Secretary

09:06.212 --> 09:12.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton or whether she sent
them, that they
were not classified or top
secret at the time.

09:12.786 --> 09:18.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They want -- repeatedly, they
said -- and
they said it again today -- we
want all e-mails

09:18.992 --> 09:22.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
released. We don't think any of
these should
be kept back.

09:23.062 --> 09:29.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the campaign press
secretary, Brian Fallon,
put out a statement saying this
is overclassification

09:29.335 --> 09:31.237 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
run amok.

09:31.337 --> 09:36.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Having said that, it's clearly a
distraction
that they would rather not were
coming up

09:36.342 --> 09:42.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right now, just days before the
caucuses.
Now, I want to tell you that one
angle in

09:42.115 --> 09:46.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this Democratic race that we
were interested
in looking at is how women are
dividing their

09:47.086 --> 09:50.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
vote here in Iowa between
Hillary Clinton
and Bernie Sanders.

09:51.090 --> 09:56.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, our team spent the last few
days talking
to Democratic and
independent-leaning women

09:56.996 --> 10:00.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
across the state.

10:00.266 --> 10:05.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's three days out from the
Iowa caucuses,
and Democrats here have an
important decision

10:05.371 --> 10:07.340 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to make.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I need you. Get everybody you
can to get out

10:08.575 --> 10:10.243 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Monday night.

10:10.343 --> 10:14.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Go with presumed
favorite,
former Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton,

10:14.347 --> 10:16.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
veteran of the party power
structure?

10:16.216 --> 10:21.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well, I
may not be
the youngest candidate in this
race, but I

10:21.488 --> 10:27.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will be the youngest woman
president in the
history of the United States.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

10:28.628 --> 10:32.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: And --
and the first
grandmother as well.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

10:34.567 --> 10:39.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Or defy
expectations by sending
Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders
to the next

10:40.039 --> 10:44.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
contest in New Hampshire with
new energy behind
his progressive message?

10:44.477 --> 10:48.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
If you are a woman, you
understand the history

10:48.114 --> 10:52.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of change, the suffragette and
the people
before the suffragettes who said
women will

10:52.485 --> 10:55.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not be considered as
second-class citizens.

10:55.989 --> 11:01.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Polls suggest the
race is close.
And political analysts here say
women are

11:01.995 --> 11:03.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a crucial demographic.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARISSA SCHUSTER, Bernie Sanders
Supporter:
The fact that, yes, Hillary
worked towards

11:05.999 --> 11:11.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women's rights, but she was also
indifferent
about gay rights, lesbian
rights. Everything

11:11.337 --> 11:15.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on that spectrum, it constantly
changed. And
Bernie never did.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINAE BRUSH, Hillary Clinton
Supporter: I
would be thrilled to see a woman
be president.

11:17.777 --> 11:22.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's time past for that
to happen,
but that's not a big factor with
me. I want

11:22.882 --> 11:26.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the quality of the candidate,
and I think
she has the qualities we need
right now.

11:26.953 --> 11:32.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton has made
women a main
focus, but they're proving
harder to persuade

11:32.325 --> 11:39.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than her campaign expected. A
recent Quinnipiac
poll of Iowa Democrats likely to
caucus shows

11:39.832 --> 11:47.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women overall back Clinton 54 to
40 percent.
But Sanders undermines that with
his enormous

11:47.240 --> 11:53.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lead with younger Democrats;
18-to-44 year
olds supported him 4-1.

11:53.479 --> 12:00.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is leading with women under
45, and that
makes Clinton's job even harder.

12:00.253 --> 12:05.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Twenty-five-year-old Gwen Merz
is one of those
women. She plays in a weekly
dodge ball league

12:05.925 --> 12:11.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just outside of Des Moines,
where she just
moved recently from Illinois.
Merz says she

12:11.664 --> 12:17.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has already made up her mind.
Sanders won
her over when he took her
question at a campaign

12:17.670 --> 12:19.372 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
event.

12:19.472 --> 12:21.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN MERZ, Bernie Sanders
Supporter: And a
hundred percent answered what I
asked, and

12:21.374 --> 12:24.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's so rare in a candidate.
If you look
at the last town hall, Bernie
answered a ton

12:25.078 --> 12:30.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of hard questions. They threw
them at him,
and he took them like a champ
and answered

12:30.717 --> 12:33.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them all correctly. And Hillary
just danced
around all the issues and didn't
have a straight

12:33.786 --> 12:35.588 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
word to say.

12:35.688 --> 12:39.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On Wednesday,
Merz attended
this women for Bernie luncheon
in Des Moines,

12:39.993 --> 12:44.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where actress Susan Sarandon
urged attendees
to get out to vote for Sanders.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN MERZ: Definitely a
flip-flopper.

12:46.099 --> 12:49.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Merz said
afterward she doesn't
think Hillary Clinton has
credibility.

12:49.435 --> 12:53.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN MERZ: She's against this
issue, she's
now for this issue. And so it's
like, I want

12:53.840 --> 12:59.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
somebody who has the chutzpah to
back up what
they say, instead of just, oh,
well, now it's

12:59.779 --> 13:01.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
popular, let's be for it.

13:01.781 --> 13:06.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Bonnie Campbell
is the former
attorney general of Iowa. She
ran unsuccessfully

13:06.185 --> 13:11.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for governor as a Democrat in
1994 and now
works as a political consultant.
She's also

13:11.224 --> 13:13.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a strong supporter of Hillary
Clinton.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BONNIE CAMPBELL, Former Iowa
Attorney General:
When I was a young woman, there
was no birth

13:15.895 --> 13:22.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
control and abortion was
absolutely out of
the question. It was illegal.
That's a battle

13:22.402 --> 13:28.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have been fighting. And they
think -- I
think many young women think we
have won.

13:28.608 --> 13:35.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think their lens is different.
It's shorter.
And they haven't hit the glass
ceiling yet.

13:35.782 --> 13:41.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're still in college. They
haven't gone
out into the work world and
discovered that,

13:42.055 --> 13:46.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wait a minute, I don't get paid
as much as
that guy who does exactly the
same thing I

13:47.060 --> 13:48.861 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do.

13:48.961 --> 13:51.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The fact that
Clinton would
be the first female president
could improve

13:51.898 --> 13:54.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the lives of women in ways that
are hard to
measure.

13:54.667 --> 14:00.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BONNIE CAMPBELL: I want all the
little girls
out there to look up and see a
president take

14:00.440 --> 14:06.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the oath of office who's a woman
and say,
ah, I guess I could grow up to
be president.

14:06.245 --> 14:09.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's more than just how you are
on issues.

14:09.348 --> 14:15.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But for many
women voters in
Iowa, especially younger ones,
it is issues

14:16.089 --> 14:19.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the passion about pursuing
them that matters
more.

14:19.992 --> 14:22.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Radio Iowa reporter O. Kay
Henderson:

14:22.195 --> 14:24.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
O. KAY HENDERSON, News Director,
Radio Iowa:
And one of the things that
Sanders has been

14:24.363 --> 14:30.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
able to do is sort of light a
spark about
the idea of income inequality,
and he is the

14:30.570 --> 14:35.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
messenger that would be able to
break up Wall
Street and the monopoly and the
corporate

14:35.808 --> 14:42.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America that he rails against.
Whereas Secretary
Clinton has focused in a more
measured way

14:42.515 --> 14:46.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on those issues, he has been
more liberal
and progressive.

14:47.019 --> 14:51.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ERIN CADY, Bernie Sanders
Supporter: Bernie
Sanders really focuses in on
giving everybody

14:51.891 --> 14:57.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
equal opportunity and giving
everybody a chance,
I really believe, and being just
a humanitarian

14:58.097 --> 15:01.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and treating people as people
and not as just
a statistic.

15:01.467 --> 15:04.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAEJEAN BODIE, Hillary Clinton
Supporter:
I have gotten more politically
active since

15:05.071 --> 15:11.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have gotten older. And, you
know, I'm retired
now, and I think about my life
and my grandchildren's

15:11.911 --> 15:16.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
life, and I think our country
would really
go forward with Hillary.

15:16.482 --> 15:20.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Both campaigns
are working
frantically to make sure their
supporters

15:20.586 --> 15:26.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
show up to caucus Monday night.
But whatever
happens, the Clinton camp has
learned here

15:26.292 --> 15:32.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the contest for the nomination
may not only
take longer, but also involve a
tougher fight

15:32.298 --> 15:36.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the votes of women than they
had counted
on.

15:36.602 --> 15:42.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From the Democratic battle for
women's votes,
to the Republican battle for the
spotlight.

15:42.108 --> 15:48.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our political director Lisa
Desjardins reports
now on the large GOP field and
last night's

15:48.181 --> 15:49.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
debate here in Iowa.

15:50.016 --> 15:54.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I did something that was very
risky. And I

15:54.754 --> 15:57.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think it turned out great,
because I'm on
the front page of every paper.
I'm getting

15:57.256 --> 15:59.025 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more publicity.

15:59.125 --> 16:02.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Donald Trump,
today in New
Hampshire, crowed about what
happened last

16:02.528 --> 16:03.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
night in Des Moines.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: This is an honor.
This is a
really -- honor.

16:05.798 --> 16:10.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: He held his own
rogue fund-raiser
for veterans, claiming to raise
at least $6

16:10.770 --> 16:12.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
million, as just across town:

16:12.271 --> 16:14.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MEGYN KELLY, FOX News: Donald
Trump has chosen
not to attend.

16:14.740 --> 16:19.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Seven other
Republicans gathered
to soak up the extra oxygen and
try to move

16:19.812 --> 16:21.681 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
past Trump.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
Chris, let's begin by being
clear what this

16:23.749 --> 16:25.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign is about. It's not
about Donald Trump.
He's an entertaining guy. He's
the greatest

16:25.918 --> 16:29.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
show on earth. This campaign is
about the
greatest country in the world.

16:29.188 --> 16:34.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This debate
drew fewer viewers
than all but one GOP face-off
this cycle,

16:34.260 --> 16:39.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around 12.5 million people. But
it kept up
in quality and quantity of
punches.

16:39.232 --> 16:41.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
Chris, I would note that the
last four questions

16:41.801 --> 16:46.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been, Rand, please attack
Ted. Marco,
please attack Ted. Chris, please
attack Ted.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeb, please attack Ted.

16:48.574 --> 16:51.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Ted Cruz,
center stage in
Trump's absence, tussled with
the FOX News

16:51.978 --> 16:53.746 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
moderators early on.

16:53.846 --> 16:57.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: If you guys ask
one more mean
question, I may have to leave
the stage.

16:57.817 --> 17:01.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But, before
long, the Texas
senator was on defense on
immigration.

17:01.654 --> 17:04.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: I don't want
immigration reform
to fail.

17:04.590 --> 17:09.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Confronted by
videotape of
what he said about a 2013
immigration compromise

17:09.629 --> 17:11.464 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the Senate.

17:11.564 --> 17:15.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: But, Megyn, the
bill was 1,000
pages. I introduced a series of
amendments,

17:15.101 --> 17:17.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
each designed to fix problems in
the bill.

17:17.436 --> 17:22.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But Cruz found
no friends
on stage. Senator Rand Paul
rejected his colleague's

words.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY),
Presidential Candidate:
And that's an authenticity
problem, that everybody

17:26.646 --> 17:30.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he knows is not as perfect as
him, because
we're all for amnesty. I was for
legalization.

17:30.816 --> 17:35.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, frankly, if you have
border security,
you can have legalization. So
was Ted, but

17:35.121 --> 17:37.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now he says it wasn't so. That's
not true.

17:37.523 --> 17:42.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: Never have and
never will
support any effort to grant
blanket legalization

17:42.161 --> 17:43.930 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
amnesty.

17:44.030 --> 17:47.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Marco Rubio,
too, had to
confront his immigration
Achilles' heel. Jeb

17:47.566 --> 17:49.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bush reminded Republicans of
Rubio's past.

17:49.435 --> 17:52.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEB BUSH (R), Presidential
Candidate: I'm
kind of confused because he was
the sponsor

17:52.405 --> 17:58.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Gang of Eight bill that
did require
a bunch of thresholds, but
ultimately allowed

17:58.711 --> 18:03.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for citizenship over an extended
period of
time. I mean, that's a fact. And
he asked

18:03.582 --> 18:05.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
me to support that.

18:05.117 --> 18:07.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Rubio shot back
at Bush,
his one-time mentor in Florida.

18:07.853 --> 18:11.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: You wrote a
book where you
changed your position from a
path of citizenship

18:11.424 --> 18:15.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a path of legalization. And
the bottom
line is this. We are not going
to be able

18:15.227 --> 18:18.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do anything on this issue
until we first
bring illegal immigration under
control.

18:19.098 --> 18:23.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In Trump's
absence, everyone
had more time. Chris Christie
presented himself

18:23.502 --> 18:28.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a no-nonsense governor, and
hit a conservative
chord when asked to cut one
government function.

18:28.975 --> 18:30.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R-NJ),
Presidential Candidate:
How about one that I have done
in New Jersey

18:30.910 --> 18:34.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the last six years? And
that's get rid
of Planned Parenthood funding
from the United

18:34.380 --> 18:35.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
States of America.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

18:36.983 --> 18:40.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: John Kasich
aimed to be the
smart, grounded voice, and took
on topics

18:40.419 --> 18:42.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
others often avoid.

18:42.421 --> 18:43.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate:
The time has come to stop
ignoring the mentally

18:44.090 --> 18:45.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ill in this country.

18:45.992 --> 18:49.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And Ben Carson,
as he does
often, spoke broadly of freedom
and specifically

18:49.929 --> 18:51.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the Constitution.

18:51.764 --> 18:55.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN CARSON (R), Presidential
Candidate: Do
ordain and establish this
Constitution of

18:55.334 --> 18:58.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the United States of America.
Folks, it's
not too late.

18:58.871 --> 19:04.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And it will be
too late for
some candidates soon. Iowans
vote Monday.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

19:07.013 --> 19:10.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And now to the
analysis
of Brooks and Dionne. That's New
York Times

19:10.783 --> 19:14.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
columnist David Brooks and
Washington Post
columnist and author of the new
book "Why

19:14.487 --> 19:17.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Right Went Wrong" E.J.
Dionne. Mark Shields
is away.

19:17.356 --> 19:19.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
E.J., let me start with you.

19:19.191 --> 19:22.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the big stories last
night was the
person who was not at the debate
stage. Did

19:22.595 --> 19:24.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump make the right
decision?

19:24.497 --> 19:29.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
E.J. DIONNE: You know, 24 hours
ago, I might
have said no. And at this point,
I think he

19:29.535 --> 19:31.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
may have made the right
decision.

19:31.737 --> 19:36.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The no is based on the idea that
Iowa caucus-goers
are very serious about politics,
and they

19:37.076 --> 19:41.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wouldn't take kindly to a guy
who says I don't
like the moderator so I'm
skipping out.

19:42.048 --> 19:48.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that debate produced so much
pummeling
of Ted Cruz -- and here I am
channeling Donald

19:48.854 --> 19:55.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump, who said, you know, he
got pummeled
today. The Des Moines Register
headline was

19:55.294 --> 19:57.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
"Rough Night for Cruz."

19:57.163 --> 20:03.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cruz is Trump's main competitor
for number
one, and so the results he
brought about may

20:03.302 --> 20:08.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually help him here. I think
the other
thing that is indicative is that
today's talk

20:08.207 --> 20:15.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is very bullish on Marco Rubio,
and Cruz has
shifted his negative advertising
from Trump

20:15.514 --> 20:21.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Rubio. He's got the ultimate
Republican
attack ad, Marco Rubio, the
Republican Obama.

20:21.620 --> 20:27.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Cruz, I think, is a little
concerned going
into this. A week or so ago, I
think you would

20:28.060 --> 20:33.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have said he was the favorite.
Now he's running
behind in the polls, and he's
being really

20:33.365 --> 20:35.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
challenged from both ends.

20:35.367 --> 20:39.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
what do you think?
Does this help or hurt Donald's
momentum going

20:39.538 --> 20:41.407 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into Iowa?

20:41.507 --> 20:43.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I think it
hurts. It hurts
them both. If you look at the
polls the last

20:43.776 --> 20:46.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
four days, they have been
dropping, both Cruz
and Trump.

20:46.245 --> 20:50.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rubio has been rising. Some of
the others
have been rising. And I thought
last night

20:50.116 --> 20:55.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hurt both Trump and Cruz, Trump
because he
looks petulant, he looks
spoiled. Shouldn't

20:55.454 --> 21:00.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have gone after Megyn Kelly. His
base of report
is 67-year-old white male
Republicans. Those

21:00.960 --> 21:05.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
guys love Megyn Kelly. He
shouldn't have gone
after her.

21:05.331 --> 21:10.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But -- and then Cruz, as E.J.
said, just got
hit, hit badly, and then, as we
saw in Lisa's

21:10.803 --> 21:16.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clip, whined about it and really
got one-upped
by Chris Wallace in some of
those exchanges.

21:16.342 --> 21:19.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so he -- his personality was
beginning
to show.

21:19.812 --> 21:24.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's interesting. We have
four days of
them sliding. They have still
got comfortable

21:24.116 --> 21:29.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leads. Rubio and some others
rising. And I
do think Trump has a gigantic
turnout problem.

21:29.188 --> 21:34.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He attracts non-voters, people
who have not
traditionally voted. He does
very well on

21:34.226 --> 21:36.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people who haven't voted in the
last four
elections.

21:36.428 --> 21:38.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a good chance some chunk
of those
people won't turn out.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: E.J., you were
just...

21:40.566 --> 21:45.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
E.J. DIONNE: I think one thing
that should
be said is that Jeb Bush
probably had the

21:45.304 --> 21:50.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
best night. If Trump did him the
favor, the
bully was gone, and Jeb really
found his voice.

21:50.576 --> 21:54.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That won't make any difference
here, where
Jeb isn't in contention, but it
could help

21:54.713 --> 21:58.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him in the fight to run at least
in New Hampshire.

21:58.851 --> 22:03.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And before we completely
discount Ted Cruz,
which is what the day's
conventional wisdom

22:03.689 --> 22:10.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is doing, he's got a very strong
organization
built on the evangelical
Christian movement.

22:10.529 --> 22:16.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the evangelical Christian
movement has
won the last two Iowa caucuses
for their candidate,

22:16.702 --> 22:19.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rick Santorum and before that
Mike Huckabee.

22:19.905 --> 22:24.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's no question that
Cruz is in a
kind of trouble today that he
hasn't been

22:24.376 --> 22:26.178 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in a while.

22:26.278 --> 22:29.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And, as E.J. says,
his turnout
base is the most secure. Those
people do come

22:29.448 --> 22:31.283 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out.

22:31.383 --> 22:35.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the odds things, also,
which E.J. just
referenced, is the ad wars.
Almost nobody

22:35.221 --> 22:39.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this entire campaign has gone
after Donald
Trump, the front-runner, because
people are

22:39.158 --> 22:44.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
afraid to take him on. And so
most of the
ads have been run, by some
measure, $22 million

22:44.196 --> 22:49.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Marco Rubio, and Cruz today
shifted and
started attacking Rubio.

22:49.401 --> 22:52.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so nobody wants to take on
Trump, either
because they are afraid what he
will do. They're

22:52.771 --> 22:56.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
afraid of offending his voters.
But it's a
weird situation, where the
front-runner is

22:56.842 --> 23:01.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
getting off scot-free so far.
And talk about
guy with big vulnerabilities.
But the ads

23:01.747 --> 23:04.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have not been -- with a couple
exceptions,
have not been run against him.

23:04.483 --> 23:06.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: E.J.?

23:06.318 --> 23:09.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
E.J. DIONNE: Although there are
a lot of outside
groups that have really kicked
in here.

23:09.555 --> 23:13.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just watching my television, I
have seen a
lot of ads trying to tell people
Donald Trump

23:14.093 --> 23:18.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not a conservative. I mean, I
think somebody
out there is putting money in to
try to get

23:18.664 --> 23:20.599 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at Donald Trump finally.

23:20.699 --> 23:26.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, David, one
of the contentious
exchanges yesterday was between
Cruz and Rubio

23:26.672 --> 23:31.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on immigration. And you kind of
see the needle
that Rubio is trying to thread
here.

23:31.176 --> 23:35.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, well, they
both flip-flopped,
as Bush sort of did.

23:35.614 --> 23:40.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I guess Rubio's flip has a
bigger flop. He
really was the leader of the
Gang of Eight.

23:40.686 --> 23:44.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What Cruz was doing, sort of in
the crucial
week, he was sort of trying to
figure out

23:44.957 --> 23:48.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where to position himself. And
he was leaning
in favor, or at least some
amendments that

23:48.961 --> 23:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would be in favor, and then he
decided to
side out against, where Rubio
really was a

23:54.433 --> 23:56.235 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
champion.

23:56.335 --> 24:01.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's sad is that it's now a
contest to see
who can be the most
anti-immigrant. And I

24:01.774 --> 24:05.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think that's the legacy of
Trump, and that
the idea that you could be for
some compromise

24:05.978 --> 24:09.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that would close the border and
then have
a path to citizenship, even
though popular

24:09.715 --> 24:13.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
among Republicans nationwide, is
not popular
among Iowa caucus-goers.

24:13.452 --> 24:18.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they are competing to show
how anti-immigrant
they are and they're competing
to show that

24:18.524 --> 24:22.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they would never make a
compromise with a
Democrat. And so they are really
appealing

24:22.695 --> 24:24.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the hardest of the hard-core
right now.

24:24.463 --> 24:28.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But, E.J.,
what happens
if you take this sort of a
hard-line stance

24:28.167 --> 24:33.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on immigration now and let's you
make it to
the general and, if you're Marco
Rubio, you

24:33.238 --> 24:35.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
might want those Latino votes?

24:35.207 --> 24:40.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
E.J. DIONNE: Well, I think part
of the problem
Rubio has is, he's flipping and
flopping and

24:40.312 --> 24:44.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
flipping and flopping on this
because he's
got in his head two things at
the same time,

24:44.983 --> 24:51.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is, he knows his original
position wasn't
hard enough, not anti-immigrant
enough for

24:51.957 --> 24:55.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
many Republican caucus-goers and
primary voters.

24:55.294 --> 24:59.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then he has an eye at the
same time on
the general election, and those
Republicans

24:59.431 --> 25:04.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to up their share of the
Latino vote
from where it was for Mitt
Romney the last

25:04.770 --> 25:10.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time. So I think he's twisted
himself into
many, many knots. There was --
Rubio had a

25:10.175 --> 25:15.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
generally good debate, but he
didn't look
good there. Jeb Bush went on the
attack against

25:15.314 --> 25:20.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
him really hard on this,
proving, among other
things, that Jeb Bush didn't
take kindly to

25:21.019 --> 25:24.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his protege challenging him in
the presidential
election.

25:24.990 --> 25:30.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, on the whole, as David
said, it's a very
bad display by the Republicans,
not only of

25:30.262 --> 25:33.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an anti-immigrant feeling, but
of an awful
lot of opportunism at the top of
the party.

25:34.099 --> 25:38.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, David, who
is stacked
where they are right now in one,
two and three

25:38.704 --> 25:41.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going into Iowa, and is that
likely to change?

25:41.373 --> 25:45.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I continue to
think -- and,
as viewers know, my predictions
have been

25:45.210 --> 25:50.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wrong consistently this entire
year -- but
I think the big story out of
Iowa will be

25:50.215 --> 25:51.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that Trump underperformed.

25:52.050 --> 25:56.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think he's got a turnout
problem. I think
that Sanders is going to
underperform too,

25:56.522 --> 25:59.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because he relies so much on
young voters.
But maybe they're a little more
mobilized

25:59.892 --> 26:03.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to actually show up. Remember,
going to the
caucus is a multihour
occupation. It's not

26:03.629 --> 26:05.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just going to a voting both and
getting out
of there.

26:05.798 --> 26:09.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it takes a big-time
commitment and
an amazingly small percentage of
Iowans actually

26:09.668 --> 26:15.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do it, I think one in six or
something like
that. And so it's -- getting
people out is

26:15.474 --> 26:17.342 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the core thing.

26:17.443 --> 26:20.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think Trump's the most --
the most likely
story is that he will
underperform and we

26:20.946 --> 26:22.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will be talking about Cruz or
somebody else.

26:23.015 --> 26:24.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: E.J., is that
how it stacks
up for you?

26:24.917 --> 26:30.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
E.J. DIONNE: I think nobody
knows what Donald
Trump people are going to do. He
managed to

26:30.456 --> 26:34.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mobilize a lot of people very
quickly for
that veterans event.

26:35.093 --> 26:39.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think a lot of people are
going to be looking
at the Des Moines Register, Des
Moines Register/Bloomberg

26:39.765 --> 26:46.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
poll, which is -- has a good
history relative
to all the other polls here. I
think that

26:46.338 --> 26:52.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump needs a significant lead
in order to
come out winning, because there
clearly will

26:52.211 --> 26:56.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be some falloff in his vote.

26:56.114 --> 27:02.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think if he wins, he wins,
whether he
runs equal to the polls or not.
I think Cruz

27:02.254 --> 27:07.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a guy who has got to win
here. I think,
if he loses here, he's the one
person who

27:07.226 --> 27:09.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
could really be hurt by Iowa.

27:09.194 --> 27:12.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: E.J., staying
with you for
a second, let's turn now to
Democrats. Sanders

27:12.130 --> 27:16.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Clinton have been running
neck and neck
in certain polls. Sanders kind
of turned up

27:16.268 --> 27:21.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the heat on Clinton this week, a
line of attack
saying that she's too connected
to Wall Street.

27:21.840 --> 27:24.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that a strategy that could
work for him?

27:24.309 --> 27:28.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
E.J. DIONNE: I think, in
Democratic primaries,
attacking someone for being too
close for

27:28.814 --> 27:35.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street always works. And,
clearly, Bernie
Sanders has found a very
substantial audience

27:35.554 --> 27:37.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for this message in the party.

27:37.823 --> 27:45.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think that -- and this
last-minute story
about e-mails, as Judy mentioned
earlier,

27:45.164 --> 27:49.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is just not a story she wants to
come out
at the end of this, even if, as
her spokesman

27:49.935 --> 27:54.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said, it turns out that this is,
I think he
said overclassification run
amok. It's just

27:54.940 --> 27:57.075 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not the way she wanted to close.

27:57.175 --> 28:03.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other side of that, though,
is that Hillary
Clinton is always best when
she's under pressure.

28:03.415 --> 28:08.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she's probably run her best
part of the
campaign in the last week. You
could see that

28:08.887 --> 28:14.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in the CNN forum at the
beginning of the week.
She seems more comfortable.

28:15.027 --> 28:22.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she does have a very, very
strong organization
and has an older electorate
behind her, which,

28:22.234 --> 28:27.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a turnout contest, is better
than having
a younger electorate. The way I
see it is,

28:27.739 --> 28:31.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are two sort of markers
for Bernie.
Some people compare him to
Howard Dean in

28:31.977 --> 28:36.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
'04. And Dean had a lot of
support, and then
it just collapsed, a lot of
young people from

28:36.214 --> 28:38.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out of state who didn't vote
here.

28:38.116 --> 28:42.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or Obama '08. Now, I think he's
well past
where Howard Dean was. I don't
think that

28:42.988 --> 28:48.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comparison is true. The question
is, how close
does he get to Obama? This is a
very tight

28:48.360 --> 28:53.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
race. And smart people I have
talked to here
thinks this could be the race
that keeps us

28:53.632 --> 28:55.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
up late on Monday night.

28:55.500 --> 28:58.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
David, if it's
such a tight race, would
O'Malley supporters

28:58.604 --> 29:03.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
play a role in where they decide
to -- especially
in those rooms, where they have
to walk from

29:03.308 --> 29:05.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one section of the corner over
to the other,
right?

29:05.277 --> 29:07.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: It would have to
be really tight
for -- because there aren't that
many of those.

29:08.080 --> 29:14.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it is, as E.J. says, a
turnout thing,
and then a message thing.
Sanders just has

29:14.720 --> 29:17.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
such a clean message. You don't
have to be
paying close attention. You know
what he's

29:17.823 --> 29:23.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all about. As E.J. says, Clinton
improves
as a campaigner when the going
gets tough.

29:23.862 --> 29:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what's the core message of
the campaign?
What's the one single theme that
you know

29:28.166 --> 29:30.035 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about her?

29:30.135 --> 29:33.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know her history. You know
her biography.
But she hasn't picked a theme.
The Wall Street

29:33.905 --> 29:37.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thing, I do think that works
very well among
the sort of people who show up
at these caucuses.

29:37.576 --> 29:38.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think, substantively, it's
crazy.

29:38.810 --> 29:40.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: As a line of
attack.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

29:42.114 --> 29:44.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, substantively, people's
wages are down
because of technological change
and globalization,

29:44.516 --> 29:49.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not because of compensation
patterns on Wall
Street, as awful as they are.
But as a line

29:49.287 --> 29:53.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of attack, this election so much
has been
about the organization of
hatred. It's about

29:53.759 --> 29:58.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
finding people or institutions
that people
in each party really distrust,
whether it's

29:58.897 --> 30:00.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Wall Street or Washington.

30:00.832 --> 30:04.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you can mobilize those,
that hostility,
that seems to be what is driving
people this

30:04.603 --> 30:06.405 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

30:06.505 --> 30:10.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally, E.J.,
I have got
to ask, is Iowa worth paying as
much attention

30:11.076 --> 30:15.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to? It's not by any stretch
demographically
representative of the entire
country.

30:15.881 --> 30:20.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Perhaps it's changed over the
last 50 years.
And this is now a reflection of
how the political

30:20.452 --> 30:24.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
system has worked and who tries
to game it.
But should we be paying as much
attention

30:24.122 --> 30:25.857 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to this state?

30:25.957 --> 30:30.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
E.J. DIONNE: Well, since I'm
sitting here,
I guess I should say the answer
is yes.

30:30.128 --> 30:34.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there are two things in
contradiction
here. On the one hand, it's
absolutely true

30:34.332 --> 30:40.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that neither Iowa nor New
Hampshire are representative
of the country as a whole,
beginning with

30:40.505 --> 30:46.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fact that they have a much
higher percentage
of white voters than the country
as a whole.

30:46.678 --> 30:52.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I end up -- I find myself
defending their
role, for the following reason.
Campaigns

30:52.217 --> 30:59.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have become so much about
advertising, candidates
going from airport tarmac to
airport tarmac,

30:59.458 --> 31:05.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that there is still something
lovely, if romantic,
about candidates having to
answer questions

31:05.230 --> 31:10.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from actual voters, instead of
us in the media.
And that part of it, I really
like.

31:10.202 --> 31:10.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right.

31:10.802 --> 31:12.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Very briefly, David.

31:12.704 --> 31:14.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I agree. The
process is great,
but the results should be taken
with a grain

31:14.673 --> 31:16.608 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of salt.

31:16.708 --> 31:19.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I would be surprised if
especially the Republican
campaign was -- I think it will
be over maybe

31:19.711 --> 31:23.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in April, May. We have got a
long time to
go here -- maybe the Democratic
one, too.

31:23.248 --> 31:25.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
David Brooks,
E.J. Dionne, thanks so much.

31:25.817 --> 31:33.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
E.J. DIONNE: Great to be with
you. Thanks.

31:33.959 --> 31:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

31:41.266 --> 31:45.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
drug shortages
lead to a kind of medical
rationing; refugees'

31:45.904 --> 31:51.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
desperate journeys transformed
into ballet;
and a young girl takes charge of
her future

31:51.676 --> 31:53.478 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and her ROTC.

31:53.578 --> 31:59.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, the iconic Barbie
doll, beloved
by some and loathed, decried by
others, is

31:59.851 --> 32:01.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going through something of a
transformation.

32:01.653 --> 32:05.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Toy maker Mattel is introducing
three new
Barbies with three different
body shapes.

32:05.257 --> 32:10.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The company acknowledges the
financial reasons
for the decision, but, more
importantly, the

32:10.428 --> 32:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
changes are meant to deal with a
changing
marketplace and issues of
diversity in the

32:15.333 --> 32:16.334 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
real world.

32:16.434 --> 32:18.403 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has a look.

32:18.503 --> 32:21.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This is what
the newly refashioned
Barbies are going to look like.
On the left,

32:22.040 --> 32:26.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's the new petite Barbie. In
the middle
is the tall Barbie, and to
right, the curvy

32:27.078 --> 32:28.880 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Barbie.

32:28.980 --> 32:31.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this behind-the-scenes video,
"TIME" magazine
was granted a look at the making
of the new

32:31.550 --> 32:36.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dolls. And in it, Mattel's
Evelyn Mazzocco
told "TIME" that the decision to
introduce

32:36.555 --> 32:41.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these new body styles was partly
about business,
but also about the growing sense
that the

32:41.359 --> 32:45.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
original Barbie, with its wildly
unrealistic
body, needed to change.

32:45.530 --> 32:51.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVELYN MAZZOCCO, Mattel: Our
decision to go
on this journey to really evolve
the brand

32:51.436 --> 32:56.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was inspired by many things. Of
course, it
was inspired by softness in
sales. It was

32:56.875 --> 33:02.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inspired by what we were seeing
on social
media about Barbie. Does she
really know what's

33:02.581 --> 33:05.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happening in the world today?
She seems a
little out of touch. It was
driven by moms

33:06.084 --> 33:09.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and -- saying, like, I don't
think that there's
a -- that Barbie really speaks
to me.

33:09.988 --> 33:15.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD GOTTLIEB, Global Toy
Experts: I think
Mattel is really responding to a
culture both

33:15.393 --> 33:18.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the U.S. and globally that's
dramatically
changed.

33:18.763 --> 33:21.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Richard
Gottlieb is with
a group called the Global Toy
Experts, and

33:22.000 --> 33:26.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he says that while Barbies sold
well last
Christmas, Mattel seems to be
acknowledging

33:26.705 --> 33:28.473 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that the world is changing.

33:28.573 --> 33:32.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD GOTTLIEB: Barbie has --
really had
some strong headwinds in terms
of cultural

33:32.978 --> 33:36.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
identity in the U.S. and around
the world.
As Mattel is a corporation and
Barbie is a

33:36.882 --> 33:42.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
brand globalized, Barbie had to
contend with
a world that was multiracial and
multicultural.

33:42.120 --> 33:45.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GIRL: It's important for Barbie
to look different.

33:45.190 --> 33:50.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD GOTTLIEB: A big part of
it is that
children and their parents want
a doll that

33:50.262 --> 33:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the child can identify with and
a sense of
accessible beauty, that I can
be, I can look

33:55.533 --> 34:00.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like this. And then, as far as
the body type
is concerned, I think that is
where that really

34:00.739 --> 34:06.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comes in, is that sense that
this is an obtainable
figure. This is a person I can
be.

34:06.244 --> 34:09.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This, of
course, has long
been the criticism of Barbie
dolls, that her

34:09.781 --> 34:14.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exaggerated body shape and
stereotypical depiction
of what women are supposed to
look like gave

34:14.786 --> 34:17.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
generations of young girls a
role model they
could never match up to.

34:18.089 --> 34:21.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEGAN GARBER, "The Atlantic":
She has these
exaggerated breasts. She has a
tiny waist.

34:21.526 --> 34:26.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you were to kind of think
about her proportions
in terms of a real woman, she
probably couldn't

34:26.564 --> 34:29.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bear a child, so you have that
element of
things.

34:29.167 --> 34:32.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Megan Garber
is a staff
writer at "The Atlantic," and
recently wrote

34:32.504 --> 34:34.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a piece about the new Barbies.

34:34.372 --> 34:37.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEGAN GARBER: And then you also
have just
the idea that she focuses on
fashion and she

34:37.375 --> 34:41.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
focuses on appearance, and there
hasn't been
much out there about her
historically that

34:41.513 --> 34:46.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has really suggested that she
has much more
aspiration than to just be
pretty and blond

34:46.384 --> 34:48.186 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and all of that.

34:48.286 --> 34:52.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Mattel has tried to fight
back a little
bit from that, with making her
an astronaut

34:53.024 --> 34:56.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a doctor and all of these
different things,
but, fundamentally, I think the
appearance

34:56.861 --> 34:59.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Barbie has sort of superseded
everything
else.

34:59.464 --> 35:03.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In the online
news site
Mashable, writer Katie Dupere,
while complimenting

35:03.668 --> 35:08.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mattel's recent move, also
summed up many
people's feelings about the doll
-- quote

35:08.640 --> 35:14.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- "Barbie has, to some extent,
always been
this bully to women. Her
impossibly thin waist

35:14.245 --> 35:19.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has taunted us, pointing out
what for many
of us is our biggest insecurity,
our body

35:19.384 --> 35:23.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
size. Though she is carved
plastic, she has
screamed at us across
generations, telling

35:23.989 --> 35:26.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
us our bodies aren't good
enough."

35:26.925 --> 35:30.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the Associated Press, the
University of
Maryland's Kumea Shorter-Gooden
applauded

35:30.962 --> 35:36.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mattel's move, but pointed out
that -- quote
-- "European-American hair
prevails" and the

35:36.134 --> 35:40.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dolls are dressed in a way that
-- quote -- "conveys
a traditional and constraining
gender norm

35:41.039 --> 35:42.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about how girls and women should
look."

35:42.974 --> 35:45.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEGAN GARBER: We live in an age
now where
there is Taylor Swift on the one
hand, but

35:46.011 --> 35:51.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is also Beyonce and Kim
Kardashian and
Gina Rodriguez, and all these
different body

35:51.182 --> 35:53.184 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
types, but also shades of skin.

35:53.284 --> 35:57.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think Barbie is definitely
trying to
sort of reflect that in the
culture. You look

35:57.222 --> 36:00.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at these Barbies, and they are
still very
much Barbie dolls. They are
still very much

36:00.658 --> 36:05.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- they are thin. They -- in
general. Even
the curvy one is very thin by
most standards.

36:05.930 --> 36:10.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, these are very incremental
changes. But
I do think they are changes, and
we have to

36:10.869 --> 36:12.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sort of embrace those changes.

36:12.804 --> 36:15.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Of course,
Barbie is also
living in a much more
competitive marketplace

36:15.940 --> 36:20.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than just a few decades ago,
with cell phones
and apps and games constantly
vying for kids'

36:20.845 --> 36:22.614 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
attention.

36:22.714 --> 36:33.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LEGO and its global brand
recently overtook
Mattel in total sales. And just
on the doll

36:33.324 --> 36:38.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
front alone, the global
blockbuster "Frozen"
saw its heroine, Elsa, become
one of the bestselling

36:38.730 --> 36:41.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dolls even two years after the
film's release.

36:41.199 --> 36:46.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD GOTTLIEB: It's important
to look at
it from cyclical standpoint.
When the "Frozen"

36:46.671 --> 36:53.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
movie came out, the "Frozen"
dolls just did
incredibly well. And, of course,
that cannibalized

36:53.578 --> 36:55.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a lot of Barbie sales.

36:55.413 --> 37:01.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that had an impact on last
year. But,
overall, Mattel and every toy
company has

37:01.786 --> 37:06.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been really challenged with a
world in which
there are so many ways to play.

37:06.925 --> 37:10.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But will any
of these changes
matter at the cash register? We
talked with

37:10.962 --> 37:12.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some parents today at a toy
store in Arlington,
Virginia.

37:12.997 --> 37:13.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: You like her?

37:13.431 --> 37:14.065 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GIRL: Yes.

37:14.165 --> 37:15.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Why do you like her?

37:15.934 --> 37:17.735 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GIRL: Pink.

37:17.836 --> 37:20.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: I think it's great. I
love the new
Barbies.

37:20.672 --> 37:24.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The new
Barbies are available
online for presale, and the real
test will

37:24.909 --> 37:27.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be when the new dolls hit the
shelves later
this year.

37:27.479 --> 37:33.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham.

37:33.318 --> 37:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now: how
shortages of some
prescription drugs are forcing
doctors to

37:48.700 --> 37:54.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make difficult, often ethically
fraught decisions,
in some cases, choosing one
patient over another

37:54.639 --> 38:00.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to receive a much-needed drug,
or splitting
a single dose between two, even
three patients.

38:00.612 --> 38:04.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For a look at what's behind the
rationing,
how doctors and their patients
are coping,

38:04.983 --> 38:08.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and what might be done to
correct the problem,
we turn to Sheri Fink of The New
York Times,

38:08.553 --> 38:12.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who has been reporting on the
story. In addition
to being a reporter, she is also
a medical

38:12.757 --> 38:14.592 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
doctor.

38:14.692 --> 38:18.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dr. Fink, what's interesting is,
you're talking
about some of the best hospitals
in the country

38:18.596 --> 38:22.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are going through this, not
a small,
faraway hospital where you might
expect that

38:22.967 --> 38:26.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there would be a shortage. This
is kind of
-- paint us a picture of how
widespread this

38:27.071 --> 38:29.007 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issue is.

38:29.107 --> 38:34.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SHERI FINK, The New York
Times: The shortages
are affecting all types of
hospitals, clinics,

38:34.512 --> 38:40.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
broad range of medical
specialities. It has
touched -- in recent years, this
problem has

38:41.052 --> 38:43.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
touched just about everywhere in
America.

38:43.354 --> 38:47.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, why is it
happening?
Is it specific types of drugs?
Is it specific

38:47.358 --> 38:49.194 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
companies?

38:49.294 --> 38:53.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SHERI FINK: It has to do
with, some of
the drugs often are made by only
one manufacturer.

38:53.698 --> 38:59.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if something goes wrong in a
quality sense,
for example, and they have to
shut down production,

38:59.704 --> 39:03.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that could leave the market not
having enough.

39:03.575 --> 39:08.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It could be that there's not an
economic incentive
for a lot of drug companies to
get into this.

39:08.613 --> 39:14.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It could be that manufacturing
chains that
-- in the factories are running
all the time,

39:14.686 --> 39:18.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and if one goes down, it can
affect lots of
different drugs.

39:19.023 --> 39:24.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there are economic reasons,
there are regulatory
reasons. There are all sorts of
reasons. And

39:24.996 --> 39:30.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these shortages are becoming a
fact of life.
They have increased. In recent
years, the

39:30.468 --> 39:37.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
number of new shortages
increased. New federal
law requiring manufacturers to
tell the FDA

39:37.909 --> 39:42.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if they see something like this
on the horizon
have decreased the number of new
shortages,

39:42.714 --> 39:47.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but the number of existing
shortages is quite
high.

39:47.252 --> 39:50.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, again, it's affecting all
different parts
of medicine.

39:50.188 --> 39:53.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right. So
there's a
hospital facing a tough choice,
saying we

39:53.191 --> 39:57.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have, let's say, five patients
that need this
drug. We only have enough drugs
for two patients.

39:57.795 --> 39:59.597 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What do they do?

39:59.697 --> 40:01.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SHERI FINK: This is the part
that we don't
see, because, of course, the
doctors don't

40:02.000 --> 40:08.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to make patients feel that
-- less trustful
of their treatment. And these
are these tough

40:08.640 --> 40:10.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ethical decisions.

40:10.508 --> 40:14.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you said, how do you make
these choices?
They are not purely medical
choices. They

40:14.679 --> 40:21.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have ethical overtones. They
have overtones
of values. For example, some of
the doctors

40:21.185 --> 40:26.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were describing to me about, in
some cases,
a drug is used for children and
adults, and

40:26.824 --> 40:31.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
maybe children need less of it.
So, could
you treat two children with the
same amount

40:32.096 --> 40:33.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of drug that you treat one
adult?

40:33.798 --> 40:37.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you make that value
judgment between
lives? It's very difficult.

40:38.002 --> 40:39.737 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

40:39.837 --> 40:41.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, if they're
using age
as a factor, do they use weight
as a factor?

40:41.673 --> 40:44.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Do they use the existing
condition of the
patient as a factor?

40:44.575 --> 40:46.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. SHERI FINK: All of the
above.

40:46.477 --> 40:50.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's -- the point of my
investigation
-- and I have been looking at
this for a few

40:50.448 --> 40:56.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years -- is that it's being done
all sorts
of ways. There is no one way.
There are very

40:56.754 --> 41:03.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
few guidelines. Today, a group
children cancer
doctors actually published
rationing guidelines,

41:03.761 --> 41:10.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because children's cancer, of
all the compelling
parts of our medical system,
that has been

41:10.735 --> 41:12.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hit by shortages in recent
years.

41:12.837 --> 41:16.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And these doctors were so
worried, and they
had so little ethical guidance,
that they

41:17.075 --> 41:21.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said let's get together for a
few years, work
this through, get ethicists
involved, get

41:21.612 --> 41:27.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
patient representatives
involved, and come
out with some strategies for --
to offer to

41:27.685 --> 41:30.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doctors who have to make these
decisions or
who may have to make them.

41:30.488 --> 41:33.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the
quotes you have
in your stories is, "We have
been forced into

41:33.458 --> 41:36.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what we think is highly an
unethical corner."

41:36.594 --> 41:40.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You actually profile -- one of
the characters
in your story is somebody that
is essentially

41:40.932 --> 41:46.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
working on inventory in the
basement of the
Cleveland hospital, and he is in
a position

41:46.204 --> 41:51.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to decide which one of his
clinics and which
doctors and eventually which
patients will

41:51.976 --> 41:52.877 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
get these drugs.

41:52.977 --> 41:54.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DR. SHERI FINK: Yes.

41:54.879 --> 41:58.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That quote was from Peter
Adamson, Dr. Peter
Adamson, the Children's Ecology
Group, which

41:58.616 --> 42:04.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the group that came out with
these guidelines
in "The Journal of the National
Cancer Institute."

42:04.655 --> 42:09.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the person you're speaking
about is Chris
Snyder. So, the Cleveland Clinic
has been

42:09.560 --> 42:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unusually proactive. They have
hired a full-time
pharmacist pretty much just to
deal with these

42:15.500 --> 42:21.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shortages in recent years. And
so Chris Snyder
is scurrying around the basement
of the Cleveland

42:21.205 --> 42:26.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinic, staying on top of these
drug shortages
and trying -- the first step, of
course, is

42:26.611 --> 42:28.379 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to conserve.

42:28.479 --> 42:32.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's to wipe out any waste that
you might
have in your system, and to
maximize, so that

42:32.817 --> 42:37.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you don't have to make those
tragic choices.
But, ultimately, sometimes, they
have had

42:37.321 --> 42:42.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to put restrictions on which
uses, which groups
of patients would get a drug and
which wouldn't.

42:42.627 --> 42:46.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, what about
the patients
in all this? You're saying that,
oftentimes,

42:46.330 --> 42:50.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they don't even know that the
medicine is
being rationed to or away from
them.

42:50.368 --> 42:52.136 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DR. SHERI FINK: That's right.

42:52.236 --> 42:54.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sometimes, they're not being
told. A lot of
times, they're not being told.
Doctors told

42:55.006 --> 42:59.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me that they don't want to worry
a patient.
There was a patient I wrote
about. Her name

43:00.044 --> 43:07.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is Bev. And she has Crohn's
disease, and she
relies on intravenous nutrition.
So she can't

43:07.351 --> 43:09.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
eat like you and I do.

43:09.253 --> 43:15.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And they cut -- during a
shortage period that
affected many elements of her
nutrition, she

43:15.927 --> 43:20.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wasn't told. She wasn't getting
zinc and she
came up with a horrible rash,
ended up in

43:20.798 --> 43:26.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the hospital, and then found out
that this
was a classic symptom of zinc
deficiency.

43:26.237 --> 43:28.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she said, why didn't anybody
tell me?

43:28.372 --> 43:33.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is just one example of
people finding
out after. There are many cases
what patients

43:33.945 --> 43:38.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just aren't being told. And this
is another
ethical dimension, is, should
patients be

43:38.483 --> 43:44.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
told, at what point, and how
does the doctor
explain the relative risks of a
substitute

43:44.155 --> 43:47.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drug vs. the standard drug? It's
all very
complicated.

43:47.658 --> 43:53.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Sheri Fink
from The New
York Times, thanks so much.

43:53.364 --> 43:59.136 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DR. SHERI FINK: Thank you.

43:59.237 --> 44:04.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This week, the
government
of Denmark approved a law that
enables the

44:04.308 --> 44:09.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
authorities to seize valuables
from asylum
seekers in order to pay towards
their shelter

44:10.081 --> 44:11.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and living expenses.

44:11.983 --> 44:16.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an effort to make one of
Europe's top
destinations less attractive to
refugees and

44:16.287 --> 44:22.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
migrants. But one of Denmark's
leading dance
troupes is taking to the stage
to expand understanding

44:22.627 --> 44:27.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the hardships many of those
same refugees
have faced. They're doing it by
incorporating

44:27.198 --> 44:30.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a number of asylum seekers into
a new ballet.

44:31.035 --> 44:34.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It opens this evening in
Copenhagen's Old
Opera House.

44:34.171 --> 44:37.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant was
at the rehearsals, and sent us
this reflection

44:38.042 --> 44:41.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from the director and cast, in
their own words.

44:41.178 --> 44:50.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALAM SUSU, Refugee: You cannot
explain it
in words. Like, people dying all
around you,

44:50.154 --> 45:03.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
friends, relatives, children,
bombs, explosions,
cars. You don't know when you're
going to

45:03.134 --> 45:07.805 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
be dead.

45:07.905 --> 45:18.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My name is Salam Susu. And I'm
from Syria.
I lived in Homs. I work as a
university professor

45:18.649 --> 45:25.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in music. I came here. I play
music. And I
work with a very high
professional people

45:25.256 --> 45:34.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who really make me feel like I'm
home. And
I really restart being a real
human being,

45:34.732 --> 45:36.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
feeling with everything.

45:36.734 --> 45:39.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTIAN LOLLIKE, Director: My
name is Christian
Lollike. I'm the director of
this piece called

45:39.870 --> 45:48.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Europa." It's called asylum
ballet. It's
a mix of asylum seekers and
royal ballet dancers.

45:48.312 --> 45:53.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm trying to sort of explode
the idea of
what is a refugee, because,,
very often in

45:53.884 --> 46:02.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Europe, refugees are considered
as parasites
who come to take things from us
and as a problem.

46:02.426 --> 46:06.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I want to show that they are
much more.

46:06.163 --> 46:14.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHAMMED AL-ISHAQ, Refugee: It
was necessary
for me to leave Pakistan because
of my sexuality.

46:15.039 --> 46:21.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My name is Mohammed al-Ishaq
from Lahore,
Punjab.

46:21.545 --> 46:26.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was becoming hard for me to
survive and
it was becoming extremely hard
for my parents

46:26.751 --> 46:33.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to survive because of me also,
because they
also started getting threats
from the religious

46:33.157 --> 46:39.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
authorities who gave me threats
also that,
either I become non-gay, like
non-homosexual,

46:39.697 --> 46:46.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and get married normally to a
woman, or I
find my own ways, or be ready to
be killed.

46:46.804 --> 46:55.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIAN YAAKOB DAWOOD, Refugee:
When the bombs
came, we were hoping they would
hit our neighbor,

46:55.980 --> 46:57.782 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
not us.

46:57.882 --> 47:12.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My name is Elian Yaakob Dawood.
I came from
Syria. And now I'm here in
Denmark. I need

47:12.596 --> 47:21.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to send a message. We all send a
message.
We are good. We love the life,
not everybody

47:21.839 --> 47:24.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a religious fanatic.

47:24.675 --> 47:33.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTIAN LOLLIKE: I think it's
actually scary
and wrong that the Danish
government is trying

47:33.784 --> 47:40.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to scare people away, instead of
being constructive
and work together in the
European Union and

47:40.524 --> 47:43.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to create a solution on this
problem.

47:43.961 --> 47:50.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's very important, especially
in Denmark,
where a lot of people are afraid
of asylum

47:50.267 --> 47:55.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seekers and refugees. I think
it's very important
to see that they are human
beings and they

47:55.239 --> 47:57.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have all kind of skills and
qualifications.

47:57.608 --> 48:02.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALAM SUSU: They are not all
similar. There
are a lot of really
high-educated people who

48:02.646 --> 48:06.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
run away from death to rebuild
their life,
and to integrate into the
society, to live

48:07.084 --> 48:14.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the life that they really
wanted, and to explain
that we are good enough to be in
your society.

48:14.692 --> 48:19.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHAMMED AL-ISHAQ: This will
help people in
thinking differently for
refugees. They look

48:19.330 --> 48:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at us as normal human beings,
the way we are,
not just the parasite.

48:22.933 --> 48:28.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As far as I'm concerned, it's
very self-therapeutic
for me. Speaking about my own
life, it gives

48:29.039 --> 48:38.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me a feeling that, when I tell
people my story,
people respond in a way that is
not confrontation

48:38.115 --> 48:39.950 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or condemnation.

48:40.050 --> 48:46.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not scared that they're
going to punish
me. It's not about the people
who come from

48:46.190 --> 48:52.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
war-trodden countries only. It's
not just
the war that people are dying
of. There are

48:53.063 --> 48:58.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other reasons also. And I do not
come from
a place where there is war going
on. But there

48:58.702 --> 49:02.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a war going on at a society
level for me,
for my sake.

49:02.773 --> 49:08.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I'm sure there are people
who have other
reasons, other than war or even
sexuality,

49:08.179 --> 49:11.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they do not find a place to
survive where
they are.

49:11.615 --> 49:20.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALAM SUSU: We got asylum today.
The papers
and the commune, and -- yes, I
can't explain

49:20.424 --> 49:27.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
too much, because it's so good.
Like, you
had a paper, you are not nobody
anymore. You

49:27.231 --> 49:29.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
became a human being.

49:29.767 --> 49:40.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My dream? To have a life again.
To live. To
experience my humanity. It's
really incredible.

49:40.411 --> 49:48.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I really start to experience my
skills on
a real world, among the real
people, who really

49:48.519 --> 50:03.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
start to know who I am. I'm like
stepping
on stairs to dream.

50:03.400 --> 50:18.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally
tonight, how today's
teens are battling gender
stereotypes.

50:18.182 --> 50:25.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shantell Gonzalez is the only
female commanding
officer of her JROTC unit at
Alonzo and Tracy

50:25.956 --> 50:30.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mourning Senior High in Miami.
Her story caps
off a week of coverage from our
Student Reporting

50:30.661 --> 50:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Labs on redefining gender in our
society.
It's part of our Outside the Box
series.

50:36.500 --> 50:40.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Fall out. Attention.
Right-face.

50:40.271 --> 50:49.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHANTELL GONZALEZ, Student: My
name is Shantell
Gonzalez. I'm the C.O. of the
NJROTC program

50:49.980 --> 50:55.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
here at Alonzo and Tracy
Mourning. C.O. represents
commanding officer, who is in
charge of the

50:55.753 --> 50:57.521 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
entire company.

50:57.621 --> 51:00.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Being a woman in a
male-dominated
military branch comes with
several struggles

51:00.624 --> 51:04.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and conquests. But Shantell
Gonzalez has never
let that come between her and
her passion

51:05.029 --> 51:06.864 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for serving.

51:06.964 --> 51:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHANTELL GONZALEZ: Difficult
being a female
and leading -- trying to lead
males, especially

51:09.166 --> 51:13.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your age group, because cadets
don't think
that they should be being told
what to do

51:13.304 --> 51:17.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by a person in general, and then
being told
what to do by a female is even
harder for

51:17.908 --> 51:19.743 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
them to listen.

51:19.843 --> 51:24.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they will eventually -- if
you do it the
correct way, they will
eventually follow what

51:24.148 --> 51:25.983 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you will say.

51:26.083 --> 51:29.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: In order to keep up
with the demands
of being a commanding officer,
Shantell attends

51:29.553 --> 51:32.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a physical training course with
current and
former Marines.

51:32.656 --> 51:36.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Staff Sergeant David Castro
(ph), an active-duty
Marine Corps recruiter who
mentors young cadets

51:37.094 --> 51:41.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
at the Miami school, says
Shantell not only
far exceeds the expectations of
others, but

51:42.066 --> 51:44.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also the expectations she has of
herself.

51:44.168 --> 51:47.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STAFF SGT. DAVID CASTRO, Marine
Corps: She
comes here every day with a lot
of enthusiasm.

51:47.504 --> 51:53.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's very optimistic about her
future. And
she's here to compete. And it
shows on a daily

51:53.310 --> 51:58.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
basis every time she come here.
Sometimes,
