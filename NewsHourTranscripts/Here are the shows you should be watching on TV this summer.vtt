JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight:
There was a time when summer
TV was largely confined

00:06.433 --> 00:08.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to reruns.

00:08.366 --> 00:10.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that has changed
dramatically in the
world of streaming video.

00:10.166 --> 00:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, in fact, a new summer
season is under way.

00:14.166 --> 00:16.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has a look.

00:16.266 --> 00:19.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The summer season
has changed so much, that it's
now when some of the best-known

00:19.166 --> 00:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shows debut new episodes.

00:21.200 --> 00:25.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
High on that list, the fantasy
series "Game of Thrones," which
run the Emmy for best drama

00:25.600 --> 00:27.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and is back on HBO.

00:27.200 --> 00:30.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Orange Is the New Black" will
air new episodes on Netflix.

00:30.600 --> 00:34.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NBC returns with its
surprise comedy hit
"The Carmichael Show."

00:34.333 --> 00:38.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there are plenty
of new options such
as "Claws," a Southern
crime drama with a comic

00:38.900 --> 00:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
edge that comes to TNT, a show
about the founding of the first
women's wrestling federation

00:45.900 --> 00:49.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
called "GLOW" on Netflix, and a
Showtime drama about struggling
comics in the 1970s called

00:50.400 --> 00:52.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
"I'm Dying Up Here."

00:52.500 --> 00:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two TV critics, I hope they're
not dying where we are talking
to them, from all of television.

00:56.833 --> 01:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're going to help us
sort through the season, Eric
Deggans of NPR and Sonia Saraiya

01:01.600 --> 01:02.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of "Variety."

01:02.600 --> 01:04.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thanks, both, for joining us.

01:04.066 --> 01:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't know how you keep up
with this, but help us out here.

01:06.300 --> 01:10.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
First of all, Eric,
summer season, does it
actually mean anything?

01:10.633 --> 01:12.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is there any rhyme
or reason anymore?

01:12.733 --> 01:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC DEGGANS, National Public
Radio: Well, you know, TV is
a business that loves habits.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, for the
broadcasters especially,
there is a summer season.

01:19.666 --> 01:24.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think it's less so for
the cable nets, and it's
even less so for the
streamers like Netflix,

01:26.133 --> 01:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which seem to churn out a new
series just about every week.

01:29.133 --> 01:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there is a sense that the
TV season is slowing down a
little bit, and we're seeing

01:32.433 --> 01:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shows that are less than
marquee shows debuting
during the next few months.

01:36.533 --> 01:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, Sonia, let
me start with you with one of
the new ones coming -- I mean,

01:39.833 --> 01:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of the old ones coming
back, a successful one, is
Aziz Ansari's "Master of None."

01:44.600 --> 01:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's take -- first, let's
take a quick look at a clip.

01:46.966 --> 01:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALESSANDRA MASTRONARDI,
Actress: This is really good.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AZIZ ANSARI, Actor: I told you.

01:51.700 --> 01:55.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Aren't you glad you
expanded your culinary
horizons beyond Italian?

01:55.100 --> 01:56.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALESSANDRA
MASTRONARDI: Yes, I am.

01:56.966 --> 01:58.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You're right.

01:58.266 --> 02:03.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What else should I try
when I'm in New York?

02:03.900 --> 02:05.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AZIZ ANSARI: Indian food.

02:05.166 --> 02:05.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALESSANDRA MASTRONARDI:
No, nobody likes curry.

02:05.966 --> 02:07.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AZIZ ANSARI: Racist.

02:07.433 --> 02:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALESSANDRA MASTRONARDI: I
said I don't like curry food.

02:08.666 --> 02:10.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I didn't say I don't
like curry people.

02:10.766 --> 02:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AZIZ ANSARI: All right, I was
kidding earlier, but the phrase
curry people, definitely racist.

02:14.533 --> 02:15.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALESSANDRA MASTRONARDI:
I'm not racist.

02:15.733 --> 02:16.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AZIZ ANSARI: You can't
say curry person.

02:16.966 --> 02:18.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm not a curry person.

02:18.500 --> 02:20.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm not defined by the
flavors my people enjoy.

02:20.500 --> 02:24.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sonia, I saw you
both actually smiling watching
or even listening to that.

02:24.766 --> 02:26.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Sonia, tell us why
you like that show.

02:26.833 --> 02:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SONIA SARAIYA, "Variety": You
know, "Master of None" is --
it's such a delicate little,

02:32.033 --> 02:33.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
beautiful show.

02:33.266 --> 02:36.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Its a half-hour, but
it's so cinematic.

02:36.833 --> 02:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is -- actually, the
second season references
Italian cinema a lot.

02:40.666 --> 02:45.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, it's Aziz Ansari more
or less playing himself, you
know, trying to understand his

02:46.600 --> 02:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
life and figure out the world.

02:48.633 --> 02:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, a big thing
that motivates him, as you
can sort of tell, that's kind

02:52.133 --> 02:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a date that he is on in
that clip, and, you know,
figuring out his love life is a

02:56.233 --> 02:58.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
big part of it.

02:58.266 --> 03:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But at the end of the first
season, he decided he wanted
to go to Italy and learn how to

03:01.300 --> 03:05.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
make pasta because that
was something that he
wanted to do in his life.

03:05.233 --> 03:09.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The second season is
about him broadening
his horizons even more.

03:09.066 --> 03:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is like a lovely little
vacation, that show.

03:11.600 --> 03:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Eric, I'm going
to have you tell us about "House
of Cards," because, indeed,

03:15.100 --> 03:18.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Kevin Spacey and Robin
Wright are back as Frank
and Claire Underwood.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let's look at a
little clip of that.

03:20.066 --> 03:24.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROBIN WRIGHT, Actress: Why
did you ask him to leave?

03:24.466 --> 03:29.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEVIN SPACEY, Actor: Because
I just wanted to look in your
eyes one more time before

03:31.633 --> 03:35.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we do this.

03:35.400 --> 03:40.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ROBIN WRIGHT: Francis,
we're doing this.

03:45.533 --> 03:48.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He can't save us.

03:48.133 --> 03:49.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He invented term limits.

03:49.633 --> 03:52.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Eric,
they are still doing it.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are still plotting.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It goes on and on.

03:55.166 --> 03:57.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ERIC DEGGANS: Yes.

03:57.233 --> 04:00.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, I know
am so people have grown
tired of "House of Cards."

04:00.000 --> 04:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, if you are one
of those people, you are not
going to necessarily like the

04:03.400 --> 04:05.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
new season.

04:05.500 --> 04:08.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the new season does have a
lot of political machinations
that I think are sort of the

04:08.566 --> 04:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
heart of the show's appeal.

04:11.100 --> 04:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it also really deals with
the tension and the partnership
between these two very

04:18.033 --> 04:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
singular characters, Frank
Underwood by Kevin Spacey and
Claire Underwood played by Robin

04:21.933 --> 04:23.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Wright.

04:23.900 --> 04:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let's look
ahead at some new programs that
you are looking forward to.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Sonia, start us
off, start us off.

04:28.500 --> 04:31.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What are a couple of
things you really want
to let us know about?

04:31.033 --> 04:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SONIA SARAIYA: Yes, absolutely.

04:33.033 --> 04:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, there is this crazy
little show called "Claws" on
TNT that is debuting next week,

04:37.866 --> 04:39.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I think.

04:39.933 --> 04:44.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it stars Niecy Nash as a
manicurist who kind of also
dabbles in some mob activity,

04:46.866 --> 04:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and it takes place in
Manatee County in Florida.

04:49.433 --> 04:51.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And just everything
about it is so different.

04:51.100 --> 04:54.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It is so different
from most other stuff
you would find on TV.

04:54.133 --> 04:56.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The nails are
amazing, obviously.

04:56.033 --> 04:58.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The fashion, the style
is just so much fun.

04:58.866 --> 05:03.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you get to see these women
who are painting nails also
launder money and maybe commit

05:05.066 --> 05:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a few murders here and there.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is something a little
bit silly and a little
bit fun about it too.

05:09.500 --> 05:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it also really takes a
look at some of the real issues
that affect people in places

05:13.466 --> 05:15.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that don't often make
it to your TV screen.

05:15.566 --> 05:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I'm really looking forward
to see how that goes too.

05:17.633 --> 05:21.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ERIC DEGGANS: Well, you
mentioned at the start
of this segment "GLOW,"
the Netflix series

05:21.333 --> 05:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the -- well,
the gorgeous ladies of
wrestling is what I think.

05:25.866 --> 05:30.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is about the start of
a female wrestling league.

05:32.766 --> 05:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it is really the start about
these sort of lovable losers
and their attempts to sort

05:38.433 --> 05:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of find themselves while
they build this very
fledgling operation,
which is a female-centered

05:43.766 --> 05:46.266 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
wrestling league
in the mid-'80s.

05:46.266 --> 05:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it is a show that
kind of sneaks up on you.

05:49.100 --> 05:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, Marc Maron is
great as the sort of B-movie
director who decides to try

05:56.966 --> 06:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and find another career by
starting this wrestling league.

06:01.333 --> 06:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would compare it a little
more favorably to another
show that you mentioned called

06:04.500 --> 06:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"I'm Dying Up Here," a Showtime
series about young comics
working out of a legendary comic

06:12.800 --> 06:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nightclub in Los Angeles.

06:14.733 --> 06:17.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is fictionalized, but it
also has real people in it.

06:17.133 --> 06:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is based on a book that
is actually about very real
comics like David Letterman and

06:21.233 --> 06:24.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jay Leno and how they
started in Los Angeles.

06:24.066 --> 06:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And because the show has a hard
time walking that line between
fictional characters that

06:28.733 --> 06:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it takes liberties with and
real characters, like Johnny
Carson and Richard Pryor, who

06:32.933 --> 06:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also show up, I think
the show isn't quite as
impactful as it could be.

06:36.100 --> 06:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it is also a show about
lovable losers trying to find
themselves and make it in an

06:43.133 --> 06:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
industry that is really very
difficult, which is Hollywood
in the late 1970s, early '80s.

06:48.900 --> 06:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
one bonus, real quick for me,
if you would, some show that

06:51.433 --> 06:54.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you love, but you
don't think has gotten
enough attention, Eric?

06:54.966 --> 06:57.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ERIC DEGGANS: It's not
in new episodes yet.

06:57.866 --> 06:59.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It will come back.

06:59.266 --> 07:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is a show called
"Throwing Shade" on TV Land.

07:01.433 --> 07:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is a late-night talk show
with a feminist and a gay man
talking about the day's news,

07:08.233 --> 07:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two points of view that are

I thought it was
brilliant when it was on.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it should come back to
new episodes relatively soon.

SONIA SARAIYA: I am going to
go with "The Carmichael Show."

07:19.833 --> 07:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is an NBC sitcom that is
coming into its third season.

07:22.533 --> 07:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is this little show that
has been running on the summer.

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I feel like, every season,
it comes up with even more
topics and even more humor

07:33.933 --> 07:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than -- to tackle in this,
like, fascinating way that --
I just think everyone should be

07:38.133 --> 07:40.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
watching this show.
