WE CERTAINLY HAD LOTS OF OTHER

FACTORS.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ECONOMIC FACTORS CAN BE HUGE,

REQUIRE THEM TO HOLD DOWN A JOB

17:23.209 --> 17:24.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE

19:54.193 --> 19:55.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID SOME THINGS DURING THE

19:55.494 --> 19:56.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTION THAT SOME PEOPLE

19:56.662 --> 19:58.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

EXTREMISTS BUT IT ENDED UP BACK-

20:08.674 --> 20:09.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIRING.

20:09.942 --> 20:11.644 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

LAWYER.

20:22.688 --> 20:24.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TALKING TO PEOPLE ON THE STREET

20:25.724 --> 20:27.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE, PEOPLE WERE TURNED OFF BY

20:27.259 --> 20:28.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FACT THAT INSTEAD OF

20:37.369 --> 20:39.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SADIQ KHAN'S MUSLIM FAITH.

MUSLIM MAYOR.

20:53.185 --> 20:55.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK IT'S SIGNIFICANT IN THAT

20:55.554 --> 20:58.424 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE IS THE FIRST MUSLIM MAYOR IN

20:58.424 --> 21:00.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A MAJOR WESTERN CAPITOL CITY.

21:00.793 --> 21:03.295 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
