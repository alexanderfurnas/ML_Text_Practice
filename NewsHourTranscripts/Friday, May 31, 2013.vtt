THE IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER
HERE IS THAT BY TAKING OVER THE

THE IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER
HERE IS THAT BY TAKING OVER THE
STUDENT LOAN INDUSTRY, THE

17:16.883 --> 17:18.975
HERE IS THAT BY TAKING OVER THE

FINANCING, THAT EASY CREDIT TO
STUDENTS, IT MAKES IT THAT MUCH
EASIER FOR THE STATES TO TURN

17:28.982 --> 17:30.310
STUDENTS, IT MAKES IT THAT MUCH
EASIER FOR THE STATES TO TURN
AROUND AND PASS THE COST OR

17:30.312 --> 17:32.071
EASIER FOR THE STATES TO TURN
AROUND AND PASS THE COST OR
SHIFT THE COST FROM THE STATES
