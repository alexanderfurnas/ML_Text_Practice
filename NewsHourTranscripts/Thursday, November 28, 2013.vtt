20:32.755 --> 20:33.804
THAT CHILD WITH ADEQUATE HEALTH 
CARE.                           
THE QUESTION BECOMES WHEN YOU   

20:33.806 --> 20:35.977
CARE.                           
THE QUESTION BECOMES WHEN YOU   
CREATE A SYSTEM THAT            

20:35.977 --> 20:36.961
THE QUESTION BECOMES WHEN YOU   
CREATE A SYSTEM THAT            
DISINCENTIVIZES PEOPLE FROM     

20:36.963 --> 20:38.080
CREATE A SYSTEM THAT            
DISINCENTIVIZES PEOPLE FROM     
BEING ECONOMICALLY PRODUCTIVE.  

20:38.082 --> 20:39.810
DISINCENTIVIZES PEOPLE FROM     
BEING ECONOMICALLY PRODUCTIVE.  
THAT INCENTIVIZES PEOPLE TO DROP

20:39.810 --> 20:40.760
BEING ECONOMICALLY PRODUCTIVE.  
THAT INCENTIVIZES PEOPLE TO DROP
OUT OF THE WORK FORCE.          

20:40.763 --> 20:42.423
THAT INCENTIVIZES PEOPLE TO DROP
OUT OF THE WORK FORCE.          
THAT INCENTIVIZES THEM TO       

20:42.426 --> 20:43.643
OUT OF THE WORK FORCE.          
THAT INCENTIVIZES THEM TO       
REARRANGE THEIR INCOME TO GAIN  

20:43.647 --> 20:44.866
THAT INCENTIVIZES THEM TO       
REARRANGE THEIR INCOME TO GAIN  
HIGHER AMOUNTS OF GOVERNMENT    

20:44.868 --> 20:46.055
REARRANGE THEIR INCOME TO GAIN  
HIGHER AMOUNTS OF GOVERNMENT    
BENEFITS, THAT'S A SYSTEM WHERE 

20:46.057 --> 20:47.682
HIGHER AMOUNTS OF GOVERNMENT    
BENEFITS, THAT'S A SYSTEM WHERE 
THE AVERAGE TAXPAYER WORKS HARD 

20:47.684 --> 20:50.295
BENEFITS, THAT'S A SYSTEM WHERE 
THE AVERAGE TAXPAYER WORKS HARD 
AND PLAYS BY THE RULES FEELS    

20:50.298 --> 20:51.924
THE AVERAGE TAXPAYER WORKS HARD 
AND PLAYS BY THE RULES FEELS    
LIKE HE'S NOT BEING TREATED     

20:51.925 --> 20:52.603
AND PLAYS BY THE RULES FEELS    
LIKE HE'S NOT BEING TREATED     
FAIRLY.                         

20:52.606 --> 20:53.995
LIKE HE'S NOT BEING TREATED     
FAIRLY.                         
AND THEN A LARGE PART OF THE    

20:53.997 --> 20:55.553
FAIRLY.                         
AND THEN A LARGE PART OF THE    
PROBLEM, AGAIN, IS THE EXISTING 

20:55.556 --> 20:57.320
AND THEN A LARGE PART OF THE    
PROBLEM, AGAIN, IS THE EXISTING 
SYSTEM OF SUBSIDY WHICH IS      

20:57.322 --> 20:58.779
PROBLEM, AGAIN, IS THE EXISTING 
SYSTEM OF SUBSIDY WHICH IS      
OVERWHELMINGLY BENEFITS THE     

20:58.781 --> 21:00.237
SYSTEM OF SUBSIDY WHICH IS      
OVERWHELMINGLY BENEFITS THE     
ELDERLY WHO END UP RECEIVING A  

21:00.239 --> 21:01.799
OVERWHELMINGLY BENEFITS THE     
ELDERLY WHO END UP RECEIVING A  
LOT MORE IN BENEFITS THAN THEY  

21:01.801 --> 21:04.819
ELDERLY WHO END UP RECEIVING A  
LOT MORE IN BENEFITS THAN THEY  
PUT INTO THE SYSTEM IN TERMS OF 

21:04.821 --> 21:06.378
LOT MORE IN BENEFITS THAN THEY  
PUT INTO THE SYSTEM IN TERMS OF 
PAYROLL TAXES AND PREMIUMS.     

21:06.380 --> 21:08.450
PUT INTO THE SYSTEM IN TERMS OF 
PAYROLL TAXES AND PREMIUMS.     
SO THE SYSTEM IN GENERAL IS     

21:08.451 --> 21:10.281
PAYROLL TAXES AND PREMIUMS.     
SO THE SYSTEM IN GENERAL IS     
LARGELY REDISTRIBUTED BUT IN THE

21:10.284 --> 21:12.623
SO THE SYSTEM IN GENERAL IS     
LARGELY REDISTRIBUTED BUT IN THE
WRONG DIRECTION AND IN AN UNFAIR

21:12.625 --> 21:13.539
LARGELY REDISTRIBUTED BUT IN THE
WRONG DIRECTION AND IN AN UNFAIR
DIRECTION.                      

21:13.542 --> 21:14.692
WRONG DIRECTION AND IN AN UNFAIR
DIRECTION.                      
UNFORTUNATELY, AGAIN, THE       

21:14.695 --> 21:16.119
DIRECTION.                      
UNFORTUNATELY, AGAIN, THE       
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT MAKES THESE 

21:16.120 --> 21:16.729
UNFORTUNATELY, AGAIN, THE       
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT MAKES THESE 
PROBLEMS WORSE.                 

21:16.731 --> 21:18.053
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT MAKES THESE 
PROBLEMS WORSE.                 
IT TAKES THE INDIVIDUAL         

21:18.053 --> 21:18.833
PROBLEMS WORSE.                 
IT TAKES THE INDIVIDUAL         
INSURANCE MARKET WHERE PEOPLE   

21:18.835 --> 21:20.461
IT TAKES THE INDIVIDUAL         
INSURANCE MARKET WHERE PEOPLE   
SHOP FOR COVERAGE ON THEIR OWN--

21:20.464 --> 21:23.075
INSURANCE MARKET WHERE PEOPLE   
SHOP FOR COVERAGE ON THEIR OWN--
WHICH IS ALREADY A DISADVANTAGED

21:23.077 --> 21:25.211
SHOP FOR COVERAGE ON THEIR OWN--
WHICH IS ALREADY A DISADVANTAGED
MARKET, WHERE PEOPLE PAY HIGHER 

21:25.213 --> 21:26.502
WHICH IS ALREADY A DISADVANTAGED
MARKET, WHERE PEOPLE PAY HIGHER 
PRICES NET THAN OTHER PEOPLE    

21:26.502 --> 21:27.723
MARKET, WHERE PEOPLE PAY HIGHER 
PRICES NET THAN OTHER PEOPLE    
DO-- AND IT MAKES THAT MARKET   

21:27.724 --> 21:28.571
PRICES NET THAN OTHER PEOPLE    
DO-- AND IT MAKES THAT MARKET   
MORE EXPENSIVE.                 

21:28.573 --> 21:30.472
DO-- AND IT MAKES THAT MARKET   
MORE EXPENSIVE.                 
SO, AGAIN, PEOPLE ARE HEALTHY,  

21:30.472 --> 21:31.897
MORE EXPENSIVE.                 
SO, AGAIN, PEOPLE ARE HEALTHY,  
WHO WORK OUT, TRY TO EAT RIGHT, 

21:31.899 --> 21:33.696
SO, AGAIN, PEOPLE ARE HEALTHY,  
WHO WORK OUT, TRY TO EAT RIGHT, 
WHO STAY HEALTHY BUT SHOP FOR

WHO WORK OUT, TRY TO EAT RIGHT, 
WHO STAY HEALTHY BUT SHOP FOR   
COVERAGE ON THEIR OWN ARE NOW   

21:34.883 --> 21:36.783
WHO STAY HEALTHY BUT SHOP FOR   
COVERAGE ON THEIR OWN ARE NOW   
HAVING TO PAY MORE FOR COVERAGE 

21:36.785 --> 21:38.207
COVERAGE ON THEIR OWN ARE NOW   
HAVING TO PAY MORE FOR COVERAGE 
TO SUBSIDIZE OTHER PEOPLE.      

21:38.209 --> 21:39.905
HAVING TO PAY MORE FOR COVERAGE 
TO SUBSIDIZE OTHER PEOPLE.      
AND, AGAIN, WE MAY SAY THAT WE

ADVANTAGED PEOPLE IN THE SYSTEM 

21:50.392 --> 21:50.695
PROBABLY ARE NOT EXACTLY MOST   
ADVANTAGED PEOPLE IN THE SYSTEM 
TODAY.

RECOGNIZE THERE ARE A LOT OF    
CROSS SUBSIDIES IN THE PRESENT

CROSS SUBSIDIES IN THE PRESENT  
SYSTEM IN REDISTRIBUTION.       

21:59.452 --> 22:00.943
CROSS SUBSIDIES IN THE PRESENT  
SYSTEM IN REDISTRIBUTION.       
IN FACT, BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE 

22:00.944 --> 22:02.367
SYSTEM IN REDISTRIBUTION.       
IN FACT, BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE 
TAX BREAKS FOR HEALTH INSURANCE 

22:02.368 --> 22:03.928
IN FACT, BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE 
TAX BREAKS FOR HEALTH INSURANCE 
ARE STRUCTURED, THE CURRENT     

22:03.930 --> 22:04.980
TAX BREAKS FOR HEALTH INSURANCE 
ARE STRUCTURED, THE CURRENT     
SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY VERY         

22:04.982 --> 22:07.424
ARE STRUCTURED, THE CURRENT     
SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY VERY         
FAVORABLE TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE    

22:07.426 --> 22:08.713
SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY VERY         
FAVORABLE TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE    
INSURANCE INTO HIGHER-FISCAL    

22:08.715 --> 22:09.290
FAVORABLE TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE    
INSURANCE INTO HIGHER-FISCAL    
CLIFF PEOPLE.                   

22:09.292 --> 22:11.563
INSURANCE INTO HIGHER-FISCAL    
CLIFF PEOPLE.                   
SO PART OF THE GOAL OF THE      

22:11.566 --> 22:13.360
CLIFF PEOPLE.                   
SO PART OF THE GOAL OF THE      
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS TO MAKE 

22:13.363 --> 22:14.582
SO PART OF THE GOAL OF THE      
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS TO MAKE 
HELP FOR HEALTH INSURANCE       

22:14.584 --> 22:16.313
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS TO MAKE 
HELP FOR HEALTH INSURANCE       
AVAILABLE TO THOSE WITH LOWER

HELP FOR HEALTH INSURANCE       
AVAILABLE TO THOSE WITH LOWER

22:16.757 --> 22:18.723
AVAILABLE TO THOSE WITH LOWER   
INCOMES.                        
AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAW,  

22:18.725 --> 22:20.182
INCOMES.                        
AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAW,  
IT'S ACTUALLY VERY MUCH         

22:20.184 --> 22:21.200
AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAW,  
IT'S ACTUALLY VERY MUCH         
SUPPORTING THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE 

22:21.202 --> 22:22.931
IT'S ACTUALLY VERY MUCH         
SUPPORTING THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE 
SHOULD BE IN THE WORK FORCE AND 

22:22.933 --> 22:24.967
SUPPORTING THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE 
SHOULD BE IN THE WORK FORCE AND 
RECEIVING THEIR HEALTH BENEFITS 

22:24.968 --> 22:26.866
SHOULD BE IN THE WORK FORCE AND 
RECEIVING THEIR HEALTH BENEFITS 
THROUGH THEIR HARD WORK.        

22:26.869 --> 22:29.073
RECEIVING THEIR HEALTH BENEFITS 
THROUGH THEIR HARD WORK.        
FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS TRYING TO    

22:29.074 --> 22:30.327
THROUGH THEIR HARD WORK.        
FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS TRYING TO    
ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS TO CONTINUE 

22:30.330 --> 22:31.787
FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS TRYING TO    
ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS TO CONTINUE 
TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE,    

22:31.789 --> 22:33.246
ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS TO CONTINUE 
TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE,    
WHICH I THINK OVER THE SLORPL   

22:33.248 --> 22:34.264
TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE,    
WHICH I THINK OVER THE SLORPL   
GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO        

22:34.266 --> 22:34.705
WHICH I THINK OVER THE SLORPL   
GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO        
MAINTAIN.                       

22:34.705 --> 22:37.114
GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO        
MAINTAIN.                       
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY AN APPROACH  

22:37.117 --> 22:39.048
MAINTAIN.                       
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY AN APPROACH  
THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE      

22:39.050 --> 22:39.762
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY AN APPROACH  
THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE      
WORK-ORIENTED SYSTEM WE HAVE    

22:39.763 --> 22:40.065
THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE      
WORK-ORIENTED SYSTEM WE HAVE    
TODAY.                          

22:40.069 --> 22:41.728
WORK-ORIENTED SYSTEM WE HAVE    
TODAY.                          
AND THE ONLY THING IT'S REALLY  

22:41.731 --> 22:44.139
TODAY.                          
AND THE ONLY THING IT'S REALLY  
DOING ON THE SIDE OF BRINGING UP

22:44.141 --> 22:45.598
AND THE ONLY THING IT'S REALLY  
DOING ON THE SIDE OF BRINGING UP
BENEFITS IS TO REALLY TRY TO    

22:45.599 --> 22:47.091
DOING ON THE SIDE OF BRINGING UP
BENEFITS IS TO REALLY TRY TO    
MAKE SURE THAT IT FILLS THOSE

THINK I NEED PUSH BACK AGAINST  
THE POINT THAT AVIK MADE-- IS   

23:04.907 --> 23:05.990
THINK I NEED PUSH BACK AGAINST  
THE POINT THAT AVIK MADE-- IS   
THAT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO  

23:05.993 --> 23:08.942
THE POINT THAT AVIK MADE-- IS   
THAT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO  
ARE LOSING OUT BECAUSE THEY WERE

23:08.945 --> 23:10.944
THAT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO  
ARE LOSING OUT BECAUSE THEY WERE
LOW-RISK PEOPLE WHO WHO HAD VERY

LOW-RISK PEOPLE WHO WHO HAD VERY
INEXPENSIVE INDIVIDUAL POLICIES.

23:11.999 --> 23:14.033
LOW-RISK PEOPLE WHO WHO HAD VERY
