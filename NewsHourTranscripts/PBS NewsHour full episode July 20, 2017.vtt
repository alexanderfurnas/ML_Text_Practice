JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:06.033 --> 00:07.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.466 --> 00:09.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Justice under fire.

00:09.566 --> 00:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the six-month anniversary
of his taking office, President
Trump goes public with his

00:16.533 --> 00:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regret over his choice for
attorney general, while blasting
the FBI and the special counsel

00:21.133 --> 00:23.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
investigating Russia.

00:23.233 --> 00:26.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Then: stepping back in Syria.

00:26.300 --> 00:31.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump ends a covert
operation arming rebel fighters,
a move that eases pressure

00:32.466 --> 00:35.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on both Presidents
Assad and Putin.

00:35.400 --> 00:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plus: Making Sense of fears
over the rise of artificial
intelligence, and how to curb

00:41.300 --> 00:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the future power of computers.

00:43.300 --> 00:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK BOSTROM, Oxford University:
How could you then ensure
that you could control what

00:46.800 --> 00:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those machines do, that they
were beneficial, that they were
aligned with human intentions?

00:51.633 --> 00:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:00.500 --> 01:03.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:03.366 --> 01:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President
Trump sounding off again.

01:11.466 --> 01:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This time, as he observes
the first half-year
mark of his presidency,
he's vented some very

01:18.366 --> 01:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
public criticism of his attorney
general and of other top
Justice Department officials,

01:22.933 --> 01:24.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
past and present.

01:24.300 --> 01:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage.

01:26.233 --> 01:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS, U.S. Attorney
General: Good morning.

01:28.766 --> 01:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Attorney General
Jeff Sessions made it clear
today he's not going anywhere

01:33.166 --> 01:34.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for now.

01:34.166 --> 01:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS: We love this job.

01:35.566 --> 01:37.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We love this department.

01:37.100 --> 01:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I plan to continue to do so,
as long as that is appropriate.

01:40.700 --> 01:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That came after
President Trump's sharp rebuke
of Sessions in a New York Times

01:45.400 --> 01:49.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interview for disqualifying
himself from the
Russia investigation.

01:49.066 --> 01:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: How do you take
a job, and then recuse yourself?

01:52.233 --> 01:53.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If he would have recused
himself before the job, I would
have said, thanks, Jeff, but

01:53.500 --> 01:58.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I can't -- you know, I'm
not going to take you.

01:59.800 --> 02:02.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's extremely unfair,
and that's a mild
word, to the president.

02:02.933 --> 02:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Trump also said
Sessions gave some bad answers
in his Senate confirmation

02:09.900 --> 02:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hearing when he failed
to disclose meetings with
the Russian ambassador.

02:12.833 --> 02:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While the White House said
the president still has
confidence in Sessions,
Mr. Trump's comments

02:17.733 --> 02:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mark a public break from one
of his earliest supporters.

02:21.633 --> 02:26.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It also suggests that
Mr. Trump's anger with
Sessions is still fresh
more than four months

02:27.733 --> 02:30.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
after the attorney
general recused himself.

02:30.366 --> 02:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the 50-minute interview, Mr.
Trump leveled a new allegation
about why fired FBI Director

02:37.766 --> 02:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
James Comey told him
about the uncorroborated
contents of a salacious
dossier before Inauguration

02:43.600 --> 02:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Day: "In my opinion, he
shared it so that I would
think he had it out there."

02:49.266 --> 02:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was asked, "As leverage?"

02:50.533 --> 02:53.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
"Yes, I think so,
in retrospect."

02:53.400 --> 02:58.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president also
appeared to warn special
counsel Robert Mueller to
limit his investigation.

03:00.466 --> 03:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: Mueller was looking
at your finances, your family's
finances unrelated to Russia.

03:01.266 --> 03:02.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that a red line?

03:02.766 --> 03:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: Well, that be a breach
of what his actual charge is?

03:06.866 --> 03:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I would say yes.

03:09.733 --> 03:11.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I would say yes.

03:11.233 --> 03:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Could Mueller's
investigation go there?

03:12.800 --> 03:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Greg Farrell is a Bloomberg
News investigative reporter.

03:15.566 --> 03:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GREG FARRELL, Bloomberg News:
That's what this is all about.

03:17.533 --> 03:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have to look into Trump's
own finances and see if there's
been any unusual benefit

03:24.566 --> 03:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beyond the purchase of
apartments, if there's
anything unusual about all
the business transactions

03:27.266 --> 03:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that have taken place
over many years between
Russian nationals and him.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Although the White
House said the president
doesn't intend to fire Mueller,

03:35.233 --> 03:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his comments raised red flags
for some Senate Judiciary
Committee Democrats.

03:39.933 --> 03:41.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:41.866 --> 03:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D),
Connecticut: What we're watching
is an obstruction of justice

03:45.800 --> 03:50.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
case unfolding in real
time right before our
eyes, the president of
the United States trying

03:50.666 --> 03:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to set limits on a
legitimate investigation.

03:53.866 --> 03:55.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:55.900 --> 03:58.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), Minnesota:
Mueller has the right to
investigate this, and he was

03:58.066 --> 04:02.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
given that authority by
the Justice Department,
and he reports to the
Justice Department and

04:03.966 --> 04:05.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not to the president
of the United States.

04:05.633 --> 04:08.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Committee
Chairman Chuck Grassley
said he wasn't worried.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:10.900 --> 04:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLES GRASSLEY (R), Iowa:
As I know Mueller or 13 years
or how many years he was head

04:15.933 --> 04:18.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the FBI, he's
going to do his job.

04:18.966 --> 04:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's all that matters.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Grassley said Donald
Trump Jr. and former Trump
campaign chairman Paul Manafort

04:25.066 --> 04:30.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have not yet responded to his
request that they testify next
week and that he will subpoena

04:31.066 --> 04:32.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
them if necessary.

04:32.766 --> 04:34.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm John Yang.

04:34.933 --> 04:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will explore
some of the implications of
the president's comments after

04:39.700 --> 04:41.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the news summary.

04:41.733 --> 04:46.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the day's other news:
Russia's official RIA
news agency reported
the U.S. and Russia

04:47.466 --> 04:51.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are talking about creating a
cyber-security working group.

04:51.166 --> 04:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump had raised a
similar idea during the G20
summit, but backed off under

04:55.733 --> 04:57.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
heavy criticism.

04:57.766 --> 05:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This latest report comes amid
multiple U.S. investigations
of Russian meddling in the

05:02.800 --> 05:04.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
2016 election.

05:04.833 --> 05:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Congressional Budget Office
says that a revised Senate
Republican health care bill

05:11.133 --> 05:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leaves as many people uninsured
as a previous version.

05:14.400 --> 05:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The CBO reported today
that, under the bill,
another 22 million Americans
would lose coverage

05:20.400 --> 05:22.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
by 2026.

05:22.366 --> 05:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The measure would also reduce
federal deficits by $420
billion over the coming decade.

05:28.866 --> 05:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So far, GOP leaders still lack
the votes to debate the bill.

05:33.633 --> 05:38.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The health of Senator
John McCain dominated this
day at the U.S. Capitol.

05:38.600 --> 05:43.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Arizona Republican has been
diagnosed with brain cancer,
and doctors removed a tumor,

05:44.766 --> 05:47.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but McCain may need
additional treatment.

05:47.466 --> 05:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The news stunned lawmakers from
both parties, who said they're
hoping for the best for their

05:53.200 --> 05:53.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
longtime colleague.

05:53.966 --> 05:55.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:55.366 --> 05:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PATRICK LEAHY (D), Vermont:
He's a good friend.

05:56.300 --> 05:57.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We agree and we disagree.

05:57.766 --> 05:59.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But he's one of the oldest
-- he keeps his word.

05:59.300 --> 06:03.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I know we will be praying
for him at mass this weekend.

06:08.400 --> 06:09.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:09.833 --> 06:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South
Carolina: He may outlive us all.

06:11.300 --> 06:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't know what -- God only
knows how this thing ends.

06:13.466 --> 06:18.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just ask God for one thing,
that he has a voice and he can
use it as long as possible.

06:20.433 --> 06:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: McCain is 80,
having survived seven years in
a North Vietnamese prison during

06:25.033 --> 06:26.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Vietnam War.

06:26.966 --> 06:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

06:33.566 --> 06:36.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Today, he tweeted: "I
greatly appreciate the
outpouring of support.

06:36.600 --> 06:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Unfortunately, for my sparring
partners in Congress, I will
be back soon, so stand by."

For the first time in the global
AIDS epidemic, more than half
of all those infected with

06:48.100 --> 06:51.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HIV are on drugs
to treat the virus.

06:51.366 --> 06:56.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A United Nations report today
also finds that overall AIDS
deaths have fallen to about half

06:57.333 --> 06:59.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the level of 2005.

06:59.400 --> 07:04.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The disease has killed
35 million people over
the past four decades.

and could be freed in October.

07:13.033 --> 07:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The one-time pro football star
had been jailed for an armed
robbery in 2007 involving his

07:19.000 --> 07:21.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
own sports mementos.

07:21.133 --> 07:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, in a live-streamed
hearing, Simpson, now 70 years
old, pleaded his case to the

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
state parole board.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
O.J.

SIMPSON, Inmate: I
have done my time.

07:31.266 --> 07:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, I have done it
as well and as respectfully
as I think anybody can.

07:34.800 --> 07:39.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think if you talk to the
wardens there, they will tell
you I have been -- I gave them

07:39.533 --> 07:40.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
my word.

07:40.533 --> 07:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I believe in the jury system.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have honored their verdict.

07:44.166 --> 07:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Simpson's
defenders said that his 33-year
sentence was overly harsh, and

07:51.066 --> 07:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he was really being
punished for the murders of his
ex-wife and her friend in 1994.

07:55.766 --> 07:59.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He was acquitted of

that Democrats condemned.

In one online posting, under a
pseudonym, he called abortion
and slavery -- quote -- "the

two greatest tragedies
in our country."

08:20.200 --> 08:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He also linked to articles on a
far-right conspiracy Web site.

ExxonMobil was fined $2 million
today for violating U.S.
sanctions on Russia in 2014.

08:32.400 --> 08:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The oil giant said that it will
challenge the fine in court.

08:35.600 --> 08:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. Treasury Department
says the company showed reckless
disregard for sanctions by

08:42.100 --> 08:45.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
signing deals with
the head of Russia's
state-owned oil company.

of State Rex Tillerson
was ExxonMobil's CEO.

And on Wall Street, the
Dow Jones industrial
average lost about 29

the S&amp;P 500 slipped a fraction.

Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a deeper look at President
Trump's frustration with

09:08.933 --> 09:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his own attorney general; White
House plans to scrap a program
to arm Syrian rebels; how

09:14.266 --> 09:19.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Obama administration tried
to safeguard state election
systems against Russian hacking;

09:20.266 --> 09:25.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and much more.

09:32.933 --> 09:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back to President Trump's
comments to The New
York Times yesterday.

09:36.700 --> 09:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The broadsides aimed at top
officials from the Justice
Department raise questions about

09:41.700 --> 09:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president's
relationship with Attorney
General Jeff Sessions.

09:44.733 --> 09:47.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We are joined by
Walter Dellinger.

09:47.266 --> 09:52.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He served in the Clinton
administration as
assistant attorney general
and acting solicitor

09:52.733 --> 09:53.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
general.

09:53.666 --> 09:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's now in private practice.

09:56.133 --> 10:00.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And former U.S. Ambassador
Douglas Kmiec, he
served as legal counsel
to Presidents Ronald

10:00.900 --> 10:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Reagan and George H.W. Bush.

10:03.033 --> 10:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is now a professor of
constitutional law at Pepperdine
University Law School.

10:09.166 --> 10:10.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we welcome you both
back to the program.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Walter Dellinger, to you first.

10:12.500 --> 10:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How significant are the
president's criticisms of
top officials at Justice?

10:19.100 --> 10:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALTER DELLINGER, Former Acting
Solicitor General: Well, I
think they're unprecedented

10:21.966 --> 10:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in their inappropriateness.

10:24.433 --> 10:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A president shouldn't
be commenting on any
particular criminal
investigation, especially

10:31.000 --> 10:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he should not be commenting one
that involves people that are
close to him, potential family

10:35.633 --> 10:38.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
members.

10:38.166 --> 10:41.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet here the president
said that the attorney
general shouldn't have
recused himself and

10:41.566 --> 10:46.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shouldn't have been appointed
unless he had sort of committed
himself not to recuse, even

10:47.733 --> 10:50.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
though departmental
rules would call for it.

10:50.300 --> 10:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He then criticized the
deputy attorney general
for naming a special
counsel, which was clearly

10:54.900 --> 10:56.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
appropriate.

10:56.933 --> 11:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, finally, he made it clear
that he thought that the special
counsel shouldn't inquire

11:02.533 --> 11:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into any financial dealings
that are outside of the scope
of the Russian campaign.

11:05.933 --> 11:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of those seem to be
inappropriate for a president,
unprecedented, and something

11:12.933 --> 11:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that certainly would send
a chill through the entire
Department of Justice.

11:15.033 --> 11:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Douglas Kmiec,
inappropriate and likely to send
a chill through the department?

11:19.333 --> 11:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOUGLAS KMIEC, Pepperdine
University Law School: I think
everything Walter said is true.

11:23.933 --> 11:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know of two things as a
result of that interview, one,
that he has a very intelligent

11:30.333 --> 11:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and beautiful granddaughter
who he's very proud of.

11:32.666 --> 11:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that, I think, will
humanize the president for
people who read his interview.

11:37.400 --> 11:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we are very troubled by the
nature of how he understands
his role as president and

11:44.533 --> 11:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his ability to intercede into
particular investigations.

11:48.600 --> 11:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, Judy, I think he
comes from the business world,
where his perception is where

11:55.600 --> 11:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lawyers are hired because
they're smart and clever and
they can get the best price on

11:58.533 --> 12:03.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
property and the best
title arrangements and
the best closing date,
and all these things

12:03.233 --> 12:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are subject to negotiation.

12:05.300 --> 12:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what he doesn't realize --
and it becomes plain at every
turn -- is that the Constitution

12:11.733 --> 12:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is designed to separate power,
to specify limits, to make sure
that nobody has the ability

12:17.066 --> 12:20.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to give favoritism
to their friends.

12:20.533 --> 12:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this is just something
he just doesn't grasp.

12:24.066 --> 12:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, he has a very
transactional view of the law,
and it's not the view that the

12:28.766 --> 12:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Department of Justice has
to defend, as a matter
of the Constitution.

12:31.633 --> 12:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Walter
Dellinger, given if that's his
understanding of the role of

12:39.100 --> 12:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Justice Department,
what are the consequences
for the department in
terms of its ability

12:43.033 --> 12:45.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do its job?

12:45.100 --> 12:49.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALTER DELLINGER: Well, I think,
outside the area of the Russia
investigation, the department

12:50.300 --> 12:52.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
will go forward.

12:52.900 --> 12:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the president's
reputation has suffered
enough that his criticism
of Attorney General

12:57.966 --> 13:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sessions is likely only to
enhance the attorney general's
standing within the department.

13:04.233 --> 13:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, I think that, in
terms of this particular
investigation, it will proceed.

13:11.200 --> 13:15.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, Robert Mueller, we
have to remember, is like James
Comey, a lifelong Republican,

13:17.533 --> 13:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
12 years as head of the FBI
under two presidents of two
different political parties.

13:24.200 --> 13:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Robert Mueller is known to
law enforcement throughout the
United States and held in the

13:30.266 --> 13:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
highest possible regard, so
that -- and I certainly agree
with everything Doug Kmiec

13:35.300 --> 13:37.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
said.

13:37.366 --> 13:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the president were to make
a move to try to break through
the department and dismiss

13:43.300 --> 13:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Robert Mueller, I think the
organized bar would find it
incumbent upon itself to take

13:48.300 --> 13:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whatever actions they
could in response to that.

13:50.700 --> 13:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Doug Kmiec,
at this point, the president
is saying he's not going to

13:54.966 --> 13:57.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do that.

13:57.100 --> 14:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he also seemed to send a
shot across the bow in saying
that, if it turns out that Mr.

14:02.900 --> 14:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mueller is looking into his
own financial dealings, any
financial dealings with Russia,

14:07.900 --> 14:11.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which may be the case, that he
would give it another thought.

14:11.366 --> 14:15.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, what does that mean
for Mr. Mueller and his
ability to go forward?

14:15.700 --> 14:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOUGLAS KMIEC: Well, I don't
think Mr. Mueller will be
intimidated whatsoever.

14:19.633 --> 14:24.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As Walter said, he's a straight
shooter, and he is being very
careful and very quiet as

14:25.900 --> 14:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he gathers his
information, as he should.

14:28.000 --> 14:33.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The concern I have is that
the president, if he thinks
that it's only a very narrow

14:35.033 --> 14:39.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
question of whether there was
a contact with Russia, that
is just simply not plausible,

14:41.033 --> 14:45.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because the real concern is
that the president somehow has
gotten himself into a difficult

14:47.766 --> 14:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
position with a foreign country,
where a foreign country has
some information, perhaps with

14:54.733 --> 14:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this disreputable memo that
talks about terrible practices
that the president allegedly was

15:01.200 --> 15:03.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
involved in, perhaps
something else.

15:03.333 --> 15:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To the extent that there is some
undue influence of a foreign
nation of his decision-making,

15:10.733 --> 15:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it strikes every aspect
of his job, foreign policy
and domestic policy.

15:17.133 --> 15:19.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's just simply
not going to be accepted.

15:19.066 --> 15:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so what is going to be
the answer if he objects?

15:22.600 --> 15:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the answer will be
a referral to the House of
Representatives for removal.

15:27.133 --> 15:30.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For
removal of the president?

15:30.466 --> 15:31.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WALTER DELLINGER: The
president, if I could just...

15:31.466 --> 15:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Of the president?

15:33.533 --> 15:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALTER DELLINGER: I think
Doug was saying a referral for
impeachment proceedings, yes.

15:37.533 --> 15:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you know that every step
he's taking are further elements
of what might well be an

15:43.733 --> 15:46.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
obstruction of justice
against the president.

15:46.333 --> 15:51.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The very idea that he
would be trying to direct
the special counsel not
to inquire into certain

15:53.033 --> 15:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
areas involving the president's
own finances, even though the
president has a free speech

15:58.566 --> 16:02.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
right to do that and can
exercise the power of
his presidency, if he
does so for a corrupt

16:04.433 --> 16:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
motive, those can
certainly be elements of
an obstruction of justice.

16:06.566 --> 16:08.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DOUGLAS KMIEC: I think
that that is right.

16:08.900 --> 16:10.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Go ahead.

16:10.966 --> 16:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOUGLAS KMIEC: The one thing
we might worry about that the
president might have helped

16:13.700 --> 16:18.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
himself, in an ironic sort of
way, in the interview, is how
profoundly he misunderstands

16:19.700 --> 16:21.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the law.

16:21.733 --> 16:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In an obstruction of justice
prosecution, an espionage
prosecution, all these things

16:28.500 --> 16:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Title 18 require bad intent
and specific bad intent.

16:35.400 --> 16:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And President Trump's knowledge
of how the law works is so
rudimentary and so different

16:41.033 --> 16:45.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than our history, where
Harry Truman was told
he couldn't seize the
steel mills, where Ronald

16:47.700 --> 16:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reagan was told he couldn't have
a line-item veto unless there
was a constitutional amendment,

16:53.600 --> 16:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where one administration after
another said to the president
of the United States, yes,

16:58.566 --> 17:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you are our chief executive, but
that means you must take care
that the laws are faithfully

17:02.266 --> 17:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
executed, not that you take
care that your objectives are
accomplished irregardless of

17:08.566 --> 17:10.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the law.

17:10.533 --> 17:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I just want
to come back to both of you
again, with less than a minute,

17:13.133 --> 17:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that is to clarify that
you believe that the job of the
attorney general, the deputy

17:20.100 --> 17:24.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attorney general, these other
individuals the president is
criticizing, that they can

17:24.533 --> 17:29.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
do their jobs as usual,
that their authority
is not undermined after
these criticisms from

17:31.000 --> 17:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the president, Walter Dellinger?

17:33.133 --> 17:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALTER DELLINGER: You know,
Judy, I don't, because I don't
think people take criticisms

17:40.066 --> 17:43.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by Donald Trump the way
they would criticism
with any other president.

17:43.500 --> 17:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think that affects the
attorney general's standing
within the department.

17:48.133 --> 17:50.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DOUGLAS KMIEC: I agree.

17:50.600 --> 17:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I also think that, as
Walter said, Jeff Sessions,
to the extent that he's
putting his nose down

17:57.866 --> 18:02.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the grindstone and getting
down to work and accomplishing
the other -- the vast number

18:04.900 --> 18:08.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of other tasks that
the department handles,
will be admired by those
people in the Justice

18:10.233 --> 18:13.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Department, as it should.

18:13.366 --> 18:15.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think Jeff Sessions
made a very important...

18:15.800 --> 18:17.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

18:17.266 --> 18:18.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WALTER DELLINGER: You know,
I think he shouldn't...

18:18.166 --> 18:20.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Go ahead.

18:20.566 --> 18:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOUGLAS KMIEC: Go ahead, Walter.

18:22.200 --> 18:24.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WALTER DELLINGER: I was
saying, Doug, I think
he shouldn't resign.

18:24.266 --> 18:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think he shouldn't resign,
because that's exactly what
the president wants him to do,

18:27.833 --> 18:32.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
so he can install some
non-recused loyalist
in the department.

18:32.100 --> 18:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOUGLAS KMIEC: Exactly right.

18:34.133 --> 18:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Jeff Sessions, however
awkward it would be to continue
his service, is doing a service

18:40.166 --> 18:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to maintain the institution
of the Department of Justice.

18:43.333 --> 18:44.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that is what's important.

18:44.933 --> 18:49.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Douglas
Kmiec, Walter Dellinger,
we thank you both.

18:52.133 --> 18:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A CIA program to aid Syrian
rebels fighting the regime of
Bashar al-Assad will soon be

19:06.400 --> 19:09.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ended by the Trump
administration.

19:09.100 --> 19:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has that.

19:11.100 --> 19:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It was a
covert program, started in
2013 under President Obama, in

19:15.866 --> 19:18.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the hopes of forcing
Assad from power.

19:18.433 --> 19:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The news that President Trump
would end the operation was
first reported by The Washington

19:22.333 --> 19:24.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Post yesterday.

19:24.400 --> 19:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joining me now for what impact
this will have on the conflict
in Syria is Faysal Itani,

19:28.200 --> 19:30.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a senior fellow at
the Atlantic Council.

19:30.166 --> 19:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, let's talk about
what this means, what the
strategy is behind this move.

19:33.166 --> 19:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FAYSAL ITANI, Atlantic Council's
Rafik Hariri Center for the
Middle East: Well, this is

19:35.133 --> 19:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something -- this is a campaign,
a strategy that's actually
been rolled back for a long

19:39.966 --> 19:42.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

19:42.033 --> 19:44.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Initially, it started as --
under the Obama administration
as a tool to put pressure on

19:44.666 --> 19:48.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the Assad regime,
military pressure, to
get them to negotiate.

19:48.100 --> 19:50.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That didn't work.

19:50.133 --> 19:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When the Russians came into
Syria in 2015, the stakes
became really too high and the

19:54.333 --> 19:58.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
risks became too high for
the administration to keep on
pushing with a proxy war program

19:58.700 --> 20:00.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like this.

20:00.666 --> 20:03.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this is basically a rollback
of that, and an indication
that we have entered a whole

20:03.366 --> 20:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
different phase of the war.

20:05.733 --> 20:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We have
seen the Trump administration
repeatedly say, our
focus is on defeating

20:08.766 --> 20:10.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ISIS.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Does this move help in
the fight against ISIS?

20:12.733 --> 20:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FAYSAL ITANI: Not so much.

20:15.100 --> 20:18.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It doesn't have any
immediate benefit on
the fight against ISIS.

20:18.100 --> 20:21.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think what the president
was saying and thinking was
that we don't want anything

20:21.733 --> 20:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to potentially distract or
sort of siphon resources away
from the fight against ISIS,

20:27.600 --> 20:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so why are we doing this thing?

20:29.066 --> 20:30.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why do we have this program?

20:30.766 --> 20:31.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're fighting Assad.

20:31.766 --> 20:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why should we be fighting Assad?

20:34.366 --> 20:37.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think it's really a
question just eliminating
other agendas and
keeping one agenda alone.

20:37.366 --> 20:42.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I do think that
some of these people who
have been on the U.S.
payroll for a long time,

20:44.400 --> 20:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they're armed, they will be
deployed against jihadi groups
in Southern Syria, not all of

20:48.166 --> 20:50.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
them, but some of them.

20:50.266 --> 20:53.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
rebels that are affected
by this particular
operation seem to be in

20:53.100 --> 20:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the area that is right
now holding tentatively
under a cease-fire, right?

20:57.233 --> 20:59.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FAYSAL ITANI: Yes, absolutely.

20:59.200 --> 21:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it's no coincidence
that this cease-fire relies
on Russian goodwill and

21:05.666 --> 21:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian intention of actually
restraining the regime for
breaking that cease-fire.

21:09.900 --> 21:14.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And in return for that,
I think you see part
of the calculation is
that we're offering

21:15.500 --> 21:17.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this concession.

21:17.566 --> 21:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're showing the Russians that
we are serious about no longer
escalating militarily against

21:20.033 --> 21:21.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the regime.

21:21.533 --> 21:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this is a sign of our
goodwill and our commitment.

21:24.066 --> 21:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Has
the strategy of funding,
at least in terms of
arms, these rebel groups,

21:29.333 --> 21:31.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has that worked?

21:31.366 --> 21:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FAYSAL ITANI: No, because
it was never of a sufficient
scale or magnitude or quality

21:37.233 --> 21:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that would really present a
strategic threat to the regime,
sufficient military threat

21:39.900 --> 21:42.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the regime.

21:42.066 --> 21:45.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The regime understood
that fairly well, when
we got slightly -- a
couple of years into

21:45.433 --> 21:47.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the conflict, really.

21:47.500 --> 21:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the point is that it was
never meant to put so much
pressure on the regime that it

21:51.800 --> 21:54.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
would collapse.

21:54.266 --> 21:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was meant to sort
of put just enough that
it would bring Bashar
al-Assad to the negotiating

21:56.933 --> 21:58.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
table.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I think, obviously,
that wasn't going to
happen, and it didn't.

22:00.166 --> 22:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Does
this change that equation?

22:02.266 --> 22:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is Bashar al-Assad happier
now that there is officially
a de-escalation, at least in

22:08.633 --> 22:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
terms of support of arms against
the people that he's against?

22:11.333 --> 22:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FAYSAL ITANI: I think this is
definitely good news to him.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's something, though, that
had been happening for a while.

22:16.100 --> 22:19.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But now that it's about
to become -- I think
this is why there is a
leak -- going to become

22:19.966 --> 22:24.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
official U.S. policy, then, yes,
he certainly knows that he's
in the clear, insofar as there

22:26.400 --> 22:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is a U.S. intention to pose
a military threat to him.

22:28.500 --> 22:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And without the United States
backing one or more of these
groups in Syria, there really

22:32.933 --> 22:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
isn't any way to pose a serious
threat to the regime, given
that Russia and Iran are

22:38.666 --> 22:40.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fighting on his side.

22:40.133 --> 22:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There's the
political dimension to it.

22:42.233 --> 22:44.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Senate Armed Services
Committee, John McCain said,
even while he's recuperating

22:44.800 --> 22:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - I want to read part of
his quote -- "If these reports
are true, the administration

22:48.000 --> 22:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is playing right into the
hands of Vladimir Putin.

22:50.933 --> 22:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Making any concession to Russia,
absent a broader strategy
for Syria, is irresponsible

22:55.600 --> 22:57.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and shortsighted."

22:57.566 --> 23:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FAYSAL ITANI: I think what
Senator McCain is really saying
is, he doesn't agree with

23:01.633 --> 23:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the policy of leaving Bashar
al-Assad alone, and focusing
only on ISIS, and letting the

23:06.533 --> 23:09.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Russians dictate the way
that that plays out in
terms of cease-fires.

23:09.833 --> 23:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you decided that that's
the course, this is not
really a concession.

23:13.866 --> 23:16.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is actually
what our strategy is.

23:16.133 --> 23:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's only a concession if what
our intention is, is actually
to wrest some sort of other

23:20.966 --> 23:22.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
concession out of the
regime or out of Russia.

23:22.900 --> 23:25.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I don't think
that is the case.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we're really just kind
of hoping that the Russians
will deliver on the cease-fire

23:28.100 --> 23:29.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agreements.

23:29.300 --> 23:30.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, well, let's
see if that happens.

23:30.466 --> 23:33.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm very skeptical,
but let's see.

23:33.033 --> 23:37.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Well,
what about the aggressions
that have happened on
the parts of the Assad

23:37.066 --> 23:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regime and the Russians, in
sometimes their indiscriminate
bombing of innocent civilians

23:41.333 --> 23:43.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and so forth?

23:43.333 --> 23:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we decide to de-escalate
this, does this decrease
our voice at the table?

23:49.500 --> 23:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FAYSAL ITANI: Yes, I think
our voice at the table started
decreasing when we failed to

23:53.633 --> 23:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
respond to chemical weapons
attacks on August 2013, failed
to respond to the Russian entry

23:57.800 --> 23:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the subsequent escalation.

23:59.866 --> 24:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think all the parties really
on the other side have already
sort of taken measure of

24:04.133 --> 24:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
us and understood what our
commitments are and what they
aren't, and that we don't have

24:08.133 --> 24:12.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the stomach for a fight
against Bashar al-Assad
or even the stomach for
sort of stopping these

24:12.266 --> 24:14.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sort of atrocities that
you're talking about.

24:14.433 --> 24:17.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, these will continue until
they're no longer needed.

24:17.566 --> 24:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then you will see one
opposition area after the other
come under regime control.

24:22.233 --> 24:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, definitely, yes,
there is nothing standing
in the way anymore in,
for example, Southern

24:27.700 --> 24:29.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Syria.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Faysal Itani, thanks so much.

24:31.066 --> 24:36.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FAYSAL ITANI: Thank you.

24:38.133 --> 24:42.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We turn back
to the Russia investigations
and the issue at their core:

24:44.933 --> 24:48.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that government's meddling
in the 2016 U.S. election.

24:48.566 --> 24:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How Russian officials made
it happen is the focus of at
least three official probes in

24:55.566 --> 24:58.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Washington, but information
about what they did and didn't
do to our voting process and

25:00.333 --> 25:03.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to our confidence in
our election system has
come in fits and starts.

25:03.533 --> 25:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A new cover story for "TIME"
magazine takes a deep dive into
what we know now, connecting

25:09.700 --> 25:13.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the dots of how, why
and how far they went.

25:13.600 --> 25:18.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's titled "Inside the
Secret Plan to Stop Vladimir
Putin's U.S. Election Plot."

25:20.366 --> 25:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the author, "TIME"
magazine's Massimo Calabresi,
is here with me now.

25:25.166 --> 25:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to the program, Massimo.

25:27.266 --> 25:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what you have reported in
this issue of "TIME" is what
we don't know before, how far

25:33.266 --> 25:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the federal government had
gone last year to prevent
damage by the Russians.

25:36.233 --> 25:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MASSIMO CALABRESI, "TIME":
In the days leading up
to the election, the top
federal cyber-security

25:43.233 --> 25:47.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
officials realized that,
for the efforts they
had taken throughout
the election, our voting

25:49.800 --> 25:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
system was still vulnerable, not
to interference with the actual
vote count, but to undermining

25:57.566 --> 26:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the credibility of the vote,
the integrity of the vote,
which is, of course, the purpose

26:01.666 --> 26:06.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of voting to begin with,
to reach a consensus
that the democratic
will of the people has

26:06.033 --> 26:08.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been expressed.

26:08.033 --> 26:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what
was it that the government
was prepared to do?

26:10.300 --> 26:14.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MASSIMO CALABRESI: Well, they
enumerated in this 15-page
plan some extraordinary steps.

26:14.466 --> 26:19.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They stipulated at the beginning
that, under most circumstances,
the federal government

26:21.900 --> 26:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would defer to the states
in a cyber-incident,
but in a particularly
bad one, for example,

26:26.566 --> 26:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one that halted voting at a
voting place, they would go
so far as to send armed law

26:32.066 --> 26:34.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
enforcement, federal
law enforcement agents
to polling places.

26:34.633 --> 26:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were prepared to
deploy active and reserve
military forces in case
of a massive incident.

26:42.533 --> 26:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they also prepared for
counterpropaganda efforts in the
wake of the vote, should false

26:50.133 --> 26:53.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
information be spread to try
and undermine its credibility.

26:53.000 --> 26:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what had they
seen that caused them to go to
this length before election?

27:00.133 --> 27:04.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MASSIMO CALABRESI: So,
initially, they saw
one or two states back
in the summer where

27:06.633 --> 27:10.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Russians had broken
into the voter registration
rolls and meddled around.

27:14.166 --> 27:19.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the more they looked,
the more they found other
states had been compromised.

27:20.566 --> 27:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they didn't quite know
what the Russians were doing.

27:22.600 --> 27:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Initially, they thought they
might be able to swing the
vote, but they soon concluded

27:26.433 --> 27:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that actual meddling with
the vote count wasn't
going to be possible.

27:30.800 --> 27:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they decided that what
the Russians could do was take
certain actions that would call

27:37.733 --> 27:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into question whether it
had been free and fair, like
interfering with the reporting

27:43.966 --> 27:47.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
systems on election
night, meddling with
voter rolls throughout
the country in ways that

27:49.766 --> 27:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would cause long lines
or, in swing states, might
cause an extraordinary
number of provisional

27:54.066 --> 27:54.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ballots to be cast.

27:54.966 --> 27:57.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

27:57.533 --> 27:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Excuse me,
but there were instances
where -- you have
reported, because you have

27:59.900 --> 28:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
written a number of
stories about this, were in
California, for example.

28:03.333 --> 28:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was an instance where a
number of people reported they
had trouble voting because of

28:07.666 --> 28:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how their identity had been
changed in voter registration.

28:10.233 --> 28:12.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MASSIMO CALABRESI:
That's absolutely right.

28:12.433 --> 28:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On primary day in California
in June 2016, the local DA
started getting a bench of calls

28:19.400 --> 28:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from voters saying that they
were not being allowed to vote
because their voter registration

28:23.100 --> 28:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
information had been changed
in the statewide voter
registration database.

28:30.166 --> 28:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The hackers remain unknown in
that case because the state of
California doesn't record the

28:34.800 --> 28:37.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I.P. addresses of computers
that make changes.

28:37.766 --> 28:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, looking back, the federal
officials who were in charge
of defending the vote, in the

28:42.733 --> 28:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
context of the other Russian
intrusions, concluded
that this might have
been a test run by the

28:49.700 --> 28:53.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russians to show what kind
of disruption they could
cause on Election Day.

28:53.466 --> 28:58.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And indeed, in this county
in California, the voters
became quite agitated, and the

28:59.333 --> 29:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
mystery actually fed the doubt.

29:01.433 --> 29:05.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I want
to press you on this, because
you're saying that the Russians

29:05.666 --> 29:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were not able -- they weren't
worried that the Russians were
going to be able to change

29:08.533 --> 29:09.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the final vote count.

29:09.566 --> 29:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MASSIMO CALABRESI: That's right.

29:11.666 --> 29:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But were able
to get in, in a remarkable
way, into state voter files,

29:15.533 --> 29:17.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into election systems.

29:17.600 --> 29:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MASSIMO CALABRESI: And this is
what's so important, because the
Russians had over time become

29:21.400 --> 29:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bolder and bolder about their
intrusions, and had not tried
to hide the fact that they

29:26.100 --> 29:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
were breaking into systems.

29:28.400 --> 29:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Russians are very
skilled cyber-actors, among
the best in the world.

29:31.533 --> 29:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the fact they were remaining
in the open was a clue to the
larger purpose of the operation.

29:38.766 --> 29:41.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it's crucial to
keep this in mind.

29:41.200 --> 29:46.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The first and primary goal of
the Russian operation against
the election was to undermine

29:47.833 --> 29:51.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
American faith in the
democratic process, the
first and abiding goal.

29:53.733 --> 29:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every secondary goal that came
had to first fulfill undermining
our faith in the democratic

29:58.133 --> 30:00.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
process.

30:00.200 --> 30:03.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so what the cyber-security
officials at the White House
and across government at the

30:03.233 --> 30:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FBI and intelligence community
concluded was that these
intrusions were less about the

30:10.266 --> 30:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
specific effect that they
could have than they were on
undermining the faith of the

30:15.066 --> 30:17.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Americans in
elections generally.

30:17.100 --> 30:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it appears
that they succeeded, at
least in part, in doing that.

30:20.200 --> 30:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you report that there is
every reason to think that
they may still be engaged in

30:25.666 --> 30:27.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have an election, governors
election coming up, this year.

30:28.133 --> 30:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MASSIMO CALABRESI: That's right.

30:28.800 --> 30:30.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's right.

30:30.500 --> 30:31.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All
of our congressional
elections next year.

30:31.433 --> 30:32.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MASSIMO CALABRESI: That's right.

30:32.100 --> 30:34.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's right.

30:34.133 --> 30:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The crucial thing here is,
this is an attack by Russia on
America, not on a particular

30:39.133 --> 30:40.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
candidate or on a
particular party.

30:40.700 --> 30:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Their interests are in weakening
the U.S. at home and abroad.

30:47.633 --> 30:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why it's so important
now that we take steps to
try and secure our election,

30:53.400 --> 30:58.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so that this kind of exercise,
propaganda, influence operation
designed to undermine

31:00.200 --> 31:03.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our faith in the democratic
process here can't
succeed in the future.

31:03.266 --> 31:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And how high
up in the Russian government
does the direction of this go?

31:08.033 --> 31:12.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know that at one point
President Obama was reportedly
telling Vladimir Putin, cut

31:12.700 --> 31:13.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it out.

31:13.933 --> 31:16.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MASSIMO CALABRESI:
Well, that's right.

31:16.066 --> 31:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama famously confronted him
in that photograph of the two
staring at each other icily in

31:19.300 --> 31:22.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
China at a meeting and
told him to cut it out.

31:22.133 --> 31:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The intelligence community
reported publicly in
their assessment in
January that the operation

31:28.300 --> 31:29.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
had been approved at
the highest level.

31:29.666 --> 31:31.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And my sources tell
me that means Putin.

31:31.866 --> 31:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it doesn't
get any higher than that.

31:34.466 --> 31:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MASSIMO CALABRESI: That's right.

31:36.066 --> 31:39.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
it's a remarkable
collection of stories.

31:39.066 --> 31:40.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Congratulations on
all this reporting.

31:40.466 --> 31:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I know you're
continuing to work on it.

31:42.400 --> 31:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MASSIMO CALABRESI: Thank you.

31:43.833 --> 31:45.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Massimo Calabresi
with "TIME," thank you.

31:45.066 --> 31:48.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MASSIMO CALABRESI:
Thanks for having me.

31:48.666 --> 31:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: the
fears around the development
of artificial intelligence.

32:01.366 --> 32:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Computer superintelligence is
a long, long way from the stuff
of sci-fi movies, but several

32:08.333 --> 32:11.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
high-profile leaders
and thinkers have been
worrying quite publicly
about what they see

32:12.500 --> 32:14.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as the risks to come.

32:14.133 --> 32:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman, explores that.

32:17.333 --> 32:19.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's part of his weekly
series, Making Sense.

32:19.533 --> 32:24.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: I want to talk to you
about the greatest scientific
event in the history of man.

32:25.766 --> 32:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTOR: Are you building an A.I.?

32:27.066 --> 32:28.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: A.I.,
artificial intelligence.

32:28.300 --> 32:30.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ACTRESS: Do you think I
might be switched off?

32:30.100 --> 32:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTOR: It's not up to me.

32:31.400 --> 32:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTRESS: Why is it up to anyone?

32:34.700 --> 32:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Some version of
this scenario has had prominent
tech luminaries and scientists

32:40.433 --> 32:42.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
worried for years.

32:42.233 --> 32:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In 2014, cosmologist Stephen
Hawking told the BBC:

32:45.733 --> 32:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN HAWKING, Scientist
(through computer voice):
I think the development
of full artificial

32:49.000 --> 32:52.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
intelligence could spell
the end of the human race.

32:52.600 --> 32:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And just this
week, Tesla and SpaceX
entrepreneur Elon Musk
told the ®MDNMational

32:58.866 --> 33:01.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Governors Association:

33:01.333 --> 33:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELON MUSK, CEO, Tesla
Motors: A.I. is a
fundamental existential
risk for human civilization.

33:04.700 --> 33:07.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I don't think people
fully appreciate that.

33:07.266 --> 33:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: OK, but
what's the economics angle?

33:10.000 --> 33:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, at Oxford University's
Future of Humanity Institute,
founding director Nick Bostrom

33:17.000 --> 33:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leads a team trying to figure
out how best to invest in,
well, the future of humanity.

33:22.833 --> 33:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK BOSTROM, Oxford University:
We are in this very peculiar
situation of looking back

33:25.333 --> 33:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the history of our species,
100,000 years old, and now
finding ourselves just before

33:32.233 --> 33:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the threshold to what looks
like it will be this transition
to some post-human era of

33:35.500 --> 33:39.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
superintelligence that
can colonize the universe,
and then maybe last
for billions of years.

33:39.033 --> 33:43.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Philosopher Bostrom
has been perhaps the most
prominent thinker about the

33:43.266 --> 33:48.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
benefits and dangers
to humanity of what he
calls superintelligence
for many years.

33:50.233 --> 33:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK BOSTROM: Once there is
superintelligence, the fate of
humanity may depend on what that

33:52.700 --> 33:55.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
superintelligence does.

33:55.233 --> 33:58.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: There are
plenty of ways to invest in
humanity, he says, giving
money to anti-disease

33:58.666 --> 34:01.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
charities, for example.

34:01.166 --> 34:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Bostrom thinks
longer-term, about investing
to lessen existential
risks, those that threaten

34:06.966 --> 34:09.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to wipe out the human
species entirely.

34:09.733 --> 34:11.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Global warming might be one.

34:11.566 --> 34:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But plenty of other people are
worrying about that, he says.

34:15.033 --> 34:17.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, he thinks about other risks.

34:17.166 --> 34:19.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What are the greatest
of those risks?

34:19.633 --> 34:23.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK BOSTROM: The
greatest existential
risks arise from certain
anticipated technological

34:26.200 --> 34:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
breakthroughs that we
might make, in particular,
machine superintelligence,
nanotechnology,

34:34.100 --> 34:39.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and synthetic biology,
fundamentally because we
don't have the ability
to uninvent anything

34:41.233 --> 34:43.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that we invent.

34:43.300 --> 34:47.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We don't, as a human
civilization, have the
ability to put the genie
back into the bottle.

34:47.133 --> 34:50.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Once something has been
published, then we are
stuck with that knowledge.

34:50.866 --> 34:54.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: So Bostrom
wants money invested
in how to manage A.I.

34:54.666 --> 34:59.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK BOSTROM: Specifically
on the question, if and when
in the future you could build

34:59.266 --> 35:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
machines that were really
smart, maybe superintelligent,
smarter than humans, how
could you then ensure

35:06.200 --> 35:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that you could control what
those machines do, that they
were beneficial, that they were

35:08.900 --> 35:11.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
aligned with human intentions?

35:11.000 --> 35:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: How likely is it
that machines would develop
basically a mind of their own,

35:16.700 --> 35:18.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which is what you're
saying, right?

35:18.666 --> 35:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK BOSTROM: I do think
that advanced A.I., including
superintelligence, is a sort of

35:24.833 --> 35:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
portal through which
humanity will have passage,
assuming we don't destroy
ourselves prematurely

35:30.866 --> 35:32.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in some other way.

35:32.300 --> 35:36.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Right now, the human
brain is where it's at.

35:36.233 --> 35:40.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the source of almost all
of the technologies we have.

35:40.166 --> 35:41.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: I'm
relieved to hear that.

35:41.766 --> 35:43.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

35:43.266 --> 35:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK BOSTROM: And the complex
social organization we have.

35:44.733 --> 35:46.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Right.

35:46.866 --> 35:48.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NICK BOSTROM: It's why
the modern condition is
so different from the
way that the chimpanzees

35:48.600 --> 35:50.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
live.

35:50.600 --> 35:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's all through the
human brain's ability to
discover and communicate.

35:54.366 --> 35:59.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there is no reason to
think that human intelligence
is anywhere near the greatest

36:01.500 --> 36:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
possible level of intelligence
that could exist, that we are
sort of the smartest possible

36:06.733 --> 36:08.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
species.

36:08.800 --> 36:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, rather, that we are
the stupidest possible species
that is capable of creating

36:13.800 --> 36:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
technological civilization.

36:15.900 --> 36:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And capable of
creating technology that has
begun to surpass us, first

36:26.033 --> 36:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in chess, then in "Jeopardy,"
now in the supposedly impossible
game for a machine to win, Go.

36:44.633 --> 36:49.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is just task-oriented
software, some have argued,
and not really intelligence at

36:49.566 --> 36:51.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
all.

36:51.600 --> 36:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Moreover, whatever you call
it, there will be enormous
benefits, says Bostrom.

36:54.600 --> 36:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the other hand, if we
approach real intelligence,
it could also become a threat.

37:01.733 --> 37:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Think of "Ex Machina" or "The
Matrix" or Elon Musk's fantasy
fear this week about advanced

37:22.700 --> 37:24.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
A.I.

37:24.733 --> 37:27.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELON MUSK: Well, it could start
a war by create - - by doing
fake news and spoofing e-mail

37:27.766 --> 37:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
accounts and fake press
releases, and just by, you
know, manipulating information.

37:33.900 --> 37:36.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The pen is mightier
than the sword.

37:36.066 --> 37:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, this is going
to be a cat-and-mouse game
between us and the intelligence?

37:42.233 --> 37:44.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NICK BOSTROM: That
would be one model.

37:44.233 --> 37:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One line of attack is to try to
leverage the A.I.'s intelligence
to learn what it is that

37:50.333 --> 37:52.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we value and what
we want it to do.

37:52.300 --> 37:57.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In order to protect
ourselves from what could
be a truly existential risk.

37:59.200 --> 38:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, how do you get the greatest
good for the greatest number
of present and future humans

38:02.033 --> 38:04.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
beings?

38:04.133 --> 38:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It might be to invest now
in controlling the evolution
of artificial intelligence.

38:07.866 --> 38:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this
is economics correspondent
Paul Solman, reporting from

38:12.466 --> 38:17.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Oxford, England.

38:19.500 --> 38:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we turn
to the grinding civil war in
Yemen, which has also become

38:26.866 --> 38:30.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a proxy conflict
between neighboring
Saudi Arabia and Iran.

38:30.966 --> 38:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A two-and-a-half-year bombing
campaign has killed thousands.

38:34.866 --> 38:38.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Vast swathes of the
country lie devastated.

38:38.233 --> 38:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Compounding the horror, Yemen
is on the brink of famine.

38:41.500 --> 38:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are critical shortages
of aid and medical care,
and now an outbreak of
cholera is spreading.

38:48.400 --> 38:52.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The country has been essentially
closed to journalists for
months, but filmmaker Martin

38:54.733 --> 38:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Smith and his team from
"Frontline" were able to
gain access to Yemen in May.

38:59.766 --> 39:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Frontline" has a short
film on its Web site
documenting what they saw.

39:02.066 --> 39:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here is an excerpt, beginning
in the capital, Sanaa.

39:06.500 --> 39:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SMITH: It's not just
the jets you hear overhead, or
the buildings that are bombed,

39:13.533 --> 39:17.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or the airport
that's demolished.

39:17.233 --> 39:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the knock-on effects of
the war on infrastructure.

39:21.433 --> 39:26.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When we came into town,
what struck me right
away was the amount of
garbage on the streets.

39:29.033 --> 39:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The garbage workers hadn't
been paid in eight months.

39:33.800 --> 39:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The rains came, washing through
the garbage, bacteria carried
into the water supply, people

39:40.800 --> 39:43.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
drinking bad water.

39:43.466 --> 39:48.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they were hit by
a cholera epidemic.

39:52.400 --> 39:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cholera simply dehydrates you
quickly, so that anything you
ingest, any water you drink

39:59.333 --> 40:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or food you eat just completely
passes through your system,
and you get no nutrients out

40:02.900 --> 40:05.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of it.

40:05.466 --> 40:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: She is very tired
because of the exhaustion
from the electrolyte
imbalance that she has.

40:10.333 --> 40:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She can't control herself now
until she gets enough fluid.

40:17.733 --> 40:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SMITH: The World Health
Organization is saying that
there are over 300,000 cases

40:25.300 --> 40:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of cholera; 1,600 people have
died, many of them children.

40:31.166 --> 40:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the numbers keep going up.

40:33.733 --> 40:38.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The hospital we visited, they
were already beyond capacity.

40:38.433 --> 40:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The nurses and doctors were
suffering from a lack of
medicines and equipment.

40:45.333 --> 40:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they were there working,
in spite the fact that
they hadn't been paid.

40:48.966 --> 40:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: We don't get salary.

40:51.533 --> 40:55.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Last salary I got was
in September only.

40:55.633 --> 40:57.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If I will not work,
then they will die.

40:57.933 --> 41:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And maybe tomorrow, I will
be sick, and nobody will
see me because of no salary.

41:06.033 --> 41:11.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARTIN SMITH: People
often ask why the Saudis
are bombing Yemen.

41:15.866 --> 41:18.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a question for the Saudis.

41:18.000 --> 41:22.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will tell you they're
fighting against the rebel
group that's trying to take over

41:22.466 --> 41:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the country, who are backed
by their archrival, Iran.

41:29.466 --> 41:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yet, in the time I was there,
it was hard to see really
what the Iranians were doing.

41:34.833 --> 41:39.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But the impact of the
Saudi-led coalition
bombing was very clear.

41:41.400 --> 41:45.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Parts of the country
have been isolated of
bomb strikes on bridges.

41:46.566 --> 41:48.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
People on the ground
in Yemen are suffering.

41:48.066 --> 41:53.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're caught in the
crossfire of this war.

41:54.233 --> 41:57.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In Hajjah, we went
to a hospital.

41:57.566 --> 42:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I met a nurse there who
showed me pictures she'd taken
a day or two before of a young

42:03.766 --> 42:08.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
boy who came in severely
malnourished, and died.

42:08.066 --> 42:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
Of course one gets very upset.

42:12.566 --> 42:15.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
All of us here do.

42:15.500 --> 42:17.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We do our job, and
we love the child.

42:17.966 --> 42:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And, in the end, they pass away.

42:22.233 --> 42:24.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's hard.

42:24.333 --> 42:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SMITH: She then was
called away to go take care
of a new severe malnutrition

42:29.400 --> 42:30.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
patient.

42:30.633 --> 42:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A mother came in with her child.

42:33.533 --> 42:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was a little girl named
Aline, a seventh-month-old baby.

42:40.333 --> 42:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
For sure, it's a
consequence of the war.

42:48.600 --> 42:50.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The war is behind
the malnourishment.

42:50.633 --> 42:52.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it is only getting worse.

42:52.033 --> 42:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The cases have increased.

42:53.900 --> 42:55.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is a food shortage.

42:55.466 --> 42:57.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How are your living
conditions at home?

42:57.766 --> 43:02.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN (through
translator): Terrible.

43:02.300 --> 43:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SMITH: There were always
malnutrition cases in Yemen,
but the nurse told us that

43:10.366 --> 43:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the number of cases had more
than doubled since the war.

43:18.400 --> 43:22.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And maybe an hour later,
another mother came
in with her daughter.

43:22.433 --> 43:23.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Ruqayah her name.

43:23.500 --> 43:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was a 5-year-old girl.

43:30.100 --> 43:33.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Ruqayah had come from
an IDP, an internally
displaced persons camp.

43:33.333 --> 43:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's quite a ways away up
near the Saudi border, traveled
several hours, because the

43:39.500 --> 43:42.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hospital up near
her had been bombed.

43:42.033 --> 43:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): As
a result of these catastrophes,
they don't have the means

43:48.566 --> 43:52.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to travel from their
areas, which are usually
very far from ours.

43:52.966 --> 43:54.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So they wait.

43:54.933 --> 43:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That was an
excerpt of "Inside Yemen," a
"Frontline" short film by Martin

44:01.500 --> 44:03.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Smith.

44:03.600 --> 44:06.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more on the conflict and
the people caught in between,
we're joined from New York by

44:06.700 --> 44:08.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
David Miliband.

44:08.666 --> 44:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is president and CEO of the
International Rescue Committee,
a global aid agency, and

44:15.266 --> 44:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he served as foreign
secretary of the United
Kingdom from 2007 to 2010.

44:20.500 --> 44:22.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
David Miliband, welcome
back to the "NewsHour."

44:22.733 --> 44:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That was a horrific film we
have just seen an excerpt of.

44:27.400 --> 44:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tell us more about just how bad
things are right now in Yemen.

44:30.500 --> 44:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND, President,
International Rescue
Committee: Well, I think
horrific is the right

44:33.333 --> 44:36.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
word for the tragedy
that's unfolding in Yemen.

44:36.866 --> 44:41.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is the modern face of
humanitarian catastrophe,
because Yemen represents
a political emergency,

44:43.633 --> 44:46.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as well as a
humanitarian emergency.

44:46.766 --> 44:50.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Yemen is one of four
countries threatened by
famine at the moment.

44:50.333 --> 44:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the numbers in Yemen
are absolutely staggering,
20 million people in
humanitarian need, over

44:57.233 --> 44:59.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
300,000 diagnosed
with cholera already.

44:59.633 --> 45:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And our teams on the
ground -- the International
Rescue Committee has
150 or 200 staff on the

45:04.133 --> 45:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ground in Yemen -- and what
they report is direct danger
to civilians from bombing as

45:11.066 --> 45:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
part of the war that's going
on, and indirect danger from
the consequences of war that are

45:17.200 --> 45:20.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
impeding access to --
of humanitarian workers
and have destroyed about
half of the hospitals

45:21.700 --> 45:23.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the country.

45:23.100 --> 45:25.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So it really is complete
meltdown in Yemen at the moment.

45:25.166 --> 45:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, if I were
to ask you what are people --
what are the main needs that

45:29.433 --> 45:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people have, it sounds as
if you're saying everything.

45:31.833 --> 45:36.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: Yes, it is
everything, but I think one
can be specific, first of all,

45:36.466 --> 45:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the war needs to be
conducted within the confines
of international humanitarian

45:41.133 --> 45:43.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
law.

45:43.166 --> 45:46.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
International humanitarian law,
which defends civilians from
attack, needs to be observed.

45:46.066 --> 45:50.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Secondly, the bombing
of hospitals needs to
be arrested and stopped.

45:50.566 --> 45:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thirdly, access for humanitarian
aide workers needs to be
supported, rather than impeded.

45:57.066 --> 46:00.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There's a threat to
the main port in Yemen,
the Hodeidah port.

46:00.366 --> 46:02.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's a threat
to bomb that port.

46:02.933 --> 46:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, it needs stronger
U.N. presence there to
ensure that food is able
to enter the country,

46:08.866 --> 46:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because, obviously, the
agriculture has been completely
ruined over the last few years

46:12.766 --> 46:14.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of war.

46:14.800 --> 46:17.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, fourthly, and critically,
there needs to be support
from the whole international

46:17.866 --> 46:22.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
diplomatic and political,
as well as humanitarian
community for some kind
of political settlement

46:24.033 --> 46:26.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that can put ahold
to the fighting.

46:26.100 --> 46:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nearly two years ago at the
United Nations, I attended a
meeting of foreign nations of

46:29.066 --> 46:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gulf countries who said
they were committed
to finding a political
settlement, but, frankly,

46:35.266 --> 46:36.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's no nearer now
than it was then.

46:36.533 --> 46:38.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And civilians in Yemen
are paying the price.

46:38.700 --> 46:41.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why has
it gotten to this point?

46:41.833 --> 46:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You describe a situation that,
by stages, has gotten to a
point, as you're describing,

46:48.300 --> 46:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's going to be very difficult
to put this back together again.

46:50.433 --> 46:51.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID MILIBAND: You're
absolutely right.

46:51.700 --> 46:55.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, there are two
main reasons, I think.

46:55.133 --> 47:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, the war itself
has seen a significant
upping of the ante, first
of all, by the Saudi-led

47:02.166 --> 47:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coalition, the U.S. supporting
that, then the Iranians getting
involved, then retaliation

47:06.566 --> 47:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
against the Iranian involvement.

47:08.600 --> 47:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so you see an escalation
upon escalation, neither side
willing to compromise, for fear

47:14.000 --> 47:16.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of losing face.

47:16.066 --> 47:19.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The second thing that's
been happening is
that the humanitarian
tragedy and the failure

47:19.800 --> 47:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to protect civilians and deliver
humanitarian aid has, I'm
afraid, fueled the political

47:25.933 --> 47:27.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
emergency.

47:27.200 --> 47:29.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's provided fuel
for radicalism.

47:29.400 --> 47:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's entrenched both sides.

47:31.500 --> 47:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The bloodletting has meant that
both the Houthi rebels and the
government who have the support

47:37.566 --> 47:41.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the Saudis and the
American side have got
further and further apart.

47:41.000 --> 47:45.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A million refugees have
left the country, including
some fleeing to Somalia.

47:45.600 --> 47:49.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You have got a situation
where Somalia is safer
for them than Yemen.

47:49.733 --> 47:51.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And those are the
two main reasons.

47:51.333 --> 47:55.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There is one other
thing, just to further
enlighten your audience.

47:55.700 --> 47:58.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Yemen is a country that
is suffering terribly
from climate change.

47:58.966 --> 48:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sanaa is predicted to be the
first capital city in the
world to run out of water.

48:02.300 --> 48:06.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So you have got chronic
long-term problems and
acute problems in the
short term as well.

48:06.966 --> 48:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A number of
guilty parties you're talking
about, including the United

48:12.433 --> 48:13.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

48:13.366 --> 48:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What, politically, can be done?

48:15.433 --> 48:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, you said a moment ago,
David Miliband, this is even
more a political crisis than

48:21.333 --> 48:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a humanitarian, as bad as it
is on a humanitarian level.

48:23.433 --> 48:25.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What has to be done?

48:25.466 --> 48:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: I think the
diplomatic and political muscle
needs to be applied to ensure

48:32.066 --> 48:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that there is a cease-fire, that
that then is built on with a
proper negotiated settlement,

48:38.400 --> 48:40.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because the truth is that the
current trajectory of the war
is in the interests of neither

48:40.866 --> 48:41.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
side.

48:41.866 --> 48:43.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No one is winning.

48:43.400 --> 48:47.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the civilians of Yemen
are losing very big time.

48:47.466 --> 48:51.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I'm pleased to say that
there are some senators
speaking up on this.

48:51.100 --> 48:53.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was in Washington on Monday.

48:53.166 --> 48:57.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there is growing concern,
I think, in the Senate to call
on the U.S. administration

48:59.700 --> 49:03.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to persuade the Saudis to call
a halt to this bombing campaign,
which, as I say, is fueling

49:03.066 --> 49:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the insurgency, rather than
curbing it, and to give time
for humanitarian aid to get in.

49:10.100 --> 49:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it tells you something
that we in the humanitarian
sector are desperately calling

49:13.633 --> 49:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on there to be no bombing of
the main port through which
90 percent of the food gets

49:19.233 --> 49:20.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into Yemen.

49:20.866 --> 49:23.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And Yemen is one of
four countries that are
threatened by famine.

49:23.466 --> 49:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a unique coalition of
eight American-led NGOs
have come together to
form a global emergency

49:30.000 --> 49:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
response coalition to call
on the American public to
support us in trying to staunch

49:36.500 --> 49:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the bloodshed, to staunch
the humanitarian suffering,
even while the war going on.

49:41.500 --> 49:44.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's for the diplomats
and the politicians to try
and bring the war to an end.

49:44.433 --> 49:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What's at
stake if that doesn't happen?

49:47.066 --> 49:52.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: Suffering and
further fuel for the insurgency.

49:53.966 --> 49:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a downward spiral
to hell that really
needs to be arrested.

49:57.100 --> 50:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Miliband
of the International Rescue
Committee, thank you very much.

50:01.633 --> 50:06.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID MILIBAND:
Thank you very much.

50:08.633 --> 50:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to another
in our Brief But Spectacular
series, where we ask people

50:17.566 --> 50:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to describe their passions.

50:19.533 --> 50:24.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from Academy
Award-winning documentary
filmmaker Laura Poitras.

50:26.133 --> 50:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her latest film is "Risk,"
which looks at WikiLeaks
and Julian Assange.

50:29.066 --> 50:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAURA POITRAS, Documentary
Filmmaker: It's a bit surprising
that I do documentaries,

50:32.433 --> 50:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because I consider myself
to be a really shy person.

50:34.633 --> 50:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's something about
the documentary form that I
guess it sort of -- it kind of

50:41.566 --> 50:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gives you an invitation, maybe,
to go places you wouldn't go
otherwise or to take risks

50:44.300 --> 50:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you wouldn't take otherwise.

50:53.000 --> 50:58.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
My filmmaking is -- kind
of comes in a tradition
of observational cinema
or cinema verite.

51:00.000 --> 51:03.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Legendary founders of it
is D.A. Pennebaker, Albert
Maysles, Frederick Wiseman.

51:04.733 --> 51:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They capture human stories.

51:06.233 --> 51:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They capture drama, and they
capture history as it unfolds.

51:08.300 --> 51:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you talk to people and
who they tell you who they are
is oftentimes different than

51:12.533 --> 51:13.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their actions.

51:13.966 --> 51:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so I'm interested in
people's actions and choices.

51:16.033 --> 51:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, for instance, sitting in a
hotel room with Edward Snowden,
as he's making this monumental

51:23.466 --> 51:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decision to leak this
information, is an example
of the type of cinema
that I'm interested

51:26.433 --> 51:28.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in doing.

51:28.333 --> 51:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The last two films I have
done, "Citizenfour" and
"Risk," I became a participant.

51:31.000 --> 51:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were things that were
happening that were happening
because of work that I was

51:35.966 --> 51:38.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
doing, reporting on the NSA.

51:38.366 --> 51:43.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, if you expose the
deepest levels of intelligence
agencies, they do tend to pay

51:44.733 --> 51:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
attention to what you're doing.

51:46.833 --> 51:51.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was placed on a government
terrorist watch list in 2006,
and was detained at the U.S.

51:53.500 --> 51:58.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
border for -- probably
50 times, interrogated.

51:58.100 --> 51:59.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have had computers
confiscated.

51:59.866 --> 52:02.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have had notebooks
photocopied.

52:02.133 --> 52:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have subpoenaed my records.

52:04.200 --> 52:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They would send FBI agents
to my film screenings to
see what I said in Q&amp;As.

52:08.900 --> 52:12.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: There's a filmmaker
named Laura Poitras.

52:12.200 --> 52:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Laura Poitras is known through
the defense community as a
documentary filmmaker who is

52:17.800 --> 52:19.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
anti-U.S.

52:19.866 --> 52:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAURA POITRAS: I became really
interested in WikiLeaks and
Julian Assange in 2010, like

52:25.333 --> 52:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of people, first when
they published the video of
Collateral Murder, the Apache

52:30.700 --> 52:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
helicopter footage
that showed killings of
Iraqis, by U.S. military.

52:33.533 --> 52:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And having made a film about
the war in Iraq, I knew that
this was the kind of thing that

52:37.633 --> 52:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was happening every day there.

52:41.633 --> 52:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I reached out to WikiLeaks and
Assange during that time and
then started filming in 2011.

52:48.666 --> 52:51.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I was interested in how
they were changing journalism.

52:51.733 --> 52:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I had somewhat of a falling out
with him over the film, where
he wanted me not to use scenes

52:58.133 --> 53:00.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the film.

53:00.300 --> 53:03.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the scenes that Julian
wanted removed from the film
is the scene where his lawyers

53:03.300 --> 53:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are giving him advice about
how to speak publicly of
-- around these allegations
of sexual assault.

53:10.666 --> 53:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIAN ASSANGE, Founder,
WikiLeaks: It's just a
thoroughly tawdry, radical,
feminist, political

53:17.500 --> 53:19.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
positioning thing.

53:19.100 --> 53:21.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's some stereotype.

53:21.333 --> 53:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAURA POITRAS: I still have
enormous respect for, like, the
project of WikiLeaks and its

53:28.866 --> 53:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
importance, because I
think they have done
extraordinary publishing.

53:32.566 --> 53:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm always interested in access.

53:34.600 --> 53:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like -- you know, like, I would
love to have access to Robert
Mueller's investigation into

53:40.600 --> 53:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Donald Trump, or James Comey.

53:43.233 --> 53:47.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But I think those are
going to be pretty tough
to get access to that.

53:47.933 --> 53:52.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, yes, I'm really looking
forward to like the really good
documentary that's capturing

53:54.100 --> 53:55.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what's happening right
now in our politics.

53:55.733 --> 54:00.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I hope it's being
documented by someone.

54:00.266 --> 54:04.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My name is Laura Poitras,
and this is my brief take
on documentary filmmaking.

week, teenagers from all over

54:18.400 --> 54:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the world, including
an all-girls team from
Afghanistan, were in
Washington to participate

54:24.266 --> 54:26.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a robotics competition.

54:26.266 --> 54:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Wednesday, a six-person
team from the war-torn African
nation of Burundi went missing.

54:33.133 --> 54:37.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But now two of those
teens have been found
safe crossing into Canada.
