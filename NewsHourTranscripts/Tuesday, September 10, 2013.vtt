TABLE, AND I BELIEVE IT SHOULD  
BE A AGGRESSIVELY PURSUED.      

12:49.090 --> 12:50.204
TABLE, AND I BELIEVE IT SHOULD  
BE A AGGRESSIVELY PURSUED.

12:50.205 --> 12:52.202
BE A AGGRESSIVELY PURSUED.

>> SENATOR, DO YOU THINK THAT   
RUSSIA IS A WORTHY ALLY IN THAT 
PURSUIT?                        

12:53.320 --> 12:55.775
RUSSIA IS A WORTHY ALLY IN THAT 
PURSUIT?                        
>> YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND THOSE 

12:55.777 --> 12:58.364
PURSUIT?                        
>> YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND THOSE 
WHO SAY WE CAN'T TRUST THE      

12:58.365 --> 12:58.723
>> YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND THOSE 
WHO SAY WE CAN'T TRUST THE      
RUSSIANS.                       

12:58.726 --> 13:01.968
WHO SAY WE CAN'T TRUST THE      
RUSSIANS.                       
BUT THE FACT IS, THAT IT IS IN  

13:01.971 --> 13:06.458
RUSSIANS.                       
BUT THE FACT IS, THAT IT IS IN  
THE RUSSIAN'S OWN SELF-INTEREST 

13:06.461 --> 13:09.243
BUT THE FACT IS, THAT IT IS IN  
THE RUSSIAN'S OWN SELF-INTEREST 
TO DIFFUSE THIS CRISES.         

13:09.246 --> 13:10.620
THE RUSSIAN'S OWN SELF-INTEREST 
TO DIFFUSE THIS CRISES.         
SO I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD     

13:10.622 --> 13:15.207
TO DIFFUSE THIS CRISES.         
SO I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD     
ALLOW SOME TIME FOR THIS TO PLAY

13:15.210 --> 13:17.175
SO I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD     
ALLOW SOME TIME FOR THIS TO PLAY
OUT, TO SEE IF THE RUSSIANS WHO 

13:17.176 --> 13:21.337
ALLOW SOME TIME FOR THIS TO PLAY
OUT, TO SEE IF THE RUSSIANS WHO 
ARE, AFTER ALL, THE CHIEF ALLIES

13:21.338 --> 13:24.778
OUT, TO SEE IF THE RUSSIANS WHO 
ARE, AFTER ALL, THE CHIEF ALLIES
FOR ASSAD CAN, INDEED, CAUSE HIM

13:24.779 --> 13:26.710
ARE, AFTER ALL, THE CHIEF ALLIES
FOR ASSAD CAN, INDEED, CAUSE HIM
TO TURN OVER HIS STOCKPILE OF   

13:26.713 --> 13:28.743
FOR ASSAD CAN, INDEED, CAUSE HIM
TO TURN OVER HIS STOCKPILE OF   
CHEMICAL WEAPONS TO THE UNITED  

13:28.745 --> 13:32.053
TO TURN OVER HIS STOCKPILE OF   
CHEMICAL WEAPONS TO THE UNITED  
NATIONS OR SOME OTHER           

13:32.055 --> 13:34.741
CHEMICAL WEAPONS TO THE UNITED  
NATIONS OR SOME OTHER           
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION.     

13:34.743 --> 13:36.773
NATIONS OR SOME OTHER           
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION.     
WITHOUT RUSSIAN WEAPONS, MONEY  

13:36.774 --> 13:39.460
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION.     
WITHOUT RUSSIAN WEAPONS, MONEY  
AND SUPPORT, ASSAD WOULD BE     

13:39.461 --> 13:40.148
WITHOUT RUSSIAN WEAPONS, MONEY  
AND SUPPORT, ASSAD WOULD BE     
GONE.                           

13:40.149 --> 13:42.409
AND SUPPORT, ASSAD WOULD BE     
GONE.                           
SO IT IS THE RUSSIANS THAT HAVE 

13:42.410 --> 13:45.752
GONE.                           
SO IT IS THE RUSSIANS THAT HAVE 
THE ABILITY TO INFLUENCE THE

SO IT IS THE RUSSIANS THAT HAVE 
THE ABILITY TO INFLUENCE THE
