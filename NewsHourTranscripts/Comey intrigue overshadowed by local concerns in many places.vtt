JUDY WOODRUFF: Millions of
Americans tuned in to watch
former FBI Director James Comey

00:04.933 --> 00:07.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
testify before
Congress yesterday.

00:07.033 --> 00:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, as Hari Sreenivasan
explores, what they saw differed
widely, often depending on where

00:13.033 --> 00:15.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they live.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We look at
the reaction across the country
to the Comey hearing, the

00:17.933 --> 00:22.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Russia investigations
and President Trump's
first few months in
office with Jon Ralston,

00:25.266 --> 00:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
editor of The Nevada
Independent, who joins
us today from California,
Ashton Marra of

00:27.700 --> 00:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
West Virginia Public
Broadcasting, and Brandon
Smith with Indiana
Public Broadcasting.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ashton, let me start with you.

00:34.100 --> 00:37.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Millions of people
watched this in D.C.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Quite a few watched President
Trump on the Rose Garden today
deny what former Director

00:40.833 --> 00:42.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Comey said.

00:42.400 --> 00:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How does this compare to the
reaction in your community?

00:43.700 --> 00:45.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Were people paying
attention to this?

00:45.800 --> 00:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ASHTON MARRA, West Virginia
Public Broadcasting: I think in
West Virginia, generally, there

00:47.933 --> 00:52.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is the same kind of -- there's
the same level of attention
as there is kind of generally

00:52.300 --> 00:54.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
across the country.

00:54.433 --> 00:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I will say, Hari, that a lot
that's happening in Washington
is being overshadowed by what's

00:57.800 --> 01:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happening here at the local
level in West Virginia.

01:00.233 --> 01:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're about 19 days away
from a government shutdown.

01:02.933 --> 01:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if lawmakers don't approve
a budget by June 30, that
means all state workers get

01:09.600 --> 01:11.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
laid off, there's no
more funding for any
government services.

01:11.600 --> 01:15.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so what's happening
at the local level
for West Virginians
is a much bigger issue

01:15.300 --> 01:17.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
than what's going
on in Washington.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jon
Ralston, all politics local?

01:19.166 --> 01:20.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is that the case
in Nevada as well?

01:20.766 --> 01:23.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JON RALSTON, The
Nevada Independent:
Well, to some extent.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Our legislature just ended.

01:25.200 --> 01:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the shadow of Trump is
over everything, as you know.

01:28.900 --> 01:32.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They did a lot of things
in reaction to Trump,
the legislative leaders.

01:32.233 --> 01:33.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's controlled
by Democrats here.

01:33.900 --> 01:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have a Republican governor
who is not that Trump-friendly.

01:37.400 --> 01:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They passed some bills to try
to codify the Obamacare here.

01:43.800 --> 01:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They sent out a lot of
press releases about Trump.

01:46.666 --> 01:51.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nevada's an unusual state, to
put it mildly, as all of you
know, but we also are one of

01:53.000 --> 01:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the few states to go
completely Democratic in 2016.

01:56.266 --> 01:57.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Went for Clinton.

01:57.266 --> 01:59.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The legislature turned.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We had two Republican
congressional seats
flip to the Democrats.

02:02.800 --> 02:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there is not -- it's
not exactly Trump-friendly
territory in the first place.

02:07.533 --> 02:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think that all politics
is local here, in the sense
that people are reacting to what

02:12.533 --> 02:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just happened in the
legislature, what kind of
education policies were passed.

02:19.500 --> 02:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, of course, the big issue
here, which nobody is talking
about elsewhere, is, we

02:22.100 --> 02:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a new legalization of
marijuana and a pot tax, which
overshadows a lot of things.

02:26.766 --> 02:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All
right, we will get to
those issues in a second.

02:29.200 --> 02:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brandon Smith, people
outside the reporter class,
the bubble that you're
in at the statehouse,

02:34.900 --> 02:35.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
were they watching?

02:35.733 --> 02:37.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Were they tuned in?

02:37.833 --> 02:39.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH, Indiana Public
Broadcasting: Not nearly in
the kind of -- with the fervor

02:39.600 --> 02:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you saw in the nation's capital.

02:41.633 --> 02:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here, it was -- I think, as
Ashton mentioned, it's just sort
of viewing this same way they

02:45.366 --> 02:49.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
viewed everything coming
out of Washington, D.C.,
these last few months.

02:49.066 --> 02:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Certainly, walking around
the statehouse yesterday,
which is where I work,
you heard the audio

02:55.500 --> 02:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the Comey hearing coming
out of a lot of offices.

02:57.533 --> 03:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it was on at the lobbyist
bar across the street.

03:00.533 --> 03:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But beyond that, no,
people weren't paying
nearly as close attention.

03:03.633 --> 03:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
Brandon, staying with you
for a second, what are
people in Indiana paying

03:07.100 --> 03:09.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
attention to?

03:09.000 --> 03:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: Well,
it's a couple big
things, one, the economy.

03:11.233 --> 03:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a heavy manufacturing
state, which is partly
why Donald Trump's
message of bringing

03:14.366 --> 03:19.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
American jobs back, referencing
Carrier, which had said that
it was pulling out of Indiana

03:20.533 --> 03:22.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and all of that, people
care about that here.

03:22.033 --> 03:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They pay a lot of attention to
that here, that and health care.

03:24.600 --> 03:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a state that went
through its own version
of Medicaid expansion
with Mike Pence's

03:28.700 --> 03:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HIP 2.0, which is what he
called Indiana's program.

03:32.566 --> 03:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that has enrolled 400,000
Hoosiers in the program.

03:36.433 --> 03:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if that gets taken away,
that's a lot of people losing
out on affordable health

03:39.900 --> 03:41.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
care.

03:41.366 --> 03:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's something people
here really care about.

03:43.900 --> 03:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Ashton
Marra, Medicaid expansion
also something in West
Virginia, but there

03:46.600 --> 03:48.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is also a lot of
talk about coal jobs.

03:48.533 --> 03:51.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president uses that
opportunity whenever he gets...

03:51.200 --> 03:53.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ASHTON MARRA: Right.

03:53.266 --> 03:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president came and visited
the state before the Republican
primary last year, and he came

03:59.166 --> 04:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to talk about coal and to
show his support for the coal
industry, and, since he's taken

04:02.500 --> 04:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
office, has continued talking
about putting coal miners
back to work in West Virginia.

04:07.333 --> 04:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will say that the state,
you know, we're on the edge of
this fiscal cliff, essentially,

04:11.466 --> 04:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but in the past couple of
months, we have seen a rebound
in the coal industry and a

04:15.333 --> 04:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really small increase in the
amount of money we're bringing
in from the coal severance

04:19.566 --> 04:21.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tax.

04:21.633 --> 04:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, at the local level, what
West Virginia voters see is,
we voted for someone who said

04:27.500 --> 04:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he was going to put miners
back to work, and then just as
recently as yesterday, one coal

04:30.900 --> 04:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mine in Southern West Virginia
announced, hey, we're going
to open our doors again and

04:34.333 --> 04:36.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
put some 300 coal
miners back to work.

04:36.800 --> 04:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jon Ralston,
besides the pot tax, what else
are people in Nevada paying

04:40.466 --> 04:41.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
attention to?

04:41.866 --> 04:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JON RALSTON: Well, you mentioned
the Medicaid expansion.

04:44.300 --> 04:46.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is a state that
did expand Medicaid.

04:46.100 --> 04:50.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We had a Republican
governor, one of the
few to expand Medicaid.

04:50.033 --> 04:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is now a bill sitting on
his desk that has gotten a lot
of national attention already

04:57.033 --> 05:00.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that would be Medicaid for all,
in other words, universal health
care in the state of Nevada.

05:01.533 --> 05:03.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's a lot of
emotion behind that.

05:03.033 --> 05:05.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's no telling yet whether the
governor is going to sign it.

05:05.066 --> 05:09.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think it's 50/50 at
best, maybe leaning
slightly against it.

05:09.233 --> 05:10.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Health care is a
big issue in Nevada.

05:10.900 --> 05:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have had a lot of uninsured.

05:12.566 --> 05:16.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Medicaid expansion
helped hundreds of
thousands of Nevadans.

05:16.200 --> 05:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now you have our U.S.
senator, Dean Heller,
the only Republican
incumbent running in a

05:23.133 --> 05:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
state that was won by Clinton,
going all over the map on
Medicaid expansion, first saying

05:28.500 --> 05:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he wants to phase it out,
then coming back today and
correcting that and saying,

05:31.000 --> 05:33.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
well, he's not so sure.

05:33.133 --> 05:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so that issue of Medicaid
expansion and whether we will
be the only state in the state

05:37.133 --> 05:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the country to have Medicaid
for all if the governor signs
that bill is a huge issue

05:41.933 --> 05:43.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

05:43.900 --> 05:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: I want to
ask all of you a question
about the level of support that

05:45.900 --> 05:50.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exists for the president
among those voters that
stuck with him in the polls.

05:50.266 --> 05:55.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Recent polling from The
Washington Post on ABC
on Wednesday reveals
a majority, 56 percent

05:57.333 --> 06:01.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of Americans say Trump
is interfering with the
Russia investigations,
rather than cooperating.

06:02.533 --> 06:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His approval ratings are
relatively low right now.

06:04.200 --> 06:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Brandon, let me start with you.

06:06.233 --> 06:10.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: Well, Indiana
is as much Trump country
as you are going to find.

06:10.366 --> 06:13.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He won the state here
by 19 points in 2016.

06:13.966 --> 06:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm sure that number
isn't as strong as it was in
November, but it's still pretty

06:18.633 --> 06:20.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
strong here.

06:20.666 --> 06:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that the overriding
sense among Hoosiers is, a lot
of this stuff is distraction or

06:23.633 --> 06:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's not Donald Trump's
fault, but it's distracting
from the real work, and
so they're still counting

06:29.500 --> 06:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on him to fulfill his promises.

06:30.433 --> 06:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Ashton Marra?

06:32.133 --> 06:35.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ASHTON MARRA: Yes, I
think the same is true
here in West Virginia.

06:35.233 --> 06:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump won the state
at the largest majority that's
ever happened over a Democratic

06:39.800 --> 06:42.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
candidate.

06:42.266 --> 06:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think, for the
most part, Trump supporters
in West Virginia are
still Trump supporters,

06:47.833 --> 06:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they feel that way because
of the things that are happening
that we have already talked

06:50.166 --> 06:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about, things at the local
level, like this small
bump in the coal industry.

06:54.200 --> 06:57.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jon
Ralston, Nevada being
a purple to blue state?

06:57.566 --> 07:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON RALSTON: Yes, Nevada,
as you know, Trump lost
here by a couple of points.

07:03.733 --> 07:05.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have essentially
three states here.

07:05.466 --> 07:07.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have the two urban
areas of Reno and Las Vegas.

07:07.966 --> 07:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then you have rural Nevada,
where Trump won in a landslide.

07:10.833 --> 07:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're the kind of people
where if Donald Trump shot
somebody on Las Vegas Boulevard

07:17.033 --> 07:19.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
south of the Strip, they
would still support him.

07:19.133 --> 07:23.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The urban area of Las
Vegas, three-quarters
of the vote sometimes is
very, very Democratic,

07:24.566 --> 07:26.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not Trump country.

07:26.600 --> 07:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then we have the swing
county of Washoe County, which
is Reno and Sparks, which is

07:31.266 --> 07:33.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more closely divided.

07:33.333 --> 07:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think that that leans a
little bit Democratic now when
it comes to presidential races.

07:38.366 --> 07:40.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So it's three states.

07:40.433 --> 07:43.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think anyone's
views are changing because
of what's happened so far.

07:43.800 --> 07:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
well, all three of your states
have Senate contests in the

07:47.633 --> 07:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
midterms coming up, so I'm sure
we will check back in with you.

07:50.533 --> 07:53.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Brandon Smith, Ashton Marra,
Jon Ralston, thank you all.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: Thank you.
