JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.372 --> 00:06.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.373 --> 00:08.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

00:08.041 --> 00:10.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
President Trump says the time is
right for

00:10.878 --> 00:17.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a new immigration law, as he
prepares to lay
out his priorities in his first
address to

00:17.050 --> 00:18.819 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Congress.

00:18.852 --> 00:21.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Tuesday:
In a new executive order, the
White House

00:21.121 --> 00:25.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
promises renewed commitment to
historically
black colleges and universities
across the

00:25.659 --> 00:27.561 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
nation.

00:27.594 --> 00:31.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And taking the
school bus across
the border -- the kids who make
the trek from

00:32.032 --> 00:34.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mexico to the U.S. every day for
school.

00:35.002 --> 00:37.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LIZETT PRECIADO, Student: It was
good to be
able to go to school there.

00:38.005 --> 00:42.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, like, there's more
opportunities to study
and to have a better job in the
future.

00:42.676 --> 00:50.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:50.717 --> 00:53.487 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:53.520 --> 01:03.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's not a State
of the Union
address, but it has most of the
trappings.

01:03.630 --> 01:08.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight offers President Trump
his biggest
moment since the inauguration to
tell Americans

01:08.435 --> 01:13.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what he wants to do as the
president, and
possibly to turn around
impressions after

01:13.173 --> 01:14.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a bumpy beginning.

01:14.942 --> 01:17.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage
from the White
House.

01:17.811 --> 01:23.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: President Trump spent
today getting
ready for prime time, tonight's
address to

01:23.850 --> 01:25.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a joint session of Congress.

01:25.652 --> 01:28.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
It's a busy day, and I guess
tonight will

01:28.755 --> 01:29.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be a rather busy night.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We look forward to it.

01:31.692 --> 01:35.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Senior administration
officials
say he will tout the campaign
promises he

01:35.162 --> 01:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has kept in his five weeks in
office and offer
an optimistic look into the
future.

01:40.033 --> 01:44.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a FOX News interview that
aired this morning,
he acknowledged some shortfalls,
specifically

01:44.604 --> 01:46.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on his travel ban order.

01:46.206 --> 01:48.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I give myself an
A-plus, OK,
effort.

01:48.675 --> 01:52.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that's, you know, results
are more important.

01:52.412 --> 01:56.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In terms of messaging, I would
give myself
a C or C-plus.

01:56.817 --> 02:01.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In a lunch with
television anchors
and reporters, including the
"PBS NewsHour,"

02:01.955 --> 02:07.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump said the time may be
right for an
immigration reform bill if
there's compromise

02:07.361 --> 02:09.062 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on both sides.

02:09.096 --> 02:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On health care, officials said
the president
would outline guiding principles
tonight,

02:13.333 --> 02:17.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but offer no specifics on
repealing and replacing
Obamacare tonight.

02:17.471 --> 02:22.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Capitol Hill, some Republican
conservatives
balked today at what party
leaders are considering.

02:22.109 --> 02:23.910 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:23.944 --> 02:26.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM JORDAN (R), Ohio: We didn't
tell the voters
that we were going to repeal
Obamacare, but

02:26.580 --> 02:28.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
keep the Medicaid expansion.

02:28.548 --> 02:32.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We didn't tell the voters we
were going to
repeal Obamacare and keep some
tax increases.

02:32.252 --> 02:35.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we certainly didn't tell the
voters we
were going to repeal Obamacare
and start a

02:35.555 --> 02:36.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
whole new entitlement.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Despite the
divisions, House Speaker
Paul Ryan was upbeat.

02:39.559 --> 02:41.428 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:41.461 --> 02:42.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: This
is the plan that we are all
working on together,

02:42.529 --> 02:44.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the House, the Senate, the White
House.

02:44.498 --> 02:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So there aren't rival plans
here.

02:45.899 --> 02:49.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're all working on this
together with the
administration.

02:49.102 --> 02:52.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I feel, at the end of the day,
when we get
everything done and right, we're
going to

02:52.672 --> 02:54.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be unified on this.

02:54.541 --> 02:58.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Administration
officials said Mr.
Trump won't offer many specifics
on tax reform,

02:58.879 --> 03:01.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but will address the need to
improve the nation's
aging infrastructure.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.483 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: What
I'm anticipating is an
optimistic and upbeat

03:06.219 --> 03:11.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
portrayal of what America could
be, with the
kind of changes that we are in
the process

03:11.091 --> 03:18.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of implementing, as you know, on
regulatory
reform, on repealing and
replacing Obamacare,

03:18.065 --> 03:22.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
comprehensive tax reform, and,
of course,
the Supreme Court.

03:22.436 --> 03:27.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Democrats say
Americans should
listen carefully to get the real
message.

03:27.107 --> 03:28.875 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:28.909 --> 03:31.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: We
fully expect the president will
offer populist

03:31.344 --> 03:33.613 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
platitude after platitude.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But talk is cheap.

03:35.882 --> 03:43.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, the president is likely
to use populist
rhetoric to mask a hard-right,
special interest-driven

03:43.757 --> 03:45.625 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
agenda.

03:45.659 --> 03:48.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats and the American
people won't be
fooled.

03:48.695 --> 03:53.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Trump will also
push his plan
to beef up the military, raising
defense spending

03:53.900 --> 03:59.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by $54 billion next year and
cutting domestic
spending and foreign aid.

03:59.706 --> 04:04.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On FOX News, he said his
policies can spur
the economy and raise new
revenue.

04:04.311 --> 04:09.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: You look at the
kind of numbers
we're doing, we were probably
GDP of a little

04:09.116 --> 04:11.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more than 1 percent.

04:11.518 --> 04:16.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if I can get that up to 3 or
maybe more,
we have a whole different ball
game.

04:16.756 --> 04:22.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, the president
two more executive
orders, beginning the process of
overturning

04:22.195 --> 04:27.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an Obama era waterway protection
rule, and
returning oversight of aid to
historically

04:27.701 --> 04:31.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
black colleges and universities
to the White
House.

04:32.005 --> 04:36.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump was still adding
to his speech
late this afternoon, including
considering

04:36.776 --> 04:42.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether to add language about an
immigration
compromise that he talked about.

04:42.349 --> 04:46.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officials say the speech could
run as long
as an hour and 20 minutes.

04:46.319 --> 04:50.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And although he's calling for
deep cuts in
domestic spending next year,
officials say

04:50.624 --> 04:56.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the speech will include a call
to the government
to expand manned space
exploration -- Judy.

04:56.830 --> 05:02.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John, you and I
were at that
lunch with the president today
and other television

05:02.302 --> 05:04.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
anchors and correspondents.

05:04.204 --> 05:09.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were all, I think, struck by
the fact the
president brought up the issue
of an immigration

05:09.376 --> 05:14.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bill and talked about how he's
decided this
is something the country is
ready for.

05:14.347 --> 05:16.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: That's right.

05:16.249 --> 05:23.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He seemed to be -- this was a
trademark campaign
issue, talking tough on illegal
immigration,

05:23.190 --> 05:25.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and he seemed to be open.

05:25.058 --> 05:29.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
According to senior
administration officials
who are familiar with his
thinking, he thinks

05:29.229 --> 05:32.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the time is right because people
are tired
of this issue.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're tired of us talking
about it.

05:34.367 --> 05:36.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They want to solve it.

05:36.336 --> 05:40.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These officials say that the
president believes
that the tough enforcement of
immigration

05:40.874 --> 05:49.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
laws that he wants to carry out
could help
the effort by reassuring those
that this is

05:49.316 --> 05:54.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not going to be opening up the
borders, that
he is still tough on
immigration.

05:54.054 --> 05:57.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Some
needle-threading to be
done here.

05:57.290 --> 05:59.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang, we thank you.

05:59.226 --> 06:04.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: At the other
end of Pennsylvania
Avenue, Lisa Desjardins is on
Capitol Hill

06:04.664 --> 06:06.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Statuary Hall.

06:06.566 --> 06:09.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lisa, what are the members that
you have spoken
with today, what are they
expecting from this

06:09.536 --> 06:11.371 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
speech?

06:11.404 --> 06:14.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, I think
it's more about
what they hope to get from it
tonight, Hari.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some Republicans and Democrats
both told me
that they think the president
needs to reach

06:16.977 --> 06:19.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out specifically to those who
oppose him.

06:19.879 --> 06:21.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're feeling the divide.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're feeling more rancor from
their constituents.

06:23.483 --> 06:29.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, Hari, a lot of kind of
regular order
Republicans would like more
details from the

06:29.256 --> 06:30.323 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

06:30.357 --> 06:31.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a place where words need
to become
reality.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That means details.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, at the same time,
Republican leaders
who spoke with the president say
they don't

06:36.730 --> 06:38.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
expect those details in this
speech tonight.

06:38.565 --> 06:42.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And put this
in the context
of the timing that is at work,
considering

06:42.269 --> 06:44.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what the Trump administration
has put forward
so far.

06:44.704 --> 06:48.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This is an
important moment,
especially here at the Capitol,
Hari.

06:48.074 --> 06:53.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an interesting one, because
right now
two of the president's major
pushes are hitting

06:53.179 --> 06:55.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
obstacle courses and speed
bumps.

06:55.181 --> 06:58.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's, of course, the ACA
repeal and replace.

06:58.451 --> 07:00.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans have not yet formed
a final plan.

07:00.487 --> 07:02.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And there is disagreement.

07:02.289 --> 07:05.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the president's own
budget, which
he outlined yesterday, many
Republicans have

07:05.992 --> 07:07.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a lot of problems with it.

07:07.927 --> 07:12.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Specifically, Senate Republican
Leader Mitch
McConnell himself made a rare
open statement

07:12.365 --> 07:16.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of disagreement with the
president today when
asked if he could support those
potential

07:16.903 --> 07:21.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cuts to the State Department and
diplomacy
that the president is thinking
about proposing.

07:21.408 --> 07:25.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Mitch McConnell said he
personally is against
that, and also he doesn't think
anything like

07:25.178 --> 07:26.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that could get through the
Senate.

07:26.479 --> 07:28.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Lisa Desjardins,
thanks so much.

07:28.782 --> 07:34.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: President
Trump said he followed the
advice of his generals

07:34.421 --> 07:41.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and defense secretary in
ordering a U.S. military
raid in Yemen that left a Navy
SEAL dead.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was asked about it in his FOX
News interview.

07:43.596 --> 07:47.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Well, this was a
mission that
was started before I got here.

07:47.400 --> 07:51.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was something that was, you
know -- just,
they wanted to do.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they came to see me.

07:54.341 --> 07:57.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They explained what they wanted
to do, the
generals, who are very
respected.

07:57.510 --> 08:01.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, this was something that
they were looking
at for a long time doing.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And according to General Mattis,
it was a
very successful mission.

08:04.751 --> 08:07.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The raid had been
in the planning
stage for months.

08:08.021 --> 08:11.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It took place five days after
Mr. Trump took
office.

08:11.291 --> 08:14.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
president's Cabinet
gained a commerce secretary
today.

08:14.694 --> 08:18.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross
easily won
confirmation in the Senate last
night.

08:18.732 --> 08:22.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After being sworn in by Vice
President Pence
this morning, Ross said he hopes
the Democratic

08:22.869 --> 08:26.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
support he received is a sign of
bipartisan
progress to come.

08:26.439 --> 08:30.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The nominee for
director of
national intelligence is
promising his full

08:30.977 --> 08:36.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
support for a congressional
investigation
into Russian meddling in last
year's election.

08:36.883 --> 08:42.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former Indiana Senator Dan Coats
had his confirmation
hearing today, and told
lawmakers they will

08:42.655 --> 08:44.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get all the intelligence they
need.

08:44.624 --> 08:48.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN COATS, National Intelligence
Director
Designate: Russia has a long
history of propaganda

08:48.661 --> 08:53.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and trying to influence various
nations' cultures
and elections.

08:53.299 --> 08:59.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a very key issue that we
understand fully
what has happened and how it
happened, and

08:59.072 --> 09:00.840 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have a full report on that.

09:00.874 --> 09:05.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Coats also sought
to assure
senators that his office will
not be swayed

09:05.145 --> 09:07.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by political pressure.

09:07.080 --> 09:10.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The U.N.
Children's Agency
Today laid bare the harrowing
conditions facing

09:10.850 --> 09:14.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
women and children at migrant
camps in Libya.

09:14.220 --> 09:19.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
UNICEF said armed groups have
turned the camps
into makeshift prisons, with
widespread beatings,

09:19.659 --> 09:21.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rapes and starvation.

09:21.528 --> 09:25.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The report said, "For the
thousands of migrant
women and children incarcerated,
the centers

09:25.432 --> 09:29.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are living hellholes, where
people are held
for months."

09:29.169 --> 09:34.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The FBI now says
it is investigating
last week's shooting death of an
Indian man

09:34.374 --> 09:37.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a Kansas bar as a hate crime.

09:37.477 --> 09:40.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That word came today after the
victim's body
was flown home.

09:40.914 --> 09:46.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hundreds of family and friends
gathered to
mourn the 32-year-old engineer
in the southern

09:46.586 --> 09:48.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
city of Hyderabad.

09:48.321 --> 09:51.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The case has touched off
widespread outcry
in India.

09:51.524 --> 09:57.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The gunman, who is in custody,
allegedly yelled,
"Get out of my country,"
according to a witness.

09:58.031 --> 10:00.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said he thought the victims
were Iranians.

10:00.433 --> 10:04.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Back in this
country, Attorney
General Jeff Sessions warned the
country faces

10:04.804 --> 10:10.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rising murder and violent crime
rates, and
he pledged to put bad men behind
bars.

10:10.710 --> 10:15.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a speech to state attorneys
general, Sessions
said police have turned overly
cautious over

10:15.949 --> 10:17.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fear of what he called viral
videos.

10:17.784 --> 10:22.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS, U.S. Attorney
General: The
Department of Justice has an
absolute duty

10:22.088 --> 10:28.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to ensure that police operate
within the law,
and if they violate the law,
they have committed

10:28.595 --> 10:32.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a crime, just as much as any
other citizen
who commits an assault.

10:32.765 --> 10:40.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we need, so far as we can,
in my view,
to help police departments get
better, not

10:40.807 --> 10:43.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
diminish their effectiveness.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm afraid we have done some
of that.

10:46.279 --> 10:50.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: FBI figures
show that violent
crime rates have been rising of
late, but

10:50.683 --> 10:54.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are still far below the levels
of the 1980s
and early '90s.

10:54.787 --> 11:00.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Former President
George W.
Bush says racism is tainting the
political

11:00.059 --> 11:03.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
climate in Washington, under
President Trump.

11:03.062 --> 11:08.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Bush tells "People" magazine
in an interview:
"I don't like the racism and I
don't like

11:08.268 --> 11:12.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the name-calling, and I don't
like the people
feeling alienated."

11:12.071 --> 11:16.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, President Bush says he's
optimistic
the country will come through
it.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: On Wall
Street, Target and
other retailers slumped, and led
the broader

11:19.946 --> 11:23.349 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
market lower.

11:23.383 --> 11:26.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 25 points
to close at 20812.

11:26.619 --> 11:29.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 36 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
slipped six.

11:29.556 --> 11:34.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a look ahead
to President Trump's first
address to a joint

11:34.093 --> 11:39.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
session of Congress; White House
efforts to
support historically black
colleges; students

11:39.532 --> 11:46.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who live in one country and go
to school in
another; and much more.

11:46.873 --> 11:58.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Our lead tonight
is the platform
being given the new president by
the new Republican

11:58.785 --> 12:04.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
majority Congress, to talk to
them and the
American people about what his
plans are.

12:04.324 --> 12:09.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We look ahead now with four who
also joined
us for last month's
inauguration, Amy Walter

12:09.395 --> 12:15.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of The Cook Political Report,
presidential
historian Michael Beschloss,
Karine Jean-Pierre,

12:15.602 --> 12:20.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a senior adviser to MoveOn.org
during the
2016 elections.

12:20.139 --> 12:23.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Matt Schlapp, he's chair of
the American
Conservative Union.

12:24.010 --> 12:29.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's good to have you all
back together
again now that a little bit of
time has passed.

12:29.115 --> 12:30.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Matt, I'm going the start with
you.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have been talking to the
folks in the
White House.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do they think that the
president needs
to do tonight?

12:34.887 --> 12:36.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP, Former White House
Director
of Political Affairs: I think
they think it's

12:36.122 --> 12:38.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to be a huge television
audience.

12:38.625 --> 12:41.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is a president who
understands TV
and TV moments.

12:41.694 --> 12:45.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I actually think they
understand that
he has got perhaps some of his
best opportunities

12:46.032 --> 12:49.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to talk to his biggest audience
about what
he sees for the vision of the
country.

12:50.003 --> 12:54.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I actually think he's going to
step back and
show people his vision of where
he wants to

12:54.307 --> 12:56.075 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
go.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Karine
Jean-Pierre, what are
you looking for from the
president tonight?

12:58.011 --> 13:00.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, Democratic
Strategist:
Well, I'm hoping that he reaches
out to the

13:00.613 --> 13:04.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people who actually didn't vote
for him and
finally brings some unity.

13:04.684 --> 13:08.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had an opportunity to do that
the last
time we were all together on
Inauguration

13:08.588 --> 13:09.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Day, and he didn't.

13:09.722 --> 13:12.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He totally went the opposite
way.

13:12.158 --> 13:15.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, if that could happen, I
think that
will be a step forward.

13:15.828 --> 13:21.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, so far, he has not appealed
to that,
to the majority of the folks who
didn't vote

13:21.067 --> 13:24.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for him or didn't vote for him
at all, which
is a good 70 percent.

13:24.570 --> 13:28.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy, does that
sound like something
that would make sense for him to
do tonight?

13:28.541 --> 13:32.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Yes,
to show maybe that magnanimous
side that we

13:32.378 --> 13:34.180 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have yet to see.

13:34.213 --> 13:37.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are some indications that
that may happen
tonight.

13:37.550 --> 13:41.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whether it's as overt as maybe
some folks
would like to see, I don't know.

13:41.354 --> 13:46.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, normally, what you think of
as -- when
you think about a State of the
Union address

13:46.125 --> 13:50.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is, it's like a Pinterest board,
right, for
the president.

13:50.930 --> 13:55.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He puts on all his hopes and he
puts them
out there, and you don't get
everything you

13:55.435 --> 13:59.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want when you put it on a
Pinterest board,
but at least you're giving folks
an idea of

13:59.505 --> 14:01.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
your big overall vision.

14:01.507 --> 14:05.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's something else that
he needs to
do tonight, too, which most
presidents, even

14:05.712 --> 14:10.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this early on, don't have to,
which is to
give the members of his own
party some real

14:10.750 --> 14:11.718 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
structure.

14:11.751 --> 14:13.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it was interesting today.

14:13.486 --> 14:16.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In The New York Times, Tom Cole,
Republican
member of Congress from
Oklahoma, longtime

14:16.422 --> 14:20.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
member, he said today the
president must become
an active participant in the
legislative process.

14:20.927 --> 14:25.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's saying, we members on the
Republican
side, we're with you, but you
need to show

14:25.431 --> 14:30.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not just where you want the
country to go,
but you need to show us where we
need to go.

14:30.036 --> 14:34.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not enough for the speaker
and the majority
leader to give us marching
orders.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That leadership comes from you.

14:35.575 --> 14:37.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we want to hear that
tonight.

14:37.477 --> 14:41.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Michael
Beschloss, compared
to where other presidents have
been at this

14:41.080 --> 14:48.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stage early in their presidency,
are we hearing
from this president, compared to
others, enough

14:48.087 --> 14:50.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about what he wants to do and
how he's going
to get us there?

14:50.089 --> 14:53.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS, Presidential
Historian:
Well, he hasn't had an
opportunity like this

14:53.092 --> 14:57.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before, because what a State of
the Union
is, is this odd contraption that
no other

14:57.163 --> 15:02.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
country has, because our
presidents are chiefs
of state and they're also prime
ministers.

15:02.635 --> 15:06.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And those two roles are
oftentimes very contradictory.

15:06.038 --> 15:11.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the State of the Union since
Theodore Roosevelt
has offered the president the
chance to say,

15:11.277 --> 15:14.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these are things I want out of
Congress, here
is my laundry list.

15:14.413 --> 15:19.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the same time, it gives
a new president
an opportunity to be seen as a
president of

15:19.952 --> 15:22.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the United States in Congress.

15:22.188 --> 15:24.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He gets very few opportunities
like this.

15:24.157 --> 15:28.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As Matt Schlapp said, he's going
to have an
enormous audience tonight.

15:28.161 --> 15:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he uses this opportunity not
only to say,
this is what I want
legislatively, but also

15:33.833 --> 15:38.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those of you who are skeptics
about me, even
in my own party, those of you
who voted against

15:38.738 --> 15:42.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
me, I can function as a
president of all the
people.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is one setting in which he
has that opportunity.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will see If he takes it.

15:46.212 --> 15:50.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Matt Schlapp,
is there
a sense that the president
himself feels that

15:50.516 --> 15:53.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he should be reaching beyond the
base?

15:53.085 --> 15:56.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know the people who voted for
him, the
polls are showing they like what
he's doing

15:56.589 --> 15:57.557 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
so far.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's having difficulty, though,
with others.

15:59.358 --> 16:03.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: I think it's
important to go
back and think about the fact
that Donald

16:03.129 --> 16:05.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump is a very different kind
of Republican.

16:05.498 --> 16:10.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He already starts off this
presidency having
gotten the support of a lot of
working-class

16:10.336 --> 16:15.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters who don't always vote
Republican, but
he doesn't always like to
critique, well,

16:15.374 --> 16:16.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you got to reach beyond.

16:16.742 --> 16:18.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's already said, hey, I have
already reached.

16:18.477 --> 16:21.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We have got a brand-new
coalition building
here.

16:21.214 --> 16:24.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I do think it's a fair point
that he ought
to reach out to all Americans.

16:24.116 --> 16:25.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's everyone's president.

16:25.484 --> 16:28.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to have a national
security emergency
before too long.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.456 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's inevitable.

16:30.489 --> 16:33.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's when we look to our
president as
commander in chief to have that
moment.

16:33.793 --> 16:37.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these moments are special,
too, because,
with a big audience, he has a
chance to tell

16:37.964 --> 16:41.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people, here is why I have been
elected and
here's what I'm going to do.

16:41.500 --> 16:46.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are people --
Karine Jean-Pierre,
you were saying people look for
him to reach

16:46.539 --> 16:47.506 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
beyond.

16:47.540 --> 16:48.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Right.

16:48.808 --> 16:50.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are they willing
to give him
a second look?

16:50.643 --> 16:54.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: I'm not
sure, because
every policy that he's put
forward, executive

16:54.213 --> 16:59.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
orders that we have seen in the
past month,
has been very divisive and dark.

16:59.819 --> 17:05.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It hasn't shown that people can
trust what
the president is going to be
doing, just looking

17:05.124 --> 17:10.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the traveling ban, which is a
religious
test, which has really destroyed
many people's

17:10.963 --> 17:12.698 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lives.

17:12.732 --> 17:16.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you go from the gag
order, which is
one of the first things that he
did, which

17:16.369 --> 17:22.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really attacked women's health
issues on a
federal international level as
well.

17:22.842 --> 17:26.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there are a lot of things
that we have
seen that is troubling.

17:26.078 --> 17:29.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I'm not sure if he's going
to get there.

17:29.181 --> 17:33.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's always this conversation
about, is
Donald Trump going to be able to
press that

17:33.486 --> 17:35.321 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
reset button?

17:35.354 --> 17:38.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If I got a dime for every time
somebody said
that to me, I would be a
billionaire and probably

17:38.891 --> 17:40.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be part of the Cabinet.

17:41.027 --> 17:43.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's just -- we have not
done that.

17:43.162 --> 17:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think there's lack of --
distrust, and
we're just not sure if that's
going to happen.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And nobody really actually
thinks it's going
to happen.

17:50.436 --> 17:53.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Amy, I
thought -- I was
struck today with the lunch with
the president

17:53.773 --> 17:58.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he did bring up on his own
immigration
bill, the time is right, maybe
both sides

17:58.945 --> 18:00.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are ready to compromise.

18:00.713 --> 18:03.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a very different message
from what
we heard when he was talking
about the travel

18:03.983 --> 18:05.618 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ban.

18:05.651 --> 18:07.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, this is what's
going to
be fascinating, because your
question was

18:07.253 --> 18:09.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a really important one: Are
people ready to
listen to it?

18:09.755 --> 18:12.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what we're seeing right now,
we know we
have a very polarized country.

18:12.992 --> 18:17.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This election highlighted it,
and it continues
to reign today.

18:17.530 --> 18:22.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when you ask Democrats, this
was the most
recent Pew poll, what do you
want your Democratic

18:22.835 --> 18:27.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaders to do in Congress, and
75 percent
of Democrats said, fight
everything that Donald

18:27.606 --> 18:28.574 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trump does.

18:28.607 --> 18:31.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They want Democrats to put up a
fight.

18:31.310 --> 18:35.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, even if the president
reaches out,
and even if there are members on
the Democratic

18:35.548 --> 18:39.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
side that say, yes, maybe I
could work with
you on this, they're going to
get pushback

18:39.452 --> 18:41.220 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from their base.

18:41.253 --> 18:43.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We talked a lot about the
Republican base,
how committed they are to the
president, but

18:43.622 --> 18:48.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Democratic base is very
committed to digging
in against this president as
well.

18:48.794 --> 18:52.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is the challenge for Donald
Trump now
going forward.

18:52.331 --> 18:55.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael
Beschloss, talk about
that a little bit, because some
presidents

18:55.468 --> 18:58.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have used opposition to their
benefit.

18:58.504 --> 19:00.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Others presidents have been
overwhelmed by
opposition.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: Yes,
absolutely.

19:02.708 --> 19:08.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Franklin Roosevelt, you know,
the patron saint
of Democrats, in the late 1930s
said, my opponents

19:08.914 --> 19:13.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are unanimously -- unanimous in
their hatred
for me, and I welcome their
hatred.

19:13.919 --> 19:15.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He used them as a foil.

19:15.554 --> 19:17.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You might see Donald Trump doing
that.

19:17.556 --> 19:22.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Donald Trump ain't no FDR,
and he wasn't
elected by a landslide.

19:22.061 --> 19:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is a much more dicey
proposition
than had he been elected, let's
say, with

19:27.733 --> 19:33.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
upward of 400 electoral votes
and been able
to go into individual
congressional districts

19:33.939 --> 19:36.742 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and saying, I'm a landslide
president.

19:36.776 --> 19:41.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is someone who wasn't
elected with a
popular vote majority, a pretty
puny electoral

19:41.580 --> 19:43.449 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
vote majority.

19:43.482 --> 19:47.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's a little bit hard to see
him taking
the strategy that might have
been more appropriate

19:47.620 --> 19:50.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had this been an election
decided much more
resoundingly.

19:50.322 --> 19:52.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Matt.

19:52.124 --> 19:54.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: The only thing I
would say to
that is, is I think the number
that matters

19:54.427 --> 19:59.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- you're right about the
popular vote and
the electoral vote, but this
wrong-track number

19:59.498 --> 20:03.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has been very steep, very
negative for a very
long time.

20:03.169 --> 20:04.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The country being
on the wrong
track.

20:04.670 --> 20:06.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Right.

20:06.639 --> 20:11.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There is something where
Americans are questioning
what America means and where
America is going,

20:11.510 --> 20:15.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and does it play a leadership
role, both from
a national security standpoint
and from an

20:15.314 --> 20:17.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
economic standpoint.

20:17.249 --> 20:20.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only thing I would say, I
couldn't compare
to the Depression at all, but
there is something

20:20.619 --> 20:23.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there that is affecting our
politics very
deeply.

20:23.656 --> 20:27.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when Donald Trump looks very
serious and
very -- and is on offense on
trying the tackle

20:27.993 --> 20:32.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the basic economic questions in
the economy,
I think it's hard for Democrats,
because they're

20:32.331 --> 20:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
used to occupying that lane.

20:33.866 --> 20:35.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he's knocked them out of
that lane.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're trying to figure out
how to get
it back.

20:37.436 --> 20:39.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Karine, Matt has
a point, doesn't
he?

20:39.705 --> 20:45.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Yes, but
reading from
a teleprompter for 45 minutes
doesn't make

20:45.311 --> 20:48.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you the president that we all
want you to
be.

20:48.447 --> 20:50.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's basically he has to do
actions.

20:50.282 --> 20:51.250 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

20:51.283 --> 20:52.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not just words.

20:52.284 --> 20:53.252 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's actions.

20:53.285 --> 20:54.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And his actions haven't matched
up.

20:54.386 --> 20:55.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Have you not seen
all these
actions?

20:55.421 --> 20:56.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Yes.

20:56.489 --> 20:57.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: I have seen a lot
of these actions.

20:57.957 --> 20:58.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: But they
have been very
divisive and dark actions.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.359 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

21:00.392 --> 21:04.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there's a reason why
millions of people,
a majority of people are in the
streets.

21:04.630 --> 21:06.098 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

21:06.132 --> 21:09.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we really -- he really has
to listen to
us, because it's a problem.

21:09.635 --> 21:12.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You can't continue being
divisive.

21:12.338 --> 21:14.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he is, like you said, a
president for
all.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.542 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

21:16.575 --> 21:20.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy, can he do
what Karine
is saying and Matt is saying
he's already

21:20.446 --> 21:21.547 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
-- he is...

21:21.580 --> 21:24.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: There's a lot of
actions going
on.

21:24.250 --> 21:26.018 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

21:26.051 --> 21:30.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Look, at this point
in 2009, about
75 percent of Americans said, I
think that

21:30.189 --> 21:33.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Obama will deliver
change.

21:33.325 --> 21:38.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More people right now believe
that about President
Trump, 77 percent now saying, I
think that

21:38.697 --> 21:40.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Donald Trump can deliver change.

21:40.733 --> 21:45.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And by -- it's a plurality, not
a majority,
think that he's going to deliver
positive

21:45.437 --> 21:47.206 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
change.

21:47.239 --> 21:49.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, Democrats don't believe
he's going to
deliver positive change, but a
plurality of

21:49.575 --> 21:52.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
independents do and, of course,
a big majority
of Republicans do.

21:52.711 --> 21:58.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So on this idea that Matt is
talking about,
this -- about changing the wrong
track to

21:58.284 --> 22:03.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right track, there are more
people than not
that believe that, even though
they may dislike

22:03.589 --> 22:07.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him personally, he's going the
change things
in the right direction or bring
the right

22:07.793 --> 22:09.395 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
kind of change.

22:09.428 --> 22:11.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's where he's going to have
to perform.

22:11.330 --> 22:15.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Independents are a little more
willing to
give him the chance.

22:15.201 --> 22:18.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If he doesn't deliver, well, we
will see what
they do.

22:18.437 --> 22:21.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats not as willing, and
Republicans
are all bought in.

22:21.073 --> 22:24.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael, it feels
like we're
coming back to that point about
how divided

22:24.610 --> 22:29.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the country is and just how
differently people
feel about this one man.

22:29.215 --> 22:30.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: I think
that's right.

22:30.849 --> 22:33.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it could have been
different, frankly.

22:33.319 --> 22:39.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His inauguration, he chose the
path of playing
to his base, giving this very
dark speech

22:39.491 --> 22:43.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about what a mess -- that's not
the term he
used that day -- he used it
later on.

22:43.662 --> 22:45.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, tonight,
they're saying
he's going to be uplifting.

22:45.764 --> 22:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: So, maybe
that will change.

22:48.534 --> 22:51.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And maybe this will be a
different moment
in this presidency.

22:51.136 --> 22:57.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was fascinating what he said
to FOX News
about giving himself about a C
on messaging.

22:57.443 --> 23:01.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That would suggest that maybe we
will see
a speech tonight that is
different from what

23:01.347 --> 23:05.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we heard at the time of the
inauguration and
during this first month.

23:05.451 --> 23:08.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It would be absolutely
scintillating if that
happens.

23:08.254 --> 23:11.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's
something that everybody
is paying attention to tonight.

23:11.857 --> 23:13.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: That's for
sure.

23:13.359 --> 23:16.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As Matt said, the
White House
is expecting a big audience.

23:16.495 --> 23:18.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We thank all of you for being
here to look
ahead.

23:18.197 --> 23:19.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: Our pleasure.

23:19.198 --> 23:21.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

23:21.066 --> 23:22.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael
Beschloss, Karine Jean-Pierre,
Matt Schlapp, Amy Walter, thank
you all.

23:22.368 --> 23:23.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Thank you.

23:23.369 --> 23:25.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

23:25.137 --> 23:28.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can stay
with us this
evening by following Twitter and
right back

23:28.340 --> 23:35.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here at 9:00 p.m. Eastern for
our special
live coverage of the president's
address.

23:35.748 --> 23:48.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now: the role
of America's
historically black colleges, and
what could,

23:48.260 --> 23:50.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or should, be done to strengthen
them.

23:50.396 --> 23:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was on President Trump's
agenda today,
and is the focus of our weekly
segment Making

23:54.400 --> 23:56.168 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Grade.

23:56.201 --> 24:00.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As part of an effort to
celebrate Black History
Month, President Trump signed an
executive

24:00.339 --> 24:03.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
order today aimed at helping
historically
black colleges and universities.

24:03.509 --> 24:08.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
HBCUs have been really pillars
of the African-American

24:08.747 --> 24:16.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community for more than 150
years, an amazing
job, and a grand and enduring
symbol of American

24:16.822 --> 24:18.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at its absolute best.

24:18.657 --> 24:23.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With this executive order, we
will make HBCUs
a priority in the White House,
an absolute

24:23.796 --> 24:25.431 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
priority.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The order will
move the
government's program for
coordinating HBCUs

24:28.834 --> 24:31.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back directly under the White
House.

24:31.370 --> 24:36.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the president didn't commit
any additional
funds to the schools yet, some
of which are

24:36.975 --> 24:38.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
struggling financially.

24:38.777 --> 24:44.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many presidents of HBCUs are in
Washington
this week, calling for $25
billion more in

24:44.783 --> 24:46.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the upcoming budget.

24:46.585 --> 24:52.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HBCUs were established after the
Civil War
to provide higher learning for
black citizens

24:52.057 --> 24:55.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who were deliberately shut out
of most universities.

24:55.094 --> 24:58.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Today, there are 100 HBCUS.

24:58.263 --> 25:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nearly 300,000 students are
enrolled in them.

25:01.567 --> 25:05.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every president since Mr. Jimmy
Carter has
issued executive orders on
HBCUS.

25:05.671 --> 25:11.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During President Obama's tenure,
he expanded
Pell Grants for schools overall,
but initially

25:11.710 --> 25:16.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
approved tighter loan conditions
for black
colleges and never held meetings
with the

25:16.348 --> 25:17.316 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
group.

25:17.349 --> 25:18.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was often a rocky
relationship.

25:18.984 --> 25:23.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A number of HBCUs still are in
financial distress.

25:23.689 --> 25:28.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Johnny Taylor, president and CEO
of Thurgood
Marshall College Fund, which
helps fund HBCUs,

25:28.460 --> 25:30.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
says the schools need more money
collectively.

25:30.662 --> 25:32.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHNNY C. TAYLOR JR., President
and CEO, Thurgood
Marshall College Fund: We should
be very clear

25:32.464 --> 25:38.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we want this administration
and the 115th
Congress to make good on the
money.

25:38.103 --> 25:40.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You cannot have mission without
money.

25:40.172 --> 25:43.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: After
President Trump's
meeting, his education
secretary, Betsy DeVos,

25:43.542 --> 25:45.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
triggered some new criticism.

25:45.444 --> 25:50.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement heralding the
HBCUs, she called
them -- quote -- "real pioneers
when it comes

25:50.215 --> 25:51.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to school choice."

25:51.884 --> 25:55.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Critics say her statement
ignores the long
history of segregation for black
students

25:55.888 --> 25:59.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the underfunding of black
schools.

25:59.491 --> 26:04.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's take a closer look now at
the president's
executive order and the status
of these schools.

26:04.463 --> 26:07.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For that, we're joined by Johnny
Taylor, who
was at the meeting and is
president of the

26:08.000 --> 26:10.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thurgood Marshall College Fund,
and Sophia
Nelson.

26:10.669 --> 26:14.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's a journalist who follows
this, and is
the author of "E Pluribus ONE:
Reclaiming

26:14.540 --> 26:16.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our Founders' Vision for a
United America."

26:17.009 --> 26:18.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Johnny, let me start with you.

26:18.777 --> 26:23.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why is it important for this
initiative to
be back under the White House?

26:23.782 --> 26:28.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHNNY C. TAYLOR JR.: You know,
at the end
of the day where you live
matters in so many

26:28.153 --> 26:29.855 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ways, right?

26:29.888 --> 26:33.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we were in the Department
of Education,
this office, it was three levels
down.

26:33.492 --> 26:36.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It didn't even report to the
secretary of
education.

26:36.361 --> 26:42.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To me, that said volumes about
what the former
administration and frankly
former administrations

26:42.267 --> 26:45.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thought about HBCUs.

26:45.070 --> 26:49.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We judge you -- more about what
you say, it's
about what you do.

26:49.241 --> 26:54.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so moving us to the White
House sends
the message to the entire
country that HBCUs

26:54.346 --> 26:58.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
matter, and they matter to the
person -- frankly,
the most powerful person in the
country, the

26:58.484 --> 26:59.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
president of the United States.

26:59.485 --> 27:00.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Sophia Nelson,
it's symbolic.

27:00.853 --> 27:02.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But symbols are important.

27:02.521 --> 27:04.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But it's not cash.

27:04.289 --> 27:06.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And cash and funding is what a
lot of these
presidents are here lobbying for
right now.

27:06.992 --> 27:09.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOPHIA NELSON, Author, "E
Pluribus ONE": Here's
what I'm encouraged by.

27:09.194 --> 27:12.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Yesterday, in the press
conference, Sean Spicer
talked about they were going to
do what he

27:12.898 --> 27:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
called a review of the agencies.

27:15.334 --> 27:19.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, I happen to understand the
way this works,
having worked in the federal
government and

27:19.438 --> 27:23.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dealing with HBCUs, as I have in
my past life
as an attorney.

27:23.542 --> 27:27.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The money that I think they're
going to find
is mostly in the R&amp;D space.

27:27.846 --> 27:30.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They're going to look at
Department of Defense
and some of the other agencies.

27:30.749 --> 27:32.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And people think defense and
HBCUs?

27:32.317 --> 27:33.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes, ROTC programs, for example,
right?

27:33.986 --> 27:35.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHNNY C. TAYLOR JR.: That's
right.

27:35.654 --> 27:38.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOPHIA NELSON: So, I think what
the Trump
administration is going to do is
shrewd.

27:39.024 --> 27:43.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're going to look for
existing pockets
of money that, under past
executive orders,

27:43.929 --> 27:48.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as you know, direct agencies to
make sure
that HBCUs are fully funded.

27:48.700 --> 27:49.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they haven't been.

27:49.868 --> 27:51.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's the challenge.

27:51.670 --> 27:55.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what I want America to
understand is that
the legislation or actually the
executive

27:55.774 --> 27:56.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
action has been there
consistently.

27:56.909 --> 27:58.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHNNY C. TAYLOR JR.: That's
right.

27:58.810 --> 28:00.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOPHIA NELSON: But there is no
enforcement
of what the agencies are doing
with the dollars.

28:00.712 --> 28:02.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHNNY C. TAYLOR JR.: And that's
why it matters.

28:02.514 --> 28:05.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOPHIA NELSON: Therein is what
I'm hopeful
about, that at least they're
going to take

28:05.183 --> 28:10.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the look and say, let's find
what we're doing
in the agencies and let's get
this money directed

28:10.956 --> 28:12.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in where it's supposed to go.

28:12.758 --> 28:17.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I really want to talk about
the R&amp;D and
the FFRDCs and all the stuff
that most HBCU

28:17.563 --> 28:18.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
presidents don't even know
about, tragically.

28:19.031 --> 28:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is a lot of money in the
R&amp;D space.

28:21.567 --> 28:26.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our country spends $30 billion,
with a B,
a year in R&amp;D that goes to Johns
Hopkins,

28:26.438 --> 28:27.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Stanford, Harvard, Yale.

28:27.673 --> 28:29.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHNNY C. TAYLOR JR.: That's
right, $1.5 billion,
right.

28:29.274 --> 28:32.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOPHIA NELSON: And the HBCUs get
about $15
million to $30 million of that.

28:32.177 --> 28:33.946 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's tragic.

28:33.979 --> 28:37.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHNNY C. TAYLOR JR.: And let me
just point
out, too, it's important, the
executive side

28:37.316 --> 28:39.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the house, but ultimately the
White House
has a small budget.

28:39.851 --> 28:41.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It can recommend a budget.

28:41.753 --> 28:44.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ultimately, we have got to get
over to Congress,
which is why the first day was
at the White

28:44.823 --> 28:46.692 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
House.

28:46.725 --> 28:49.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second day was the HBCU
fly-in being hosted
by the Republican leadership at
the Library

28:50.028 --> 28:51.163 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Congress.

28:51.196 --> 28:52.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what's important, because
it's all
going to hit.

28:52.998 --> 28:55.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president releases his
budget in the next
six or eight weeks.

28:55.901 --> 28:57.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And then it goes over to
Congress.

28:57.803 --> 29:00.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have got to get the money no
only authorized,
but then appropriated.

29:00.672 --> 29:03.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOPHIA NELSON: Let's talk about
politics here
a little bit, too.

29:03.642 --> 29:07.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Trump is able, President
Trump -- let me
give him his proper respect,
because I was

29:07.746 --> 29:08.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on that with Obama.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHNNY C. TAYLOR JR.: That's
right.

29:10.549 --> 29:13.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOPHIA NELSON: If President
Trump is able
to gain ground here and show
that he's able

29:13.352 --> 29:18.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to direct moneys and come up
with some of
the R&amp;D dollars and give this
more of a presence,

29:18.290 --> 29:23.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's going to score some points
with an community
right now, an African-American
community,

29:23.261 --> 29:27.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that I think, after the last
election, is
a little bit not sure of which
way to go.

29:27.065 --> 29:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHNNY C. TAYLOR JR.: That's
right.

29:28.066 --> 29:29.635 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's right.

29:29.668 --> 29:31.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOPHIA NELSON: You saw this with
the DNC's
direction with Ellison vs.
Perez.

29:31.470 --> 29:34.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that there was --
and, you know,
Stephanie Rawlings-Blake wasn't
reelected.

29:35.007 --> 29:37.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so it was interesting.

29:37.309 --> 29:39.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
African-Americans lost power,
although he's
vice chair.

29:39.478 --> 29:40.445 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHNNY C. TAYLOR JR.: That's
right.

29:40.479 --> 29:42.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOPHIA NELSON: There was a sense
that we're
the most loyal voting bloc that
the Democrats

29:43.982 --> 29:46.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have, and what are we getting
for it?

29:46.551 --> 29:48.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So Trump is being shrewd.

29:48.387 --> 29:52.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, speaking
of that, the
state of HBCUs is something that
the community

29:52.157 --> 29:55.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was even critical of Mr. Obama,
or President
Obama, for pointing out.

29:55.761 --> 30:00.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On the plus side, it is
absolutely training
some of the leadership that
exists in the

30:00.132 --> 30:01.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
African-American community
today.

30:01.900 --> 30:06.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on the minus side, the
graduation rates
for students just aren't where
you want it

30:06.071 --> 30:07.305 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to be.

30:07.339 --> 30:10.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, and quite a few of these
schools are in
deep red ink.

30:10.208 --> 30:14.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, how do you get them back
into even a position
of stability before you can get
them to thrive?

30:14.579 --> 30:16.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHNNY C. TAYLOR JR.: It's funny
that you
mention that.

30:16.348 --> 30:19.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was the first thing that we
asked for
when we met with the president
and with the

30:19.284 --> 30:20.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
congressional group this
morning.

30:20.919 --> 30:22.754 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It was money.

30:22.788 --> 30:27.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact of the matter is, it
takes resources,
significant resources, to
graduate students

30:27.492 --> 30:32.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who come out of pre-K through
12, secondary
systems, where they were
underprepared.

30:32.497 --> 30:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can't expect to finish --
these kids come
in behind.

30:35.367 --> 30:37.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, our schools have an
extremely heavy lift.

30:37.903 --> 30:39.671 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that lift costs money.

30:39.705 --> 30:43.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're not institutions with huge
endowments
that can put a ton of resources
around getting

30:43.442 --> 30:48.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Johnny ready so that he
graduates in four
years and is prepared to go into
the workplace.

30:48.947 --> 30:50.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We might take six years.

30:50.248 --> 30:52.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that costs more money.

30:52.184 --> 30:55.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, how do you do that when
you're historically
underfunded, currently
underfund, and you're

30:55.287 --> 31:00.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enrolling a disproportionately
high group
of people who come from
poor-performing K-12

31:00.192 --> 31:02.027 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
systems?

31:02.060 --> 31:04.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOPHIA NELSON: And I think there
has to be
a place for public-private
partnership, companies

31:04.830 --> 31:06.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like Intel or AT&amp;T.

31:06.131 --> 31:07.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHNNY C. TAYLOR JR.:
Absolutely, who benefit
from this.

31:07.799 --> 31:11.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOPHIA NELSON: STEM professional
companies,
right, that are severely
underrepresented

31:11.269 --> 31:12.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with people that look like you
and me.

31:12.738 --> 31:14.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHNNY C. TAYLOR JR.: That's
right.

31:14.573 --> 31:18.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOPHIA NELSON: And so I think
those companies
need to help these colleges
develop centers

31:18.076 --> 31:21.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of excellence and things like
that, that we
have to start thinking out of
the box, because,

31:21.947 --> 31:25.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as you said, HBCUs don't have
the endowment
that the Ivies do or even some
of the big

31:25.951 --> 31:27.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
schools like you or I went to.

31:27.619 --> 31:28.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They just don't have it.

31:28.620 --> 31:29.588 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

31:29.621 --> 31:30.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHNNY C. TAYLOR JR.: That's
right.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOPHIA NELSON: And so, if there
is no money,
it's toothless.

31:32.724 --> 31:35.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I do think that this
administration is
being wise to say, look, the
executive orders,

31:35.060 --> 31:39.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like I said, starting with
President Herbert
Walker Bush forward, they have
all directed

31:39.264 --> 31:42.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the money there, but it's not
flowing towards...

31:42.267 --> 31:43.401 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

31:43.435 --> 31:44.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHNNY C. TAYLOR JR.: Well, it's
not been
appropriated.

31:44.269 --> 31:45.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's the issue.

31:45.937 --> 31:47.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But how do you
make sure
that this doesn't become
toothless and it

31:47.072 --> 31:49.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't -- because you still
need the face
time.

31:49.074 --> 31:51.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You still need the time to talk
to the secretaries
of education and all these
different departments

31:51.643 --> 31:54.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to say, hey, here's those R&amp;D
dollars that
could come this way, too.

31:54.146 --> 31:55.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHNNY C. TAYLOR JR.: That's the
number one
thing.

31:55.447 --> 31:57.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why it's so important to
be in the
White House.

31:57.349 --> 31:59.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When they're having these staff
meetings,
when everybody is going over to
meet with

31:59.785 --> 32:03.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president, they have got the
walk past
that White House initiative on
HBCUs.

32:03.889 --> 32:07.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's far easier for them not to
think about
it, because out of sight, out of
mind, when

32:07.259 --> 32:09.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're sitting three levels
down at the Department
of Education.

32:09.795 --> 32:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for the people who question
why it's so
important, it's not about an
address in many

32:15.267 --> 32:16.568 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ways.

32:16.601 --> 32:18.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's about who else is at that
address that
you're moving too.

32:18.303 --> 32:19.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Johnny Taylor,
Sophia Nelson, thank you both.

32:19.704 --> 32:23.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOPHIA NELSON: Thank you.

32:23.708 --> 32:31.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHNNY C. TAYLOR JR.: Thank you.

32:31.449 --> 32:39.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just days ago,
the EPA's new
administrator, Scott Pruitt,
promised an aggressive

32:39.157 --> 32:43.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rollback of environmental
regulations that
had been put in place by former
President

32:43.695 --> 32:44.729 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Obama.

32:44.763 --> 32:48.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The future, he said, ain't what
it used to
be.

32:48.133 --> 32:53.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump made good on his
and Pruitt's
pledge today with an order to
dismantle a

32:53.138 --> 32:58.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
controversial Obama rule about
smaller bodies
of water in the U.S.

32:58.610 --> 33:00.445 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the story.

33:00.478 --> 33:04.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It's called
the waters of
the United States rule, and it
has to do with

33:04.182 --> 33:08.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which smaller bodies of water,
like streams
and wetlands, should be
regulated and protected

33:08.920 --> 33:11.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the federal government under
the Clean
Water Act.

33:11.790 --> 33:14.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That question has been litigated
in court
battles for years.

33:14.860 --> 33:18.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so for more on what today's
move is all
about, I'm joined now by Juliet
Eilperin,

33:18.730 --> 33:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who's been reporting on this for
The Washington
Post.

33:21.266 --> 33:23.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Juliet, welcome back to the
"NewsHour."

33:23.835 --> 33:27.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before we get into the rollback,
can you tell
me what this rule is really
about?

33:27.873 --> 33:32.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this was, as I understand
it, a very big
part of Obama's environmental
legacy.

33:32.310 --> 33:37.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN, The Washington
Post: This
is a 2015 rule, which has been
subject to

33:37.215 --> 33:42.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
litigation, which tries to
clarify what, as
you alluded to, has been really
a 30-year

33:42.988 --> 33:49.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
battle over what jurisdiction
the federal
government has over these
smaller streams,

33:49.327 --> 33:54.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some are intermittent, some
wetlands, and
essentially what the federal
government can

33:54.633 --> 34:01.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tell Americans, including
farmers, ranchers,
homebuilders, what they can and
cannot do,

34:01.273 --> 34:06.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even when it has to do with
private property,
because it has implications for
smaller water

34:06.645 --> 34:11.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bodies that are crucial water
supply for larger
water bodies across the United
States.

34:11.483 --> 34:15.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, is this
about a rule
that is trying to protect these
waters from

34:15.253 --> 34:16.288 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pollution?

34:16.321 --> 34:18.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that the issue here?

34:18.089 --> 34:22.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: Partially, it's
pollution,
but what it pertains to many
often is whether

34:22.360 --> 34:25.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they can be drained or filled
in.

34:25.530 --> 34:31.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of those actions, which are
in some ways
the inevitable product of these
operations

34:31.670 --> 34:37.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that happen in various different
sectors of
the economy, have implications
for whether

34:37.208 --> 34:41.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that water will then flow into
larger water
bodies.

34:41.079 --> 34:46.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so it is usually a
restriction on whether
you can drain something or dig
up something,

34:46.484 --> 34:51.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as opposed to, for example, just
dumping in
pollutants into a small water
body, although,

34:51.456 --> 34:53.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
technically, it could apply to
that as well.

34:53.191 --> 34:54.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I see.

34:54.993 --> 34:59.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know that a lot of farmers and
businesses
and developers have said that
this rule was

34:59.764 --> 35:01.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hugely burdensome to them.

35:01.633 --> 35:07.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Was this an issue primarily of
cost to them,
or confusion about what rules
were covered?

35:07.505 --> 35:09.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What was the issue?

35:09.407 --> 35:13.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: It was a
combination of both
the costs that they might have
to incur, but

35:13.244 --> 35:15.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also whether they were permitted
to do something
or not.

35:15.814 --> 35:21.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you had -- one thing that's
difficult
is essentially these activities
were being

35:22.020 --> 35:27.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decided on a case-by-case basis,
and so you
had individual operators,
whether you're talking

35:27.692 --> 35:34.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about someone who is operating a
gravel pit
or trying to expand a parking
lot or do something

35:34.432 --> 35:39.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on his or her ranch -- all of
those folks
were engaged in conversations
with the Environmental

35:39.304 --> 35:42.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Protection Agency and the Army
Corps of Engineers.

35:42.474 --> 35:44.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And sometimes the decisions
didn't go the
way they wanted to.

35:44.976 --> 35:47.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There were fines imposed on
them.

35:47.345 --> 35:52.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so there were these
long-running disputes
happening across the country
where the federal

35:52.250 --> 35:56.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government was saying, that in
order to protect
these sources of water, they
couldn't do things

35:56.821 --> 35:59.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or had to pay for some of the
actions that
they undertook.

35:59.591 --> 36:03.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I understand a
lot of environmental
groups and some sporting groups
have been

36:03.561 --> 36:05.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
very critical of this rollback.

36:05.463 --> 36:07.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is their complaint?

36:07.298 --> 36:11.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: Their argument
-- and there
certainly are a lot of them --
is that these

36:11.202 --> 36:16.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
water bodies, though it might be
inconvenient
to have restrictions, were
crucial habitat

36:16.374 --> 36:22.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for everything from waterfowl,
many migratory
birds, aquatic species, as well
as a source

36:22.881 --> 36:25.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of drinking water for millions
of Americans.

36:25.950 --> 36:30.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so these groups, primarily
outdoor recreation
groups, as well as many
environmental groups,

36:31.022 --> 36:36.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worked extensively during the
Obama administration
to get them to finalize this
rule, in the

36:36.294 --> 36:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hopes that there would be an
overarching standard
that could be applied across the
country that

36:41.699 --> 36:45.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would provide more stringent
protections for
these streams and wetlands.

36:45.703 --> 36:50.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, with
President Trump's
order, this doesn't immediately
undue the

36:51.009 --> 36:52.077 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rule.

36:52.110 --> 36:53.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, tomorrow, the rule doesn't
disappear,
right?

36:53.845 --> 37:00.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: It doesn't,
although the
Sixth Circuit has put a
nationwide stay on

37:00.185 --> 37:04.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the rule, so the rule has not
gone into effect
and will not go into effect.

37:04.689 --> 37:10.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, the order that
President Trump
signed instructs the attorney
general to ask

37:10.462 --> 37:17.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that court to simply hold that
lawsuit in
abeyance, essentially freezing
this rule further,

37:17.902 --> 37:23.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
while the two agencies that are
charged with
overseeing it look at whether
they can undo

37:23.808 --> 37:28.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it, although that again is an
extensive process
and will spur more lawsuits
going forward.

37:28.746 --> 37:33.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Juliet Eilperin
of The Washington Post, thanks
so much.

37:33.451 --> 37:41.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: Thank you.

37:41.626 --> 37:46.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

37:46.564 --> 37:52.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
documenting the
civil rights movement through
powerful images;

37:52.070 --> 37:55.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and airlifting bison to a new
home.

37:55.039 --> 38:00.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But first:
With stepped-up
enforcement along the
U.S.-Mexican border,

38:00.545 --> 38:05.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is more anxiety among
immigrant communities
that families members with
different status

38:06.017 --> 38:07.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
might be separated.

38:07.852 --> 38:12.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In New Mexico, one small
binational community
along the border is working hard
to keep families

38:12.590 --> 38:14.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
connected through schools.

38:14.526 --> 38:19.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From Public Media's Fronteras
desk and PBS
station KRWG, Simon Thompson,
originally from

38:19.864 --> 38:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Australia, brings us this
report.

38:21.666 --> 38:27.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIMON THOMPSON: Daylight hasn't
even broken,
but 500 children who live in
Palomas, Mexico,

38:27.772 --> 38:30.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are up and on their way to
school.

38:30.275 --> 38:32.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Their commute is not typical.

38:32.243 --> 38:36.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They must first cross the
international border
into the U.S.

38:36.781 --> 38:43.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They show their U.S. passports
and birth certificates.

38:43.421 --> 38:46.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Customs and Immigration
officials inspect
their school bags.

38:46.925 --> 38:52.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then they're bussed to school in
Luna County,
New Mexico.

38:52.764 --> 38:57.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lizett Preciado is a senior at
Deming High
School in Luna County.

38:57.635 --> 39:02.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A U.S. citizen, she's lived in
Palomas with
her parents for seven years.

39:02.540 --> 39:04.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LIZETT PRECIADO, Student: It was
good to be
able to go to school there.

39:04.442 --> 39:10.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, like, there's more
opportunities to study
and to have a better job in the
future.

39:10.315 --> 39:16.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIMON THOMPSON: Lizett and her
family moved
to Palomas from Colorado, after
her mother,

39:16.221 --> 39:20.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rosa Marie, was deported for
being in the
United States illegally.

39:20.258 --> 39:27.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSA MARIA PRECIADO, Mother
(through translator):
I felt really bad, really badly,
because I

39:27.832 --> 39:32.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have four children who are
citizens of the
United States, and my husband is
a resident.

39:32.637 --> 39:35.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I didn't want to go back to live
in Mexico.

39:35.773 --> 39:39.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know it is my country, but
life in Mexico
in really hard.

39:39.744 --> 39:45.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIMON THOMPSON: Preciado and her
husband,
Ramon, makes their living in
Palomas raising

39:45.216 --> 39:46.484 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
goats.

39:46.517 --> 39:51.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ramon still crosses occasionally
back into
the U.S. to work.

39:51.956 --> 39:56.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Preciado says having her
children educated
in the U.S. was important to
her, and that's

39:57.028 --> 39:59.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
why they settled in Palomas.

39:59.697 --> 40:06.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSA MARIA PRECIADO (through
translator):
I came to Palomas because of a
friend who

40:06.437 --> 40:10.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said Palomas would be a good
option to live
with my children.

40:10.475 --> 40:14.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is easy to cross into the
United States,
and there is a bus to take them
to school.

40:14.912 --> 40:20.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIMON THOMPSON: Armando Chavez
is the principal
of Columbus Elementary in Luna
County.

40:20.618 --> 40:25.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says the school district
usually sees an
influx of students when states
enact strict

40:25.757 --> 40:28.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
immigration laws, as Arizona did
in 2010.

40:28.793 --> 40:33.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARMANDO CHAVEZ, Principal,
Columbus Elementary:
We are sometimes the holding
spot for them,

40:33.131 --> 40:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for them to fix the papers
correctly.

40:34.899 --> 40:38.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are dealing with children
that come from
South Dakota, Missouri.

40:39.003 --> 40:44.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It can be any state that they
come, but we
embrace our children that come
to our door

40:44.108 --> 40:45.743 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
every day.

40:45.777 --> 40:50.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIMON THOMPSON: School districts
in Texas
and California also allow
students living

40:50.348 --> 40:52.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in Mexico to come to school.

40:52.750 --> 40:56.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But they often charge
out-of-district fees
or are private.

40:56.120 --> 41:02.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the U.S. citizen-students
coming from
Palomas to school in Luna
County, the education

41:02.360 --> 41:05.863 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is free.

41:05.897 --> 41:11.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many teachers in the Luna County
schools crossed
the border as students.

41:11.302 --> 41:16.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ricardo Gutierrez teaches the
fifth grade
at Columbus Elementary, the
school he attended

41:16.841 --> 41:18.443 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as a child.

41:18.476 --> 41:23.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICARDO GUTIERREZ, Teacher: So
now it's my
turn to give back to the
community.

41:23.748 --> 41:27.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIMON THOMPSON: Gutierrez says
keeping parents
engaged in their children's
education is the

41:27.852 --> 41:29.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
biggest challenge.

41:29.420 --> 41:34.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He opens his restaurant in
Palomas for parent-teacher
conferences via Skype.

41:34.459 --> 41:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for this year's graduation
ceremony, he
hosted a live watch party for
parents that

41:42.367 --> 41:49.841 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can't cross.

41:49.874 --> 41:54.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But not everybody living in the
Luna County
area thinks that state money
should be used

41:54.045 --> 41:56.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to educate students who don't
live in the
United States.

41:56.914 --> 41:58.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUSS HOWELL, Chair, Republican
Party of Luna
County: They are getting a free
education.

41:59.016 --> 42:04.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIMON THOMPSON: Luna County
Republican Party
chair Russ Howell says
allowances like the

42:04.188 --> 42:09.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one being made by the school
district motivate
people to exploit birthright
citizenship.

42:09.594 --> 42:18.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUSS HOWELL: They don't live in
the United
States, so that forces the state
of New Mexico

42:18.369 --> 42:25.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to pay for their education, as
well as those
of us that are taxed to pay for
them too.

42:25.076 --> 42:30.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIMON THOMPSON: The New Mexico
State Constitution
requires public schools to be
open to all

42:30.481 --> 42:37.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the children of school age,
regardless of
residence.

42:37.855 --> 42:42.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Principal Chavez says, if there
are concerns
about students not paying their
fair share,

42:42.593 --> 42:45.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that is more reason to make sure
they're getting
a good education.

42:45.696 --> 42:49.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARMANDO CHAVEZ: They are going
to more than
likely live in the United
States.

42:49.734 --> 42:51.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We want to educate them.

42:51.536 --> 42:55.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want to get them to the
highest level of
education possible, so they can
be successful,

42:55.873 --> 42:59.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and so they can become
productive members
and contribute back.

42:59.777 --> 43:06.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIMON THOMPSON: Rosa Maria
Preciado says her
three oldest children are
already making their

43:06.150 --> 43:08.019 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
contributions.

43:08.052 --> 43:12.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her oldest daughter serves in
the U.S. military
and her two sons have careers in
engineering

43:12.790 --> 43:14.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and manufacturing.

43:14.592 --> 43:20.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSA MARIA PRECIADO (through
translator):
I am very proud, because I have
a lot of family,

43:21.032 --> 43:25.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and almost none of their
children graduated
from anything, not even high
school.

43:25.870 --> 43:27.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I have two that graduated.

43:27.371 --> 43:29.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they have their careers.

43:29.540 --> 43:33.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That has made me really proud
and it has given
me a lot of happiness.

43:33.644 --> 43:39.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIMON THOMPSON: Lizett is
scheduled to graduate
next spring, and plans to study
engineering

43:39.150 --> 43:41.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at Colorado State.

43:41.619 --> 43:46.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Preciado hopes an immigration
pardon waiver
she is eligible for in two years
will allow

43:46.290 --> 43:49.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the whole family to reunite in
the U.S.

43:49.961 --> 43:51.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But there are no guarantees.

43:51.829 --> 44:00.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Simon Thompson
in Luna County, New Mexico.

44:00.638 --> 44:13.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We often think of
history as
words recorded in a textbooks,
but some of

44:13.184 --> 44:17.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the most powerful stories of our
past are
told through images.

As David C. Barnett from
WVIZ/PBS ideastream
in Cleveland reports, an exhibit
at the Maltz

44:24.395 --> 44:31.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Museum of Jewish documents a
crucial period
in the civil rights movement of
the 1960s

44:31.068 --> 44:34.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
through the work of nine
photographers.

44:34.939 --> 44:48.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID C. BARNETT: Martin Luther
King Jr. led
about 25,000 people into
Montgomery, Alabama,

44:48.986 --> 44:54.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in March of 1965 as part of a
demonstration
to promote voting rights.

44:54.258 --> 44:58.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Government officials in several
Southern states
were trying to suppress the
African-American

44:58.462 --> 45:01.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vote by making it difficult to
register.

45:01.566 --> 45:05.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Historian Leslie Kelen says a
rigged literacy
test often made it impossible.

45:05.236 --> 45:08.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LESLIE KELEN, Center for
Documentary Expression
and Art: White people who also
took the literacy

45:08.906 --> 45:12.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
test were almost always passed.

45:12.843 --> 45:15.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And about 98 percent of the
black people failed.

45:15.513 --> 45:20.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID C. BARNETT: Kelen is
executive director
for the Utah-based Center for
Documentary

45:20.418 --> 45:25.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Expression and Art, which has
organized a
traveling photo exhibition which
tells the

45:25.389 --> 45:29.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
story of that voting rights
march and other
civil rights events of the
mid-1960s.

45:29.193 --> 45:35.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Currently on display at
Cleveland's Maltz
Museum of Jewish heritage, the
exhibition

45:35.166 --> 45:41.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gives a behind-the-scenes look
at everything
from quiet moments to violent
confrontations.

45:41.572 --> 45:47.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Montgomery demonstration
brings many memories
back to 81-year-old Otis Moss
Jr., who marched

45:47.845 --> 45:53.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with King and for 33 years was
pastor of Cleveland's
Olivet Institutional Baptist
Church.

45:54.018 --> 45:58.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reverend Ross recalls that a
previous protest
had resulted in a vicious attack
by state

45:58.556 --> 46:02.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
troopers, so he had mixed
emotions as the
march approached the city.

46:02.293 --> 46:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OTIS MOSS JR., Former Pastor,
Olivet Institutional
Baptist Church: It was a great
moment of anticipation,

46:09.567 --> 46:16.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
acknowledgment of the danger,
but also fully
aware of the necessity.

46:16.407 --> 46:21.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID C. BARNETT: As it turned
out, they walked
into Alabama's capital city
without incident,

46:21.379 --> 46:26.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thanks in part to the powerful
images of earlier
violence that were printed and
broadcast around

46:26.584 --> 46:28.552 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the world.

46:28.586 --> 46:32.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it didn't hurt that the
federal government
had sent armed troops to
accompany the demonstrators.

46:32.356 --> 46:36.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The films and photographs
focused global attention
on the marchers and their
safety.

46:36.661 --> 46:46.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OTIS MOSS JR.: I think within
the civil rights
community was a sense that now
all of America

46:46.270 --> 46:54.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the world can see what we
have been experiencing
for decades.

46:54.345 --> 47:06.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here is the undeniable recording
of human
brutality that many people
believed never

47:06.857 --> 47:07.892 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
happened.

47:07.925 --> 47:10.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The picture becomes a message.

47:10.127 --> 47:16.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID C. BARNETT: A year
earlier, in June
of 1964, a Mississippi voter
registration

47:16.133 --> 47:22.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drive known as Freedom Summer
attracted over
1,000 volunteers from outside
the state, including

47:22.239 --> 47:24.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a prominent Jewish clergyman
from Cleveland.

47:24.709 --> 47:28.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELLEN RUDOLPH, Maltz Museum of
Jewish Heritage:
Rabbi Arthur Lelyveld went down
the participate

47:28.746 --> 47:30.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Freedom summer.

47:30.681 --> 47:34.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was a rabbi at Fairmount
Temple.

47:34.885 --> 47:38.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he wanted to do what he
could to help.

47:38.756 --> 47:40.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he was beaten.

47:40.524 --> 47:45.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He happened to actually be with
a photographer
that day.

47:46.030 --> 47:51.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And after he was beaten up and
the photographer
was there, he told them to take
a picture

47:51.635 --> 47:53.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and to capture that moment.

47:53.571 --> 47:56.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID C. BARNETT: David
Kordalski has spent
over to 30 years thinking about
the power

47:56.941 --> 47:59.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of images and how best to use
them in print.

47:59.643 --> 48:01.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID KORDALSKI, Creative
Director, Crain's
Cleveland Business: I think a
photographer's

48:01.312 --> 48:05.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
role is to take people where
they can't go.

48:05.416 --> 48:11.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in this particular case,
there is a large
swathe of America that just
didn't know, never

48:11.789 --> 48:15.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really been covered before in
such a way.

48:15.326 --> 48:19.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to get there, and have a
front-row seat
to history bought there in the
power of a

48:19.797 --> 48:23.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still frame is just an absolute
remarkable
feat.

48:23.934 --> 48:28.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID C. BARNETT: These pictures
of protests
and sometimes violent
confrontations between

48:28.305 --> 48:33.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
citizens and police are a part
of America's
historical record, but some of
the events

48:33.811 --> 48:38.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of 50 years ago, documented by
photography,
certainly have a familiar ring.

48:38.415 --> 48:43.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELLEN RUDOLPH: We can't look at
these images
without thinking about what is
happening today.

48:43.354 --> 48:47.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID C. BARNETT: Like the image
captured
by a security camera showing the
shooting

48:47.658 --> 48:51.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of 12-year-old Tamir Rice on
Cleveland's West
Side.

48:51.829 --> 48:57.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This scene helped rekindle a
national discussion
about race and justice in the
same way that

48:57.802 --> 49:02.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of these photos on display
at the Maltz
Museum did 50 years ago.

49:02.106 --> 49:06.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Otis Moss is taken with
something else he
sees in these photographs.

49:06.577 --> 49:10.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's a different sort of
historical lesson
that would be hard to explain in
the text

49:10.981 --> 49:12.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of a history book.

49:12.917 --> 49:25.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OTIS MOSS JR.: She is giving
literacy instruction,
preparing this individual to
write his name

49:26.030 --> 49:34.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in order that he will be able to
register
and vote.

49:34.738 --> 49:44.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It inspires me beyond
description to see this
scene and look at her hand over
his hand.

49:44.782 --> 49:50.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It inspires me beyond
description to see this
scene and look at her hand over
his hand.

49:50.354 --> 49:58.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is a volume of history
tied into this
one photograph.

49:58.963 --> 50:06.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID C. BARNETT: Images have
the power to
tell us stories about ourselves
and others

50:06.270 --> 50:09.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a way that words can't always
capture.

50:10.007 --> 50:18.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
David C. Barnett
in Cleveland.

50:18.749 --> 50:33.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now to our
"NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught our eye,
that might

50:33.264 --> 50:35.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be of interest to you, too.

50:35.099 --> 50:39.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than a century after they
disappeared,
bison have been reintroduced to
Canada's oldest

50:40.004 --> 50:41.805 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
national park.

50:41.839 --> 50:45.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The operation took a decade of
planning, but
went off without a hitch earlier
this month.

50:45.976 --> 50:50.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We reached out to the man in
charge for insights
on the project and where it goes
from here.

50:50.681 --> 50:53.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARSTEN HEUER, Banff National
Park: My name
is Karsten Heuer.

50:53.150 --> 50:57.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I am the bison
reintroduction project
manager for Banff National Park.

50:57.187 --> 50:59.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Banff is Canada's first national
park.

50:59.857 --> 51:02.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a very mountainous, rugged
landscape.

51:02.593 --> 51:08.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, it has glaciers and
spectacular
peaks, not unlike Glacier
National Park in

51:08.666 --> 51:10.367 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the U.S.

51:10.401 --> 51:15.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, bison, plains bison
particularly, were
here over 140 years ago, before
they went

51:15.839 --> 51:20.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
locally extinct, at the same
time as bison
went extinct across the Great
Plains.

51:20.511 --> 51:27.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, obviously, with one big
major player,
Canada's largest land mammal
missing, we wanted

51:27.451 --> 51:29.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to try to restore that animal
onto the landscape.

51:29.820 --> 51:32.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our seed herd was from Elk
Island National
Park.

51:32.790 --> 51:35.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's 400 animals there, in a
plains bison
herd.

51:35.926 --> 51:43.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are probably the most
genetically pure
plains bison after Yellowstone
in terms of

51:43.400 --> 51:45.069 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their wildness.

51:45.102 --> 51:51.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We targeted 16 animals, the vast
majority
of which are young females, all
of whom are

51:51.141 --> 51:54.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pregnant, and then we brought in
six young
bulls as well.

51:54.311 --> 51:58.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we have a breeding herd,
because we
have been told the single most
important thing

51:59.016 --> 52:05.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you can do to really make those
animals anchor
to their new home is to have
them calve there

52:05.255 --> 52:07.091 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
successfully.

52:07.124 --> 52:11.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One of the logistical
constraints we had to
overcome in this translocation
from Elk Island

52:11.161 --> 52:17.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Banff was the fact that there
is no road
access into the backcountry of
Banff National

52:17.301 --> 52:19.069 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Park.

52:19.103 --> 52:23.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where we are staging this
reintroduction,
we could get fairly close with
vehicles, you

52:23.540 --> 52:27.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, within 20 miles, but we
couldn't get
right into the reintroduction
zone.

52:27.745 --> 52:32.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So we opted to do some
modifications on 10-foot-long
shipping containers.

52:32.316 --> 52:38.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They could be plucked off the
back of these
trucks one at a time and then
flown into the

52:38.188 --> 52:39.923 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
backcountry.

52:39.957 --> 52:44.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that flight was new for
everybody, the
bison and us.

52:44.795 --> 52:50.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we had to do things like
develop a parachute
system with a helicopter company
that would

52:50.868 --> 52:55.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drag behind the containers and
prevent them
from spinning while they were in
the air.

52:55.072 --> 52:58.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the helicopters left,
and it was
nice and quiet and settled, and
not a lot

52:58.809 --> 53:01.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
going on, and then the
containers were all
opened.

53:01.345 --> 53:05.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that was a pretty magical
moment, when
these bisons stepped out and
their hooves

53:05.549 --> 53:09.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hit the ground, back in a place
where they
haven't been in over 140 years.

53:09.186 --> 53:13.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are actually going to feed
and support
these animals for the next 16
months, so they

53:13.857 --> 53:19.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can calve twice and really
anchor down into
this place as their new home
range, before

53:19.563 --> 53:23.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we release them into the larger
1,200-square
kilometer reintroduction zone.

53:23.834 --> 53:28.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a biologist, to have the
opportunity to
work on a dream project where
you are bringing

53:28.439 --> 53:33.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back North America's largest
land mammals
to Canada's first national park,
tremendous

53:33.610 --> 53:35.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sense of accomplishment.

53:35.379 --> 53:39.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bigger human accomplishment
is to have
the foresight to actually make
these kind

53:39.450 --> 53:41.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of efforts unnecessary.

53:41.318 --> 53:43.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That is just
extraordinary,
you have to say.

53:43.921 --> 53:45.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes, what a
lot of work.

53:45.622 --> 53:46.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wow.

53:46.623 --> 53:48.425 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Good for them.

53:48.459 --> 53:52.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on the "NewsHour" online
right now: Over
the last five years, the
nation's opioid crisis
