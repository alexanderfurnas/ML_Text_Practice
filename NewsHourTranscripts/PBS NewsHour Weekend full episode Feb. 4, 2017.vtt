SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE

AGENCIES THAT ARE CONTINUING TO

HAD BEEN DOING UNDER PRESIDENT

OBAMA TO SOME DEGREE, THOSE

SORTS OF FUNCTIONS CONTINUE.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S REALLY THE PLACES WHERE

06:32.025 --> 06:33.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WANT TO DO A WHOLESALE

06:33.893 --> 06:35.462 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGE OF WHAT WAS BEING DONE

06:35.462 --> 06:37.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DURING THE OBAMA YEARS THAT THEY

06:37.564 --> 06:38.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

06:38.865 --> 06:39.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: THERE'S SOMETHING

06:39.766 --> 06:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

06:46.740 --> 06:48.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT THEY MIGHT DO.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCOTT PRUITT, FOR EXAMPLE, FOR

06:49.876 --> 06:51.044 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE E.P.A.

06:51.044 --> 06:53.046 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE BEING PAID FOR BY

06:53.046 --> 06:54.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT,

06:54.481 --> 06:56.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBVIOUSLY, SUPPORT THAT AGENDA.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WHY IS THIS-- WHAT DOES IT

06:57.884 --> 06:59.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY THAT WE HAVE COMMERCIALS

06:59.052 --> 07:00.420 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT CABINET PICKS?

07:00.420 --> 07:01.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, I THINK THAT THE

07:01.321 --> 07:02.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMERCIALS ABOUT THE CABINET

07:02.522 --> 07:04.224 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PICKS ARE LAYING THE GROUNDWORK

07:04.224 --> 07:07.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THE EVENTUAL VOTES THAT TAKE

07:07.227 --> 07:08.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACE ON THE FLOOR OF THE

07:08.561 --> 07:11.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SENATE, SO THAT WHEN, LET'S SAY

07:11.798 --> 07:14.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU ARE A VOTER IN INDIANAPOLIS

07:14.567 --> 07:17.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

07:19.606 --> 07:20.840 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRAT-- VOTES AGAINST SOME OF

07:20.840 --> 07:24.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE TRUMP NOMINEES, THERE ARE

07:24.210 --> 07:25.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALREADY ADS THAT MAY HAVE

07:25.378 --> 07:26.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALREADY BEEN RUNNING AGAINST

07:26.746 --> 07:27.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIM.

07:27.681 --> 07:28.982 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK A LOT OF THIS IS SORT OF

07:28.982 --> 07:30.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR THE AD

07:30.817 --> 07:32.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAMPAIGNS THAT TAKE PLACE DOWN

07:32.452 --> 07:34.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

DEMOCRATIC SENATORS.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.190 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: HOW MUCH OF THIS

07:37.190 --> 07:39.292 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LACK OF CONFIRMATION HAS TO DO

07:39.292 --> 07:41.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THE VETTING PROCESS TAKING

07:41.227 --> 07:42.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONGER?

07:42.162 --> 07:43.029 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW MUCH OF IT HAS TO DO WITH

07:43.029 --> 07:44.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICS?

07:44.064 --> 07:45.932 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THERE WERE SOME VETTING

07:45.932 --> 07:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTIONS WITH SOME OF THE

07:47.400 --> 07:50.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOMINEES THAT LARGELY HAVE BEEN

07:50.003 --> 07:51.438 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESOLVED NOW, ALTHOUGH SOME

07:51.438 --> 07:52.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STILL HAVE NOT.

07:52.772 --> 07:55.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LOT OF THIS NOW IS POLITICAL,

07:55.008 --> 07:55.809 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOWEVER.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WE'RE SEEING, AND WE'LL SEE

07:58.011 --> 08:00.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STARTING ON MONDAY, IS THE

08:00.480 --> 08:03.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SENATE BASICALLY BEING IN MAYBE

08:03.550 --> 08:04.851 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTINUOUSLY THROUGH THE

08:04.851 --> 08:06.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEEKENDS, UP UNTIL THE

08:06.686 --> 08:09.589 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT'S DAY RECESS, TRYING

08:09.589 --> 08:10.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO GET AS MANY OF THESE

08:10.623 --> 08:12.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONFIRMED AS POSSIBLE, WITH

08:12.025 --> 08:14.828 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRATS BASICALLY TAKING UP

08:14.828 --> 08:17.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL THE DEBATE TIME IMAGINABLE

08:17.297 --> 08:18.932 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR PEOPLE LIKE JEFF SESSIONS,

08:18.932 --> 08:19.999 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PICK TO BE THE ATTORNEY

08:19.999 --> 08:22.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GENERAL, FOR TOM PRICE FOR

08:22.102 --> 08:24.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
H.H.S., AND SOME OTHER PICKS.

08:24.471 --> 08:26.740 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE IDEA HERE IS THAT THE

08:26.740 --> 08:28.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRATS REALLY SEEM TO BE

08:28.475 --> 08:30.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WANTING THE SENATE REPUBLICANS

08:30.310 --> 08:32.245 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO DO AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE ON

08:32.245 --> 08:34.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FLOOR AND BASICALLY DRAGGING

08:34.247 --> 08:36.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS PROCESS OUT AS LONG AS THEY

08:36.116 --> 08:38.752 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN, IT MINIMIZES THE

08:38.752 --> 08:40.887 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPORTUNITY TO DO ANYTHING ELSE.

08:40.887 --> 08:42.122 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: NIELS LESNIEWSKI,

ATTEMPT TO GET THEIR ATTENTION.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THE RUSSIAN SIDE, THEY ALSO

GIVEN THAT MANY ANALYSTS HAVE

ATTEMPT TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK

19:43.416 --> 19:45.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR A MUCH BROADER DEAL WITH

RUSSIA.

19:45.918 --> 19:47.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT SHE SAID

19:47.119 --> 19:48.687 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLOSELY, SHE HAS A VERY STRONG

19:48.687 --> 19:50.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONDEMNATION OF RUSSIA, CLEAR

19:52.058 --> 19:54.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALSO, SHE SAID, SPECIFICALLY,

19:54.627 --> 19:55.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE CRIMEA-RELATED

19:55.561 --> 19:57.763 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SANCTIONS WOULD STAY IN PLACE.

19:57.763 --> 20:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WHAT SHE DIDN'T SAY WAS THAT

20:00.433 --> 20:02.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SANCTIONS RELATED TO THE

20:02.268 --> 20:06.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

RELIEF WILL NOT HAPPEN UNTIL

20:11.510 --> 20:12.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOTH SIDES ABIDE BY THIS

AGREEMENT.

20:13.612 --> 20:15.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ALL.

20:15.915 --> 20:18.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT SOFTENING

20:18.884 --> 20:21.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF U.S. SUPPORT FOR KIEV

20:21.454 --> 20:22.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

NIKKI HALEY REACTED?

20:29.829 --> 20:31.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, I THINK THE TRUMP

20:31.130 --> 20:32.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION IS PLAYING A

20:32.665 --> 20:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TWO-LEVEL GAME HERE.

20:34.133 --> 20:35.534 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE TRYING TO REASSURE

20:35.534 --> 20:38.370 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONGRESS THAT THEY WILL NOT GIVE

20:38.370 --> 20:39.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AWAY THE STORE IN ANY

20:39.405 --> 20:41.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEGOTIATIONS WITH RUSSIA AROUND

UKRAINE.

20:41.974 --> 20:44.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REMEMBER, CONGRESS IS PUTTING

20:44.944 --> 20:46.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORWARD LEGISLATION THAT WOULD

20:46.946 --> 20:48.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PREVENT THE PRESIDENT FROM

20:48.214 --> 20:50.349 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIFTING SANCTIONS UNILATERALLY

20:50.349 --> 20:52.251 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITHOUT CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK PART OF NIKKI HALEY'S

20:53.586 --> 20:54.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATEMENT WAS DESIGNED TO

20:54.653 --> 20:57.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REASSURE CONGRESS THAT THE TRUMP

20:57.056 --> 20:58.324 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT GIVE

20:58.324 --> 20:59.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AWAY THE STORE, AND THAT THERE

20:59.458 --> 21:00.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS NO NEED FOR THIS LEGISLATION

21:12.204 --> 21:14.373 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S BEEN NEGOTIATIONS AROUND

MINSK 2.

21:15.407 --> 21:17.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS AN AGREEMENT WHEREBY THE

21:17.710 --> 21:18.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD

21:18.677 --> 21:20.212 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEVOLVE SOME SOVEREIGNTY TO THE

TWO REGIONS THAT ARE IN

BE FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS HELD.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ONCE THOSE ELECTIONS ARE

21:27.119 --> 21:28.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HELD, THEN THE RUSSIANS WOULD

21:28.120 --> 21:30.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEAL OFF THE BORDER SO THAT NO

21:30.289 --> 21:31.924 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATERIEL AND PERSONNEL COULD

21:31.924 --> 21:33.626 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CROSS INTO UKRAINE AND KEEP THE

21:34.860 --> 21:37.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE UKRAINIAN SIDE AND THE
