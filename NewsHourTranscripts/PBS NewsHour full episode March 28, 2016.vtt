GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: The
Pakistani government announces a
crackdown

00:11.745 --> 00:17.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
after an Easter massacre

JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead:
Bernie Sanders
sweeps the weekend's primaries
by huge margins

00:22.890 --> 00:29.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Alaska, Washington, and
Hawaii. We get
analysis on that and other
campaign news from

00:29.229 --> 00:30.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our Politics Monday duo.

00:30.964 --> 00:36.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Plus, a report from
the front
lines against ISIS, where Iraqi
troops are

00:36.236 --> 00:39.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
beginning an offensive to take
back the city
of Mosul.

00:39.706 --> 00:43.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Civilians are
running from
their homes where the fresh
fighting has broken

00:43.277 --> 00:49.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out. These people came from the
villages recently
retaken from ISIS, seizing the
chance to escape

00:49.149 --> 00:50.384 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the fighting.

00:50.417 --> 00:56.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:59.393 --> 01:10.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Shooting erupted
inside the
U.S. Capitol Visitors Center
this afternoon.

01:10.938 --> 01:15.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police say a man was going
through security
screening when he pulled a gun
and pointed

01:15.509 --> 01:21.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it at officers. They shot and
wounded him
and took him into custody. A
female bystander

01:21.148 --> 01:23.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was injured, but not seriously.

01:23.483 --> 01:26.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Capitol police chief said it
appears to
be an isolated incident.

01:26.954 --> 01:30.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW VERDEROSA, U.S. Capitol
Police Chief:
I want to stress that, while
this is preliminary,

01:30.257 --> 01:37.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
based on the initial
investigation, we believe
that this is an act of a single
person who

01:37.097 --> 01:42.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has frequented the Capitol
grounds before,
and there is no reason to
believe that this

01:42.436 --> 01:44.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is anything more than a criminal
act.

01:44.404 --> 01:49.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The shooting
prompted the entire
U.S. Capitol complex and nearby
White House

01:49.910 --> 01:55.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to go on lockdown for a time.
Congress is
currently in recess, so most
lawmakers were

01:55.749 --> 01:58.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
traveling or back home in their
districts.

01:58.085 --> 02:02.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The governor of
Georgia today
vetoed a bill to let religious
groups deny

02:02.489 --> 02:09.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
services to homosexual, bisexual
and transgender
people. Republican Nathan Deal
said there's

02:09.096 --> 02:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no need to discriminate in order
to protect
religious liberties.

02:13.467 --> 02:19.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, in North Carolina,
gay and transgender
groups filed suit against a new
state ban

02:19.306 --> 02:24.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on local laws providing for
transgender bathrooms
and other protections.

02:24.111 --> 02:30.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: This is not about a
bathroom, this
is not about a cake, and this is
not about

02:30.684 --> 02:38.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
flowers at a wedding. This is
about discrimination.
This is about being afraid of
where this world

02:38.692 --> 02:42.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has gone and where we will
continue to go.

02:42.863 --> 02:48.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Republican Governor
Pat McCrory
signed the ban into law last
week. It overturned

02:48.702 --> 02:53.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Charlotte ordinance allowing
transgender
people to use the bathroom that
matches their

02:53.940 --> 02:55.642 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
identity.

JUDY WOODRUFF: In Belgium, the
death toll
rose to 35 in last week's terror
attacks in

02:59.579 --> 03:04.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brussels. And police called for
the public
to help identify a key suspect.

Emma Murphy of Independent
Television News
reports from Brussels.

03:08.688 --> 03:13.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA MURPHY: The man in the hat,
believed
to be the surviving bomber from
the Brussels

03:13.126 --> 03:17.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Airport attack, who he is and
where he is
still unknown.

03:17.697 --> 03:22.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Belgian authorities
released this video
of him walking through the
airport with the

03:22.235 --> 03:27.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other two attackers. Moments
later, they blew
themselves up. But when his bomb
failed to

03:27.974 --> 03:33.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
detonate, he fled. Police are
now appealing
for those who may know the most
wanted man

03:33.780 --> 03:35.549 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to get in touch.

03:35.582 --> 03:39.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As that footage was released,
prosecutors
confirmed that more people had
died in the

03:39.820 --> 03:41.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
attacks than first thought.

03:41.655 --> 03:46.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Well, we know now that
four people
have died in a hospital after
the attack and

03:46.793 --> 03:56.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that 31 died in the crime scene;
28 of these
31 people were identified
formally. And we

03:56.570 --> 04:04.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are still trying to give the
three families
of the three victims news about
their relatives.

04:04.511 --> 04:09.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA MURPHY: People have today
charged three
more people following days of
raids, Yassine

04:09.716 --> 04:16.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A., Mohamed B. and Aboubaker O.
all accused
of participating in terrorist
activities.

04:16.623 --> 04:21.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, a man arrested at
this apartment
and named as Faycal C. when he
was charged

04:21.561 --> 04:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with terrorist offenses has been
released,
police saying they didn't have
enough evidence

04:26.800 --> 04:28.668 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to hold him.

04:28.702 --> 04:34.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Almost a week after Najim
Laachraoui and Ibrahim
El Bakraoui attacked airport,
the memorial

04:34.374 --> 04:39.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to those they killed remained
outside. There
is a wish to get this place open
again soon,

04:39.746 --> 04:44.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but with additional security.
Tomorrow, 800
airport staff will be asked to
check in as

04:44.851 --> 04:49.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if they were passengers in order
to test the
efficiency of the new systems.

JUDY WOODRUFF: This evening, an
all-faith
service was held at the Brussels
Cathedral

04:53.793 --> 04:55.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in tribute to the victims of the
attacks.

04:55.795 --> 05:01.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And in Syria,
government forces
began combing Palmyra for mines
and bombs

05:01.535 --> 05:06.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
left by Islamic State militants.
The army
captured the ancient city
yesterday, clearing

05:06.807 --> 05:10.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the way to advance toward
militant strongholds
in the east.

05:10.844 --> 05:16.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But during their 10-month
occupation, ISIS
fighters destroyed some of its
most revered

05:16.650 --> 05:21.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
treasures. they include temples
dating back
more than 1,800 years.

05:21.121 --> 05:27.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Former Cuban
leader Fidel Castro
spoke out today on President
Obama's historic

05:27.360 --> 05:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
visit, and rejected his appeal
for warmer
ties. In a long letter to state
media, Castro

05:33.400 --> 05:38.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
catalogued U.S. actions against
his regime,
and he dismissed Mr. Obama's
call to -- quote

05:39.005 --> 05:40.840 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- "leave the past behind."

05:40.874 --> 05:45.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in Washington, White House
spokesman
Josh Earnest brushed aside the
Castro criticism.

05:46.012 --> 05:49.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
The fact that the former
president felt compelled

05:49.249 --> 05:55.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to respond so forcefully to the
president's
visit, I think, is an indication
of the significant

05:55.155 --> 05:57.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
impact of President Obama's
visit to Cuba.

05:57.290 --> 06:02.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Obama didn't
meet with
Fidel Castro last week. He did
have several

06:02.229 --> 06:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
meetings with his younger
brother, Raul Castro,
who is Cuba's current president.

GWEN IFILL: Chicago's police got
a new interim
boss today, in the face of a
federal investigation

06:12.739 --> 06:18.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the use of deadly force.
Veteran Officer
Eddie Johnson was appointed by
Mayor Rahm

06:18.178 --> 06:23.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Emanuel. Johnson's predecessor
was forced
out last fall over the killing
of 17-year-old

06:23.650 --> 06:26.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Laquan McDonald by a white
officer.

06:26.052 --> 06:31.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: California
Governor Jerry Brown
has formally unveiled a plan to
raise the

06:31.591 --> 06:37.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state's minimum wage to $15 an
hour. Brown
says it's a landmark deal to
increase the

06:37.998 --> 06:45.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
current minimum from $10 an
hour, in stages,
by 2022. If approved by the
state legislature,

06:45.138 --> 06:48.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it will be the highest statewide
rate in the
country.

06:48.141 --> 06:52.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: There is word the
Justice Department
will end its encryption fight
with Apple.

06:52.812 --> 06:57.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's widely reported the
department is dropping
the legal effort to make the
company unlock

06:57.183 --> 07:02.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an iPhone. It was used by one of
the San Bernardino,
California, shooters. The
Associated Press

07:02.589 --> 07:06.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says the FBI used another method
to decrypt
the phone's data.

07:06.826 --> 07:12.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street had a quiet Easter
Monday. The
Dow Jones industrial average
gained 19 points

07:12.666 --> 07:19.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to close at 17535. The Nasdaq
dropped six
points. The S&amp;P 500 added one.

07:19.472 --> 07:24.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the President
and Mrs.
Obama hosted their final White
House Easter

07:24.077 --> 07:29.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
egg roll today. Thousands of
children turned
out to take part in a tradition
that goes

07:29.382 --> 07:35.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back to 1878. The president also
read the
children's classic "Where the
Wild Things

07:35.722 --> 07:41.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are." And there was basketball,
tennis and
a run hosted by the first lady.

07:41.161 --> 07:45.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Still to come on the

the group and the motives behind
the deadly

07:45.432 --> 07:52.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Easter Sunday bombing in
Pakistan; a fight

Iraq; our Politics

trail; and much more.

08:08.121 --> 08:12.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Iraqi government last week
announced the
beginning of what it said is the
campaign

08:12.225 --> 08:16.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to free Iraq's second largest
city from ISIS
control.

08:16.730 --> 08:21.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mosul was overrun nearly two
years ago and
has become a vital hub for the
group's operations

08:21.801 --> 08:27.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Iraq. But whether Iraq's
military is up
to the challenge is an open
question, even

08:27.507 --> 08:31.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the potential grows for
deeper American
involvement.

08:31.378 --> 08:36.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Jane
Ferguson reports
from the front lines near
Makhmour, Iraq.

08:36.583 --> 08:43.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: In an effort to
soften ISIS
positions, Iraqi forces bombard
them repeatedly.

08:43.390 --> 08:49.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are trying to push forward
from this
sandbank up the hill to a
village Islamic

08:49.763 --> 08:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
State fighters are dug into.

08:54.134 --> 08:58.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, the Iraqi army
suddenly announced
the launch of the long-awaited
battle for

08:58.338 --> 09:04.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mosul city. In reality, so far,
just several
villages have been retaken in
the Makhmour

09:04.744 --> 09:07.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
area, well south of Mosul.

09:07.547 --> 09:12.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is as far as the front line
comes for
these Iraqi troops. They are
mortaring the

09:12.619 --> 09:17.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
village in that direction that
is just on
that hill. It's about
half-a-kilometer from

09:17.090 --> 09:21.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here. And that's where ISIS
positions are.
That village is called al-Nasr.
They plan

09:21.728 --> 09:26.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to then move in and try to
occupy the village,
but they have been trying to do
that for three

09:26.733 --> 09:28.635 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
days.

09:28.668 --> 09:34.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Far beyond that village is the
city of Mosul,
and bit by bit, inch by inch,
they plan to

09:34.073 --> 09:40.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
retake it. So far, progress is
slow. Iraqi
forces swiftly abandoned their
positions here

09:40.947 --> 09:44.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in 2014, when ISIS swept across
the country.

09:44.818 --> 09:51.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Morale in the military has yet
to fully recover.
So, when Iraq's commander of
ground forces,

09:51.090 --> 09:56.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lieutenant General Riyadh Jalal
Tawfiq, showed
up near the front lines in an
unexpected visit,

09:56.396 --> 10:05.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there was great fanfare. But he
didn't wish
to talk about past mistakes.

10:05.205 --> 10:11.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When ISIS took Mosul Iraqi
forces quickly
withdrew from the city when ISIS
were moving

10:11.311 --> 10:14.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
quickly. How do you feel like
you can prevent
that happening again?

10:14.647 --> 10:18.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. GEN RIYADH JALAL TAWFIQ,
Iraq (through
translator): These issues depend
on the time

10:18.051 --> 10:23.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
frames and plans designed for
them. After
that, for every incident, there
will be a

10:23.456 --> 10:26.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
response. If God wills it, we
will retake
Mosul.

10:26.926 --> 10:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: The battle lines
in Iraq are
as complex as the country's
woven identities.

10:33.533 --> 10:38.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraqi forces are holding this
ground alongside
Kurdish fighters called
Peshmerga. They are

10:38.638 --> 10:44.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a skilled fighting force,
protecting the semiautonomous
Kurdish region, which borders
Mosul. They

10:44.310 --> 10:47.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are holding the line on both
ends of the Iraqi
army.

10:47.947 --> 10:53.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Peshmerga fighters are supported
by U.S. airstrikes
when they confront ISIS, but are
not given

10:53.186 --> 10:59.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the extensive military equipment
the official
Iraqi army receives from
America. This Peshmerga

10:59.359 --> 11:03.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
commander, Colonel Naji
Bedaroni, wandered
over to inspect their progress.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He wasn't impressed.

11:05.732 --> 11:10.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
COL. NAJI BEDARONI, Iraq
(through translator):
The operation is very weak. It's
not strong

11:10.403 --> 11:14.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enough. I believe that if the
Peshmerga had
the equipment they have, we
could liberate

11:14.574 --> 11:17.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this village in three to four
hours, not three
to four days.

11:17.777 --> 11:22.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Kurdish forces
have pushed
ISIS out of most of their areas.
An agreement

11:22.315 --> 11:28.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for them to take part in the
battle for Mosul,
a mostly Arab city, has yet to
be reached.

11:28.187 --> 11:32.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But without the Peshmerga, the
Iraqi army
will struggle to retake the city
alone.

11:32.825 --> 11:35.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are the Peshmerga taking part in
this fight?

11:35.161 --> 11:39.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COL. NAJI BEDARONI (through
translator): For
this, we need a political
decision. That area

11:39.499 --> 11:43.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is being targeted for this
operation
is not a Kurdish area. We are
just guarding

11:43.670 --> 11:48.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our bunkers. If we get orders,
for sure we
can do that, but, until now, we
have not gotten

11:48.474 --> 11:50.343 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
any orders.

11:50.376 --> 11:53.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: How is the
relationship between
the Kurdish Peshmerga fighters
and the Iraqi

11:53.913 --> 11:55.682 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
army?

11:55.715 --> 12:00.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COL. NAJI BEDARONI (through
translator): We
are coordinating with them. We
are helping

12:00.086 --> 12:03.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them. But they are weak. They
don't believe
strongly in the cause.

12:03.790 --> 12:11.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Soon, we are on
the move, to
another part of the battlefield.
Unseen on

12:11.564 --> 12:16.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this front line, but still
playing a major
role, are U.S. forces, providing
advise and

12:16.669 --> 12:19.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
assist and support for Iraqi and
Kurdish forces.

12:19.806 --> 12:25.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An American Marine was killed
earlier this
month, not long after arriving
at a base in

12:25.311 --> 12:30.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here in Makhmour. Only after his
death did
the U.S. military announce the
presence of

12:30.750 --> 12:32.552 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Marines.

12:32.585 --> 12:37.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff General
Dunford admitted last week there
will be more

12:37.256 --> 12:39.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. boots on the ground soon.

12:39.058 --> 12:40.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEN. JOSEPH DUNFORD, Joint
Chiefs of Staff
Chairman: We have a series of
recommendations

12:40.960 --> 12:45.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we will be discussing with
the president
in the coming weeks to further
enable our

12:45.565 --> 12:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
support for the Iraqi security
forces.

12:47.533 --> 12:53.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, again, the secretary and I
both believe
that there will be an increase
to the U.S.

12:53.272 --> 12:57.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forces in Iraq in the coming
weeks, but that
decision hasn't been made.

12:57.343 --> 13:02.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: The U.S. military
in Makhmour
declined requests from "PBS
NewsHour" for

13:02.482 --> 13:04.350 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an interview.

13:04.384 --> 13:09.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fighting between ISIS and the
Iraqi army and
Kurdish forces has flattened
village after

13:09.122 --> 13:16.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
village here. The scenes are of
complete devastation.
Civilians are running from their
homes where

13:16.262 --> 13:21.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fresh fighting has broken
out. These people
came from the villages recently
retaken from

13:21.100 --> 13:23.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is, seizing the chance to escape
the fighting.

13:24.003 --> 13:28.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have just come upon this
scene here of
civilians fleeing the frontline.
Further back

13:28.775 --> 13:33.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there, as far as the eye can
see, where cars
are coming from, there are
several villages

13:33.413 --> 13:38.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where ISIS have either retreated
or have been
pushed out by Iraqi forces.
Civilians are

13:38.518 --> 13:43.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
fleeing while they can,
anticipating perhaps
more maneuvers.

13:43.890 --> 13:50.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not everyone is jubilant.
Traumatized and
exhausted, these women and
children arrived

13:50.129 --> 13:55.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at another front-line position
while we were
filming. They ran from their
village as ISIS

13:55.368 --> 14:02.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
retreated. A girl was killed. We
are told
ISIS shot her as she ran away.
This elderly

14:02.775 --> 14:06.245 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
woman said they were being held
as human shields.

14:06.279 --> 14:12.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"The ISIS were wearing explosive
belts and
we couldn't leave because of
them," she cries.

14:12.418 --> 14:14.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where are the men?

14:14.087 --> 14:17.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): They
wouldn't
let them leave because they were
police and

14:17.090 --> 14:21.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
army. They slaughter. They took
seven from
my family.

14:22.028 --> 14:29.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: This outpost is
manned by another
group involved in this
offensive, Hashd al-Shaabi,

14:29.769 --> 14:36.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or Popular Mobilization Fores.
They are militia,
and quickly descend into
fighting with the

14:36.442 --> 14:46.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
official army commanders
accompanying us.

14:46.185 --> 14:51.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In other areas retaken from ISIS
like Ramadi
and Tikrit, such forces are
predominantly

14:51.758 --> 14:58.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shia, but, here, we are told
these men are
Sunni tribesmen. We are told to
leave.

14:59.031 --> 15:04.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On this battlefield, it's not
always clear
who's in charge. The fight to
retake Mosul

15:05.004 --> 15:11.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from ISIS will be the toughest
yet. Losing
the city could be a deadly blow
for the terror

15:11.110 --> 15:19.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
group. Given the chaos of this
battle's earliest
stages, a quick victory seems
out of reach.

15:19.685 --> 15:29.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Jane
Ferguson
in Makhmour, Iraq.

15:29.228 --> 15:40.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Pakistan, the
government
and people were reeling from
yesterday's terrorist

15:40.373 --> 15:45.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attack in Lahore. It's the
country's cultural
capital.

15:45.478 --> 15:50.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The crime scene was strung with
police tape
and emptied of visitors this
morning, while

15:50.750 --> 15:58.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investigators searched for
evidence. Sunday's
suicide bomber targeted
Christians at an Easter

15:58.090 --> 16:05.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
celebration. But most of the
dead were Muslims
who'd been enjoying the park on
a weekend.

16:05.264 --> 16:10.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I was
standing there
near the seesaw when the blast
occurred. The

16:10.036 --> 16:14.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
explosion was very loud. As we
rushed over
here, we saw a pool of blood and
people lying

16:14.841 --> 16:16.642 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
here and there.

16:16.676 --> 16:21.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A breakaway
Taliban faction
claimed responsibility, its
fifth attack since

16:21.948 --> 16:27.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
December. In a challenge to the
government,
the militants said in a
statement: "We have

16:27.486 --> 16:29.388 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
entered Lahore."

16:29.422 --> 16:36.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The eastern city in Punjab
province, the country's
richest and most populous, is a
power base

16:36.062 --> 16:42.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
His government
launched a paramilitary
crackdown in Punjab

16:42.735 --> 16:49.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today. And after visiting the
wounded, Sharif
returned to Islamabad, vowing to
defeat what

16:49.342 --> 16:51.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he called the extremist
mind-set.

16:51.310 --> 16:54.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NAWAZ SHARIF, Pakistani Prime
Minister (through
translator): We will not let
them raise their

16:54.814 --> 16:59.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heads again. We will not allow
them to play
with the lives of the people of
Pakistan.

16:59.518 --> 17:03.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is my resolve. This is my
government's
resolve.

17:03.222 --> 17:10.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But Muslim
extremists protested
outside Parliament for a second
day. They

17:10.830 --> 17:17.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chanted "Death to Nawaz" and
demanded authorities
impose Islamic Sharia law.

17:17.236 --> 17:23.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in Lahore, funerals played
out all day
as victims, including some of
the children,

17:23.342 --> 17:25.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
were laid to rest.

17:25.111 --> 17:29.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): These
people were
innocent. They had no idea when
they left

17:29.415 --> 17:33.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their homes what was going to
happen to them.
Terrorists killed these innocent
people. We

17:33.519 --> 17:35.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
demand strict punishment.

17:35.354 --> 17:41.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And at the
Vatican, Pope Francis
called the attacks vile and
senseless.

17:42.028 --> 17:48.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We explore the situation in
Pakistan now with
Husain Haqqani, who was
Pakistan's ambassador

17:48.100 --> 17:54.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Washington from 2008 to 2011.
He's now
director for South and Central
Asia at the

17:54.540 --> 18:01.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hudson Institute. He's also the
author of
"Pakistan: Between Mosque and
Military." And

18:01.280 --> 18:06.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pamela Constable, who has
covered Pakistan
for The Washington Post, and is
the author

18:06.185 --> 18:11.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of "Playing With Fire: Pakistan
at War With
Itself."

18:11.123 --> 18:13.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you back
to the program.

18:13.359 --> 18:15.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Ambassador, let me start
with you.

18:15.328 --> 18:18.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This group Jamaat-ur-Ahrar, who
are they?
Where do they come from?

18:18.564 --> 18:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HUSAIN HAQQANI, Former Pakistani
Ambassador
to the United States: It's a
group that was

18:20.766 --> 18:26.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
part of the Pakistani Taliban,
the TTP. It
has an affiliation with
al-Qaida.

18:26.405 --> 18:31.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are an offshoot of the TTP,
and they
have flirted with supporting --
support ISIS

18:32.011 --> 18:37.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recently. And they have been
responsible for
other actions, including
kidnappings for ransom

18:37.616 --> 18:40.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and terrorist acts in the past.
JUDY WOODRUFF: When you say they
have flirted

18:40.086 --> 18:41.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with ISIS, what do you mean?

18:41.821 --> 18:44.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HUSAIN HAQQANI: They issued a
statement saying
that "We agree with ISIS
objectives," but

18:44.924 --> 18:50.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they didn't go so far as to
disassociate with
al-Qaida and affiliate
themselves with ISIS.

18:50.196 --> 18:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Pam Constable,
what would you
add to that? Help us figure out
where -- how

18:54.533 --> 18:59.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they fit into what we already
know about the
Taliban and ISIS in this part of
the world.

18:59.372 --> 19:01.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAMELA CONSTABLE, The Washington
Post: Well,
it's interesting because, of
course, the Pakistani

19:01.941 --> 19:07.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Taliban has always been
ferocious and very
anti-Western and very
anti-state, but this

19:07.880 --> 19:10.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
group seems to have been even
more hard-line.

19:10.416 --> 19:15.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They split off from the Pakistan
Taliban because
it wasn't hard-line enough on
issues such

19:15.221 --> 19:22.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as Sharia law and real
fundamentalist values.
And the leader of this group is
from the border

19:22.128 --> 19:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tribal area up in the northwest.
But the fact
that they're focusing on Punjab
is extremely

19:27.433 --> 19:31.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interesting. And it's a major
challenge for
this government, unlike anything
they have

19:31.270 --> 19:32.972 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
faced before.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why is that
significant that
they went after Punjab and
specifically the

19:35.708 --> 19:37.476 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
city of Lahore?

19:37.510 --> 19:40.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAMELA CONSTABLE: Well, partly
because, as
you -- as the tape mentioned,
this is the

19:40.780 --> 19:46.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
power base of the government,
but it's also
because Punjab has always been a
little bit

19:46.052 --> 19:50.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
off-limits in terms of the
anti-terror fight.

19:50.556 --> 19:55.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are some groups based in
Punjab that
have government support, whether
it's acknowledged

19:55.661 --> 20:00.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or not. They have gone very
lightly on them.
They have tried to appease them.
And now it

20:00.099 --> 20:04.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really is coming back to haunt
them, because
you have much more radical
groups coming in

20:04.937 --> 20:06.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and building on that foundation.

20:06.806 --> 20:10.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, why is
Punjab, why is Lahore
such a target?

20:10.576 --> 20:14.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HUSAIN HAQQANI: Well, Lahore is
only a target
yesterday, but the fact remains
that the rest

20:14.947 --> 20:17.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the country has been a target
for much
longer.

20:17.216 --> 20:23.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The real problem lies in that
attitude of
the government of trying to
protect the parties

20:23.155 --> 20:27.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Punjab, while going after the
terrorists
in other parts of the country,
but not in

20:27.726 --> 20:30.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Punjab. And that's what has
come back
to bite them.

20:30.830 --> 20:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact of the matter is that
the Pakistani
military and the Pakistani
civilian leadership

20:34.533 --> 20:41.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
easily gets distracted by
delusions of fighting
India and influence in
Afghanistan and allowing

20:41.474 --> 20:46.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
certain jihadi groups to pursue
those objectives,
not realizing that they can end
up having

20:46.879 --> 20:51.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
offshoots, just like the
Pakistani Taliban
came out of the Afghan Taliban.
The Pakistani

20:51.750 --> 20:54.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
component of the Afghan Taliban
ended up becoming
a separate group.

20:54.920 --> 20:59.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now Jamaat-ur-Ahrar has
broken away from
the Pakistani Taliban. Pakistan
has to make

21:00.025 --> 21:06.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a decision to go after all
terrorist groups,
as well as the mind-set that
breeds these

21:06.499 --> 21:10.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terrorists. And Pakistan has not
been able
to make that decision.

21:10.402 --> 21:14.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every few years -- in fact, I
can recall at
least -- being in this studio
for at least

21:14.340 --> 21:19.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
six times saying, whether
Pakistan is saying
or somebody is staying in the
studio Pakistan

21:19.378 --> 21:23.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is going after these people now,
it hasn't,
and 16 years have gone by.

21:23.682 --> 21:27.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you
explain, Pam Constable,
how much the government appears
to have taken

21:27.686 --> 21:33.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its eye off the ball? And what
is it that
this group wants? Is it just to
destroy anything

21:33.425 --> 21:38.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that doesn't agree with them?
Why specifically
children? This was a playground.
There were

21:38.998 --> 21:41.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
children, women, and they ended
up mostly
killing Muslims.

21:41.967 --> 21:46.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAMELA CONSTABLE: Well, they
want power. They
want religious power. They want
their vision

21:46.338 --> 21:53.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the religion to prevail in
what has been
historically, at least in
theory, a multireligious

21:53.979 --> 22:00.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
democracy, in which obviously
Muslim dominates,
but -- Islam dominates, but the
country has

22:00.119 --> 22:04.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
always been very not open to
Christianity
only, but benefited enormously.

22:04.790 --> 22:10.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of the best schools and
colleges in Pakistan
have been Christian. So it's
always been a

22:10.796 --> 22:15.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
popular group, a group that's
fit in and benefited
greatly the society. I think
it's important

22:15.367 --> 22:20.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to point out that these
extremists don't only
go after Christians. They go
after Shiite

22:20.506 --> 22:25.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Muslims and they go after Ahmadi
Muslims,
which is a very ostracized
Muslim minority.

22:25.344 --> 22:28.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have been very badly
attacked by groups
like this.

22:28.480 --> 22:38.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this really is sort of the
sword arm of
extreme Sunni Islam acting
viciously, without

22:38.190 --> 22:44.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regard for any human life,
simply to make
a point, Easter, a park,
children, mothers,

22:44.463 --> 22:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
playground. Notably, very little
guards, few
guards were there.

22:47.866 --> 22:52.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HUSAIN HAQQANI: And they justify
killing the
Muslims as well on grounds that
this is necessary

22:52.571 --> 22:54.373 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for advancing their cause.

22:54.406 --> 23:01.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two things are at play here.
One, Pakistan's
involvement with jihadi groups
initially was

23:01.146 --> 23:07.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
primarily as a strategic
investment, which
was supposed to bring them
benefits through

23:07.953 --> 23:09.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
influence in Afghanistan and...

23:09.455 --> 23:10.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At the highest
levels.

23:10.990 --> 23:14.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HUSAIN HAQQANI: And the
liberation of Jammu
and Kashmir from India.

23:14.126 --> 23:20.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That has backfired. Now, even
though it has
backfired, Pakistan has been
very selective

23:20.165 --> 23:25.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in going after these jihadi
groups. And that
is the reason why the jihadi
groups pick up

23:25.771 --> 23:31.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
specific targets like Shias or
Ahmadis or
Christians, as a means of
improving their

23:31.610 --> 23:38.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recruitment, playing on various
kinds of polarization,
and taking advantage of that to
advance in

23:38.183 --> 23:39.985 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
society further.

23:40.019 --> 23:42.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Pam Constable,
how much should
we look at this as an extension
of what ISIS

23:42.655 --> 23:47.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is doing in other parts of the
world, especially
in the Middle East, and how much
of this is

23:47.192 --> 23:48.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
internal to Pakistan?

23:48.994 --> 23:52.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAMELA CONSTABLE: I think it's
mostly internal,
but I think this group -- and I
think they

23:52.631 --> 23:59.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even said so -- groups like this
are taking
a leaf, taking an inspiration,
if you will,

23:59.071 --> 24:03.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from ISIS and saying, we can go
farther, we
can do more. You know, let's get
up to the

24:03.309 --> 24:05.110 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
plate here.

24:05.144 --> 24:09.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's been going on a very
long time within
Pakistan, sort of creeping up
bomb by bomb

24:09.848 --> 24:17.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and attack by attack. It's not
new news. It's
the pace and the ferocity that
has increased.

24:17.189 --> 24:20.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that that is because
they feel
emboldened by ISIS.

24:20.326 --> 24:24.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HUSAIN HAQQANI: And the state
has not taken
the measures that are necessary
to isolate

24:24.596 --> 24:26.365 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
them all.

24:26.398 --> 24:29.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there are groups like
Lashkar-e-Taiba
and Jaish-e-Mohammed which
attack India. And

24:29.802 --> 24:34.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are spared. Once they are
spared, it's
very possible that some of their
members will

24:34.807 --> 24:37.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually join splinter groups
which will attack
Pakistan.

24:37.810 --> 24:41.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just very
quickly, in less
than a minute, to both of you,
when Prime

24:41.747 --> 24:45.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Minister Sharif says, "We're
going after the
people responsible, we're going
to something

24:45.851 --> 24:48.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about this," how realistic is
that?

24:48.053 --> 24:52.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HUSAIN HAQQANI: Well, people
like me at that
time say, I hope you can, but
Pakistan has

24:52.324 --> 24:57.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had eight prime ministers since
9/11, each
one of whom has said the same
thing. It hasn't

24:57.296 --> 24:58.564 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
happened.

24:58.597 --> 25:01.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need to examine why it hasn't
happened
and try to change that.

25:01.767 --> 25:05.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAMELA CONSTABLE: The government
says, unofficially,
that it's going to be sending in
paramilitary

25:05.804 --> 25:11.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rangers in Punjab, which has
been somewhat
successful in Karachi, a very
violent city.

25:11.043 --> 25:16.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's see if they can do it. I
have serious
doubts, but let's see if they
can do it. Maybe

25:16.315 --> 25:18.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it will be a turning point. One
can always
hope.

25:18.917 --> 25:24.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Pam Constable,
Ambassador Husain
Haqqani, we thank you both.

25:24.223 --> 25:31.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAMELA CONSTABLE: You're
welcome.

25:31.430 --> 25:35.901 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

25:35.934 --> 25:42.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
waste to wattage,
creating energy from livestock
manure; a chronicle

25:42.107 --> 25:48.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the 14-year manhunt for
Balkan war criminals;
and remembering an author with a
love for

25:48.514 --> 25:50.449 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the great outdoors. s

25:50.482 --> 25:57.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, from Bernie Sanders'
Saturday
sweep to the continued war of
words between

25:57.089 --> 26:01.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the two GOP front-runners,
there's lots to
talk about this Politics Monday
with Tamara

26:01.860 --> 26:07.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Keith of NPR, and joining us
from Phoenix,
Arizona tonight, Amy Walter of
The Cook Political

26:07.332 --> 26:09.034 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Report.

26:09.067 --> 26:11.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tam, three states for Bernie
Sanders this
weekend, does that mean he has
momentum?

26:11.370 --> 26:14.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: He's
definitely claiming momentum,
but he still

26:14.440 --> 26:16.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has something of a math problem.

26:17.009 --> 26:22.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Going into Saturday, he needed
to win 58 percent
off all the remaining delegates
to clinch

26:23.015 --> 26:29.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the nomination, pledged
delegates. After that
huge, huge series of wins by
larger margins

26:29.988 --> 26:35.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than his campaign expected, he
needs 57 percent
of all the remaining delegates.
And not all

26:35.160 --> 26:38.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the states that are coming up
are as favorable
to Sanders.

26:38.564 --> 26:43.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There aren't very many caucuses
left, and
there are several closed
primaries coming

26:43.869 --> 26:48.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up, including in New York state,
where Sanders
is planning to good up a good
fight, planning

26:48.774 --> 26:53.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to contest it, but it's a state
where Hillary
Clinton was elected senator
twice.

26:53.145 --> 26:58.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, Hawaii, Alaska
and Washington
state were fine victories for
what they were,

26:58.951 --> 27:00.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but they don't actually close
the gap that
much?

27:00.752 --> 27:06.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: They close the gap
a bit. He
did cut into Hillary Clinton's
delegate lead,

27:06.692 --> 27:12.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but it doesn't change the math
fundamentally.
He still has a lot of work to
do.

27:12.798 --> 27:16.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his campaign today in a
conference call
said that they're going to keep
fighting this

27:16.869 --> 27:22.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all the way, and they think that
neither candidate
will get a majority of the
pledged delegates

27:22.708 --> 27:27.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
needed to actually clinch it
with just pledged
delegates, so they're going for
superdelegates,

27:27.246 --> 27:29.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which are the sort of party
establishment
people.

27:29.548 --> 27:35.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Sanders' campaign today did
announce that
it has gotten one superdelegate
to support

27:35.320 --> 27:40.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him, one member of Congress,
Collin Peterson
from Minnesota. That's not a
tidal wave.

27:40.292 --> 27:46.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, Amy, that is --
there is still
on the Clinton side an
enthusiasm gap which

27:46.465 --> 27:49.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Sanders people say will make
all the difference.
Is there anything to that?

27:49.768 --> 27:54.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Well,
I think the real challenge for
Hillary Clinton

27:54.506 --> 28:00.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been the fact that Bernie
Sanders, to
his credit, has really driven
the terms of

28:00.646 --> 28:05.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this campaign and this debate.
It has been
on the terrain he wants to be
playing on.

28:05.884 --> 28:11.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The talk now is about issues
that Bernie Sanders
has been talking about really
since he first

28:12.024 --> 28:17.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got into politics. The talk
about income inequality,
the rigged economy, this is
where the debate

28:17.696 --> 28:22.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been, trade, et cetera. And
this may or
may not have been where Hillary
Clinton wanted

28:22.834 --> 28:25.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to have the debate, but it's
where she been
forced to go.

28:25.938 --> 28:29.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the end of the day, though,
completely
agree with Tamara, where it
becomes a math

28:29.808 --> 28:34.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problem. Not only has she
secured more delegates,
pledged delegates, the people
that you get

28:34.479 --> 28:39.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when you win primaries. She's
won more votes
than he has as well, so she has
more people

28:39.084 --> 28:41.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who have actually turned out and
voted for
her.

28:41.720 --> 28:45.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think you're right, Gwen,
that what
we're seeing, though, is an
enthusiasm gap

28:45.490 --> 28:50.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a group of voters that is
critical in
November, and that's younger
voters. We know

28:50.362 --> 28:54.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that it was critical for
President Obama in
his victories in 2008 and '12.

28:54.833 --> 28:59.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What Hillary Clinton is going to
have to do
is to prove to those younger
voters who keep

28:59.905 --> 29:04.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
turning out for Bernie Sanders,
even though
they probably intellectually
know he may not

29:04.710 --> 29:09.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be the nominee, but they keep
turning out
for him because there is
something about him

29:09.348 --> 29:14.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that strikes them, and that, she
has not figured
out how to crack.

29:14.086 --> 29:18.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, there has been
something
of a war of words between the
Sanders camp

29:18.557 --> 29:23.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the Hillary camp today, on
the Republican
side, the war of words has been
a little less

29:23.829 --> 29:26.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
elevated, shall we say?

29:26.164 --> 29:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's listen to Ted Cruz today.

29:27.966 --> 29:31.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
When it comes to civility, there
have been

29:31.203 --> 29:38.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other candidates who have
demonstrated a willingness
to go to the gutter, to make
personal attacks,

29:38.543 --> 29:43.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make sleazy attacks. I think
the people,
the American people are sick of
that. That

29:43.915 --> 29:49.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has no place in politics. No
candidate should
be doing what Donald Trump did
last week,

29:49.688 --> 29:52.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is attacking my wife and
attacking my
family.

29:52.157 --> 29:57.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, it's been
well-documented
everywhere how much of these
attacks and counterattacks

29:57.696 --> 30:02.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been going on between Trump
and Cruz,
and even John Kasich has said,
please, let's

30:02.167 --> 30:03.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
leave the family out of it.

30:04.002 --> 30:06.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I guess the question in this
is, how low
can they go, Tam?

30:06.938 --> 30:12.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: That's question I
ask a lot
again and again.

30:12.978 --> 30:18.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's not clear. There is
that old saying
-- and I don't know who gets
full credit for

30:18.483 --> 30:23.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it -- I think John McCain is one
of the people
who gets credit for it -- that
when you wrestle

30:23.622 --> 30:26.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with a pig, you both get dirty
and the pig
enjoys it.

30:26.692 --> 30:28.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Right.

30:28.460 --> 30:30.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: In this analogy,
and I'm not
calling Donald Trump a pig here,
because I

30:30.829 --> 30:31.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would not do that.

30:31.930 --> 30:33.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Be careful. No.

30:33.765 --> 30:37.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: However, the past
has proven
that people who wrestle with
Donald Trump

30:37.803 --> 30:41.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
end up worser -- worser -- worse
for wear.

30:41.206 --> 30:42.007 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

30:42.040 --> 30:43.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you think about that,
Amy?

30:43.275 --> 30:47.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Absolutely, it
doesn't do anybody
any good.

30:47.379 --> 30:53.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, listen, if you're the
Republican Party
right now, you are so -- just
the architects

30:53.285 --> 30:56.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Republican Party, or the
establishment
of the Republican Party, they
are desperate

30:56.655 --> 30:58.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to try to figure out a way to
bring this party
together.

30:58.924 --> 31:05.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This party has been now
fracturing and there
is -- the divisiveness is
significant, and

31:05.564 --> 31:09.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is not helping at all. And,
in fact,
if you want to look at the
trajectory for

31:09.868 --> 31:14.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Republican Party in its
approval ratings
over the course of this
campaign, it's only

31:14.172 --> 31:15.941 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gone like this.

31:15.974 --> 31:19.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is not helping the overall
-- whoever
the nominee ends up being. This
is not helping

31:19.945 --> 31:25.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the image of the Republican
Party. This isn't
helping Republicans in Congress.
And this

31:25.117 --> 31:31.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is going to be the major
challenge for Republicans
going forward, which is, how do
they unify

31:31.656 --> 31:39.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
these disparate parts of
themselves, when
the candidates can't even have a
civil conversation,

31:39.998 --> 31:42.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
nonetheless agree on the
direction forward?

31:42.234 --> 31:45.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let me ask you both
about the
story in The New York Times
today Nick Confessore

31:45.270 --> 31:52.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wrote about the fact that the
Republican establishment
finds itself in such a corner,
because the

31:52.744 --> 31:58.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
big donors, the big people who
go to the cocktail
parties didn't see the Trump
train coming.

31:58.383 --> 32:00.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: It's a challenge.

32:00.452 --> 32:07.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is this thought that
the Chamber
of Commerce Republican Party is
not the Republican

32:07.893 --> 32:14.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Party of people who went through
a wrenching
recession, who feel like their
lives are not

32:14.733 --> 32:21.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back, even if the jobs report
says they are.
Their wages are stagnant. You
know, they don't

32:21.106 --> 32:24.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know how they feel about trade
deals.

32:24.242 --> 32:31.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is Donald Trump, and
he is sort
of emoting in the very way that
people -- he's

32:31.883 --> 32:33.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saying things that people want
to hear.

32:33.785 --> 32:38.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Amy, it also seems
that we're
not just talking about
blue-collar, underemployed,

32:38.423 --> 32:41.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unemployed people. We're talking
white-collar
businesspeople, too.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.061 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's right.

32:43.094 --> 32:46.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is what Donald Trump has
done very well,
which is he has definitely
tapped into that

32:46.064 --> 32:51.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anger and that angst with
blue-collar, working-class
Americans, but he's also doing
well or well

32:51.603 --> 32:57.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enough with the so-called
establishment, Chamber
of Commerce types, many of whom
I speak with

32:57.342 --> 33:01.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they say, you know, the
thing about Donald
Trump is, yes, he says things
that are outrageous,

33:01.179 --> 33:04.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no, I don't believe he's going
to follow through
on a lot of things that he says
he is going

33:04.850 --> 33:10.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do, but I do believe he's a
good businessman
and a good negotiator. And they
say, we just

33:10.121 --> 33:12.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
simply need to shake things up.

33:12.090 --> 33:16.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So both -- he's able to win
because he has
a group of voters who believe
he's a hard-liner

33:17.028 --> 33:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who isn't going to negotiate or
compensate
in any way, shape and form, and
then he's

33:21.833 --> 33:26.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
able to get another group of
voters who believe
his success is based on the fact
that he's

33:26.638 --> 33:28.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
such a good negotiator.

33:28.607 --> 33:33.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why it's been a challenge
for the never-Trump
folks to stop him, because he's
not just pulling

33:33.278 --> 33:35.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
off one group of voters.

33:35.180 --> 33:39.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, and the
enthusiasm gap on
the Republican side seems to
work in his favor

33:39.351 --> 33:42.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- I mean, the Democratic side
-- seems to
work on his favor on the
Republican side.

33:42.921 --> 33:46.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Amy Walter, Tamara Keith, it's
Monday. Thank
you both.

33:46.925 --> 33:50.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

33:51.029 --> 33:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

33:55.166 --> 34:01.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now a unique look
at a completely
different kind of power: the
potential of

34:01.640 --> 34:04.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
organic waste as a renewable
energy source.

34:04.876 --> 34:10.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A fair warning of sorts for
those of you either
preparing or eating dinner,
given the subject

34:10.048 --> 34:11.449 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
matter.

34:11.483 --> 34:16.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Public Media's Inside Energy and
Rocky Mountain
PBS Dan Boyce explains.

34:16.354 --> 34:24.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN BOYCE: Jon Slutsky has been
milking cows
since the early 1980s, his
professional life

34:24.396 --> 34:31.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rising and falling with what his
livestock
excrete, and not just from their
udders.

34:31.269 --> 34:35.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON SLUTSKY, La Luna Dairy: It's
like a buffet
for the manure connoisseur.

34:35.373 --> 34:42.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN BOYCE: Manure, the dirty
dark side of
working with these adorable
Holsteins, is

34:42.213 --> 34:48.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the enormous logistical
challenge of dealing
with waste. Slutsky considers
himself an environmentally

34:48.453 --> 34:54.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conscious guy, so he worries
about all the
methane produced as that manure
breaks down.

34:54.359 --> 34:59.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON SLUTSKY: Then the whole
methane thing
and greenhouse gases, all of
that is more

34:59.931 --> 35:02.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
important to many in our
industry.

35:02.968 --> 35:10.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN BOYCE: If only he lived
about 50 miles
southeast. This is Heartland
Biogas, a new

35:10.308 --> 35:16.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
facility bring in truckload
after truckload
of manure from nearby dairies.
All of the

35:16.881 --> 35:20.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
buildings and pools here add up
to what's
called a digester.

35:20.685 --> 35:25.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB YOST, A1 Organics: You can
think of the
digester the same as your own
guts, if you

35:25.557 --> 35:26.658 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
can.

35:26.691 --> 35:27.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN BOYCE: So, this is where all
the cow poop
goes?

35:28.026 --> 35:29.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BOB YOST: This is -- the cow
poop ends up
right here.

35:29.961 --> 35:36.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN BOYCE: Bob Yost is showing
me around Heartland.
What's brought in gets
liquefied, cooked up

35:36.301 --> 35:42.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and mixed together, speeding up
the production
of methane. And, here, they
actually want

35:42.307 --> 35:48.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
methane. With a little more
refining, that
methane becomes chemically
identical to the

35:48.179 --> 35:51.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
natural gas drilled from
underground.

35:51.383 --> 35:56.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The gas produced here goes
straight into a
pipeline on site, just like any
other natural

35:56.388 --> 35:58.023 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
gas.

35:58.056 --> 36:01.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB YOST: It's injected into the
pipeline
and then it's delivered to
anywhere in the

36:01.893 --> 36:03.728 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

36:03.762 --> 36:07.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAN BOYCE: Destructive
greenhouse gases that
would be escaping into the
atmosphere anyway

36:07.799 --> 36:10.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going to good use.

36:10.502 --> 36:17.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dairy farms have been building
digesters for
years, but the technology is
advancing and

36:17.042 --> 36:22.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
diversifying. It turns out, the
way to get
the most methane from your
digester is to

36:22.680 --> 36:25.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have a mixture of manure and
food scraps.

36:25.850 --> 36:29.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: I got the Turkey bacon
guac burger.

36:29.521 --> 36:33.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAN BOYCE: That's where
restaurants like Denver's
Park Burger come in.

36:33.658 --> 36:36.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
T.J. MCREYNOLDS, Park Burger: We
do have a
couple of gray recycling bins,
as well as

36:36.895 --> 36:39.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bins with no bag, which is our
composting
setup.

36:39.297 --> 36:44.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN BOYCE: General manager T.J.
McReynolds
pays a little bit more for
composting services

36:44.269 --> 36:48.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on top of his trash bill. He
thought it would
all end up as mulch somewhere.

T.J. MCREYNOLDS: Never once did
I even consider
it being used for natural gas.

36:51.876 --> 36:58.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN BOYCE: Hundreds of Colorado
restaurants,
schools and groceries have begun
sending their

36:58.183 --> 36:59.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
scraps to Heartland.

36:59.918 --> 37:06.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB YOST: There could be 25, 30
semi-loads
per day eventually of food waste
coming in,

37:06.224 --> 37:07.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and then the manure is added to
that.

37:07.992 --> 37:12.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN BOYCE: The company Yost
works with, A1
Organics, coordinates the
delivery of all

37:12.897 --> 37:17.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that food waste. It comes in all
types, a
lot of it still in packaging.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BOB YOST: Well, this had sweet
tea in it.

37:19.137 --> 37:24.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN BOYCE: Luckily this machine
at the digester
can tear all that apart to get
to the valuable

37:24.976 --> 37:27.312 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
organics inside.

37:27.345 --> 37:35.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unfortunately, all of this is a
prospect tantalizingly
out of reach for Slutsky. His
farm is too

37:35.120 --> 37:41.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
far from the Heartland facility,
and too small
to build his own primitive
digester, which

37:41.426 --> 37:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really only makes financial
sense for operations
with 2,000 cows or more. Slutsky
has 1,500.

37:48.099 --> 37:53.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON SLUTSKY: Well, we have a
business to run,
and it's not going to do us any
good if we

37:53.771 --> 37:56.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
build a digester and go out of
business.

37:56.641 --> 38:01.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN BOYCE: It's a tough position
to be in:
big enough to have to deal with
mounds and

38:01.446 --> 38:07.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mounds of manure, too small to
make any money
off it. It's where most American
dairies find

38:07.819 --> 38:11.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
themselves, their methane
remaining wasted.

38:11.122 --> 38:15.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there is another source of
biogas, sitting
right under our noses.

38:15.794 --> 38:18.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN TONELLO, Persigo Wastewater
Services Manager:
This is what eight million
gallons of sewage

38:18.530 --> 38:20.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a day looks like.

38:20.365 --> 38:26.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN BOYCE: Yes, human waste can
also be turned
into power. We're at the
wastewater treatment

38:26.171 --> 38:32.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
plant in Grand Junction,
Colorado. And that
distinctive smell of sewage is
starting to

38:32.310 --> 38:38.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
smell like money to manager Dan
Tonello. The
plant has had a digester for
decades, but

38:38.883 --> 38:41.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most of the methane used to be
flared off
into the air.

38:41.352 --> 38:44.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN TONELLO: Not good for the
environment
and a waste of a wonderful
resource.

38:44.422 --> 38:50.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN BOYCE: So the city spent
just under $3
million for the natural gas
refining equipment.

38:50.228 --> 38:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, rather than just putting it
into a pipeline
or generating electricity with
it, Tonello

38:56.034 --> 38:57.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
had another idea.

38:57.735 --> 39:00.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN TONELLO: In the evening,
when the trucks
are done with their routes, they
hook up,

39:00.371 --> 39:02.140 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fill up.

39:02.173 --> 39:06.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN BOYCE: Grand Junction has
been replacing
an aging fleet of garbage trucks
and buses

39:06.611 --> 39:13.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with natural gas vehicles fueled
mostly by
the human-sourced gas from the
treatment plant.

39:13.651 --> 39:17.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonello says Grand Junction is
the first city
in the nation to do that.

39:17.755 --> 39:22.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN TONELLO: We're looking at
hundreds of
thousands of dollars a year
being saved by

39:22.293 --> 39:23.928 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
implementing this process.

39:23.962 --> 39:26.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOANNA UNDERWOOD, Energy Vision:
That's a
model for small wastewater
treatment plants

39:26.831 --> 39:28.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
anywhere in the country.

39:28.733 --> 39:32.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN BOYCE: Joanna Underwood
works with Energy
Vision, an environmental group
which promotes

39:32.737 --> 39:39.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the use of this renewable
natural gas. She
says using biogas to run a fleet
of vehicles

39:39.877 --> 39:42.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is the most efficient way to use
a digester.

39:42.380 --> 39:47.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOANNA UNDERWOOD: Every time you
convert a
bus fleet or a refuse truck
fleet or a produce

39:47.552 --> 39:52.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
delivery fleet to renewable
natural gas, you
have had a huge impact.

39:52.257 --> 39:57.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN BOYCE: Because, more often
than not, those
natural gas vehicles are
replacing older,

39:57.862 --> 40:03.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more polluting diesel trucks.
Underwood says,
if all the organic waste in the
country were

40:03.568 --> 40:09.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gathered from dairies, food
producers and
sewage plants, current
technologies could

40:09.440 --> 40:17.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
produce enough natural gas to
replace about
half of the diesel fuel used in
the U.S. transportation

40:17.348 --> 40:19.284 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sector.

40:19.317 --> 40:25.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And wastewater treatment plants
could provide
as much as 12 percent of the
nation's electricity,

40:25.089 --> 40:31.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
turning waste into a serious
powerhouse.

40:31.229 --> 40:42.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Dan
Boyce reporting
from Grand Junction, Colorado.

40:42.540 --> 40:55.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Last Thursday, a
U.N. tribunal
convicted former Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan

40:55.720 --> 41:00.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Karadzic of war crimes and
genocide in the
1990s Balkan wars.

41:00.625 --> 41:05.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A look at how tough it was to
hunt down those
indicted is the focus of the
newest addition

41:05.496 --> 41:07.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the "NewsHour" Bookshelf.

41:07.131 --> 41:09.434 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Margaret Warner has that.

41:09.467 --> 41:16.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The genocidal
crimes of the
1990s Balkan wars stunned the
world, mass

41:16.874 --> 41:20.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
killings, concentration camps,
systematic
rape.

41:20.478 --> 41:26.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many, but by no means all of the
perpetrators
were the majority Serbs,
starting with Serbian

41:26.084 --> 41:32.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Slobodan Milosevic.
The U.N. set
up an international tribunal to
investigate

41:32.056 --> 41:37.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and indict some 161 people it
found most responsible.

41:37.462 --> 41:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The challenge was to actually
apprehend them.
How they did so is captured in a
gripping

41:42.667 --> 41:49.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new book by Julian Borger,
longtime correspondent
and editor at The Guardian
newspaper, titled

41:49.207 --> 41:55.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"The Butcher's Trail: How the
Search for Balkan
War Criminals Became the World's
Most Successful

41:55.546 --> 41:56.447 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Manhunt."

41:56.481 --> 41:58.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Julian Borger, welcome.

41:58.349 --> 42:03.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You open this book with a really
vivid account
of the capture of the last of
these criminals

42:03.254 --> 42:06.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a forest in Serbia. Who was
he and what
had he done?

42:06.557 --> 42:07.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIAN BORGER, "The Butcher's
Trail: How the
Search for Balkan War Criminals
Became the

42:07.725 --> 42:09.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
World's Most Successful
Manhunt": He was Goran
Hadzic.

42:09.527 --> 42:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he used to run a Serb
statelet inside
Croatia which had been carved
out of Croatia

42:16.033 --> 42:21.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by what was called ethnic
cleansing, a euphemism
for mass killing of other
ethnicities. So

42:21.973 --> 42:25.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he had overseen that killing on
a large scale.

42:25.443 --> 42:31.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: And you had a
particularly
horrible example, more than 260
men and boys

42:31.115 --> 42:32.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
taken to the forest and just
executed.

42:33.017 --> 42:39.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIAN BORGER: Yes, that was the
Vukovar massacre,
and that was the first
large-scale massacre

42:39.090 --> 42:42.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since the Nazi era. So it came
as a complete
shock to Europe.

42:42.527 --> 42:49.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: So you covered
these wars.
How typical was Hadzic in terms
of the perpetrators?

42:49.700 --> 42:56.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In other words, what did you
discover about
what drove these people into the
most grotesque,

42:56.507 --> 42:58.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
kind of savage brutality?

42:58.409 --> 43:04.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIAN BORGER: A lot of them, a
lot of the
people who rose to prominence
and ended up

43:04.615 --> 43:10.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
indicted war criminals, as war
criminals,
came from very ordinary
backgrounds.

43:10.588 --> 43:17.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the lesson that I
learned by going
through their life stories is
that there are

43:17.762 --> 43:24.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these people all around us. And
when a permissive
atmosphere is created in which
that they can

43:24.435 --> 43:31.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rule the roost, then it creates
the conditions
for which these kind of mass
murders can take

43:31.042 --> 43:32.877 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
part.

43:32.910 --> 43:35.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: And how much of
it was driven
by ethnic hatreds? I mean, you
had Christian

43:35.513 --> 43:41.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Serbs and Croats against Bosnian
Muslims,
but also against each other, vs.
just being

43:41.252 --> 43:42.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
perpetrated by outright
psychopaths?

43:42.920 --> 43:46.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JULIAN BORGER: It was
perpetrated by political
leaders.

43:46.290 --> 43:52.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was political leaders who in
the -- with
the aim of expanding their
territory and consolidating

43:52.964 --> 44:00.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their own power set one ethnic
group against
another and brought nationalism
to the fore

44:00.271 --> 44:05.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a replacement for communism,
which was
in collapse. And so they offered
something

44:05.209 --> 44:12.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that seemed visceral and
certain. And they
drove this largely for their own
political

44:12.416 --> 44:14.318 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
motives.

44:14.352 --> 44:17.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: What's really,
truly groundbreaking
about this book is what it took
to apprehend

44:17.922 --> 44:19.724 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

44:19.757 --> 44:24.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The International Tribunal
headed by a Canadian
judge, Louise Arbour, didn't get
much help

44:24.362 --> 44:30.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
apprehending them from this NATO
stabilization
force that was, the U.S., the
Brits, et cetera.

44:30.268 --> 44:32.069 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why not?

44:32.103 --> 44:36.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIAN BORGER: Well, when the
NATO went in,
initially as a peacekeeping
force, all it

44:36.407 --> 44:41.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wanted to do was keep the peace.
It didn't
want to do any other tasks that
might be risky,

44:41.345 --> 44:46.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that might risk upsetting the
peace. They
called it mission creep.

44:46.617 --> 44:52.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's hard now to look back at
that time before
9/11 and remember how
casualty-averse, how

44:52.590 --> 44:57.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
risk-averse the U.S. military,
the British
military were. It was said, if
you were a

44:57.128 --> 45:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
general officer at that time,
you were unlikely
to get another star if you had
casualties

45:02.066 --> 45:03.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
under your watch.

45:03.868 --> 45:09.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: You managed to
get those
who did hunt these men down to
talk you, for

45:09.173 --> 45:11.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the first time really that they
ever had.

45:11.809 --> 45:13.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you could sum it up, who were
they?

45:13.711 --> 45:20.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIAN BORGER: It was a shifting
cast of characters
involved, diplomats, special
forces from six

45:20.952 --> 45:24.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nations altogether, intelligence
agencies
from others.

45:25.022 --> 45:30.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the first one is an
interesting arrest,
the first arrest specifically
for the War

45:30.628 --> 45:35.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Crimes Tribunal in The Hague,
which was kind
of an international pickup team,
working for

45:35.900 --> 45:43.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.N. that involved an
American diplomat
general, an American prosecutor,
a British

45:43.341 --> 45:50.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policeman, a Czech homicide
detective, and
a newly formed Polish special
forces unit

45:50.481 --> 45:55.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that had only a few years been
on opposite
sides of the Iron Curtain.

45:55.086 --> 46:00.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, together, they did
something that NATO
at that time was afraid of
doing. They took

46:00.725 --> 46:07.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a risk in order to carry out the
U.N. mandate
to make an arrest. And that
really broke the

46:07.098 --> 46:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- opened the floodgates.

46:09.000 --> 46:12.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: What did it
take to get these
guys? Some of them were hiding
in plain sight.

46:12.370 --> 46:14.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIAN BORGER: They knew where
they were.
And it was just a question of
getting them

46:14.772 --> 46:21.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a place where there was
unlikely to be
collateral damage, passersby
would be hurt.

46:21.278 --> 46:25.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So it was a question of
following them, often
in their cars, stopping the car,
ripping them

46:25.916 --> 46:33.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out, the kind of scenes that
have since become
familiar after Bosnia in the
form of renditions.

46:33.057 --> 46:34.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Rendition.

46:34.892 --> 46:36.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIAN BORGER: These were the
kind of early
forms of rendition. The
important difference

46:36.761 --> 46:42.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, they were underpinned by
Security Council
resolutions and a body of
international law.

46:42.333 --> 46:47.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Jumping
forward, did this
have any deterrent effect, the
success of

46:47.538 --> 46:53.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these apprehensions and so many
of them brought
to justice? I mean, we see mass
atrocities

46:53.177 --> 46:57.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of civilians now going on in
Syria and other
parts of the Middle East, and
the perpetrators

46:57.648 --> 46:59.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't seem at all afraid of
being prosecuted.

46:59.750 --> 47:06.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIAN BORGER: Well, I think
this manhunt
represented the high watermark
in terms of

47:06.924 --> 47:12.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enforcement of international
humanitarian
law, and I think it pushed back
the boundaries

47:12.263 --> 47:14.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of impunity for these kinds of
mass crimes.

47:14.799 --> 47:23.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think, since that manhunt,
that achievement
has been allowed to unravel. The
Hague War

47:23.474 --> 47:27.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Crimes Tribunal had
international support.
Its permanent successor, the
International

47:27.912 --> 47:32.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Criminal Court, hasn't had that
support from
the big powers, from the U.S.,
from Russia

47:32.683 --> 47:35.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or China and India.

47:35.519 --> 47:40.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And because of that, it doesn't
have that
clout. It hasn't been able to
enforce its

47:40.991 --> 47:46.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
judgments. And I think the
consequences is
the return of impunity. And we
see the results

47:46.897 --> 47:53.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of that now in the Middle East,
in Syria,
in Iraq, where terrorism has had
its roots

47:53.070 --> 47:55.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in mass crimes committed by
regimes.

47:55.306 --> 47:58.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Well, a very
disappointing
result.

47:58.576 --> 48:04.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Julian Borger, author of "The
Butcher's Trail,"
thank you.

48:04.615 --> 48:10.187 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIAN BORGER: Thank you.

48:10.221 --> 48:17.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight:
remembering
one of the nation's most
versatile writers.

48:17.161 --> 48:18.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

48:18.963 --> 48:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Jim Harrison was
a prolific
writer of fiction and poetry,
most often of

48:23.134 --> 48:28.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
men and women in the drama of
rural America
and the natural world. Among his
best known

48:28.105 --> 48:32.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
works are "Legends of the Fall,"
"Dalva,"
and the more recent "Brown Dog."

48:32.309 --> 48:36.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A new novel, "The Ancient
Minstrel," came
out just this month, and a new
volume of poetry,

48:37.014 --> 48:41.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Dead Man's Float," earlier this
year. He'd
been a Hollywood screenwriter, a
food writer

48:41.786 --> 48:47.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for "Esquire" magazine, a man of
many pursuits
who lived large and died this
weekend at age

48:47.458 --> 48:48.926 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
78.

48:48.959 --> 48:52.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2009, I visited Harrison at
his home in
Montana. Here's a look back.

48:52.897 --> 48:58.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM HARRISON, Author: Other than
fishing and
a little bird-hunting, all I do
is write.

48:58.169 --> 49:02.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Harrison is a
determined outsider,
in all senses.

49:02.373 --> 49:10.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM HARRISON: You really get a
hang of the
country, rather than be stuck in
what I call

49:10.548 --> 49:13.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the geo-piety of the Eastern
Seaboard.

49:13.484 --> 49:16.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Careful, because
that's where
I am.

49:16.120 --> 49:19.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIM HARRISON: I know it, but you
deserve it,
too. But it does happen.

49:19.623 --> 49:26.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now 71, Jim
Harrison is a Falstaffian
figure: blind in his left eye
from a childhood

49:26.764 --> 49:34.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
accident, chain-smoking his
American Spirit
cigarettes, part wild man, part
cultivated

49:34.271 --> 49:42.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
literary lion, who peppers his
speech with
talk of birds and great poets of
the past.

49:42.146 --> 49:48.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's poetry, in fact, that has
remained Harrison's
first love. His new collection
is called "In

49:48.152 --> 49:50.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Search of Small Gods."

49:50.087 --> 49:56.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM HARRISON: You sense those
spirits in certain,
often remote places, whether
it's the spirit

49:56.994 --> 50:02.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of animals, the spirit of trees.
So those
are the small gods.

50:02.132 --> 50:06.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And they appear
throughout
these poetry, so it sounds like
they're coming

50:06.036 --> 50:07.905 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from the walks.

50:07.938 --> 50:13.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM HARRISON: I think that's
true, you know,
because sometimes you have
little breakthroughs.

50:13.477 --> 50:24.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I've known this group of ravens
for 19 years,
for instance, Chihuahuan ravens,
Mexican ravens.

50:24.555 --> 50:29.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And last year, several times,
they began to
take walks with me.

50:29.593 --> 50:31.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But then you put
them into
poetry?

50:31.528 --> 50:40.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM HARRISON: Yes, then you do.
You know,
what is it that Blake said? How
do we know

50:40.304 --> 50:47.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but that every bird who cuts the
airy way
is an immense world of delight
close to our

50:48.012 --> 50:54.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
senses five, that perception?
What is possible
in the natural world?

50:54.818 --> 51:02.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have been inordinately
productive in the
last five or six years, and I
think it was

51:02.927 --> 51:06.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
boiling down your life.

51:06.330 --> 51:14.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dhogan (ph), an old 14th-century
Zen philosopher,
talked about cooking down your
life. You cook

51:14.371 --> 51:20.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down your life and then the
sauce is just
right, so you can let go.

51:20.044 --> 51:24.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There is, in
fact, much about
loss and grief in Harrison's
writing these

51:24.982 --> 51:30.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
days. His brother and a number
of friends
have died in recent years. And
on our walk

51:30.187 --> 51:35.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
near Antelope Butte, he told me
of a talk
he'd had with one of them, a
Native American,

51:35.526 --> 51:37.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just before his death.

51:37.361 --> 51:41.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM HARRISON: And I was really
falling apart,
and he says: "Don't be upset.
These things

51:41.699 --> 51:45.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happen to people." Isn't that an
incredible
thing to say?

51:45.836 --> 51:46.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

51:46.837 --> 51:49.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Of course, a lot of characters
in your books...

51:49.139 --> 51:50.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JIM HARRISON: ... are like that,
yes.

51:50.975 --> 51:52.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: ... are like
that, huh? "These
things happen." They go through
all kinds

51:52.743 --> 51:54.578 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of tragedies.

51:54.611 --> 52:00.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM HARRISON: Well, that is that
Native American
stoicism. You know, they tend to
see the whole

52:00.617 --> 52:02.353 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
arc.

52:02.386 --> 52:09.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Moving higher my thumping chest
recites the
names of a dozen friends who
have died in

52:09.193 --> 52:16.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
recent years, names now
incomprehensible as
the mountains across the river
far behind

52:16.633 --> 52:23.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me. I will always be walking up
toward Antelope
Butte. Perhaps, when we die, our
names are

52:23.741 --> 52:29.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taken from us by a divine magnet
and they
are free to flutter here and
there within

52:29.446 --> 52:37.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the bodies of birds. I will be a
simple crow
who can reach the top of
Antelope Butte."

GWEN IFILL: Also on the

The weather phenomenon known as
El Nino has

52:58.042 --> 53:03.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a new cousin. Atmospheric
scientists have
identified an ocean temperature
anomaly that

53:03.447 --> 53:07.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can predict droughts on the East
Coast up
to two months before they hit.
Read how the

53:07.918 --> 53:12.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
team plans to build an alert
system based
on these findings. That's on our

"NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:16.960 --> 53:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Tuesday, our series on foster

For all of us here at the "PBS
NewsHour,"

53:31.708 --> 53:40.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you and good night.
