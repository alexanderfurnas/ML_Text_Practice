JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:06.139 --> 00:07.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.875 --> 00:11.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: The
Congressional
Budget Office releases projected
costs of

00:11.478 --> 00:16.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the GOP's health care bill,
while the White
House and Republicans question
the agency's

00:16.817 --> 00:18.685 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
analysis.

00:18.719 --> 00:23.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: ahead of Rex Tillerson's
trip to Asia,
a look at the secretary of
state's low profile

00:23.657 --> 00:25.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the Trump administration.

00:25.893 --> 00:31.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I sit down with former Vice
President
Al Gore to talk about restoring
the United

00:31.064 --> 00:34.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States information ecosystem in
the age of
Trump.

00:34.668 --> 00:39.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AL GORE, Former Vice President
of the United
States: A false belief collides
with physical

00:39.640 --> 00:41.375 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
reality.

00:41.408 --> 00:45.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are seeing every night on the
television
news now a nature hike through
the Book of

00:45.145 --> 00:46.380 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Revelation.

00:46.413 --> 00:53.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:53.086 --> 00:55.789 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:55.822 --> 01:05.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Congressional
Budget Office
is out tonight with its analysis
of the Republican

01:05.632 --> 01:07.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
health care bill.

01:07.467 --> 01:13.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It includes the nonpartisan
agency's best
estimates on cost, coverage and
other issues.

01:13.206 --> 01:16.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our Lisa Desjardins has been
looking at the
numbers, and she joins me now.

01:17.010 --> 01:18.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa, what's the headline here?

01:18.512 --> 01:20.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: There are
several, but let's
start with a very big one.

01:20.247 --> 01:23.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What will this mean for health
insurance coverage
for Americans?

01:23.250 --> 01:26.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Congressional Budget Office
looked at
the numbers and found that this
Republican

01:26.153 --> 01:32.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bill in just the first year,
next year, would
mean some 14 million Americans
who have insurance

01:33.026 --> 01:34.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
now wouldn't have it.

01:34.561 --> 01:38.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The ranks of the uninsured would
go up and
they would continue to go up.

01:38.065 --> 01:40.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Next year, that's because, Judy,
they say
the mandate ends.

01:40.200 --> 01:44.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So people would choose no longer
to have coverage
because there is no mandate
penalty.

01:45.005 --> 01:51.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That shifts in 2024, where we
see now another
24 million Americans or a total
of 24 million

01:51.345 --> 01:52.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Americans over now uninsured.

01:52.946 --> 01:57.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it grows because of the
Medicaid changes,
largely Medicaid cuts.

01:57.718 --> 02:01.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you were
telling that members
of Congress, that the White
House and others

02:01.421 --> 02:02.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have already been commenting on
this.

02:02.656 --> 02:03.857 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

02:03.890 --> 02:05.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had very quick reaction from
congressional
Democrats.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's start with House Minority
Leader Nancy
Pelosi.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.396 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:09.429 --> 02:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), House
Minority Leader:
The CBO has reported that the
Republican bill

02:13.934 --> 02:21.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pushes 24 million people out of
health care,
off of health coverage.

02:21.508 --> 02:23.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a remarkable figure.

02:23.310 --> 02:29.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It speaks so eloquently to the
cruelty of
a bill that the speaker called
an act of mercy.

02:30.017 --> 02:34.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know if he thinks it's
an act of mercy
to all the people who will lose
coverage

02:34.488 --> 02:37.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And, Judy,
Republicans didn't
waste time either.

02:37.457 --> 02:41.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House -- new Health
and Human Services
Secretary Tom Price spoke.

02:41.395 --> 02:44.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He thinks these numbers on CBO
coverage are
wrong.

02:44.197 --> 02:48.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM PRICE, U.S. Health and Human
Services
Secretary: It basically says
that we will

02:48.769 --> 02:54.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be right back at pre-Obamacare
status with
about 40 million people
uninsured in this

02:54.741 --> 02:56.543 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

02:56.576 --> 02:59.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We believe that the plan that
we're putting
in place is going to insure more
individuals

02:59.513 --> 03:01.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than currently are insured.

03:01.281 --> 03:04.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we think that the CBO simply
has it wrong.

03:04.818 --> 03:08.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lisa, CBO,
Congressional
Budget Office, also looked at
what is going

03:08.789 --> 03:10.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to happen to premiums and their
costs.

03:10.657 --> 03:11.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What did they say about that?

03:11.658 --> 03:12.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

03:12.659 --> 03:13.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is the other big personal
effect of this.

03:13.627 --> 03:14.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And is a mixed bag.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's look at what the CBO found
there.

03:16.463 --> 03:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the next two years, the
Congressional Budget
Office found that actually this
plan will

03:20.167 --> 03:22.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
increase premiums overall.

03:22.569 --> 03:24.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say that's because healthy
people will
leave.

03:24.671 --> 03:28.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The mandate penalty is removed
and people
that don't have to have care
will leave.

03:28.909 --> 03:34.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But then, after that, they say,
that the premiums
will actually go down.

03:34.614 --> 03:38.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's because there will be
more choices,
that there will no longer be
these bronze

03:38.552 --> 03:39.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
plans, silver plans.

03:39.920 --> 03:43.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There will be bare-bones
insurance plans that
are not allowed now.

03:43.123 --> 03:45.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they think more people will
choose them,
premiums will go down.

03:45.725 --> 03:47.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But one very important note,
Judy.

03:47.494 --> 03:48.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They think it's by age.

03:48.929 --> 03:52.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So premiums will likely go up
for older Americans
in general.

03:52.632 --> 03:55.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which people we
will of course
be paying attention to across
the board.

03:55.635 --> 03:58.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, finally, Lisa, what about
the effect
on the budget?

03:58.238 --> 03:59.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

03:59.306 --> 04:01.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is something Republicans
care about dearly.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The CBO found something that
Republicans like.

04:03.043 --> 04:08.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say that this Republican
plan would save
over $300 billion in the deficit
over the

04:08.582 --> 04:10.050 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
next 10 years.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How does it do that?

04:11.852 --> 04:15.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, a large part of that is
the Medicaid
cuts, over $800 billion in
Medicaid cuts in

04:15.622 --> 04:17.357 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

04:17.390 --> 04:19.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Republicans for a long time
have felt
that Medicaid spending was out
of control.

04:19.826 --> 04:20.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're reining it in here.

04:20.994 --> 04:22.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's going to be a very big
debate.

04:22.796 --> 04:26.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Lisa
Desjardins, I know
you have only had an hour or two
to look at

04:26.199 --> 04:27.167 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It came out after 4:00 Eastern
this afternoon.

04:28.902 --> 04:30.170 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

04:30.203 --> 04:32.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will continue to look at
the impact
of the CBO report.

04:32.539 --> 04:33.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: My pleasure.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

04:35.475 --> 04:40.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
Northeastern
U.S. is bracing for a late
winter snowstorm

04:40.147 --> 04:43.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that could bring up to 20 inches
of snow tonight.

04:43.283 --> 04:47.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A blizzard watch is in effect
through tomorrow
evening for New York City, parts
of New Jersey

04:47.787 --> 04:49.589 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Connecticut.

04:49.623 --> 04:53.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Preparations were under way
today in New York
and elsewhere, with mayors
urging people to

04:53.994 --> 04:56.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stay inside and not take
chances.

04:56.329 --> 05:00.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL DE BLASIO (D), Mayor of New
York: This
kind of snow coming down this
intensely, again,

05:00.600 --> 05:01.568 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it's dangerous.

05:01.601 --> 05:03.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It'll be dangerous to be on the
roads.

05:03.336 --> 05:08.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to urge everyone now to
make plans
to not be out on the roads
tomorrow, first

05:08.942 --> 05:14.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and foremost for your own
safety, but second
and very important, so that all
of the good

05:14.614 --> 05:18.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
people at the sanitation
department can do
their job and clear the roads.

05:18.285 --> 05:21.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Even before it
arrived, the
storm caused disruptions.

05:22.022 --> 05:28.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Airlines canceled some 6,000
flights, and
New York City called off school
tomorrow.

05:28.261 --> 05:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The state of Washington went to
federal court
today to stop President Trump's
revised travel

05:33.066 --> 05:34.968 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ban.

05:35.001 --> 05:40.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The executive order temporarily
blocks refugees
and travelers from six
Muslim-majority countries.

05:40.607 --> 05:45.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
California is joining
Washington's suit, along
with Minnesota, New York and
Oregon.

05:45.845 --> 05:49.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hawaii has already filed its own
challenge.

05:49.316 --> 05:54.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House is now saying
the president
wasn't speaking literally when
he accused

05:54.087 --> 05:57.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Obama of wiretapping
Trump Tower.

05:57.691 --> 06:01.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Adviser Kellyanne Conway
suggested over the
weekend that it might have been
some other

06:01.861 --> 06:03.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
form of surveillance.

06:03.296 --> 06:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, she acknowledged that she
has no evidence.

06:06.366 --> 06:09.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Press Secretary Sean Spicer
followed up at
the daily White House briefing.

06:09.936 --> 06:12.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
He doesn't really think that
President Obama

06:12.572 --> 06:15.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
went up and tapped his phone
personally.

06:15.642 --> 06:19.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that there's no
question that
in the Obama administration that
there were

06:19.479 --> 06:23.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actions about surveillance and
other activities
that occurred in the 2016
election.

06:23.416 --> 06:28.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president used the word
wiretap in quotes
to mean broadly surveillance and
other activities.

06:28.989 --> 06:33.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The House
Intelligence Committee
also asked that the Justice
Department to

06:33.593 --> 06:37.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
provide any evidence of
wiretapping by today.

06:37.330 --> 06:42.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. Senate moved this
evening to confirm
Seema Verma to oversee the
government's Office

06:42.435 --> 06:44.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and Medicare and Medicaid.

06:44.371 --> 06:49.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Indiana health care
consultant will be
charged with directing key
changes, if congressional

06:49.843 --> 06:54.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans push through heir
replacement
for Obamacare.

06:54.281 --> 06:59.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Syria, last year was the most
dangerous
yet for children since the civil
war began

06:59.219 --> 07:00.854 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
six years ago.

07:00.887 --> 07:07.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N. Children's Relief
Agency, UNICEF,
reports that at least 652 Syrian
children

07:07.427 --> 07:09.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
were killed in 2016.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's up 20 percent from 2015.

07:12.399 --> 07:20.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The number recruited to fight
doubled to more
than 850, with some acting as
executioners

07:20.040 --> 07:21.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and suicide bombers.

07:21.708 --> 07:28.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. military confirms that
it's begun
deploying attack drones to South
Korea to

07:28.148 --> 07:32.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
counter what it calls North
Korea's continued
provocative actions.

07:32.719 --> 07:36.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The move follows Pyongyang's
recent nuclear
and missile tests.

07:36.856 --> 07:42.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it comes just days after the
Pentagon
sent an advanced anti-missile
system to the

07:42.128 --> 07:43.830 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
South.

07:43.863 --> 07:48.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Scottish leader, Nicola
Sturgeon, called today
for a new referendum on
independence.

07:48.635 --> 07:54.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The nation's first minister in
Edinburgh,
and said most Scots oppose
leaving the European

07:54.441 --> 07:57.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Union, and that's cause to
reconsider independence.

07:57.210 --> 08:00.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLA STURGEON, Scottish First
Minister:
Right now, we're on a path not
just to Brexit,

08:00.513 --> 08:05.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but to hard Brexit, that will
have profound
implications for our economy,
our society,

08:05.652 --> 08:09.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our culture, our place in the
world, sense
of who we are.

08:10.023 --> 08:13.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we have no control over
that.

08:13.893 --> 08:17.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We voted against it, but
nevertheless that
is the direction the U.K.
government is intent

08:17.731 --> 08:19.532 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on taking us in.

08:19.566 --> 08:25.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In a 2014
referendum, 55 percent
of Scottish voters rejected
independence.

08:25.305 --> 08:28.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The British Parliament would
have to authorize
a new vote.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Wall Street, stocks
mostly searched
for direction.

08:31.978 --> 08:36.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 21 points
to close at 20881.

08:36.383 --> 08:43.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 14 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added about a point.

08:43.223 --> 08:48.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the costs
of the Republican plan to
replace Obamacare;

08:48.762 --> 08:55.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fog in Foggy Bottom, the low
profile of
Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson; crisis in

08:55.468 --> 09:05.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South Sudan, famine and civil
unrest strike
the world's newest nation; and
much more.

09:05.578 --> 09:14.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South Sudan, famine and civil
unrest strike
the world's newest nation; and
much more.

09:14.120 --> 09:19.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now reaction to the analysis of
the Republican
health care bill by the budget
office of Congress.

09:19.959 --> 09:26.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we report a few moments ago,
it is forecasting
that 24 million fewer people
would be insured

09:26.065 --> 09:32.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after a decade and it would
reduce the deficit
by more $300 billion over 10
years.

09:32.872 --> 09:34.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our John Yang gets some analysis
now.

09:34.874 --> 09:39.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, for that, we
turn to two experts
who watch this all closely, Zeke
Emanuel,

09:39.546 --> 09:44.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who is one of the original
architects of the
Affordable Care Act, or
Obamacare.

09:44.317 --> 09:49.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's chair of the University of
Pennsylvania's
Department of Medical Ethics and
Health Policy.

09:49.055 --> 09:54.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Lanhee Chen, a fellow at the
Hoover Institution,
who advised both Mitt Romney and
Marco Rubio

09:54.561 --> 09:56.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in their presidential campaigns.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Gentlemen, welcome to you both.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dr. Emanuel, let me start with
you.

09:59.666 --> 10:07.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The big headline number out of
this, 24 million
fewer with health insurance
after a period

10:07.207 --> 10:09.676 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
after this.

10:09.709 --> 10:13.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is more than who were added
to the rolls
by Obamacare.

10:13.980 --> 10:14.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's your reaction?

10:14.981 --> 10:16.816 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

10:16.850 --> 10:19.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EZEKIEL EMANUEL, Former White
House Special
Adviser: Well, by 2026, one in
five Americans

10:19.385 --> 10:23.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are going to lack health
insurance if this
plan goes through, according to
the CBO.

10:23.823 --> 10:29.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And lest Americans think, oh,
this is only
people on Medicaid or people who
got Obamacare,

10:29.429 --> 10:34.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the CBO estimates seven million
people who
have employer insurance today
will lose coverage.

10:34.968 --> 10:39.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you're getting coverage
through your
employer, it's not guaranteed
under this plan.

10:39.873 --> 10:44.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the big, positive news for
the Republicans
sounds puny in comparison.

10:44.210 --> 10:50.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
All those people losing
coverage, and the
deficit goes down $34 billion
per year.

10:50.183 --> 10:54.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This sounds like no home run at
all for them,
and a real albatross.

10:54.787 --> 10:59.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One out of five Americans, no
health insurance,
maybe that's acceptable in some
places like

10:59.125 --> 11:04.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Texas, but I don't think across
the country,
it's something we're going to
find very tolerable.

11:04.531 --> 11:11.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They also point out that the
extensive coverage
under this plan, what your
insurance actually

11:11.170 --> 11:14.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
covers, is going to go down, so
people are
going to be responsible for more
out of their

11:14.507 --> 11:15.909 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
own pocket.

11:15.942 --> 11:18.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are going to have skinnier
health insurance,
more deductibles.

11:18.111 --> 11:21.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, again, that is something
that has proven
unpopular.

11:21.180 --> 11:25.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why the Republicans want to
encourage that
is beyond my comprehension.

11:25.485 --> 11:27.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think this points out it's a
loser bill.

11:27.954 --> 11:31.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need to go back to the
drawing board and
try to get a bipartisan bill.

11:31.524 --> 11:36.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there is a compromise,
but only when
the Republicans give up on this
kind of approach.

11:36.896 --> 11:40.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Lanhee Chen, an
albatross, a loser
bill, what do you say?

11:40.800 --> 11:43.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LANHEE CHEN, Former Policy
Director, Mitt
Romney Campaign: Well, that's
certainly one

11:43.736 --> 11:45.004 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
perspective.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would argue that, in fact,
this bill is
a very good start.

11:46.239 --> 11:47.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think, clearly, it's not
perfect.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are improvements that need
to be made
in the bill.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But let's just start with a
couple of things.

11:51.978 --> 11:55.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, obviously, the
Congressional
Budget Office estimates do
reveal that in

11:55.682 --> 11:59.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fact the bill is going to cut
the deficit,
it's going to cut spending over
the next 10

11:59.118 --> 12:03.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years and provide almost $1
trillion in tax
relief over the years -- over
the next 10

12:03.990 --> 12:05.692 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think those are points you
are going
to hear supporters of the law
point to.

12:07.794 --> 12:11.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Clearly, on the coverage
numbers, the 24 million
number is a big number.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think they have got some work
to do there.

12:13.132 --> 12:17.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The challenge is that, without
an individual
mandate, without a massive and
costly expansion

12:17.604 --> 12:21.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Medicaid, you're not going to
see the same
kind of coverage numbers that
you saw out

12:21.874 --> 12:23.643 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the Affordable Care Act.

12:23.676 --> 12:28.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Republicans need to be
willing to
accept that at least as
presently constituted,

12:28.047 --> 12:30.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their plan is not going to get
to the same
levels.

12:30.049 --> 12:33.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, the question becomes, are
people going
to have more choices?

12:33.519 --> 12:35.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Are premiums going down?

12:35.355 --> 12:39.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And indeed the CBO report finds
that beginning
in 2020, premiums are going to
go down and

12:39.392 --> 12:41.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
consumers are going to have more
choices.

12:41.294 --> 12:45.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reason why consumers might
want to buy
skinny down plans is because
they don't want

12:45.965 --> 12:50.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to pay for all of the excessive
benefits that
are mandated and required by the
Affordable

12:50.470 --> 12:52.338 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Care Act.

12:52.372 --> 12:55.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in fact, it's a quite
reasonable response
to what we have seen from the
over-regulation

12:55.241 --> 12:57.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
created by the ACA over the last
10 years.

12:57.844 --> 13:00.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Now, in the employer
marketplace, let me just
make one point.

13:00.513 --> 13:04.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The CBO when they estimated the
Affordable
Care Act, or Obamacare, upon
passage also

13:04.917 --> 13:09.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
noted that many millions of
Americans would
lose their coverage in the
employer marketplace.

13:09.088 --> 13:14.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not unusual to see shifting
between marketplaces
as it's created by a large-scale
reform such

13:14.594 --> 13:17.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the ACA or the current bill
that Republicans
are considering.

13:17.830 --> 13:19.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Lanhee Chen...

13:19.632 --> 13:26.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EZEKIEL EMANUEL: Let's just be
clear; $600
billion or so of this change is
going to be

13:26.039 --> 13:32.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tax cuts to the wealthiest 2 or
3 percent
of Americans, the insurance
companies, the

13:32.578 --> 13:33.546 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
drug companies.

13:33.579 --> 13:36.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to see Americans get
less insurance.

13:36.182 --> 13:37.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Lanhee Chen said that.

13:38.017 --> 13:41.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All right, which part of the
essential benefits
that the government is so-called
mandating

13:41.487 --> 13:42.455 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
don't you want?

13:42.488 --> 13:43.456 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hospital care?

13:43.489 --> 13:44.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Emergency room care?

13:44.457 --> 13:45.425 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Drug care?

13:45.458 --> 13:46.426 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Doctor care?

13:46.459 --> 13:48.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Preventative services?

13:48.294 --> 13:50.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LANHEE CHEN: Zeke, I would like
for Americans
to be able to choose the
benefits they want.

13:50.630 --> 13:54.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't believe that it makes
sense for Washington
to mandate the same plans
broadly across the

13:54.600 --> 13:55.568 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
board.

13:55.601 --> 13:57.036 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

13:57.070 --> 13:58.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EZEKIEL EMANUEL: Lanhee, what
you're doing
is not giving them choice.

13:58.805 --> 14:01.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What you're doing is saying,
we're taking
away the money and we're going
to let you

14:01.908 --> 14:03.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
choose with no money.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Health care is extremely
expensive.

14:05.244 --> 14:08.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's $10,000 on average per
American.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Americans don't have that kind
of money.

14:10.550 --> 14:11.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LANHEE CHEN: It is, and the
Affordable Care
Act has made it less affordable.

14:11.951 --> 14:13.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EZEKIEL EMANUEL: And they need
subsidies.

14:13.553 --> 14:16.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we -- no, the Affordable
Care Act didn't
make it less affordable.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It made it more affordable.

14:18.558 --> 14:21.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LANHEE CHEN: Twenty-five percent
increase
in premiums silver plan year
over year from

14:21.127 --> 14:23.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
2016 to 2017 sounds less
affordable to me,
Zeke.

14:23.830 --> 14:29.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EZEKIEL EMANUEL: In fact, the
silver plan
is low than the CBO predicted in
2010.

14:29.702 --> 14:33.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's actually been -- we have
been able to
control health care costs and
that has gone

14:33.806 --> 14:35.575 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You tell me the one service on
the essential
benefits you're going to get rid
of that is

14:38.010 --> 14:40.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to be better for people.

14:40.346 --> 14:41.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No Republican can say...

14:41.380 --> 14:42.582 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

14:42.615 --> 14:44.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EZEKIEL EMANUEL: That's the one
they want
to throw out.

14:44.550 --> 14:47.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LANHEE CHEN: I'm not in the
business of telling
people what benefits they should
and shouldn't

14:47.453 --> 14:48.421 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
have.

14:48.454 --> 14:49.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Look, the bottom line here is
this.

14:49.856 --> 14:51.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EZEKIEL EMANUEL: Lanhee, just
tell me what
benefit you don't want.

14:51.657 --> 14:54.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LANHEE CHEN: What this plan will
do is, it
will allow people to choose the
plans -- there

14:55.027 --> 14:56.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are things that I would choose.

14:56.629 --> 14:58.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are not going to be the
same as the things
someone else would choose, Zeke.

14:58.998 --> 15:02.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the point here, that this
is not a
decision Washington should be
making.

15:02.502 --> 15:05.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the point that
supporters of the
law have been making.

15:05.037 --> 15:08.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, look, at the end of the day
the AHCA
actually, as you know, leaves
the essential

15:08.407 --> 15:12.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health care benefits in place
for now, because
they can't be removed through
reconciliation.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know that better than
anybody else.

15:15.014 --> 15:16.249 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

15:16.282 --> 15:21.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: You talked about
premiums would
be going down.

15:21.788 --> 15:25.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the CBO found that there is
going to be
a difference by age.

15:25.558 --> 15:34.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
By 2026, premiums for a
21-year-old would
be 20 to 25 percent lower, for a
40-year-old,

15:34.100 --> 15:35.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
10 percent lower.

15:35.668 --> 15:41.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, for a 64-year-old, one year
before Medicare,
20 percent to 25 percent higher.

15:41.440 --> 15:45.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LANHEE CHEN: Well, yes, the
notion of insurance
again is about...

15:45.578 --> 15:47.013 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

15:47.046 --> 15:48.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EZEKIEL EMANUEL: People who are
sick and who
need it are going to be...

15:48.381 --> 15:49.348 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

15:49.382 --> 15:50.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Hold on.

15:50.383 --> 15:51.317 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Hold on.

15:51.350 --> 15:52.318 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Let him answer.

15:52.351 --> 15:53.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's let Lanhee Chen answer
that.

15:53.352 --> 15:55.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LANHEE CHEN: Yes.

15:55.288 --> 15:55.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The point is that any time you
create an insurance
marketplace, you are going to
have people

15:55.855 --> 15:56.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
coming in and out of it.

15:56.856 --> 15:58.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're going to have people of
different ages.

15:58.424 --> 16:01.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is the case that there is
going to
be variation across age
categories.

16:01.127 --> 16:04.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, the Affordable Care Act
increased premiums
significantly for younger
people.

16:04.997 --> 16:08.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It did bring the premiums down
for older people
because of the way the law was
structured.

16:08.234 --> 16:11.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there are always going to be
winners and
losers in these situations.

16:11.170 --> 16:13.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have got to take look at
exactly what happens.

16:13.306 --> 16:18.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, remember, what the AHCA,
What The Republican
proposal does is to create an
additional subsidy

16:18.644 --> 16:20.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to help people who are older.

16:20.179 --> 16:23.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, arguably, you could tweak
That subsidy
to give them even more support.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That may be a change want to
look at.

16:25.451 --> 16:29.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the notion that there will
be differences
in costs of premiums across age
is not surprising

16:29.655 --> 16:31.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
any time you have a large health
reform.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Thirty seconds, Dr.
Emanuel.

16:33.125 --> 16:34.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You want to respond?

16:34.126 --> 16:35.094 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

16:35.127 --> 16:36.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EZEKIEL EMANUEL: Wait a second.

16:36.896 --> 16:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you take the subsidies way
down, so you
give people less money to buy
insurance.

16:39.899 --> 16:45.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a double whammy, which
is, we're going
to allow the premiums to go up,
and, by the

16:45.171 --> 16:49.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way, the amount of coverage is
going to go
down, because the essential
benefits are going

16:49.575 --> 16:50.543 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
down.

16:50.576 --> 16:52.445 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So -- and we should also mention
that by 2022...

16:52.478 --> 16:53.880 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

16:53.913 --> 16:54.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LANHEE CHEN: The essential
benefits aren't
touched by the law, Zeke.

16:54.780 --> 16:56.482 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You know that.

16:56.515 --> 17:00.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EZEKIEL EMANUEL: They're
actually going to
send the premiums up for all
people 15 to

17:00.052 --> 17:01.854 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
20 percent.

17:01.888 --> 17:05.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, yes, by 2026, a decade from
now, premiums
for the younger will come down,
but, before

17:05.858 --> 17:07.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that, they are going to actually
go up.

17:07.693 --> 17:12.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So this is hardly a very good
thing if you're
going to say we're going to make
it cover

17:12.598 --> 17:14.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
everyone and we're going to make
it cheaper.

17:14.734 --> 17:15.935 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not going to be cheaper.

17:15.968 --> 17:17.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Time, gentlemen.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.004 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Time.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.005 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm sorry.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are going to have to leave it
there.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EZEKIEL EMANUEL: Yes.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.275 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

17:22.308 --> 17:23.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Dr. Emanuel, Lanhee
Chen, thanks
for joining us.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EZEKIEL EMANUEL: Thank you.

17:24.176 --> 17:25.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's a
debate thanks
to hear.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks to both of them.

17:26.579 --> 17:29.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we want to hear what people
think on all
sides of the health care debate.

17:29.115 --> 17:33.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're concerned about health
care reform,
you can go online, find a brief
questionnaire

17:33.085 --> 17:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and share your experience.

17:47.533 --> 17:52.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson
flies to
Asia tomorrow for high-stakes
visits to Japan,

17:52.705 --> 17:58.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South Korea and China, as
tensions in the
region mount over North Korea's
missile and

17:58.344 --> 18:04.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nuclear programs, but not flying
with Tillerson,
the State Department press
corps, a significant

18:04.750 --> 18:07.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
change from prior
administrations.

18:07.186 --> 18:12.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This comes amid reports that
Tillerson has
been sidelined by the White
House on some

18:12.058 --> 18:18.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
major international issues, and
that it wants
to slash State's budget by 37
percent.

18:18.130 --> 18:23.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here to walk us through all this
and more
is chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret

18:23.202 --> 18:24.170 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Warner.

18:24.203 --> 18:25.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Margaret, welcome.

18:25.204 --> 18:27.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, what do you make of all
this?

18:27.039 --> 18:31.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Judy, there is
just no doubt
this -- Rex Tillerson is the
lowest-profile

18:31.110 --> 18:34.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
secretary of state in modern
times.

18:34.246 --> 18:39.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has not uttered a word
publicly in the
United States since arrival
comments when

18:39.452 --> 18:42.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he joined state on February 2.

18:42.221 --> 18:47.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Overseas, he does give prepared
remarks, but
never takes a question from
reporters.

18:47.293 --> 18:51.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This issue about taking the
press corps on
such an important trip, that
began with Henry

18:51.564 --> 18:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kissinger, who recognized it was
very useful.

18:54.567 --> 19:00.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He could background reporters,
get U.S. policy
out there, help shape the
coverage.

19:00.573 --> 19:05.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm told that, at the G20
meeting in Germany,
where his prepared remarks were
very well-received,

19:05.077 --> 19:09.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he had a private meeting with
the Russian
foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov.

19:09.782 --> 19:12.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obviously, there are a lot of
issues there.

19:12.218 --> 19:16.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he didn't want to do a joint
press conference
with Lavrov or have anything to
say.

19:16.322 --> 19:20.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his aides said, look, if you
don't say
something, the Russians get to
characterize

19:20.459 --> 19:22.194 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this meeting.

19:22.228 --> 19:26.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he went before the American
reporters
who were there and he read a
short statement,

19:26.699 --> 19:28.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
took no questions.

19:28.534 --> 19:33.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here in Washington, he has not
been included
in allied leaders, important
allied leaders'

19:34.006 --> 19:38.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
visits like the Japanese prime
minister or
Benjamin Netanyahu.

19:38.310 --> 19:43.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He didn't even present the
annual human rights
report 10 days ago, which
secretaries always

19:43.549 --> 19:47.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do in the Briefing Room to
demonstrate how
important that issue is to the
U.S.

19:47.353 --> 19:51.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, in fact, the State
Department didn't
have a daily press briefing, as
they have

19:51.257 --> 19:53.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had ever since the '50s, until
about 10 days
ago.

19:53.826 --> 19:58.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, how much
influence, Margaret,
is it believed that he has
internally?

19:58.998 --> 20:02.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: That remains
something of
a mystery, Judy.

20:02.368 --> 20:03.602 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we can't discount him.

20:03.636 --> 20:06.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Here's the former CEO of
ExxonMobil.

20:06.505 --> 20:10.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, he's going on a really
important
mission, as you explained in
your intro, tomorrow.

20:10.709 --> 20:15.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's having dinner tonight with
the president
and with the national security
adviser, General

20:15.981 --> 20:17.116 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
McMaster.

20:17.149 --> 20:20.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, so far, there haven't been
opportunities
to see.

20:21.020 --> 20:26.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know he had influence getting
Iraq off
the Muslim country travel ban
list, for example,

20:26.492 --> 20:31.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but, on other big issues, we
don't really
know whether he's going to have
influence.

20:31.730 --> 20:38.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, climate change,
he's in favor
of staying within the climate
change treaty.

20:38.404 --> 20:42.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what has been happening, in
the absence
of statements of policy from the
State Department,

20:42.441 --> 20:45.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is that policy is made by
presidential tweet.

20:45.778 --> 20:51.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wasn't involved in former
National Security
Adviser Michael Flynn saying
Iran was officially

20:51.217 --> 20:54.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on notice after this missile
test.

20:54.220 --> 21:00.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wasn't consulted when Trump
said, with
Netanyahu, I'm agnostic on
whether it's a

21:00.226 --> 21:01.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
one- or two-state solution.

21:01.827 --> 21:05.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That upends policy, but I'm told
that was
negotiated privately between the
Israelis

21:05.397 --> 21:07.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and Jared Kushner, his
son-in-law.

21:07.833 --> 21:13.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the big concern among the
veteran diplomats,
Judy, is what is the role of
this sort of

21:13.572 --> 21:20.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shadow NSC that Bannon, Steve
Bannon, who
is a real America-firster, has
established

21:20.146 --> 21:21.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
called the Strategic Initiatives
Group?

21:21.881 --> 21:23.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And is that going to really run
the show?

21:23.916 --> 21:27.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, finally,
Margaret, is
there a sense that there is a
design behind

21:27.553 --> 21:29.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
all this, that there's a plan?

21:29.655 --> 21:32.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: That is the
question that
people are asking.

21:32.892 --> 21:37.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Did he understand this low
profile was part
of his job?

21:37.696 --> 21:42.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Did he know that his choice for
deputy could
be rejected by the president?

21:42.601 --> 21:47.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he is now in a department
without any
policy people to advise him.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One person said to me, it's like
a ghost ship.

21:49.175 --> 21:54.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You hear the wind in the sails,
but there's
no one's on deck.

21:54.079 --> 22:02.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is he being sidelined by a sort
of Bannon-Kushner
operation inside the White
House?

22:02.454 --> 22:08.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Somebody who knows him well from
ExxonMobil
said she's really mystified that
-- quote

22:08.894 --> 22:10.529 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- "He's not the person I knew."

22:10.563 --> 22:13.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She saw him as a large,
in-charge CEO.

22:13.599 --> 22:17.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fascinating and,
as you said,
Margaret, a change from previous
administrations

22:17.770 --> 22:19.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going back to Richard Nixon.

22:19.205 --> 22:20.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Absolutely.

22:20.272 --> 22:27.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Margaret Warner,
thank you.

22:27.947 --> 22:34.687 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Stay with us.

22:34.720 --> 22:40.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
assault on
reason -- Al Gore gives his take
on the Trump

22:40.226 --> 22:44.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presidency; it's Politics
Monday, a look ahead
to the upcoming fight over the
new health

22:44.863 --> 22:53.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care plan; and running on ice, a
marathon
over a frozen Siberian lake.

22:53.806 --> 23:00.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: South Sudan, the
world's youngest
country, founded in 2011, is in
freefall.

23:00.446 --> 23:05.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Three of its six years in
existence have been
spent fighting a civil war that
has left tens

23:05.618 --> 23:07.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of thousands dead.

23:07.219 --> 23:11.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now the ravages of that war have
led to a
manmade famine.

23:11.724 --> 23:17.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, the United Nations
reported that
7.5 million people there are in
need of assistance.

23:17.496 --> 23:22.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From South Sudan, John Ray of
Independent
Television News brings us this
report.

23:22.101 --> 23:25.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a warning: Viewers may find
some of the
images upsetting.

23:25.404 --> 23:34.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN RAY: Of South Sudan's many
torments,
hunger has become the greatest
terror of all.

23:34.480 --> 23:41.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is a horror written in the
flesh and bones
of this little boy.

23:41.587 --> 23:44.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has drawn the strength from
his limbs and
the life from his eyes.

23:44.957 --> 23:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His name is Khamis, 2 years old,
but weaker
than a newborn baby.

23:53.899 --> 24:00.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His mother has lost one child to
sickness,
lost family to war, and now
starvation threatens

24:00.039 --> 24:01.307 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
her son.

24:01.340 --> 24:05.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LOMO LATABO, Mother (through
translator):
There is no food.

24:05.811 --> 24:08.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Anything we can find, we will
try to eat.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We find grass, we will eat it.

24:09.982 --> 24:11.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's just the way it is for us
now.

24:11.884 --> 24:16.889 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN RAY: The red warning signs
are everywhere.

24:16.922 --> 24:23.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At this screening center out in
the countryside,
we're told four out of every 10
children are

24:23.896 --> 24:25.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
severely acutely malnourished.

24:25.764 --> 24:32.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In language any parent would
understand, they
risk starving to death.

24:32.338 --> 24:37.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, with every exhausted step,
South Sudan
moves from the brink of genocide
into the

24:37.910 --> 24:39.745 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
arms of famine.

24:39.778 --> 24:44.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For many days and many miles,
they have trekked
across a sand-blown wasteland in
search of

24:44.149 --> 24:47.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something to eat and somewhere
safe to stay.

24:47.720 --> 24:54.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Exhausted, famished, almost
finished, and
all they have gained is the
shade of a tree.

24:54.793 --> 25:00.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everyone is hungry, the old
woman tells me,
but better here than at home.

25:00.232 --> 25:06.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): The
soldiers came,
and so many people were killed,
even the women

25:06.605 --> 25:08.140 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and old people.

25:08.173 --> 25:10.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My children were shot in front
of me.

25:10.843 --> 25:14.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The houses were burnt, so we ran
to the bush.

25:14.213 --> 25:18.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN RAY: There is food, but
nothing like
enough.

25:18.884 --> 25:23.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the district center of
Ganyiel, a U.N.
plane has just delivered its
once-a-month

25:23.789 --> 25:25.624 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
aid drop.

25:25.657 --> 25:32.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the baking heat, they
collect their
rations, but thousands have
arrived too late.

25:32.331 --> 25:37.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We found this woman picking
through the dirt
for a few grains split from the
sacks of cereal.

25:37.336 --> 25:41.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the long grass all around,
there are many
like her.

25:41.039 --> 25:43.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is all she has for the next
month.

25:43.342 --> 25:49.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"It shames and pains me," she
says, "but how
else can I live?"

25:49.782 --> 25:55.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The answer, for many, is to risk
the malaria-infested
marshes that line the River
Nile.

25:55.687 --> 26:01.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We watched William Gaul and his
family of
eight children arrive after a
19-day journey

26:01.393 --> 26:03.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from famine through fighting.

26:03.228 --> 26:06.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All they have eaten on the way
are water lilies.

26:06.799 --> 26:11.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM GAUL, South Sudan
(through translator):
I have never seen so many people
die of hunger.

26:11.970 --> 26:13.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Only God can help us now.

26:13.739 --> 26:17.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Without God, I am afraid none of
us will survive.

26:17.443 --> 26:23.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN RAY: This is Dalia, 6 years
old, perilously
thin.

26:23.215 --> 26:30.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her fight for life is one tiny
front line
in a much wider struggle,
100,000 people on

26:30.255 --> 26:32.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the verge of starvation.

26:32.090 --> 26:37.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dalia is precisely the same age
as her country,
uncertain fates intertwined.

26:37.596 --> 26:46.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, like so many children,
Khamis knows only
fear and hunger, first the war,
then the famine,

26:46.038 --> 26:50.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
now the reckoning.

26:50.209 --> 27:00.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: Has faith in
the power
of reason fallen victim to
modern politics?

27:00.252 --> 27:06.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: Has faith in
the power
of reason fallen victim to
modern politics?

27:06.358 --> 27:11.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ten years after its original
publication,
former Vice President Al Gore
has updated

27:11.396 --> 27:14.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his book "The Assault on
Reason."

27:14.166 --> 27:19.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Its new subtitle is telling:
"Our Information
Ecosystem: From the Age of Print
to the Age

27:19.872 --> 27:21.707 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Trump."

27:21.740 --> 27:25.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I sat down with him this
afternoon, and started
by asking about the sharp
criticisms he made

27:25.944 --> 27:29.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the original version against
then President
George W. Bush.

27:29.581 --> 27:33.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AL GORE, Former Vice President
of the United
States: My criticisms were not
mainly aimed

27:33.752 --> 27:41.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at any individuals, including
President George
W. Bush or Vice President
Cheney, but rather

27:41.460 --> 27:49.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the way in which our democratic
conversation
has been degraded over the last
several decades.

27:49.468 --> 27:53.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would say the same thing
about President
Trump.

27:53.639 --> 28:01.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For me, the most serious problem
is how our
nation became so vulnerable to
the assertion

28:01.847 --> 28:10.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of blatant falsehoods that drive
policy and
are not corrected by the
so-called immune

28:10.923 --> 28:16.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
system of democracy, a free
press and a free
democratic discourse.

28:16.428 --> 28:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think we have a huge
systemic problem
that we have largely ignored.

28:21.633 --> 28:26.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When our founders created
America, it was
in the age of the printing
press, when individuals

28:26.805 --> 28:29.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
could freely join the
conversation.

28:29.308 --> 28:35.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that robust, democratic
dialogue more
often than not lifted up the
best available

28:35.681 --> 28:39.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
evidence and asserted what was
more likely
to be true than not.

28:40.018 --> 28:46.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now we have things that are
obviously false,
leading us to war, leading us to
deny people

28:46.224 --> 28:49.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
health care, leading us to
ignore the climate
crisis.

28:49.361 --> 28:52.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to restore the integrity
of the democratic
conversation.

28:52.431 --> 28:56.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, back when
you first wrote
the book, you were pretty
optimistic, you

28:56.134 --> 29:01.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wrote, that the Internet would
be an open
-- an opportunity for the kind
of discourse

29:01.306 --> 29:02.341 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that you would like to see.

29:02.374 --> 29:03.342 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AL GORE: Yes.

29:03.375 --> 29:04.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Has it turned out
that way?

29:04.610 --> 29:07.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AL GORE: Not as quickly as I had
hoped, that's
for sure.

29:07.145 --> 29:09.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I still do have hope, however.

29:09.514 --> 29:15.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look at the way all of
the new reform
movements dedicated to the
public interest

29:15.354 --> 29:21.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are living and thriving on the
Internet, I
do think there is still some
considerable

29:21.059 --> 29:27.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hope that the full participation
of individuals
in that conversation of
democracy can once

29:27.799 --> 29:30.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
again restore the integrity of
the way our
democracy works.

29:30.869 --> 29:34.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you write
about that
in the book, in the update, but
you also say

29:34.172 --> 29:38.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you think it's wrong to go
after President
Trump as the principal cause of
the.

29:39.011 --> 29:43.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as you well know, there are
others out
there who are saying he is,
because -- a principal

29:43.715 --> 29:50.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cause, because of the language
we have heard
from him about how many people
showed up at

29:50.255 --> 29:53.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the inauguration, about how many
electoral
votes that he had.

29:53.959 --> 29:54.926 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AL GORE: Yes.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.561 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

29:56.595 --> 29:59.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, why is he not
part of your
focus, a main part of your
focus?

29:59.998 --> 30:02.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AL GORE: Well, he is, and I
don't defend any
of that.

30:02.501 --> 30:08.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just think that a much more
important part
of the problem we face, which
was evident

30:08.840 --> 30:15.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
10 years ago and is even more
evident now,
is that the way we share
information among

30:15.881 --> 30:21.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ourselves as American citizens
has been radically
transformed.

30:21.286 --> 30:28.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't have -- the line
between news and
entertainment has almost
dissolved, where

30:28.293 --> 30:33.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ratings now have a big impact on
what kinds
of stories are covered and not
stories.

30:33.899 --> 30:41.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And when you talk about
President Trump, the
cable networks turned over so
many hours of

30:41.306 --> 30:43.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
prime time to him.

30:43.809 --> 30:45.110 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

30:45.143 --> 30:49.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because he was entertaining, but
also because
it drove ratings.

30:49.281 --> 30:55.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is different from what
the news media
is supposed to focus on.

30:55.587 --> 30:59.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But how much
responsibility
does he bear for what's going
on?

30:59.491 --> 31:06.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AL GORE: Well, I mean, I think
that asserting
that former President Obama
wasn't born in

31:06.598 --> 31:10.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the United States was just the
height of irresponsibility,
of course.

31:10.736 --> 31:12.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he corrected that one.

31:12.370 --> 31:14.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are others that have yet
to be corrected.

31:14.206 --> 31:18.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You met with
President Trump
during the transition in New
York, and you

31:18.076 --> 31:24.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have written about -- you have
said you have
been in touch with him since
then.

31:24.282 --> 31:25.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's your take on him?

31:25.417 --> 31:27.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AL GORE: Well, what is the Latin
phrase, sui
generis?

31:27.686 --> 31:29.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's one of a kind.

31:29.154 --> 31:30.889 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

31:30.922 --> 31:35.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AL GORE: I think -- like a lot
of people,
I'm still trying to figure out
exactly what

31:35.560 --> 31:38.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he represents in American
politics.

31:38.330 --> 31:46.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, if nothing else, he
represents a way
for tens of millions of people
who were desperate

31:46.872 --> 31:52.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for change to just turn the
table over and
say, we want to start over
again.

31:52.844 --> 31:55.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it is a challenge for our
democracy.

31:55.347 --> 31:57.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It definitely is.

31:57.082 --> 32:06.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, again, the remedy has to be
devoting
enough attention to restoring
the way we make

32:06.424 --> 32:08.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
collective decisions in this
country.

32:08.426 --> 32:12.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you're saying
that can
be done with a -- even with a
president like

32:12.898 --> 32:18.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump, who is as
outspoken as he is
and who makes the controversial
statements

32:18.203 --> 32:19.171 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that he does?

32:19.204 --> 32:21.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AL GORE: I hope so.

32:21.039 --> 32:26.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're less than two months into
this experiment,
and people are already reaching
conclusions.

32:26.545 --> 32:36.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, George Orwell
once wrote that
a false belief sooner or later
collides with

32:36.988 --> 32:40.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
physical reality, usually on a
battlefield.

32:40.625 --> 32:45.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what happened with the
invasion of
Iraq, and we're still bogged
down there.

32:45.730 --> 32:52.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is what would happen if the
Congress
passed this pending health care
bill that

32:52.103 --> 32:57.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would knock so many millions of
people out
of coverage and raise the
expenses of so many

32:57.142 --> 32:58.677 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
others.

32:58.710 --> 33:05.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a physical reality that
can't be finessed
with words and falsehoods.

33:05.050 --> 33:08.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is your take
on the man
the president chose to head the
Environmental

33:08.653 --> 33:14.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt,
who, by the
way, just last week said he
doesn't agree

33:14.326 --> 33:17.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that carbon dioxide is a primary
contributor
to climate change?

33:17.896 --> 33:18.864 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

33:18.897 --> 33:20.765 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AL GORE: I know.

33:20.799 --> 33:23.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's a perfect example of
the problem
that I'm describing in "The
Assault on Reason."

33:23.235 --> 33:30.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, at some point, a false
belief collides
with physical reality.

33:30.141 --> 33:34.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are seeing every night on the
television
news now a nature hike through
the Book of

33:34.246 --> 33:36.014 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Revelation.

33:36.047 --> 33:41.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These climate-related extreme
weather events
have convinced the vast majority
of people

33:41.953 --> 33:45.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the scientists have been
right for a
long time.

33:45.090 --> 33:46.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have to address this.

33:46.858 --> 33:54.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But putting someone in the EPA
who denies
even the most basic scientific
truth about

33:54.232 --> 33:59.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this, you know, it's -- the old
cliches are,
you can say the Earth is flat,
but it doesn't

33:59.437 --> 34:01.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mean you're going to fall off
the edge.

34:01.273 --> 34:08.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're saying the
news media
can do its job and not be
accused on a regular

34:08.046 --> 34:11.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
basis of being fake news, as
this president
does?

34:11.249 --> 34:14.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AL GORE: Yes, fake news has been
around as
long as news has been around.

34:14.386 --> 34:19.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, again, the issue is, how
vulnerable are
we to it?

34:19.624 --> 34:25.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How can the immune system of
democracy, which
is not only the news media, but
also the free

34:25.497 --> 34:32.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speech we all enjoy and the way
we make decisions
collectively, how can that
better protect

34:32.470 --> 34:36.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
us against blatant untruths that
are repeated
over and over again?

34:36.841 --> 34:39.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are you
continuing to have
conversations with President
Trump?

34:39.644 --> 34:47.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AL GORE: Well, I'm not talking
about any dialogue
with him, direct or indirect.

34:47.686 --> 34:52.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I hope that our country remains
in the Paris
agreement.

34:52.157 --> 34:58.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we face a climate crisis now
that is the
most serious challenge our
civilization has

34:58.496 --> 35:00.231 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ever confronted.

35:00.265 --> 35:06.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the greatest country in the
world has
to remain a part of this
unprecedented global

35:06.571 --> 35:08.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
agreement to deal with it.

35:08.273 --> 35:10.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you're
telling him that?

35:10.075 --> 35:13.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AL GORE: Well, again, I'm not
commenting on
my communications, because I
want to have

35:13.878 --> 35:15.547 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

35:15.580 --> 35:17.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, we
will leave it
there, former Vice President Al
Gore.

35:17.482 --> 35:22.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The book is "The Assault on
Reason," out with
a 10-years-later update.

35:22.387 --> 35:23.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AL GORE: I thank you, Judy.

35:23.555 --> 35:31.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you very
much.

35:31.429 --> 35:40.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now: With news continuing to
swirl around
health care reform and
wiretapping claims,

35:40.205 --> 35:46.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's time for Politics Monday
with Tamara
Keith of NPR and Amy Walter of
The Cook Political

35:46.111 --> 35:47.078 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Report.

35:47.112 --> 35:49.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to both of you.

35:49.047 --> 35:51.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And before we talk about health
care, I have
to ask you, Amy, about what
former Vice President

35:51.616 --> 35:57.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Al Gore said, trying to be
optimistic about
the ability of the news media
to, in his words,

35:57.122 --> 36:02.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get the truth out of there in
the face of
a lot of, frankly, nontruths
floating around.

36:02.060 --> 36:03.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Right.

36:03.962 --> 36:09.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, and we have created a
world now, us
as Americans, where we like to
surround ourselves

36:09.701 --> 36:14.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with news and information that
already confirms
our own bias.

36:14.839 --> 36:20.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is very uncomfortable for us
to go outside
of that circle, and we do it not
just in the

36:20.311 --> 36:23.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
channels that we choose, but in
the ways in
which we choose to get it.

36:23.448 --> 36:24.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Who are we following on
Facebook?

36:24.582 --> 36:26.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Who are we following on Twitter?

36:26.251 --> 36:28.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Usually, people who agree with
us.

36:28.119 --> 36:34.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we call something fake
news because
it challenge us our assumptions,
rather than

36:34.359 --> 36:38.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to what we should be doing
is saying,
I should constantly be
challenging my assumptions.

36:38.997 --> 36:40.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it's not the news media.

36:40.799 --> 36:46.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's partly the news media, but
it's really
the consumer as well, breaking
out of those

36:46.171 --> 36:47.138 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bubbles.

36:47.172 --> 36:48.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Tam, you see
that challenge.

36:48.173 --> 36:49.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're out there covering the
news every day.

36:49.274 --> 36:51.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Yes.

36:51.076 --> 36:54.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, and the actual fake news
is often the
news that confirms our biases,
that we want

36:54.245 --> 37:00.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to believe that it's too good --
as a news
consumer, it's too good to
check.

37:00.185 --> 37:04.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as a member of the news
media, you put
one foot in front of the other,
and you just

37:04.823 --> 37:11.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
keep going and, you know,
reporting the numbers,
the CBO numbers, and the Bureau
of Labor Statistics

37:11.563 --> 37:14.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
numbers, and also talking about
their methodology.

37:14.099 --> 37:15.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Exactly.

37:15.100 --> 37:16.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what we want to do
right now.

37:16.935 --> 37:22.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We did just get, in the last few
hours, this
report, analysis, Amy, from the
Congressional

37:22.207 --> 37:23.975 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Budget Office.

37:24.008 --> 37:28.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some good news interest for
Democrats, a little
bit of good news for the
administration.

37:28.213 --> 37:31.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, if you're the
administration,
the first thing you look at, you
say, well,

37:31.816 --> 37:35.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it reduces the deficit, and that
is good news.

37:35.053 --> 37:41.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But at the core, Judy, this is
the challenge
for the Republican Party
fundamentally, which

37:41.126 --> 37:46.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, the president of the United
States, who
is a Republican, went out on the
campaign

37:46.531 --> 37:50.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trail and even when he was
president-elect
and said things like,
everybody's going to

37:50.702 --> 37:53.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be covered, we're going to have
insurance
for everybody.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said that over and over
again.

37:55.473 --> 38:01.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the people in Congress and
those even
surrounding him, his HHS
secretary, the head

38:01.646 --> 38:06.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Budget Office, believe
that the issue
is not how many people are
covered, but whether

38:06.417 --> 38:08.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they have access to that
coverage.

38:08.319 --> 38:12.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so you have a populist
president who promised
that everything was going to be
OK, we're

38:12.991 --> 38:15.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not going to touch Medicaid,
we're not going
to touch entitlements, you are
going to be

38:15.460 --> 38:20.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
able to get everything, but it
is going to
be cheaper and better, and a
free market Republican

38:20.098 --> 38:24.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leadership who says, no, we
never promised
those things, we think that the
market can

38:25.003 --> 38:26.804 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
take care of it.

38:26.838 --> 38:30.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, those two things are going
to continue
to collide, regardless of what
the CBO report

38:31.009 --> 38:32.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
says, and then we will see it in
a bill.

38:32.777 --> 38:35.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
the political
impact of this, Tam?

38:35.046 --> 38:39.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, certainly
leading into
it, the Trump administration and
some in Congress

38:39.517 --> 38:45.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were sort of trying to work the
refs, trying
to discredit the report before
it ever came

38:45.590 --> 38:47.258 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out.

38:47.292 --> 38:52.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But these numbers are stark, you
know, 14
million people almost
immediately who will

38:52.197 --> 38:54.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not have insurance who have it
now.

38:54.532 --> 38:57.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The number goes up significantly
as time goes
on.

38:57.802 --> 39:04.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, if you look at
the breakdown,
the people who this report would
indicate

39:04.976 --> 39:14.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are the most likely to face
higher costs are
older people and poorer people.

39:14.452 --> 39:19.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And many of those people are the
very people
who supported Donald Trump,
people who show

39:19.190 --> 39:20.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
up to his rallies.

39:21.025 --> 39:22.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it seems like
this is going
to, in the short run anyway,
make it a little

39:22.860 --> 39:24.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bit harder for them to make the
case.

39:24.629 --> 39:26.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: For them to sell it,
right, and,
more importantly, for the
president to be

39:26.798 --> 39:29.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
able to sell it, because he's
the one who
talked about, everybody is going
to be able

39:29.968 --> 39:31.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to keep their health care.

39:31.769 --> 39:35.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the headline number out of
this, of course,
are the millions of people who
will not.

39:35.673 --> 39:39.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, the
other thing
I want to ask you all about is
what we heard,

39:39.344 --> 39:45.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that infamous or famous tweet,
Tam, from President
Trump two Saturday mornings
ago...

39:45.316 --> 39:47.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Oh, yes.

39:47.151 --> 39:49.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... when he
accused President
Obama of wiretapping him in
Trump Tower in

39:49.587 --> 39:51.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a series of tweets that morning.

39:51.489 --> 39:53.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We really haven't stopped
talking about it
since then.

39:53.791 --> 39:57.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House has not yet come
forward -- or
the administration has not come
forward with

39:57.862 --> 40:00.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
any evidence to back it up,
despite a request
by the Hill.

40:00.898 --> 40:05.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we just now have seen -- and
you were
telling us about it -- a
statement by the

40:05.336 --> 40:09.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Justice Department saying
they're asking for
more time to respond to this
request.

40:09.974 --> 40:11.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Right.

40:11.809 --> 40:15.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the Justice Department got
in touch with
the chairman and the ranking
member of the

40:15.580 --> 40:20.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House Intelligence Committee,
which had asked
them to produce evidence that
President Trump

40:20.451 --> 40:22.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
had been wiretapped.

40:22.487 --> 40:24.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they're asking for more
time.

40:24.289 --> 40:28.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The administration, you know, we
have been
asking Sean Spicer, the press
secretary, where

40:28.192 --> 40:31.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did the president get this from,
what is his
source?

40:31.095 --> 40:33.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he said, well, there have
been lots of
reports out there.

40:33.398 --> 40:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he won't say whether that
was the president's
source.

40:35.933 --> 40:42.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a new turn today, he said
that, well, when
the president said wiretapping,
he put it

40:42.206 --> 40:48.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in quotes, and because it was in
quotes, maybe
he was talking more broadly
about surveillance,

40:48.546 --> 40:52.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even though there were other
tweets where
the president said his phones
were tapped,

40:52.250 --> 40:54.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and that wasn't in quotes.

40:54.052 --> 40:58.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I guess Sean
Spicer's comment
was, he may not have meant it
literally.

40:58.456 --> 40:59.424 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
So...

40:59.457 --> 41:00.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Oh, we're back to
literally.

41:00.992 --> 41:02.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're back to
literally.

41:02.727 --> 41:03.895 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

41:03.928 --> 41:06.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Amy, where
does this go
from here?

41:06.731 --> 41:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're waiting to see if there is
any evidence.

41:08.800 --> 41:14.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, meanwhile, this is a very
serious charge
that the current president
levels against

41:14.072 --> 41:15.039 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the previous.

41:15.073 --> 41:16.040 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

41:16.074 --> 41:17.809 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

41:17.842 --> 41:19.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I want to go back to where
you started
this conversation, Judy, about
the public

41:19.677 --> 41:23.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and their frustration with the
media, this
idea about fake news, and who
they trust and

41:23.648 --> 41:25.416 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who they don't.

41:25.450 --> 41:28.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as I watch the story unfold,
I think I
can understand where a lot of
Americans get

41:28.353 --> 41:30.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
frustrated with this story.

41:30.188 --> 41:34.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president tweeted something
out that clearly
is completely unfounded, in the
same way he

41:34.926 --> 41:40.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tweeted out this statistic that
there are
three million to five million
Americans who

41:40.098 --> 41:44.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voted illegally, that the
president wasn't
born in this country.

41:44.669 --> 41:48.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the news media's job is to
report that
this is unfounded, we haven't
seen any evidence

41:48.773 --> 41:50.508 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of this.

41:50.541 --> 41:54.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, every day, the question is
presented
to Sean Spicer or Kellyanne
Conway, when it

41:54.946 --> 41:57.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
looks like in a way that the
media's trying
to get a gotcha.

41:57.515 --> 42:01.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's make them have to say that
he was wrong.

42:01.319 --> 42:03.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let's put them in an
uncomfortable position.

42:03.221 --> 42:07.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think what Americans are
looking for
is, we get it, he said something
that's unfounded,

42:07.492 --> 42:12.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but it looks like the media is
trying to prove
a point, rather than trying to
look out for

42:12.296 --> 42:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the other issues that are out
there, spend
more time focusing on health
care and those

42:16.234 --> 42:17.835 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
other issues.

42:17.869 --> 42:22.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I understand undermining the
president, the
former president, is a big
issue.

42:22.306 --> 42:27.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But without
pushing forward,
Tam, you're left with a sort of
ragged uncertainty.

42:27.745 --> 42:31.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you stop talking about it,
stop asking
about it, then, basically,
you're leaving

42:31.649 --> 42:33.084 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it unresolved.

42:33.117 --> 42:35.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And, at the
moment, it is still
very much unresolved.

42:35.420 --> 42:37.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: But do you have to
do it every
single day?

42:37.955 --> 42:42.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I agree it is unresolved, and
that question
has to be answered.

42:42.160 --> 42:44.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I don't think we're going to
-- we're
not going to get an answer.

42:44.529 --> 42:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: But -- and more to
the point,
we keep trying to ask the
president, too.

42:48.299 --> 42:49.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he hasn't yet answered
either.

42:49.600 --> 42:50.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He's not going
to...

42:50.768 --> 42:52.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And he's never going
to admit
-- we know this.

42:52.036 --> 42:55.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it's not true, he will not
admit that it's
not true.

42:55.273 --> 42:57.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, we may
discuss this
again.

42:57.575 --> 42:58.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: We will.

42:58.843 --> 43:00.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter,
Tamara Keith, thank
you both.

43:00.578 --> 43:02.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

43:02.413 --> 43:06.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will be
back shortly
with a story about a marathon
that takes place

43:06.083 --> 43:08.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on a lake, frozen lake, that is.

43:08.686 --> 43:12.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, we ask you to take a
moment to
hear from your local PBS
station.

43:12.390 --> 43:18.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a chance to offer your
support, which
helps to keep

43:18.563 --> 43:22.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a chance to offer your
support, which
helps to keep

43:37.582 --> 43:47.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
programs like ours on the air.

43:47.625 --> 43:52.830 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
programs like ours on the air.

43:52.864 --> 43:54.165 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

43:54.198 --> 44:04.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now

44:04.308 --> 44:10.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now

44:10.414 --> 44:21.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to our "NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught
our eye that might be of
interest to you,

44:22.026 --> 44:23.794 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
too.

44:23.828 --> 44:34.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While many of us can't wait for
temperatures
to thaw, one Russian community
thinks this

44:34.872 --> 44:43.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is the best time of year for a
run, and a
chilly one.

44:43.881 --> 44:46.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s Julia Griffin
explains.

44:46.083 --> 44:55.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Siberia's Lake
Baikal, it's
the world's oldest and deepest
freshwater

44:55.059 --> 44:56.193 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lake.

44:56.227 --> 45:03.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's also the perfect spot for a
midwinter
marathon.

45:03.968 --> 45:10.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN (through translator): It is
a tradition.

45:10.508 --> 45:20.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I do not want to miss it.

45:20.551 --> 45:29.594 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I do not want to miss it.

45:29.627 --> 45:37.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So as long as I have energy, I
will take part
in this race.

considered an extreme sport, it
is the annual

45:56.687 --> 46:01.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Baikal Ice Marathon, a 26.2-mile
dash from
one side of a lake to another,
in subfreezing

46:01.325 --> 46:03.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
temperatures, over nothing but
ice.

46:03.427 --> 46:07.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This year, 200 participants from
32 countries
enthusiastically signed up.

46:07.498 --> 46:17.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: This is a great race, and
we hope everybody enjoys it.

46:17.041 --> 46:24.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: At the starting
line this year,
temperatures hovered around an
unexpectedly

46:24.081 --> 46:26.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
balmy 12 degrees.

46:26.350 --> 46:34.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Runners strapped on their snow
cleats and
stuck athletic tape to exposed
skin.

46:34.158 --> 46:37.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was also the odd pair of
butterfly wings.

MARINA ANDERSEN, Marathon
Runner: I love this
place.

46:41.632 --> 46:48.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think The temperature is
pretty warm today.

46:48.739 --> 46:52.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I expected it to be colder.

46:52.109 --> 46:57.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think it's a good start
for me

46:57.882 --> 47:02.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think it's a good start
for me

47:43.728 --> 47:45.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to start ice-running.

JULIA GRIFFIN: With

49:44.048 --> 49:49.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a shout of a megaphone, they're
off.

49:49.787 --> 49:54.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a shout of a megaphone, they're
off.

minutes and hours pass, the
clusters of runners
disperse.

51:56.714 --> 52:03.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One by one, they brave the slick
ice, blistering
winds, burning sun, with only
ambition to

52:03.988 --> 52:05.589 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cheer them on.

52:05.622 --> 52:08.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the psychological challenges
don't end
there.

52:08.926 --> 52:14.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The flat, featureless landscape
makes it difficult
for runners to gauge their
progress.

52:14.465 --> 52:22.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Only periodic refreshment
stands, with tea,
water and a variety of snacks,
mark the miles.

52:22.172 --> 52:28.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yet, Bartosh Maserski of Poland
crossed the
finish line with a
record-setting time of

52:28.645 --> 52:33.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
two hours, 53 minutes and 26
seconds.

52:33.183 --> 52:36.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had to miss last year's
marathon, so this
was a redeeming victory.

BARTOSH MASERSKI,
®MD-BO /Marathon Winner:
I broke my leg two days before
marathon.

52:41.091 --> 52:42.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I come back here.

52:42.393 --> 52:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I do it, and I am very, very
happy.

JULIA GRIFFIN: For a frigid foot
race, a heartwarming
end.

JUDY WOODRUFF: You have got to
give them credit.

53:00.611 --> 53:01.745 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

"NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:03.647 --> 53:08.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Tuesday: one day ahead of a
general election
in the Netherlands, a look at
the continued

53:08.752 --> 53:10.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rise of the right in Europe.

53:10.854 --> 53:11.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
