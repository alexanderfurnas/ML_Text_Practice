JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.733 --> 00:06.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.733 --> 00:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.833 --> 00:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS, U.S. Attorney
General: The suggestion that I
participated in any collusion

00:12.466 --> 00:17.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that I was aware of,
any collusion with the
Russian government to
hurt this country, which

00:19.366 --> 00:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have served with honor for
35 years, is an appalling
and detestable lie.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jeff
Sessions in the hot seat.

00:28.066 --> 00:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The attorney general testifies
before the Senate over
allegations of collusion with

00:35.033 --> 00:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia and defends his decision
to recommend the firing of
then FBI Director James Comey.

00:40.633 --> 00:44.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: North Korea releases
University of Virginia
student Otto Warmbier,
who is in a coma, more

00:46.833 --> 00:51.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
than a year after
he was sentenced to
15 years hard labor.

00:53.866 --> 00:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Uber's CEO takes a leave
of absence amid a review of the
company's policies and culture,

00:58.533 --> 01:02.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
which have been under
fire since a recent
string of controversies.

01:02.266 --> 01:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:07.200 --> 01:09.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:09.733 --> 01:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It has been
another day of high-stakes
testimony before the
Senate Intelligence

01:22.033 --> 01:24.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Committee.

01:24.100 --> 01:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Attorney General Jeff Sessions
today denied any wrongdoing
in his contacts with Russian

01:29.933 --> 01:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
officials during last year's
campaign or in his conduct
since becoming attorney general.

01:35.166 --> 01:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He acknowledged that then
FBI Director James Comey was
concerned about being left alone

01:40.866 --> 01:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with President Trump
after a February meeting.

01:43.533 --> 01:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He declined to discuss any
conversations he had with the
president on firing Comey.

01:50.566 --> 01:54.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he defended his
handling of his recusal
from the investigation
into Russian meddling

01:55.033 --> 01:57.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the election.

01:57.066 --> 02:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sessions also said he still
doesn't remember a meeting with
the Russian ambassador at a

02:02.133 --> 02:04.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trump speech in
Washington last year.

02:04.600 --> 02:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he said he never meant
to mislead anyone during
his confirmation hearings.

02:08.500 --> 02:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS, U.S. Attorney
General: Let me state
this clearly, colleagues.

02:13.066 --> 02:18.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have never met with
or had any conversation
with any Russians or
any foreign officials

02:20.166 --> 02:25.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
concerning any type of
interference with any
campaign or election
in the United States.

02:27.133 --> 02:30.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Further, I have no knowledge of
any such conversations by anyone
connected to the Trump campaign.

02:33.333 --> 02:38.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I was your colleague in
this body for 20 years,
at least some of you.

02:40.366 --> 02:43.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the suggestion that
I participated in any
collusion, that I was
aware of any collusion

02:48.200 --> 02:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the Russian government to
hurt this country, which I have
served with honor for 35 years,

02:55.866 --> 03:00.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or to undermine the integrity
of our democratic process, is
an appalling and detestable lie.

03:03.433 --> 03:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The attorney
general also struck sparks today
when he declined several times

03:10.533 --> 03:14.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to discuss conversations
he had with President
Trump about firing James
Comey or about recusing

03:15.700 --> 03:18.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
himself in the Russia matter.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats, including Senator
Martin Heinrich of New Mexico,
were visibly frustrated.

03:22.633 --> 03:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS: I'm not able
to share with this committee
private communications

03:29.066 --> 03:30.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:30.966 --> 03:32.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN HEINRICH (D), New
Mexico: Because you're
invoking executive privilege?

03:32.466 --> 03:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS: I'm not able
to invoke executive privilege.

03:33.566 --> 03:34.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's the president's
prerogative.

03:34.466 --> 03:36.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:36.466 --> 03:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN HEINRICH: Well, my
understanding is, you took an
oath, you raised your right hand

03:42.433 --> 03:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here today and you said that
you would solemnly swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth and

03:46.433 --> 03:47.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nothing but the truth.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And now you're not
answering questions.

03:49.600 --> 03:51.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You're impeding
this investigation.

03:51.700 --> 03:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS: I am protecting
the president' constitutional
right by not giving it away

03:59.066 --> 04:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
before he has a chance to...

04:00.733 --> 04:01.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

04:01.700 --> 04:02.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:02.900 --> 04:04.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARTIN HEINRICH: You're
having it both ways.

04:04.966 --> 04:07.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFF SESSIONS: And,
secondly, I am telling
the truth in answering
your question, in saying

04:07.233 --> 04:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's a longstanding policy of
the Department of justice...

04:11.233 --> 04:13.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

04:13.266 --> 04:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS: ... even and
to make sure the president has
full opportunity to decide these

04:18.433 --> 04:21.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issues.

04:21.066 --> 04:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, in
another, separate hearing
today, the deputy attorney
general, Rod Rosenstein,

04:26.866 --> 04:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pledged to defend special
counsel Bob Mueller's
probe of Russian
meddling in the election.

04:29.500 --> 04:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Conservative media executive
and Trump ally Christopher
Ruddy told the "NewsHour" last

04:30.966 --> 04:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
night that the president has
been considering firing Mueller.

04:32.900 --> 04:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But in exchanges with Republican
Senators Susan Collins and
Lindsey Graham, Rosenstein

04:34.433 --> 04:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said that he wants to put
that speculation to rest.

04:34.966 --> 04:37.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:37.066 --> 04:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN COLLINS (R), Maine: If
President Trump ordered you to
fire the special counsel, what

04:37.733 --> 04:39.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
would you do?

04:39.800 --> 04:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROD ROSENSTEIN, Deputy Attorney
General Nominee: Senator, I'm
not going to follow any orders

04:41.266 --> 04:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unless I believe those are
lawful and appropriate orders.

04:42.700 --> 04:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If there were good cause,
I would consider it.

04:44.733 --> 04:45.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If there were not good
cause, it wouldn't matter
to me what anybody says.

04:45.266 --> 04:47.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:47.300 --> 04:47.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South
Carolina: Do you know any reason
for a cause to fire Mr. Mueller

04:47.966 --> 04:49.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as of this date?

04:49.200 --> 04:49.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ROD ROSENSTEIN: No,
I do not, Senator.

04:49.733 --> 04:51.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:51.833 --> 04:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM: And that
would be your decision if
that ever happened, right?

04:52.766 --> 04:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROD ROSENSTEIN: That's correct.

04:54.766 --> 04:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we are
joined now by our Capitol Hill
correspondent, Lisa Desjardins.

04:56.300 --> 04:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She was in the room for both
of today's Senate hearings.

04:59.400 --> 05:04.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Carrie Johnson,
correspondent for NPR, she
covers the Justice Department.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you both.

05:06.233 --> 05:07.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Lisa, I'm going
to start with you.

05:07.033 --> 05:09.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You were in the room.

05:09.133 --> 05:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tell us what you were seeing
and what you were hearing that
we couldn't see on television.

05:12.466 --> 05:14.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Well,
this extraordinary
week just continued.

05:14.966 --> 05:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was a rather remarkable
hearing, and not just because
there was yet again a line going

05:19.700 --> 05:24.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
out the door and down
the hallway to attend
it, but I think because
we saw very serious

05:26.566 --> 05:29.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
questions, Judy, from both
Republicans and Democrats
about Attorney General Sessions

05:29.666 --> 05:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and about the role of the
Trump administration and Trump
campaign in their meetings with

05:34.033 --> 05:36.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Russia.

05:36.600 --> 05:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I took away that this was
a serious investigation,
that senators are trying
to show the American

05:39.666 --> 05:43.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people, in particular with
this very public hearing, that
they're tackling this, but there

05:43.866 --> 05:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are still a lot of
questions left after today's
hearing as well, Judy.

05:47.100 --> 05:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Carrie
Johnson, as I said, you
cover the Justice Department.

05:51.933 --> 05:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have been watching
this from that perspective.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What did you hear new
today in the testimony
by the attorney general?

06:02.066 --> 06:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON, NPR: For Jeff
Sessions, the attorney general,
a qualified or limited success

06:06.833 --> 06:08.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

06:08.900 --> 06:12.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was able to defend himself
with respect to some of the
allegations swirling around

06:12.366 --> 06:14.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about him.

06:14.366 --> 06:17.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He denied he had a meeting with
the Russian ambassador last
year at the Mayflower Hotel.

06:17.700 --> 06:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He denied he had tried to lean
on the FBI director, fired
FBI Director James Comey,

06:24.766 --> 06:29.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and he also denied that
he had misled Congress
when he testified in his
confirmation hearings

06:31.033 --> 06:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
earlier this year that
he only had a couple
meetings with the Russians.

06:37.300 --> 06:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he tried to clear up all
of those mistakes that he had
made, I think with some success

06:41.933 --> 06:43.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
today, Judy.

06:43.933 --> 06:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Carrie, I was
struck that he - - sorry you're
having microphone troubles.

06:47.600 --> 06:52.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All right, let me go back to
Lisa Desjardins just a minute
while Carrie gets the earpiece

06:53.866 --> 06:55.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
straightened out.

06:55.900 --> 06:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Lisa, I know you have
been talking to these senators
on the committee in the days

07:00.800 --> 07:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and weeks leading up to this.

07:02.533 --> 07:07.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For them, how critical
was this testimony by
the attorney general?

07:07.366 --> 07:12.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Is this just one more
step along a long road
of this investigation?

07:12.266 --> 07:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think
the answer that it was both
critical and it is just one more

07:16.633 --> 07:19.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
step along the road
of this investigation.

07:19.066 --> 07:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Judy, I think we're at the
point where each one of these
kinds of hearings is critical.

07:23.200 --> 07:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, to be honest, many of
these senators say they're
not exactly sure where all of

07:26.800 --> 07:28.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this is leading yet.

07:28.900 --> 07:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're still asking these
first rounds of questions to
see who else do they need to

07:31.866 --> 07:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
talk to and about which event.

07:33.933 --> 07:38.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, Judy, the questions
remaining from today's hearing
especially are, did President

07:40.333 --> 07:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump directly order Mr.
Sessions to write that memo
endorsing James Comey's firing,

07:46.400 --> 07:48.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and what conversations
did they have about that?

07:48.566 --> 07:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Did President Trump indicate
why he wanted Mr. Comey fired?

07:52.533 --> 07:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you played in the bite, Mr.
Sessions refused to answer any
communication questions about

07:59.533 --> 08:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his talks with Mr. Trump, and
that's something I think we're
going to see played a lot.

08:01.666 --> 08:05.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was never able to give
a legal justification
for refusing to answer.

08:05.533 --> 08:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, he I basically leaving
an opening for the president
to later invoke executive

08:10.133 --> 08:12.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
privilege, but, Judy,
he hasn't done so yet.

08:12.433 --> 08:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And his attorney general hasn't
answered these questions.

08:14.966 --> 08:17.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So,
Carrie, back to you now.

08:17.800 --> 08:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Again, you have been
following this very closely.

08:20.766 --> 08:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What questions do you still
have that the attorney general
either wasn't able to or

08:24.900 --> 08:27.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
didn't answer today?

08:27.000 --> 08:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: The attorney
general never said whether
the president discussed with

08:31.133 --> 08:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him in connection with firing
James Comey anything regarding
the Russia investigation.

08:38.066 --> 08:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The attorney general refused
to answer whether the president
had brought up with him the

08:40.666 --> 08:45.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
idea of pardoning anyone in
the Trump campaign who may have
had contacts with the Russians

08:46.266 --> 08:48.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last year.

08:48.233 --> 08:52.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the attorney general really
didn't have a good answer
for why he left James Comey

08:52.033 --> 08:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hanging to defend himself after
the president pressured him in
the Oval Office on the Russia

08:59.033 --> 09:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
probe, so lots of questions
remaining for Jeff Sessions
on those topics as it relates

09:05.333 --> 09:07.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to his interactions
with President Trump.

09:07.933 --> 09:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think some of the
Democrats on the committee
today vowed to get answers
to those questions,

09:12.000 --> 09:13.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
come hell or high water.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Carrie, just a
quick question of clarification.

09:15.566 --> 09:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You said he didn't address
pardoning anyone in connection
with the Russia investigation.

09:20.033 --> 09:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are you referring to?

09:22.033 --> 09:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: Well, he was
asked questions by Democrats
today, Jeff Sessions was, about

09:28.333 --> 09:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether -- you know, this
investigation is early, but
whether he had talked with the

09:31.900 --> 09:36.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president at all about the
president using his power, very
vast power, to grant a pardon

09:38.900 --> 09:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to anyone who may have engaged
in wrongdoing in connection
with Russia in the campaign.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No names were mentioned.

09:45.966 --> 09:49.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that several
people, including
President Trump's former
national security adviser,

09:49.166 --> 09:52.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Michael Flynn, are
under investigators'
crosshairs right now.

09:52.800 --> 09:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know that Flynn, in fact,
has tried to seek immunity,
so far without success.

09:57.466 --> 10:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sessions was asked whether the
idea of pardoning anybody came
up, and he declined to answer

10:01.933 --> 10:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that question as part of the
confidential conversations he
was having with the president.

10:06.400 --> 10:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I want to know more about that.

10:07.666 --> 10:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think lawmakers do, too.

10:09.700 --> 10:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Carrie Johnson,
as we said, who covers the
Justice Department for NPR,

10:13.833 --> 10:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our own Lisa Desjardins at
the Capitol, thank you both.

10:18.133 --> 10:22.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And we turn now to our
panel of former Justice
Department officials.

10:22.400 --> 10:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
George Terwilliger served as
former deputy attorney general
and acting attorney general

10:26.566 --> 10:29.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
under President
George H.W. Bush.

10:29.166 --> 10:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Walter Dellinger served in
the Clinton administration
as assistant attorney
general and as acting

10:34.900 --> 10:36.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
solicitor general.

10:36.933 --> 10:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Carrie Cordero, she served
in the Justice Department
under presidents George W. Bush

10:40.333 --> 10:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and President Obama, where
she worked on matters
of national security.

10:44.733 --> 10:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, before I speak with them,
one issue today was former
FBI Director Comey's testimony

10:51.766 --> 10:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about a February meeting in
the Oval Office, when everyone
else left, and the president

10:56.633 --> 10:58.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
asked him to stay.

10:58.733 --> 11:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democratic Senator Mark
Warner today pressed the
attorney general on that.

11:01.533 --> 11:02.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Let's listen.

11:02.533 --> 11:04.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
®MD-BSEN.

11:04.633 --> 11:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER (D), Virginia: Mr.
Comey's testimony last week was
that he felt uncomfortable when

11:07.400 --> 11:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the president asked everyone
else to leave the room.

11:11.633 --> 11:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He left the impression that
you lingered, perhaps a sense
that you felt uncomfortable

11:15.500 --> 11:17.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about it as well.

11:17.300 --> 11:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS: Well, I
would just say it this way.

11:21.100 --> 11:22.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We were there.

11:22.100 --> 11:24.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was standing there.

11:24.200 --> 11:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And without revealing any
conversation that took place,
what I do recall is that I did

11:30.366 --> 11:32.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
depart.

11:32.500 --> 11:36.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I believe everyone else
did depart, and Director
Comey was sitting in
front of the president's

11:37.233 --> 11:38.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
desk, and they were talking.

11:38.166 --> 11:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, that's what I do remember.

11:40.233 --> 11:44.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I believe it was the
next day that he said
something, expressed
concern about being left

11:45.300 --> 11:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
alone with the president.

11:46.966 --> 11:51.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But that, in itself,
is not problematic.

11:51.566 --> 11:56.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He didn't tell me, at that time,
any details about anything that
was said that was improper.

11:58.633 --> 12:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I affirmed his concern that we
should be following the proper
guidelines of the Department of

12:05.800 --> 12:09.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Justice and basically backed
him up in his concerns.

12:09.366 --> 12:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, let's turn
now to our three panelists.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Carrie Cordero, I'm
going to start with you.

12:15.200 --> 12:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you make of that answer
that he really didn't have an
explanation for leaving the

12:19.400 --> 12:23.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
room, whether he thought that
was unusual, leaving the Oval
Office when the president

12:23.366 --> 12:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wanted to be alone with the
then FBI director, and he didn't
seem terribly upset about the

12:30.433 --> 12:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fact that the FBI director
was concerned the next day
when he told him about it?

12:32.533 --> 12:34.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CARRIE CORDERO, Former
Department of Justice
Official: Right.

12:34.533 --> 12:37.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, these memos that he's
talking about, this longstanding
Department of Justice policy,

12:37.700 --> 12:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has to do with, in recent
history, there was a
memo that an Attorney
General Mukasey issued,

12:42.533 --> 12:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Eric Holder issued that
restrict the contacts between
the White House and the Justice

12:49.066 --> 12:51.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Department and the
FBI investigators on
ongoing investigations.

12:51.766 --> 12:56.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it was still an
odd answer, because, given
the fact that there was
this major investigation

12:58.766 --> 13:02.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going on that the attorney
general himself knew that he
was recused from, it would be

13:04.233 --> 13:06.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
unusual.

13:06.233 --> 13:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why would the president need
to hold back the FBI director
about something that the

13:12.300 --> 13:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attorney general couldn't
be present for, other than
the Russia investigation?

13:15.133 --> 13:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In other words, anything else
that the FBI director and the
president needed to discuss

13:22.066 --> 13:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a substantive nature,
one would think the attorney
general could be there for it.

13:24.933 --> 13:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: George
Terwilliger, what about that?

13:27.033 --> 13:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEORGE TERWILLIGER, Former U.S.
Deputy Attorney General: Well,
I don't think it's that unusual

13:28.700 --> 13:32.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for a president to talk
to an FBI director alone.

13:32.366 --> 13:37.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it would probably be
worth asking a number of former
FBI directors if they ever

13:38.700 --> 13:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had one-on-one conversations
with the president.

13:40.733 --> 13:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Even in this
-- in the middle of this
kind of an investigation?

13:43.133 --> 13:45.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GEORGE TERWILLIGER: Yes.

13:45.266 --> 13:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, I think, in hindsight,
anybody that looks at it would
go, it would have been better

13:47.400 --> 13:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for that not to have occurred,
but the fact that the president
asked and the attorney

13:53.766 --> 13:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
general -- I just -- I
mean, he's a courteous man.

13:56.200 --> 13:59.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think he respected
the president's wishes.

13:59.333 --> 14:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And more than anything, Judy,
I -- what came through to me
today, more than an attorney

14:04.266 --> 14:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
general, was I saw a man who
said, you're not going to
play political football with

14:08.633 --> 14:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my integrity, and said
that very, very firmly
even as to that question.

14:13.133 --> 14:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Walter Dellinger,
what did you take away from
the hearing overall, and

14:16.433 --> 14:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what about the specific
point about the president
asking everybody to
clear the room while he

14:22.200 --> 14:24.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
talked to James Comey?

14:24.300 --> 14:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
®MD-BWALTER DELLINGER, Former
Acting Solicitor General: Well,
I think what was particularly

14:26.366 --> 14:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
improper about that conversation
was the content of it, that is,
the president saying, I hope

14:31.166 --> 14:36.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you will end this investigation
into General Flynn.

14:38.100 --> 14:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even if that wasn't a directive,
that statement that you should
end it because he's a good

14:43.933 --> 14:48.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
guy undercuts our basic notion
of equal justice under law.

14:50.766 --> 14:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We shouldn't be investigating
or stopping investigations
because the president thinks

14:53.600 --> 14:57.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
someone is a good guy or
a U.S. attorney thinks
someone is a good guy.

14:57.466 --> 14:59.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's number one.

14:59.933 --> 15:03.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My larger takeaway
is that the attorney
general seemed relatively
passionate in defending

15:05.266 --> 15:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his own lack of involvement
with the Russians
and quite convincing.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He did.

15:10.633 --> 15:14.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WALTER DELLINGER: He
showed much less concern
about this extraordinary
event that the Russian,

15:16.333 --> 15:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a foreign military
hostile power, tried to
interfere in our elections.

15:19.766 --> 15:24.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He referred to it as
improper, but he didn't seem
to have any energy about
where that investigation

15:26.766 --> 15:29.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should go, didn't seem to
suggest that the president of
the United States is concerned

15:29.466 --> 15:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about what was really a foreign
attack by a hostile power on
the core of our democracy.

15:34.166 --> 15:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we have got
a little excerpt of that coming
up, and I want to ask you that.

15:37.133 --> 15:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But just quickly, on this point,
Carrie Cordero, again, on --
is there a precedent for the

15:45.066 --> 15:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attorney general basically
saying, it's OK for me to remove
myself from a conversation

15:50.066 --> 15:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and let the president talk
to the head of the FBI
about something sensitive?

15:52.900 --> 15:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARRIE CORDERO: Well, so,
in other circumstances,
if, for example, the
FBI director was at the

15:57.866 --> 16:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House to give a
counterterrorism briefing,
on some really substantive
matter, then, sure.

16:02.700 --> 16:05.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But there would be other
aides in the room, too.

16:05.400 --> 16:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That type of briefing wouldn't
take place just with the
president and the FBI director.

16:10.333 --> 16:15.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But those are the types
of scenarios that would
be more routine types
of meetings between

16:17.166 --> 16:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a president and an FBI
director, if it was some
substantive type of briefing.

16:20.733 --> 16:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and -- and
keep all that in mind, because
we want to turn to another

16:24.933 --> 16:27.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
aspect of what came out
in today's testimony.

16:27.900 --> 16:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is that more
than one senator asked
the attorney general
about the firing of James

16:33.366 --> 16:35.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Comey.

16:35.933 --> 16:38.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The attorney general
testified that he didn't
talk to the FBI director
about his job performance

16:38.966 --> 16:41.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
before the president
dismissed him.

16:41.066 --> 16:45.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He did detail for California
Democrat Dianne Feinstein the
issues that he had with Comey,

16:47.566 --> 16:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but he declined to answer
a later question from Maine
independent Senator Angus King.

16:51.433 --> 16:54.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFF SESSIONS: We
had problems there.

16:54.700 --> 16:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was my best judgment that
a fresh start at the FBI was
the appropriate thing to do.

17:03.766 --> 17:06.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And when asked, I said
that to president.

17:06.533 --> 17:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's something I had adhered to.

17:08.833 --> 17:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Deputy Rosenstein's letter
dealt with a number of things.

17:12.866 --> 17:17.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When the -- Mr. Comey declined
the Clinton prosecution,
that was really a usurpation

17:22.933 --> 17:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the authority of the
federal prosecutors in
the Department of Justice.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was a stunning development.

17:30.766 --> 17:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The FBI -- the investigative
team, they don't decide
prosecution policies.

17:37.900 --> 17:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that was a thunderous thing.

17:41.033 --> 17:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also commented at some
length on the declination
of the Clinton prosecution,
which you shouldn't

17:49.400 --> 17:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
normally -- you shouldn't do.

17:50.900 --> 17:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The policies have been historic.

17:52.866 --> 17:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you decline, you decline
and you don't talk about it.

17:55.900 --> 18:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were other things that
had happened that indicated
to me a lack of discipline.

18:02.566 --> 18:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it caused controversy
on both sides of the aisle.

18:06.366 --> 18:10.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I had come to the
conclusion that a fresh
start was appropriate.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

18:11.200 --> 18:13.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

18:13.866 --> 18:15.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGUS KING (I), Maine: In
any of your discussions
about the firing of James
Comey, did the question

18:15.166 --> 18:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the Russian
investigation ever come up?

18:17.233 --> 18:21.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFF SESSIONS: I cannot
answer that because
it was a communication
by the president, or,

18:23.566 --> 18:27.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
if any such occurred, it
would be a communication
that he has not waived.

18:27.500 --> 18:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, a number
of people, George Terwilliger,
were struck by the fact that

18:31.666 --> 18:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the attorney general wouldn't
talk about these conversations
he had with the president.

18:35.633 --> 18:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GEORGE TERWILLIGER: Well, to
me, that makes perfect sense.

18:40.033 --> 18:45.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The privilege belongs to the
president, and it wouldn't be
up to a subordinate official

18:46.900 --> 18:50.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to take it upon himself to
waive it by answering the
question at that time and place.

18:52.833 --> 18:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Otherwise, the president
loses the ability to assert
or preserve that privilege.

18:57.100 --> 19:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you
and I were discussing this
earlier, Walter Dellinger.

19:01.233 --> 19:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were trying to understand,
to what extent is there a
precedent for not answering some

19:07.800 --> 19:09.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of these questions?

19:09.900 --> 19:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We heard the attorney general
say -- at one point, he said,
I think there's even a piece

19:12.566 --> 19:17.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of paper at the Justice
Department that refers
to privileged or
confidential conversations

19:18.966 --> 19:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
between the president
and the attorney general.

19:21.466 --> 19:23.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALTER DELLINGER: You know,
he was very well-prepared,
but he didn't bring
any such piece of paper

19:23.966 --> 19:26.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with him.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would be surprised,
because I don't believe there
is any privilege of refusing

19:29.833 --> 19:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to answer questions from
a congressional committee,
unless the president is
going to invoke executive

19:34.666 --> 19:35.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
privilege.

19:35.666 --> 19:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he didn't want to say that.

19:37.733 --> 19:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Through a dozen iterations of
the question, he would simply
say, it was confidential,

19:41.800 --> 19:43.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
without asserting any privilege.

19:43.866 --> 19:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Finally, he suggested -- and the
committee should follow up on
this -- here are the questions

19:49.100 --> 19:51.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we want answered.

19:51.200 --> 19:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Did you discuss the Russian
investigation in connection
with the firing of Comey?

19:57.100 --> 20:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if the president then wants
to assert executive privilege,
he can do so in writing

20:00.133 --> 20:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
communicated to the committee.

20:02.033 --> 20:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, if not, then the
question ought to be answered
by the attorney general.

20:05.500 --> 20:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Carrie
Cordero, this really does get to
the heart of a lot of what we're

20:08.433 --> 20:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talking about today, and that
is, the president has not so
far exerted executive privilege.

20:15.333 --> 20:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has not said to the
attorney general, you cannot
answer these questions.

20:17.833 --> 20:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the attorney general said,
at least on two occasions today,
that he's trying to protect

20:22.800 --> 20:27.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the president's right to
later on exert executive
privilege, which is a
way of looking at this,

20:29.666 --> 20:31.000 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
I think, some of
us haven't seen.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CARRIE CORDERO: Right.

20:33.066 --> 20:37.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this is the second week in
a row that senior administration
officials have had difficulty

20:37.766 --> 20:39.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
answering this question.

20:39.800 --> 20:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DNI Coats, Director of National
Intelligence Coats, and
Director of NSA Rogers last week

20:46.533 --> 20:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had a similar problem,
where they didn't seem
to have been advised by
the White House Counsel's

20:52.166 --> 20:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Office that they should
exert executive privilege,
and yet they were
uncomfortable giving answers

20:56.300 --> 20:57.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to questions.

20:57.900 --> 21:00.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Attorney General
Sessions handled it a
little bit differently.

21:00.533 --> 21:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He did say that he was trying
to protect a potential exertion
of executive privilege,

21:06.700 --> 21:08.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but he also raised
other privileges.

21:08.233 --> 21:10.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He said maybe there are
some other privileges.

21:10.400 --> 21:14.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so that reminded
me a little bit more of
the attorney-client-type
privilege that

21:14.833 --> 21:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sometimes the Department of
Justice asserts, but that's
when the Justice Department is

21:21.800 --> 21:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
giving legal advice to the
president, and they don't then
want to provide information

21:26.233 --> 21:28.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Congress.

21:28.300 --> 21:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he was still vague and
unclear about which privileges
he was potentially asserting.

21:34.300 --> 21:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that sounded
like a different question.

21:36.833 --> 21:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I'm coming back to
you, George Terwilliger,
to ask, on just how
solid is this ground that

21:43.233 --> 21:46.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the attorney general stands on
when he says, I'm protecting
the president's right to exert

21:46.100 --> 21:47.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
executive...

21:47.400 --> 21:49.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GEORGE TERWILLIGER: I
think it's very solid.

21:49.400 --> 21:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And both Democrat and Republican
officials have asserted that
privilege over the years,

21:52.700 --> 21:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as recently as in the Obama
administration through
Attorney General Holder.

21:58.866 --> 22:01.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's really quite
simple, I think, Judy.

22:01.066 --> 22:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the president has a privilege
to have confidential discussions
with his advisers, which include

22:08.300 --> 22:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cabinet officials, the
Cabinet officials shouldn't
be the ones to decide the
waive the confidentiality

22:13.266 --> 22:15.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of those communications.

22:15.366 --> 22:19.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he doesn't know what
questions he is going
to be asked before he
gets up there, to ask

22:19.700 --> 22:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
permission ahead of time,
can I talk about this,
can I talk about that?

22:23.166 --> 22:25.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, I think it's just
a very practical issue.

22:25.366 --> 22:29.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, there is
another important part of this,
what came out today in today's

22:29.300 --> 22:31.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
testimony that we
want to look at.

22:31.333 --> 22:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is on the attorney --
on the issue of the attorney
general's recusing himself

22:35.333 --> 22:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from the Russia investigation.

22:37.733 --> 22:42.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Mr. Sessions clashed at
one point with Oregon
Democratic Senator Ron
Wyden, who challenged

22:43.833 --> 22:45.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
him on whether he
adhered to that recusal.

22:45.333 --> 22:47.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

22:47.366 --> 22:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RON WYDEN (D), Oregon: The
question is, Mr. Comey said that
there were matters with respect

22:52.833 --> 22:57.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to recusal that were problematic
and he couldn't talk about them.

22:57.900 --> 22:59.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What are they?

22:59.200 --> 23:02.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFF SESSIONS: Why
don't you tell me?

23:02.133 --> 23:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are none, Senator Wyden.

23:04.733 --> 23:05.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
There are none.

23:05.933 --> 23:10.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I can tell you that
for absolute certainty.

23:10.233 --> 23:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a secret innuendo
being leaked out there about
me, and I don't appreciate it.

23:17.233 --> 23:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have tried to give my
best and truthful answers to any
committee I've appeared before.

23:23.266 --> 23:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's really -- people are
suggesting through innuendo that
I have been not honest about

23:30.233 --> 23:32.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
matters, and I've
tried to be honest.

23:32.233 --> 23:34.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

23:34.800 --> 23:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RON WYDEN: Why did you
sign a letter recommending
the fire -- firing of
Comey, when it violated

23:40.133 --> 23:41.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your recusal?

23:41.333 --> 23:43.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFF SESSIONS: It didn't
violate my recusal.

23:43.966 --> 23:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It didn't violate my recusal.

23:47.066 --> 23:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That would be answer to that.

23:49.533 --> 23:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the letter that I signed
represented my views that had
been formulated for some time.

23:56.033 --> 23:58.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

23:58.166 --> 24:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RON WYDEN: Mr. Chairman, just
if I can finish, that answer,
in my view, doesn't pass the

24:01.333 --> 24:03.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
smell test.

24:03.400 --> 24:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Walter
Dellinger, this is getting at
the -- what you heard, the tug

24:09.533 --> 24:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and pull about all afternoon,
and that is that letter that
the attorney general signed

24:15.900 --> 24:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the deputy attorney
general signed criticizing
then FBI Director Comey
as the grounds for

24:20.866 --> 24:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his dismissal was all about
how he handled the Hillary
Clinton, or largely about how

24:24.600 --> 24:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he handled the Hillary
Clinton e-mail investigation.

24:26.933 --> 24:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Later on, the president said he
fired him mainly over Russia,
the Russia investigation.

24:31.333 --> 24:36.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the attorney general
is basically saying, I
recused myself from the
Russia investigation,

24:37.200 --> 24:39.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but that's not a problem here.

24:39.166 --> 24:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALTER DELLINGER: Well, the
attorney general makes the
point that he's responsible for

24:41.500 --> 24:44.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the entire department, and he
has to make personnel decisions.

24:44.800 --> 24:49.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, this one got awfully
close to his recusal issue.

24:49.700 --> 24:52.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And maybe he should
have stepped aside.

24:52.100 --> 24:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, to me, the most interesting
question that wasn't fully
answered was, were you aware

24:59.133 --> 25:03.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - when you sent the letter
to the president recommending
that Comey be fired, were you

25:04.766 --> 25:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
aware that the president had
already decided to fire him?

25:07.933 --> 25:12.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that question, he
-- the answer got evaded
in the back-and-forth.

25:12.100 --> 25:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that will be an
interesting question for
someone to follow up with.

25:15.666 --> 25:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is
your take on this exchange?

25:17.633 --> 25:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARRIE CORDERO: Well, the
nut of it is, is, was former
Director Comey fired because of

25:23.100 --> 25:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Russia investigation?

25:25.100 --> 25:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president has said in an
interview that it was, that
Russia is what was on his mind.

25:28.733 --> 25:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Attorney General Sessions
is clinging to this argument
that his -- his justification,

25:36.133 --> 25:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is that it was
because of the handling of
the Hillary Clinton case.

25:40.766 --> 25:45.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And because he didn't answer
the one question, which was, in
the context of discussing with

25:47.800 --> 25:51.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the president the firing
of the FBI director,
did you also discuss the
Russia investigation,

25:53.266 --> 25:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that was the question that
really needed to be answered
to tie these pieces together.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, we don't
have the answer to the question?

25:57.833 --> 26:00.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GEORGE TERWILLIGER: I don't
think he's clinging to anything.

26:00.000 --> 26:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's very possible -- I don't
know the answer, but it's very
possible that there could be

26:04.500 --> 26:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two very different reasons
on the part of the president
and the attorney general and

26:08.200 --> 26:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the deputy attorney general
for dismissing Mr. Comey.

26:12.533 --> 26:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Indeed, I know you may have
to be sort of part of the
Justice family or cognoscenti

26:19.466 --> 26:23.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to appreciate this, but what
Jim Comey did last July in terms
of usurping, as the attorney

26:25.800 --> 26:30.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
general put it, the authority
of the Justice Department to
make a prosecution decision,

26:30.566 --> 26:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then the utter trashing
of Hillary Clinton that he did
along with that, that is so far

26:37.466 --> 26:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
outside the mainstream, that
the attorney general said today
that he and Mr. Rosenstein

26:43.466 --> 26:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had been talking about
that for some time and the
need to replace Mr. Comey.

26:48.700 --> 26:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fact that that may have
been, or not, I don't know,
convenient to the president

26:52.433 --> 26:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for other reasons is something,
you know, that I'm sure the
Senate will want to explore,

26:59.033 --> 27:01.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
but it doesn't impugn
the attorney general's
integrity at all.

27:01.633 --> 27:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But just to
quickly follow up, if the Russia
investigation was any part

27:05.966 --> 27:10.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of the reason for the
president's firing the
FBI director, and the
attorney general was

27:12.366 --> 27:16.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
- - attached himself to that
decision, that wasn't a problem?

27:16.766 --> 27:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That didn't violate his recusal?

27:18.833 --> 27:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEORGE TERWILLIGER: Well, it
might have if, in fact, you
know, he thought that was the

27:24.566 --> 27:26.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reason or he acted as
that -- the reason.

27:26.166 --> 27:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think Walter a few minutes
ago made a very good point.

27:29.333 --> 27:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The recusal is as to one case
out of thousands in the Justice
Department, albeit an important

27:34.800 --> 27:37.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
one.

27:37.300 --> 27:39.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The attorney general
still has a responsibility
to run the department,
not the least of which

27:39.200 --> 27:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is to make sure he has the
right people in the top jobs.

27:41.733 --> 27:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just very
quickly, Walter Dellinger,
what is the -- what
the -- do you think we

27:45.700 --> 27:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can get to the bottom of this
question of whether the recusal
was violated in some way?

27:53.100 --> 27:56.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALTER DELLINGER: I think
we will, because I think
the special counsel,
follow-up hearings

27:58.733 --> 28:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are going to say, look, either
the president formally invoke
executive privilege or answer

28:04.300 --> 28:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the question about whether you
knew already that the president
made up his mind to fire

28:09.466 --> 28:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Comey, and to deal with the
fact that it is extremely
unusual for a president to have

28:14.166 --> 28:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
half-a-dozen conversations
with an FBI director directly.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Walter Dellinger,
Carrie Cordero, George
Terwilliger, we thank you all.

28:25.300 --> 28:27.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Remarkable day,
another remarkable day.

28:27.266 --> 28:31.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And for more
on the attorney general's
testimony, I'm now joined by the

28:31.966 --> 28:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
top Democrat on the House
Intelligence Committee.

28:35.066 --> 28:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is Representative Adam
Schiff of California.

28:37.800 --> 28:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Congressman Schiff,
thank you for joining us.

28:40.033 --> 28:44.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know you paid close
attention to what was said
today by the attorney general.

28:44.800 --> 28:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Did you come away with a better
understanding of what has
happened over the last year?

28:50.266 --> 28:51.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

28:51.500 --> 28:53.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ADAM SCHIFF (D),
California: I did.

28:53.533 --> 28:57.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what was notable to me was
the degree to which the attorney
general really corroborated

28:59.300 --> 29:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what is, I think, the most
significant of the meetings
that James Comey testified.

29:01.566 --> 29:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is, he did corroborate
that there was a meeting of
many people in the Oval Office.

29:09.133 --> 29:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And although he didn't say
it was at the president's
instruction, it was
pretty clear that it was.

29:12.300 --> 29:15.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Everyone left the room,
except for James Comey
and the president.

29:15.566 --> 29:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the attorney general
acknowledged that he did linger,
that he was one of the last,

29:19.933 --> 29:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if not the last, to leave the
room, and also corroborated
the fact that, the following

29:24.233 --> 29:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
day, Director Comey told him he
was essentially uncomfortable
with something that took place

29:29.833 --> 29:31.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in that meeting.

29:31.800 --> 29:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That tells me that James Comey's
testimony about that meeting
is far more accurate than

29:37.966 --> 29:41.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president's statements about
that meeting, because, if there
wasn't something uncomfortable

29:43.533 --> 29:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about it, then why did the
director go the next day to
the attorney general and say,

29:46.033 --> 29:48.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't leave me alone
again with the president?

29:48.800 --> 29:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other point I would
make, Judy, is the one that
you have been discussing.

29:51.433 --> 29:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is, we cannot
accept this non-invocation
of privilege as a reason
to prohibit the Congress

29:59.733 --> 30:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from finding out whether the
attorney general wrote a memo
or wrote a letter along with

30:06.766 --> 30:10.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the deputy attorney general to
provide cover or pretext for
a decision they knew was made

30:10.900 --> 30:13.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on other grounds.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, I don't know if that's
the case, because he wouldn't
answer, but as it goes to the

30:15.966 --> 30:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very heart of whether
the president sought to
interfere or obstruct
the Russia investigation,

30:20.733 --> 30:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we need to use whatever
compulsory process is
necessary to get those answers.

30:25.133 --> 30:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we heard
at the end of the meeting --
of the hearing, rather, the

30:28.900 --> 30:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chairman, Richard Burr, Senator
Burr, asked the attorney
general to go back to the White

30:35.900 --> 30:39.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House to see if there's more
of his communications with the
president and with anyone in the

30:40.566 --> 30:43.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
White House that they can share.

30:43.400 --> 30:47.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Is that something that
you think is likely to
produce some answers?

30:47.233 --> 30:48.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

30:48.233 --> 30:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I don't know.

30:49.233 --> 30:51.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I would certainly hope so.

30:51.366 --> 30:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will say this, in light of
the conversation that you just
had with Walter Dellinger and

30:54.366 --> 30:56.533 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Mr. Terwilliger,
a couple things.

30:56.533 --> 31:01.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
First is, the questions
that were asked of the
attorney general were
all easily anticipated,

31:02.100 --> 31:04.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so there were no
surprise questions here.

31:04.266 --> 31:07.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There was no reason why
the White House could
not have instructed the
attorney general whether

31:07.733 --> 31:09.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they were going to
invoke privilege or not.

31:09.766 --> 31:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I don't buy the idea that
the attorney general couldn't
know in advance whether he

31:13.300 --> 31:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
needed to invoke the privilege.

31:14.933 --> 31:16.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They didn't want him to.

31:16.066 --> 31:17.800 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
They didn't want
the optic of it.

31:17.800 --> 31:21.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that's not a good
reason for refusing to
answer the questions.

31:21.466 --> 31:26.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, more than that, if the
attorney general allowed himself
to be used as a pretext to

31:28.700 --> 31:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
give justification for a firing
that was made on other grounds,
that not only violates his

31:34.166 --> 31:36.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
recusal.

31:36.100 --> 31:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It also potentially violates
the law or is a highly unethical
practice, and we need to

31:42.200 --> 31:44.200 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
find out whether
that's the case.

31:44.200 --> 31:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't know, but we have an
obligation in our investigation,
Bob Mueller will in his,

31:49.700 --> 31:51.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to get the answer.

31:51.766 --> 31:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, how
do you get beyond his
refusal to answer, though?

31:54.500 --> 31:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he's saying these were
privileged communications
that I had that stand
on precedent at the

32:01.566 --> 32:05.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Department of Justice, whether
they're written down or not,
how do you get through that?

32:05.666 --> 32:07.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

32:07.733 --> 32:09.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I think
the process, if we're going to
live up with our institutional

32:09.866 --> 32:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
responsibility in Congress,
is to go back to the White
House and say, we want answers

32:14.433 --> 32:16.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to these questions.

32:16.166 --> 32:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Are you invoking the privilege?

32:18.200 --> 32:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, if they're not, we need
to bring the attorney general
back before either our committee

32:21.800 --> 32:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the House or before the
Senate committee and demand
answers to those questions.

32:28.733 --> 32:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they do invoke privilege,
then we may need to litigate
the contours of that privilege.

32:31.566 --> 32:36.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The privilege cannot
be used as a shield to
protect or hide potential
impropriety or illegality.

32:38.566 --> 32:43.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we may have to go to court
to pierce that privilege, but
we do need to get to the bottom

32:44.766 --> 32:46.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of this.

32:46.933 --> 32:50.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have the powers and
institution to do it,
and I think we have
an ethical obligation

32:50.366 --> 32:52.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and a responsibility to
the country to do it.

32:52.800 --> 32:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman,
were you struck by,
were you surprised when
the attorney general

32:56.033 --> 33:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said that he had not had, had
not sought any sort of briefing
on attempts by the Russians

33:02.566 --> 33:04.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to interfere in the
election last year?

33:04.333 --> 33:05.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

33:05.333 --> 33:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: I was struck by it.

33:07.466 --> 33:11.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Certainly, during his time in
the Senate and as a member of
the Armed Services Committee,

33:11.033 --> 33:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when we have a hostile
power, Russia, interfering
in our internal affairs,
you would think he

33:15.400 --> 33:17.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
would have an interest in that.

33:17.466 --> 33:22.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, more than that, it
was an echo of Director
Comey's testimony also
that the president

33:23.900 --> 33:27.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
showed no curiosity,
no interest, no concern
over the Russia hack.

33:29.933 --> 33:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The only element of it that
concerned him was how it
might impact him personally.

33:35.266 --> 33:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That says, I think, a lot
about where the president is
coming from, but it was quite

33:38.100 --> 33:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
jarring given this was an
attack on our democracy
by a foreign power.

33:42.500 --> 33:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman,
another thing I saw late this
afternoon after the hearing

33:46.766 --> 33:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concluded that the --
that Senator Dick Durbin,
who, of course, is in
the leadership among

33:51.233 --> 33:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats in the Senate, was
saying that the attorney general
should step down based on

33:57.700 --> 34:01.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his testimony today, his --
and his performance in office.

34:01.366 --> 34:02.733 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Are you -- would
you go that far?

34:02.733 --> 34:04.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

34:04.700 --> 34:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I would want
to pursue two things before
I would be prepared to go

34:07.066 --> 34:09.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that far.

34:09.133 --> 34:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the first is to do whatever
investigation we need to do to
find out whether his testimony

34:12.566 --> 34:17.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today about what happened
or didn't happen at the
Mayflower is accurate
and can be corroborated,

34:19.566 --> 34:23.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or wasn't accurate, in which
case, we do need to consider
the remedies that Dick Durbin

34:24.566 --> 34:27.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
talked about.

34:27.100 --> 34:30.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, also, we need to get
answers to the questions
about what went into
the firing of Director

34:31.833 --> 34:33.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Comey.

34:33.900 --> 34:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if he refuses and doesn't
have a legal basis to do so,
then, again, I think we may

34:38.700 --> 34:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
end up where Senator Durbin is.

34:40.833 --> 34:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At this point,
just quickly, Congressman, are
you optimistic that Congress,

34:46.966 --> 34:49.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that your committee, the Senate
committee, are eventually
going to get to the bottom

34:49.066 --> 34:50.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of this?

34:50.066 --> 34:51.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

34:51.533 --> 34:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: Well, you
know, I certainly hope so.

34:53.600 --> 34:57.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we have the look at
this in a very nonpartisan way
and try to, as best we can,

34:58.533 --> 35:00.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
divorce ourselves
of the consequences.

35:00.666 --> 35:04.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what is at stake here is
really our system of checks and
balances and whether we're going

35:04.466 --> 35:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to allow an administration not
to invoke privilege, but just to
say it's inconvenient for us to

35:09.300 --> 35:11.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tell you the answers.

35:11.400 --> 35:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It wouldn't reflect well on us,
so we're going to invoke some
inchoate privilege that doesn't

35:17.200 --> 35:18.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
exist.

35:18.333 --> 35:19.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We can't tolerate that.

35:19.700 --> 35:21.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We can't stand for that.

35:21.800 --> 35:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at the end of the day, I
don't think Bob Mueller will,
and Congress shouldn't either.

35:27.733 --> 35:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman
Adam Schiff of California, the
ranking Democrat on the House

35:30.233 --> 35:32.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Intelligence Committee,
thank you very much.

35:32.100 --> 35:33.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

35:33.100 --> 35:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: Thank you, Judy.

35:35.666 --> 35:39.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the
day's other news: Leaders
of two Senate committees
have reached agreement

35:48.166 --> 35:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on new sanctions against Russia.

35:50.700 --> 35:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The plan, announced last night,
targets corruption, human rights
abuses and weapons shipments

35:56.300 --> 35:58.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Syria.

35:58.366 --> 36:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It also requires congressional
review if a president tries to
ease or end existing sanctions.

36:04.333 --> 36:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pentagon leaders were
criticized over not
finishing a new strategy
for the war in Afghanistan.

36:10.500 --> 36:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At a Senate hearing, Defense
Secretary James Mattis says he
will provide details next month.

36:16.900 --> 36:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Arizona Republican John McCain,
chair of the Armed Services
Committee, said it should have

36:19.766 --> 36:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been done within the
administration's first 60 days.

36:22.200 --> 36:24.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

36:24.233 --> 36:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN MCCAIN (R), Arizona: Unless
we get a strategy from you,
you're going to get a strategy

36:26.833 --> 36:28.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
from us.

36:28.233 --> 36:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The fact is, it's not our job.

36:30.333 --> 36:31.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not our job.

36:31.700 --> 36:33.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's yours.

36:33.700 --> 36:36.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES MATTIS, U.S.
Secretary of Defense: Sir,
I understand the urgency.

36:36.266 --> 36:37.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I understand it's
my responsibility.

36:37.966 --> 36:42.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We are not winning in
Afghanistan right now.

36:42.233 --> 36:44.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we will correct this.

36:44.200 --> 36:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Secretary
Mattis had his own
complaint about Congress.

36:47.833 --> 36:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said that -- quote -- "No
enemy has hurt combat readiness
more than the automatic spending

36:53.566 --> 36:55.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cuts of recent years."

36:55.533 --> 37:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Verizon completed its takeover
of Yahoo! today in a deal
valued at $4.5 billion.

37:02.400 --> 37:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yahoo!'s news and other
offerings will be folded into a
new Verizon subsidiary called

37:07.100 --> 37:09.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Oath.

37:09.633 --> 37:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street today,
the Dow Jones industrial
average gained 92 points
to close at 21328.

37:14.733 --> 37:19.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Nasdaq rose nearly
45 points, and the
S&amp;P 500 added 11.

37:21.200 --> 37:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Golden State Warriors
are celebrating their second
NBA championship in three years.

37:28.533 --> 37:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They captured the title
last night in Oakland,
California, after
finishing off the Cleveland

37:31.866 --> 37:34.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Cavaliers in five games.

37:34.100 --> 37:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Golden State lost to Cleveland
in last year's finals.

37:38.533 --> 37:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
an American student released
from North Korea, but his

37:42.700 --> 37:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parents say he is in a
coma; Uber in turmoil
- - the company's CEO
takes a leave of absence;

37:50.166 --> 37:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
behind the jobs numbers that
President Trump says are signs
of a growing economy; and much

37:54.900 --> 37:59.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

38:06.800 --> 38:11.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now to the release
of Otto Warmbier from
captivity in North Korea.

38:11.166 --> 38:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The American college student
was arrested almost 18 months
ago during a trip to the

38:15.900 --> 38:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reclusive nation, and he was
sentenced to 15 years in prison.

38:20.133 --> 38:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This morning came word suddenly
that the United States had
secured his release, but under

38:24.933 --> 38:27.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
apparently desperate
circumstances.

38:27.900 --> 38:31.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Warmbier is comatose,
and has been for a year.

38:31.166 --> 38:36.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An American delegation in
Pyongyang petitioned for his
immediate release yesterday.

38:38.033 --> 38:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our chief foreign
affairs correspondent,
Margaret Warner, reports.

38:40.066 --> 38:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary
of State: At the president's
direction, the Department

38:42.000 --> 38:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of State has secured
the release of Otto
Warmbier from North Korea.

38:46.033 --> 38:50.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: The
announcement came from
Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson at a Senate

38:50.133 --> 38:52.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
budget hearing.

38:52.166 --> 38:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The 22-year-old University of
Virginia student was finally
free, after being jailed by the

38:57.666 --> 39:01.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
North's repressive
regime for 17 months.

39:01.333 --> 39:04.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Anna Fifield has been
reporting the story for
The Washington Post.

39:04.966 --> 39:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She spoke via Skype from Tokyo.

39:07.066 --> 39:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNA FIFIELD, The Washington
Post: What I have been told
is that, last Monday, June

39:09.066 --> 39:11.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the 5th, the North Koreans
actually approached Americans
who they talk to, and they said

39:11.166 --> 39:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Otto Warmbier was in
a coma and had been in a
coma for more than a year.

39:12.766 --> 39:14.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that started the
ball rolling to have
him medically evacuated.

39:14.866 --> 39:18.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The North Koreans said
that he came down with
a case of botulism soon
after his sentencing,

39:20.466 --> 39:23.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that he was given a sleeping
pill and fell into a coma,
and he didn't wake up from

39:34.466 --> 39:36.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

39:36.866 --> 39:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Warmbier's
parents confirmed their
son is in a coma, and
had been medically

39:41.966 --> 39:43.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
evacuated.

39:43.900 --> 39:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a statement to the Associated
Press, they also said: "We
want the world to know how

39:48.366 --> 39:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we and our son have been
brutalized and terrorized
by the pariah regime."

39:55.466 --> 39:59.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Warmbier was arrested
after he allegedly took
a propaganda poster from
the wall of a Pyongyang

40:00.566 --> 40:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hotel on New Year's Eve, 2015.

40:03.500 --> 40:06.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He'd been in North Korea
as part of a tour group.

40:06.666 --> 40:10.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In March last year,
he was sentenced to
15 years hard labor.

40:10.300 --> 40:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OTTO WARMBIER, Released North
Korean Prison: I have made
the worst mistake of my life.

40:13.733 --> 40:18.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: In the past,
Pyongyang has used detained
American citizens to try to

40:18.366 --> 40:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
exert leverage over the U.S.

40:20.633 --> 40:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Anna Fifield says, this
time, the North had appeared
unwilling to bargain.

40:27.566 --> 40:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It didn't respond to U.S. offers
to send a high-level envoy
to discuss Warmbier and three

40:32.266 --> 40:34.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
other Americans
held by the North.

40:34.566 --> 40:37.466 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
One was arrested
just last month.

40:37.466 --> 40:39.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Pyongyang's attitude
changed in May.

40:39.833 --> 40:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It agreed to let Swedish
diplomats visit the prisoners,
and with news of Warmbier's dire

40:46.866 --> 40:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
condition, Pyongyang urgently
requested a meeting with a
top U.S. official at the U.N.

40:50.866 --> 40:52.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last week.

40:52.400 --> 40:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At that point, Fifield said,
President Trump got involved.

40:55.266 --> 41:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNA FIFIELD: Once Otto
Warmbier's condition was known,
I'm told that the president did

41:02.266 --> 41:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
become involved, that he was
informed, that he personally
gave the order to do everything

41:08.166 --> 41:10.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that they could to
get Otto Warmbier out.

41:10.233 --> 41:12.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The release
comes at a time of heightened
tensions between Washington

41:12.366 --> 41:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the regime of Kim Jong-un.

41:15.900 --> 41:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Pyongyang has ramped up its
nuclear and missile programs.

41:19.733 --> 41:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In response, the U.S. has taken
a tough tack, and recently
began deploying the advanced

41:26.166 --> 41:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anti-missile defense known
as THAAD to South Korea.

41:29.233 --> 41:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Fifield says another
motivation may have
driven the North Koreans.

41:32.566 --> 41:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNA FIFIELD: I think the North
Koreans have probably realized
that they did need to get

41:42.233 --> 41:43.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
rid of Otto Warmbier
at some stage, that he
wasn't recovering, and
they needed to hand

41:43.233 --> 41:45.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
him back.

41:45.366 --> 41:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The release
also coincides with former NBA
player Dennis Rodman's latest

41:47.333 --> 41:49.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
visit to Pyongyang.

41:49.433 --> 41:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fifield says she was told
Rodman's visit had nothing to
with the freeing of Warmbier.

41:56.266 --> 42:00.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Warmbier was flown first
to an American military
medical facility in
Japan, then flown on to

42:01.900 --> 42:04.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Cincinnati, near
his family's home.

42:04.066 --> 42:09.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Margaret Warner.

42:11.033 --> 42:15.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: After months of
complaints about the company's
culture, allegations of

42:21.433 --> 42:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sexual harassment and
bias, Uber announced
changes at the top today.

42:28.400 --> 42:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even though the ride service
giant is worth tens of billions
of dollars, it's in the midst

42:31.400 --> 42:33.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of major turmoil.

42:33.966 --> 42:38.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now it will take new steps
to change the culture,
it say, and values of
a company that's become

42:40.066 --> 42:43.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
criticized for very
aggressive, unethical and
potentially illegal tactics.

42:44.266 --> 42:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

42:46.300 --> 42:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Perhaps the
biggest immediate change, Uber's
chief executive and co-founder,

42:48.733 --> 42:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Travis Kalanick, will take an
indefinite leave of absence.

42:52.000 --> 42:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That comes after a personal
loss, the death of his mother,
but also coincides with a new

42:56.000 --> 43:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
report on company policy
and behavior led by former
Attorney General Eric Holder.

43:00.966 --> 43:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Uber's board of directors
reportedly adopted a
series of recommendations
from Holder, including

43:07.933 --> 43:11.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
more oversight of
leadership, new measures
to increase diversity
and inclusion, stricter

43:13.600 --> 43:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
guidelines for employee
behavior, and a pledge to change
Uber's core founding values.

43:18.800 --> 43:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Uber's problems grew after a
former engineer wrote a blog
post this past winter detailing

43:25.166 --> 43:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how she had been sexually
harassed at the company
and how her managers
ignored her complaints.

43:28.800 --> 43:30.900 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We're joined now
by Jessi Hempel.

43:30.900 --> 43:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She head of editorial for
Backchannel, a tech and
business publishing site.

43:34.566 --> 43:36.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome to you.

43:36.566 --> 43:39.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, is this, first of all,
a surprise that Travis
Kalanick is taking a leave?

43:39.600 --> 43:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what further questions
does it raise for you?

43:42.433 --> 43:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JESSI HEMPEL, Backchannel: I
would say, in fact, it can't
be a surprise at this point

43:47.266 --> 43:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that Travis is taking a leave.

43:48.633 --> 43:50.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Look, he's having a
hard personal time.

43:50.233 --> 43:52.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He buried his mother on Friday.

43:52.166 --> 43:55.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But, beyond that,
the company needs it.

43:55.033 --> 43:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Shareholders are worried.

43:56.700 --> 43:59.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They're worried that
the company is going to
begin the lose value.

43:59.333 --> 44:04.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as to what questions that
it raises for me, I think the
biggest question is, Travis

44:04.066 --> 44:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a guy who has managed,
through very smart manipulation
of the shares of the company,

44:10.200 --> 44:12.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to maintain a ton of
control of this company.

44:12.166 --> 44:13.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He certainly will
stay on the board.

44:13.733 --> 44:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want to know what it really
means that he's taking a leave.

44:16.200 --> 44:20.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is he actually going to be
able to step back and let
somebody else run the company?

44:20.000 --> 44:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so, what
are the core - - what is the
core problem at Uber that comes

44:23.733 --> 44:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through the reporting up to
this point and what we know
from the Holder report that's

44:29.333 --> 44:31.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
just come out?

44:31.366 --> 44:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JESSI HEMPEL: I would point to
two problems that are really
highlighted by the Holder

44:35.266 --> 44:36.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
report.

44:36.633 --> 44:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The first and the most
egregious is a cultural problem.

44:38.633 --> 44:40.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It starts at the top.

44:40.733 --> 44:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a company that has for
too long taken it for granted
that people are disposable,

44:44.533 --> 44:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and that the CEO's machismo
attitude has just trickled down.

44:48.900 --> 44:53.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, secondarily, this
is a 14,000-per company,
and Travis has been
running it as if it were

44:54.766 --> 44:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an eight-person start-up.

44:56.933 --> 45:00.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, it has none of the
structures that most
companies put in place
the catch some of this

45:00.300 --> 45:02.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
stuff a lot earlier on.

45:02.166 --> 45:04.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what you really
see in the Holder report.

45:04.300 --> 45:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Holder reports asks for what
at many companies this size are
very basic things, like a better

45:10.933 --> 45:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
H.R. structure that works, or a
head of diversity and inclusion
that actually does that job.

45:15.600 --> 45:17.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
These are pretty basic things.

45:17.700 --> 45:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, there is
always a question, of course,
when you have a company that's

45:21.066 --> 45:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really built and
around the image of one
person, how much can you
separate that person from

45:27.600 --> 45:31.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the company and how much
the company can thrive
now going forward.

45:31.100 --> 45:35.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JESSI HEMPEL: I mean,
I think that really is
the question for Uber.

45:35.700 --> 45:37.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a paradox of sorts.

45:37.800 --> 45:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The reason why Uber has been
so successful so far is also
the reason why the culture

45:42.000 --> 45:44.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is in such crisis.

45:44.100 --> 45:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you truly are able to strip
Travis, not just Travis, but
his values from this company,

45:49.133 --> 45:50.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what do you have left?

45:50.433 --> 45:52.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What are you going
to rebuild it as?

45:52.000 --> 45:54.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What is the vision
going forward?

45:54.066 --> 45:58.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, do you
see any new steps in what you
have seen so far to ensure the

46:00.233 --> 46:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
diversity, the better kind of
leadership, the taking away
the bias that's been there?

46:05.700 --> 46:07.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JESSI HEMPEL: Well, absolutely.

46:07.166 --> 46:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, this is a company that's
truly taking this seriously.

46:10.233 --> 46:12.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now, it's about time.

46:12.300 --> 46:17.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But last week, we saw that
the company hired Frances Frei
from Harvard Business School.

46:18.400 --> 46:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's a renowned executive
leadership expert.

46:21.000 --> 46:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she's going to come in, and
she says she has full leeway
to do whatever she needs to

46:26.866 --> 46:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
do to improve the culture.

46:29.400 --> 46:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, the
biggest challenge for
this company right now is
that it has no leadership.

46:34.400 --> 46:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, it's not just that
it doesn't have Travis.

46:35.900 --> 46:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's executive ranks are
incredibly thin right now.

46:38.700 --> 46:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so Uber's first -- the
first thing it needs to do is
simply put new leaders in place.

46:45.633 --> 46:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, frankly, it's a pretty
hard place to recruit
skilled leaders right now.

46:48.033 --> 46:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't know a heck of a lot
of people who want to go.

46:50.433 --> 46:51.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

46:51.433 --> 46:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Excuse me.

46:52.433 --> 46:54.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JESSI HEMPEL: Yes.

46:54.466 --> 46:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: How much impact
has all this had on ridership
and on the bottom line?

46:56.300 --> 46:59.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JESSI HEMPEL: Well, it's
hard to say right now.

46:59.566 --> 47:04.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, profits --
revenues continue to
agree at this company,
and its loss last quarter

47:05.166 --> 47:07.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
shrunk some.

47:07.266 --> 47:10.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we have also seen the
competitor Lyft gain some
market share in the U.S.

47:10.766 --> 47:15.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I have heard that
advertisers are a little
nervous about putting
their brand next to

47:16.366 --> 47:18.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Uber right now.

47:18.400 --> 47:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think that we're
going to start to see over the
long term, over the next few

47:20.933 --> 47:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
months the impact that the
last few months has had.

47:23.100 --> 47:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And just very
briefly, Jessi, how much of all
this is being watched by other

47:27.500 --> 47:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
companies who have been
charged with a similar kind
of culture in Silicon Valley?

47:32.400 --> 47:35.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JESSI HEMPEL: You make
a really great point.

47:35.233 --> 47:39.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Uber is in the spotlight
for this, but this
isn't an Uber problem.

47:39.066 --> 47:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a problem that a lot of
start-ups have that have grown
to these massive valuations

47:43.533 --> 47:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with many employees based
on the charisma and the
vision of one founder.

47:48.266 --> 47:53.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think one thing that we
will see going forward is that
Silicon Valley will hopefully

47:55.333 --> 47:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
look itself in the mirror and
rethink some of the ways that
it structures these start-ups

47:58.233 --> 47:59.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to begin with.

47:59.733 --> 48:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Jessi Hempel
of Backchannel, thank you.

48:01.033 --> 48:02.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

48:02.266 --> 48:06.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JESSI HEMPEL: Thank you.

48:06.833 --> 48:11.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Much of the
president's agenda is aimed at
kicking the economy into higher

48:17.800 --> 48:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
gear and creating more jobs.

48:20.566 --> 48:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just four months into office,
the president has made numerous
claims about the jobs he's

48:25.000 --> 48:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
created and the jobs he's saved.

48:27.900 --> 48:32.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's in Wisconsin tonight,
and is spending a good part
of his week promoting some of

48:32.166 --> 48:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his
job-creating initiatives.

48:34.400 --> 48:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But what's the real record on
some of the president's claims?

48:37.733 --> 48:40.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
William Brangham takes a
look behind the numbers.

48:40.033 --> 48:45.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Today,
the president repeated
a claim he's been making
for months: His policies

48:46.433 --> 48:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are creating new jobs that
far surpass his predecessors.

48:48.533 --> 48:53.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: I think probably
seldom has any president

48:53.166 --> 48:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and administration done more or
had more success so early on,
including a record number of

48:57.633 --> 49:02.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
resolutions to eliminate
job-killing regulations.

49:02.366 --> 49:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we see it all over the
country, where jobs are starting
that would never have started,

49:06.666 --> 49:08.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ever, under any circumstance.

49:08.700 --> 49:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Earlier this
month, the president claimed
he helped claim more than

49:12.133 --> 49:13.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
one million new jobs.

49:13.633 --> 49:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: More than a
million private sector jobs.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But that
number was based on an estimate
from a payroll company.

49:20.933 --> 49:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The U.S. Labor Department
reported far fewer jobs.

49:24.266 --> 49:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This weekend, the president
correctly tweeted out a
lower number, 600,000.

49:27.400 --> 49:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVEN RATTNER, Former Adviser
to President Obama: In my 40
years of being in and around

49:31.233 --> 49:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Washington and economic policy,
I have never seen a president
try to take credit for as

49:37.866 --> 49:39.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
many things as he has
tried to take credit
for on the job front.

49:39.866 --> 49:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Steve Rattner
is an analyst and Wall Street
financier who also headed

49:43.533 --> 49:46.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
President Obama's Auto
Industry Task Force.

49:46.533 --> 49:50.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
According to the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, in the four
months before President Trump's

49:50.466 --> 49:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
election, the U.S. economy
added about 840,000 jobs.

49:55.100 --> 49:59.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In the four months since
his inauguration, it's
added about 600,000.

49:59.133 --> 50:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEVEN RATTNER: The U.S. economy
is like a huge battleship.

50:01.900 --> 50:03.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It doesn't turn fast.

50:03.966 --> 50:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think to judge any
president by a few months of
results, whether they're good

50:09.666 --> 50:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or bad, is way premature.

50:11.733 --> 50:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Veronique de
Rugy, a libertarian economist
at George Mason University, says

50:18.100 --> 50:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
giving credit to a president
for job numbers, good
or bad, is misleading.

50:20.466 --> 50:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VERONIQUE DE RUGY, George
Mason University: It's wrong
to be thinking about the power

50:23.233 --> 50:26.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the president
in terms of jobs.

50:26.000 --> 50:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is important to think is
how -- what kind of policies
can be put in place to grow

50:30.966 --> 50:35.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the economy, and that,
in theory, creates jobs.

50:38.366 --> 50:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Since
he was elected, the
president claims he's
persuaded numerous companies

50:43.933 --> 50:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to keep and grow jobs here
in the U.S., but analysts who
have looked at these numbers

50:48.366 --> 50:50.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say they're not nearly as
clear-cut as the president says.

50:50.666 --> 50:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Take the president's claim back
in December that the heating
and cooling companies United

50:55.066 --> 50:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Technologies and Carrier would
be keeping jobs in the U.S.
and not sending them to Mexico.

50:59.900 --> 51:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I will tell you
that United Technologies and
Carrier stepped it up, and

51:07.033 --> 51:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now they're keeping -- actually,
the number is over 1,100
people, which is so great, which

51:11.733 --> 51:13.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is so good.

51:13.733 --> 51:17.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: CEO Greg
Hayes told CNBC that a personal
phone call from the president

51:17.666 --> 51:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and his business-friendly
platform were important factors.

51:20.733 --> 51:23.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREGORY HAYES, CEO, United
Technologies: And he simply
said, "Look, Greg, I need you to

51:23.600 --> 51:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
re-look at the decision
to close the Indianapolis
factory of Carrier."

51:27.133 --> 51:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said, "We're going to do a
lot of things in this country
that is going to make it a

51:29.700 --> 51:31.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lot more conducive
to manufacturing."

51:31.766 --> 51:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It turned
out, though, only 800 jobs were
staying in the U.S., while 1,300

51:37.700 --> 51:39.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
were in fact
leaving the country.

51:39.766 --> 51:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And those jobs that were staying
came after the company received
$7 million in tax incentives

51:45.300 --> 51:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from the state of Indiana.

51:47.400 --> 51:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Another example, just a few
weeks before the inauguration,
Ford Motor Company announced

51:51.500 --> 51:55.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
they had scrapped plans
for a new billion-dollar
plant in Mexico.

51:55.733 --> 52:00.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The president hailed
the decision, but Ford's
then CEO, Mark Fields,
later said not moving

52:01.966 --> 52:04.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to Mexico was mostly
a business decision.

52:04.066 --> 52:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK FIELDS, Former CEO, Ford
Motor Company: Well, the main
reason for not building the

52:05.966 --> 52:09.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
plant and canceling the
plant in Mexico is just
due to market demand.

52:09.633 --> 52:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For critics
of the president, like Steven
Rattner, these claims are P.R.

52:13.933 --> 52:16.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stunts to give the
appearance of action.

52:16.266 --> 52:20.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVEN RATTNER: My colleague
and I recently put together
a list for The New York Times

52:20.000 --> 52:21.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of every place he
had taken credit.

52:21.833 --> 52:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, in fact, he doesn't
deserve credit for any of them.

52:25.033 --> 52:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only jobs that he
can legitimately take
credit for saving were
those 800 jobs at Carrier

52:31.233 --> 52:33.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Corporation early in
the administration.

52:33.766 --> 52:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In one case,
the Trump administration's
claim about job creation
has blurred job categories.

52:39.633 --> 52:41.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT PRUITT, Environmental
Protection Agency Administrator:
Since the last -- fourth quarter

52:41.566 --> 52:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of last year until most
recently, added almost 50,000
jobs in the coal sector.

52:43.933 --> 52:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Last weekend,
EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt
made this striking claim, that

52:48.833 --> 52:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
50,000 new coal jobs have been
created, which would mean the
entire U.S. coal industry had

52:54.933 --> 52:56.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
doubled in just a few

52:56.266 --> 52:58.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Months.

52:58.366 --> 53:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fact-checkers quickly pointed
out that the vast majority
of those new jobs were not in

53:01.233 --> 53:03.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
coal, but in mining.

53:03.200 --> 53:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In other interviews, Pruitt
included both categories
in the 50,000 number.

53:06.300 --> 53:11.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT PRUITT: You know, since
last -- the fourth quarter
of 2016, Chris, we have had

53:11.166 --> 53:16.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
almost 50,000 jobs created in
the mining and - - and -- and
coal sector alone, in fact,

53:17.333 --> 53:19.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the month of May,
almost 7,000 jobs.

53:19.333 --> 53:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Despite these
claims, many economists say
that, until the president's

53:22.700 --> 53:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
major economic policies on
taxes, regulation and trade
are in place, they can't make a

53:28.933 --> 53:30.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
proper verdict on
his job creation.

53:30.966 --> 53:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VERONIQUE DE RUGY: If you look
at the stock market, there
is just a lot of excitement

53:34.166 --> 53:36.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out there.

53:36.200 --> 53:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The question is whether they're
going to be able to translate
these into realities, which

53:42.066 --> 53:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then turns into real economic
growth that is based on
something else but hope.

53:47.300 --> 53:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The White
House is planning on hosting
another set of CEOs later this

53:50.033 --> 53:51.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
week.

53:51.266 --> 53:52.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm William Brangham.

53:52.900 --> 53:56.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we're
going to continue to
follow the jobs story.

53:56.933 --> 54:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online right
now: In a social experiment, one
well-known poet writes short,

54:03.833 --> 54:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
meaningless poems, and
tests the public reaction
by using Instagram.

54:07.033 --> 54:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Just how popular are they?

54:09.033 --> 54:13.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our
Web site at PBS.org/NewsHour.

54:13.100 --> 54:15.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

54:15.566 --> 54:19.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Wednesday: an exclusive
conversation with the
newly named United
States poet laureate.

54:20.533 --> 54:22.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again
right here tomorrow evening.

54:24.066 --> 54:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank you,
and we will see you soon.
