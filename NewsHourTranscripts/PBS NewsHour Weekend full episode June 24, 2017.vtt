THIS WAS A FEW YEARS AGO, IT

05:17.817 --> 05:18.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THROUGHOUT A LOT OF THIS, IT WAS

05:46.346 --> 05:47.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOUND THAT SOME VETERANS

05:47.447 --> 05:48.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY DIED WHILE THEY WERE

05:48.548 --> 05:50.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAITING FOR CARE.

05:50.717 --> 05:52.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE V.A. SECRETARY, AS YOU

WHISTLE BLOWERS?

06:07.433 --> 06:08.868 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

06:08.868 --> 06:10.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE EVEN HEAR ABOUT THESE THINGS,

06:10.336 --> 06:11.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TO SEE SOMETHING CHANGE.

06:20.012 --> 06:21.614 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

HAVE THIS SORT OF PROTECTION,

06:47.440 --> 06:48.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

OF LEGISLATION?

06:49.642 --> 06:50.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

CONCERNS A LOT OF THE UNIONS IS

07:29.515 --> 07:31.417 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ONLY THING THAT THEY REQUIRE FOR
