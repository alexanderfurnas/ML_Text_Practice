00:52.352 --> 00:53.553
ISRAEL AND HAMAS APPEAR TO HAVE

00:53.553 --> 00:54.655
AT LEAST TEMPORARILY BROKEN

00:54.655 --> 00:55.689
DOWN.

00:55.689 --> 00:57.190
THERE WAS MORE ISRAELI SHELLING

00:57.190 --> 00:58.892
OF GAZA AND NEW HAMAS ROCKET

00:58.892 --> 01:00.761
FIRE INTO ISRAEL TODAY.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.462
YESTERDAY, HAMAS REJECTED AN

01:02.462 --> 01:04.164
ISRAELI OFFER TO EXTEND A 12-

01:04.164 --> 01:05.999

01:22.582 --> 01:24.918
OF THE UNITED NATIONS AND TAKING

01:24.918 --> 01:26.486
INTO CONSIDERATION THE CONDITION

01:26.486 --> 01:28.488
OF OUR PEOPLE IN GAZA,

01:28.488 --> 01:30.023
ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE

01:30.023 --> 01:31.325
COMING EID HOLIDAY, THERE WERE

01:31.325 --> 01:33.193
DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE FACTIONS

01:33.193 --> 01:34.695
AND THEY HAVE REACHED AN

01:34.695 --> 01:36.563
AGREEMENT TO ACCEPT THE OFFER OF

01:36.563 --> 01:38.365
A 24-HOUR HUMANITARIAN CALM.

01:38.365 --> 01:39.566
>> Sreenivasan: BUT ISRAEL TODAY

01:39.566 --> 01:40.567
RENEWED ITS ATTACKS ON HAMAS

01:40.567 --> 01:42.336
TARGETS IN GAZA.

01:42.336 --> 01:43.370
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN

NETANYAHU APPEARED ON CNN'S

01:44.571 --> 01:45.405
STATE OF THE UNION WITH CANDY

01:45.405 --> 01:46.673
CROWLEY.

01:46.673 --> 01:47.341
>> YOU SAY ISRAEL RESUMED ITS

01:47.341 --> 01:48.508
OFFENSIVE.

01:48.508 --> 01:50.677
NO, ISRAEL DIDN'T RESUME OUR

01:50.677 --> 01:51.845
OFFENSIVE, WE HAD A CEASEFIRE,

01:51.845 --> 01:54.247
THEY VIOLATED IT, AND NOW

01:54.247 --> 01:55.682
THEY'RE VIOLATING THEIR OWN

01:55.682 --> 01:57.284
CEASEFIRE AND OBVIOUSLY WE'LL

01:57.284 --> 01:58.819
TAKE WHATEVER ACTION IS

01:58.819 --> 02:00.587
NECESSARY TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE,

02:00.587 --> 02:01.888
INCLUDING AGAINST THE TERRORIST

02:01.888 --> 02:03.290
TUNNELS THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO

02:03.290 --> 02:05.092
DIG AGAINST US.

02:05.092 --> 02:07.060
HAMAS IS SIMPLY CONTINUING ALL

02:07.060 --> 02:09.363
ITS OPERATIONS AND ISRAEL WILL

02:09.363 --> 02:10.764
NOT LET THIS TERROR OPERATION

02:10.764 --> 02:12.532
DECIDE WHEN IT'S CONVENIENT FOR

02:12.532 --> 02:13.834
THEM AND NOT CONVENIENT FOR THEM

02:13.834 --> 02:15.168
TO ATTACK OUR PEOPLE, WHEN IT'S

02:15.168 --> 02:16.269
CONVENIENT FOR THEM TO RESTOCK

02:16.269 --> 02:17.404
AND RELOAD, AND WHEN IT'S NOT

02:17.404 --> 02:23.543
CONVENIENT FOR THEM.

02:23.543 --> 02:24.378
FOR MORE WE ARE JOINED BY

02:24.378 --> 02:26.380
SKYPE BY RUTH EGLASH OF THE

02:26.380 --> 02:27.080
WASHINGTON POST.

02:27.080 --> 02:27.981
SO WHAT'S THE LATEST?

02:27.981 --> 02:29.783
>> IT'S BEEN A VERY UP AND

02:29.783 --> 02:31.551
DOWN DAY.

02:31.551 --> 02:33.020
I MEAN THIS MORNING THERE

02:33.020 --> 02:34.955
WAS A CEASEFIRE AND IT WAS

02:34.955 --> 02:36.990
HOLDING FOR A LITTLE BIT,

02:36.990 --> 02:38.358
EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS STILL

02:38.358 --> 02:39.726
ROCKET FIRE COMING IT FROM

02:39.726 --> 02:40.927
GAZA INTO ISRAEL.

02:40.927 --> 02:42.195
THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT HAD

02:42.195 --> 02:44.231
ORDERED THE MILITARY NOT TO

02:44.231 --> 02:46.933
RESPOND UP UNTIL MIDMORNING.

02:46.933 --> 02:48.969
AND AT THAT POINT THE

02:48.969 --> 02:50.670
ROCKETS JUST KEPT ONCOMING.

02:50.670 --> 02:54.074
AND THE GOVERNMENT DECIDED

02:54.074 --> 02:55.776
TO INSTRUCT THE MILITARY TO

02:55.776 --> 02:57.644
CONTINUE ON POUNDING GAZA

02:57.644 --> 02:59.579
WITH ITS AIR STRIKES AND

02:59.579 --> 03:01.615
FROM THE SEA, AND ALSO TO

03:01.615 --> 03:03.650
CONTINUE SEARCHING AND

03:03.650 --> 03:05.685
DESTROYING TUNNELS THAT HAVE

03:05.685 --> 03:07.054
BEEN DISCOVERED UNDER THE

03:07.054 --> 03:09.423
GROUND BETWEEN ISRAEL AND GAZA.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.024
AT AROUND 2:00 TODAY THERE

03:11.024 --> 03:13.593
WAS SOME WORDS THAT HAMAS

03:13.593 --> 03:16.963
WAS SEEKING A CEASEFIRE,

03:16.963 --> 03:19.099
AND THAT PROPOSAL BY HAMAS

03:19.099 --> 03:21.334
WAS REJECTED BY ISRAEL.

03:21.334 --> 03:23.003
AND THEN OVERALL THE

03:23.003 --> 03:24.604
CEASEFIRE ATTEMPTS BY THE

03:24.604 --> 03:26.139
U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN

03:26.139 --> 03:27.507
KERRY HAS BEEN AS FAR AS I

03:27.507 --> 03:29.609
KNOW REJECTED, FLATLY

03:29.609 --> 03:31.178
REJECTED BY THE ISRAELI

03:31.178 --> 03:32.612
GOVERNMENT.

03:32.612 --> 03:33.346
>> WE'VE ALSO HEARD THAT

03:33.346 --> 03:35.315
THERE HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTS AT

03:35.315 --> 03:36.416
INFILTRATION ALONG THE

03:36.416 --> 03:37.417
BORDER WITH GAZA.

03:37.417 --> 03:39.286
>> THAT'S BEEN AN ONGOING

03:39.286 --> 03:40.654
FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS.

03:40.654 --> 03:43.223
THERE HAVE BEEN PRETTY MUCH

03:43.223 --> 03:45.926
EVERY FEW DAYS INFILTRATION

03:45.926 --> 03:48.028
ATTEMPTS, SOLDIERS

03:48.028 --> 03:49.996
DISCOVERING TUNNELS INSIDE

03:49.996 --> 03:52.466
THE GAZA STRIP AND MILITANTS

03:52.466 --> 03:54.234
MANAGING TO GO THROUGH THOSE

03:54.234 --> 03:55.635
TUNNELS AND COME OUT INTO

03:55.635 --> 03:56.203
ISRAEL.

03:56.203 --> 03:57.704
THAT'S BEEN PRETTY MUCH

03:57.704 --> 03:59.339
CONSTANT FOR THE LAST THREE

03:59.339 --> 04:00.073
WEEKS.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.541
>> WE'VE ALSO HEARD THAT

04:01.541 --> 04:03.076
THERE WAS AN ATTEMPTED

04:03.076 --> 04:04.277
INFILTRATION INTO ISRAEL

04:04.277 --> 04:06.213
FROM THE WEST BANK TODAY.

04:06.213 --> 04:07.881
>> YES, I RECEIVED AROUND

04:07.881 --> 04:09.649
MIDDAY AN UPDATE FROM THE

04:09.649 --> 04:11.818
ARMY THAT SAID A CO-OP

04:11.818 --> 04:13.520
CARRYING EXPLOSIVES HAD BEEN

04:13.520 --> 04:14.788
STOPPED AT A CHECK POINT

04:14.788 --> 04:15.789
NEAR JERUSALEM.

04:15.789 --> 04:18.191
THE SUSPECT WAS APPREHENDED

04:18.191 --> 04:20.060
AND THE CAR WAS TAKEN IN FOR

04:20.060 --> 04:20.961
FURTHER INVESTIGATION.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.929
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY MORE

04:22.929 --> 04:24.698
DETAILS ON THAT AT THIS TIME

04:24.698 --> 04:26.299
BUT THERE HAS BEEN QUITE A

04:26.299 --> 04:28.101
NUMBER OF-- QUITE A LARGE

04:28.101 --> 04:29.469
AMOUNT OF PROTESTS IN THE

04:29.469 --> 04:31.171
WEST BANK OVER THE LAST FEW

04:31.171 --> 04:32.272
DAYS.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.908
AND AT LEAST NINE PALESTINIANS

04:34.908 --> 04:37.944
KILLED DURING CLASHES WITH THE

04:37.944 --> 04:39.212
ISRAELI SECURITY FORCES IN THE

04:39.212 --> 04:41.081
WEST BANK.

04:41.081 --> 04:42.115
>> YOU KNOW, WE'VE SEEN A

04:42.115 --> 04:44.151
COUPLE OF CLIPS AND IMAGES

04:44.151 --> 04:45.852
AND VIDEOS OF PEACE RALLIES

04:45.852 --> 04:47.554
IN CITIES LIKE TEL AVIV.

04:47.554 --> 04:49.856
IS THIS GAINING ANY ATTRACTION,

04:49.856 --> 04:51.024
THE SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGNS AS

04:51.024 --> 04:51.992
WELL?

04:51.992 --> 04:53.126
>> YEAH, YOU KNOW, THESE

04:53.126 --> 04:54.227
HAVE BEEN HAPPENING SINCE

04:54.227 --> 04:55.929
THE BEGINNING.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.297
THERE WAS ALWAYS A SMALL

04:57.297 --> 04:59.499
NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN ISRAEL

04:59.499 --> 05:00.600
WHO WERE SPEAKING OUT

05:00.600 --> 05:01.902
AGAINST THE WAR SAYING THAT

05:01.902 --> 05:03.703
IT WASN'T GOING TO ACHIEVE

05:03.703 --> 05:04.437
ANYTHING.

05:04.437 --> 05:06.706
LAST NIGHT POSSIBLY WAS THE

05:06.706 --> 05:08.775
BIGGEST RALLY IN TEL AVIV,

05:08.775 --> 05:10.810
ROUGHLY 3,000 PEOPLE ATTENDED.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.512
AND THAT RALLY WAS CUT SHORT

05:12.512 --> 05:14.881
WHEN HAMAS FIRED ROCKETS

05:14.881 --> 05:16.583
TOWARDS TEL AVIV AND THE

05:16.583 --> 05:18.618
SIRENS WENT OFF IN TEL AVIV,

05:18.618 --> 05:19.853
FORCING PEOPLE TO GO INTO

05:19.853 --> 05:21.488
BOMB SHELTERS.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.523
BUT THERE IS A CONSISTENT

05:23.523 --> 05:25.759
VOICE HERE, BUT IT'S VERY,

05:25.759 --> 05:26.426
VERY SMALL.

05:26.426 --> 05:27.327
>> RUTH EGLASH OF THE

05:27.327 --> 05:29.162
"WASHINGTON POST" JOINING US

05:29.162 --> 05:30.564
VIA SKYPE FROM JERUSALEM

05:30.564 --> 05:32.265
THIS EVENING, THANKS SO MUCH.

05:32.265 --> 05:33.300
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

05:33.300 --> 05:34.367
>> FOR MORE ABOUT THE

05:34.367 --> 05:35.335
SITUATION ON THE GROUND IN

05:35.335 --> 05:36.369
GAZA WE ARE JOINED ONCE

05:36.369 --> 05:38.104
AGAIN TONIGHT VIA SKYPE BY

05:38.104 --> 05:39.005
NICHOLAS CASEY OF "THE WALL

05:39.005 --> 05:39.973
STREET JOURNAL."

05:39.973 --> 05:41.441
SO WE'VE HEARD BASICALLY THAT

05:41.441 --> 05:43.043
ALL SIGNS OF THE TRUCE ARE OFF.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.111
THAT THERE IS CONTINUED ROCKET

05:45.111 --> 05:47.514
BEING HURLED AT ISRAEL FROM

05:47.514 --> 05:48.815
HAMAS, AND THAT THE SHELLING

05:48.815 --> 05:52.052
CONTINUES FROM ISRAEL ON GAZA.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.086
>> BASICALLY THAT'S WHAT IS

05:53.086 --> 05:54.487
HAPPENING, UNFORTUNATELY.

05:54.487 --> 05:56.489
I SAW JUST RIGHT OUTSIDE MY

05:56.489 --> 05:57.924
HOTEL WINDOW THREE ROCKETS

05:57.924 --> 05:59.960
FROM HAMAS OR ONE OF THE

05:59.960 --> 06:01.962
AFFILIATED GROUPS GOING OUT

06:01.962 --> 06:02.996
TOWARDS ISRAEL.

06:02.996 --> 06:05.999
AND MOST OF THEM WARNING, WE

06:05.999 --> 06:07.400
WERE GETTING BOMBARDED

06:07.400 --> 06:08.802
HEAVILY RIGHT AROUND THE HOTEL.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.537
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE

06:10.537 --> 06:11.504
ISRAELIS WERE TRYING TO

06:11.504 --> 06:13.440
HIT BUT THEY WERE TRYING TO HIT

06:13.440 --> 06:14.307
IT MULTIPLE TIMES.

06:14.307 --> 06:16.009
THE SOUNDS OF THE BOOMS WERE

06:16.009 --> 06:17.410
SO LOUD THAT IT WAS SHAKING

06:17.410 --> 06:19.412
THE WINDOWS, SCARING

06:19.412 --> 06:20.580
EVERYBODY OUT OF THE ROOMS.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.115
AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE

06:22.115 --> 06:23.183
SITUATION WAS LIKE JUST A

06:23.183 --> 06:25.919
COUPLE OF BLOCKS AWAY WHERE

06:25.919 --> 06:26.953
THESE TARGETS WERE GETTING

06:26.953 --> 06:27.621
HIT.

06:27.621 --> 06:28.455
>> THERE SEEM TO BE

06:28.455 --> 06:29.656
DIFFERENT MOTIVATIONS FOR

06:29.656 --> 06:31.024
BOTH SIDES ON WHETHER TO

06:31.024 --> 06:32.525
AGREE TO A CEASEFIRE OR NOT.

06:32.525 --> 06:33.226
>> THERE ARE.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.495
I THINK AGREEING TO THESE

06:35.495 --> 06:37.197
TEMPORARY CEASEFIRES IS

06:37.197 --> 06:38.331
MOST WITHIN ISRAEL'S

06:38.331 --> 06:40.166
INTEREST BECAUSE WHEN THE

06:40.166 --> 06:42.235
FIRING STOPPED, ISRAEL

06:42.235 --> 06:43.303
GENERALLY CONTINUES TO GO

06:43.303 --> 06:45.005
AFTER THE HAMAS TUNNELS AND

06:45.005 --> 06:46.640
HAVE ITS TROOPS STILL

06:46.640 --> 06:48.408
STATIONED WITHIN THE GAZA

06:48.408 --> 06:49.809
STRIP WITH A PROMISE FROM

06:49.809 --> 06:51.444
HAMAS THAT HAMAS WON'T

06:51.444 --> 06:52.145
ATTACK IT.

06:52.145 --> 06:54.514
AS FOR HAMAS, ITS

06:54.514 --> 06:56.483
INFRASTRUCTURE, ITS WEAPONS

06:56.483 --> 06:57.917
FACILITIES AND ITS TUNNELS

06:57.917 --> 06:59.686
CONTINUE TO BE DESTROYED BY

06:59.686 --> 07:01.554
ISRAEL AS THE PEOPLE OF GAZA

07:01.554 --> 07:04.057
GET A SMALL BRIEF BREAK TO

07:04.057 --> 07:05.125
GET SOME WATER.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.459
WHEREAS THE TROOPS FROM

07:06.459 --> 07:07.861
ISRAEL REMAIN IN THE GAZA

07:07.861 --> 07:09.562
STRIP AND IS UNABLE TO

07:09.562 --> 07:10.630
ATTACK THEM BY ITS OWN

07:10.630 --> 07:11.264
AGREEMENT.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.332
>> WE ALSO RECEIVED

07:12.332 --> 07:13.300
INFORMATION TODAY ABOUT A

07:13.300 --> 07:15.135
RED CROSS BUILDING THAT WAS

07:15.135 --> 07:15.835
DAMAGED.

07:15.835 --> 07:16.970
WHAT HAPPENED THERE?

07:16.970 --> 07:18.471
>> THERE WAS A RED CROSS

07:18.471 --> 07:19.539
BUILDING SOUTH OF HERE THAT

07:19.539 --> 07:20.240
WAS TORCHED.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.274
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHY PEOPLE

07:21.274 --> 07:22.342
CAME AFTER THE RED CROSS

07:22.342 --> 07:22.942
BUILDING.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.011
BUT THE FACT IS, WHAT'S

07:25.011 --> 07:27.013
GOING ON IN GAZA NOW IS THAT

07:27.013 --> 07:28.315
THERE'S A FOREIGN ARMY WHO'S

07:28.315 --> 07:29.416
ATTACKING IT.

07:29.416 --> 07:31.851
THERE ARE A LOT OF FOREIGNERS

07:31.851 --> 07:33.853
HERE WHO ARE TRYING TO

07:33.853 --> 07:35.955
PHOTOGRAPH, DOCUMENT AND

07:35.955 --> 07:38.224
ALSO HELP GAZANS.

07:38.224 --> 07:39.592
AND THERE'S A TREMENDOUS

07:39.592 --> 07:41.695
FEELING OF FRUSTRATION AND

07:41.695 --> 07:42.996
ENTRAPMENT HERE.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.030
THE OTHER THING THAT HAD

07:44.030 --> 07:45.865
GONE ON WAS THAT THERE WAS A

07:45.865 --> 07:47.500
BIT OF ANGER TOWARDS THE RED

07:47.500 --> 07:49.202
CROSS BASED ON SOME RUMORS

07:49.202 --> 07:50.603
THAT HAD GONE AROUND BEFORE

07:50.603 --> 07:52.572
THE EVACUATION OR THE

07:52.572 --> 07:54.507
ATTEMPTED EVACUATION OF A

07:54.507 --> 07:56.076
U.N. SHELTER IN THE NORTH OF

07:56.076 --> 07:56.576
HERE.

07:56.576 --> 07:58.178
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS HAD

07:58.178 --> 07:59.212
ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.

07:59.212 --> 08:00.213
BUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS

08:00.213 --> 08:02.148
THAT THERE WAS A RUMOR GOING

08:02.148 --> 08:03.616
AROUND THAT THERE WERE RED

08:03.616 --> 08:04.884
CROSS VEHICLES THAT WERE

08:04.884 --> 08:06.019
GOING TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF

08:06.019 --> 08:06.753
THE SHELTER.

08:06.753 --> 08:07.754
THEN AS PEOPLE WERE

08:07.754 --> 08:09.522
GATHERING, THERE WAS AN

08:09.522 --> 08:10.890
ATTACK ON THE SHELTER THAT

08:10.890 --> 08:12.592
KILLED 16 PEOPLE.

08:12.592 --> 08:14.327
ONE OF THE DAYS THAT I WAS

08:14.327 --> 08:15.328
IN THE HOSPITAL WHERE THESE

08:15.328 --> 08:16.429
PEOPLE WERE BEING TREATED,

08:16.429 --> 08:17.731
THERE WERE PEOPLE YELLING AT

08:17.731 --> 08:18.798
THE RED CROSS SAYING WHY

08:18.798 --> 08:20.500
DIDN'T YOU COME TO RESCUE US.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.901
AND THE DRIVER FROM THE RED

08:21.901 --> 08:23.236
CROSS WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN

08:23.236 --> 08:24.904
THAT HE HIMSELF COULDN'T GET

08:24.904 --> 08:26.439
INTO THE AREA BECAUSE IT WAS

08:26.439 --> 08:27.640
TOO DANGEROUS THAT DAY.

08:27.640 --> 08:28.908
>> ALL RIGHT, NICHOLAS CASEY

08:28.908 --> 08:30.076
OF "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"

08:30.076 --> 08:31.444
JOINING US VIA SKYPE FROM

08:31.444 --> 08:33.546
GAZA, THANKS SO MUCH.

08:33.546 --> 08:40.019
>> THANKS.

08:40.019 --> 08:41.621
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW TO

08:41.621 --> 08:42.322
ANOTHER MAJOR CONFLICT ZONE:

08:42.322 --> 08:42.922
UKRAINE.

08:42.922 --> 08:44.424
TODAY, DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY

08:44.424 --> 08:45.558
ADVISOR BEN RHODES SAID THE

08:45.558 --> 08:46.960
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS

08:46.960 --> 08:47.927
EXPLORING NEW WAYS TO HELP THE

08:47.927 --> 08:48.762
UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT SUPPRESS

08:48.762 --> 08:50.196
PRO-RUSSIAN SEPARATISTS.

08:50.196 --> 08:51.331
>> WE'VE INITIATED A DISCUSSION

08:51.331 --> 08:53.166
WITH THEM, WHAT A LONG TERM

08:53.166 --> 08:54.267
TRAINING AND EQUIPPING

08:54.267 --> 08:54.801
RELATIONSHIP WOULD BE WITH

08:54.801 --> 08:55.402
UKRAINE SO THAT THEY HAVE MORE

08:55.402 --> 08:56.069
MODERNIZED AND PROFESSIONALIZED

08:56.069 --> 08:56.770
SECURITY FORCES SO THAT THEY CAN

08:56.770 --> 08:57.504
PROVIDE FOR SECURITY IN THE

08:57.504 --> 08:59.105
COUNTRY.

08:59.105 --> 09:00.306
AND WE'RE ALSO VERY FOCUSED ON

09:00.306 --> 09:01.007
WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP THEM

09:01.007 --> 09:01.541
SECURE THAT BORDER.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.375
WE HAVEN'T MADE THE DECISION TO

09:02.375 --> 09:03.276
PROVIDE CERTAIN TYPES OF

09:03.276 --> 09:04.310
WEAPONS, BUT INTELLIGENCE, WE DO

09:04.310 --> 09:04.978
PROVIDE INTELLIGENCE AND WE'VE

09:04.978 --> 09:06.012
REVIEWED THAT.

09:06.012 --> 09:07.180
WE STILL THINK THE BEST THING

09:07.180 --> 09:08.381
THAT THE UNITED STATES CAN DO IS

09:08.381 --> 09:09.716
SEND A MESSAGE TO RUSSIA THROUGH

09:09.716 --> 09:11.151
VERY STRONG SANCTIONS,

09:11.151 --> 09:12.952
COORDINATED WITH THE EUROPEANS.

09:12.952 --> 09:14.287
>> Sreenivasan: THIS AS FIGHTING

09:14.287 --> 09:15.488
BETWEEN UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT

09:15.488 --> 09:16.790
FORCES AND PRO-RUSSIAN

09:16.790 --> 09:19.426
SEPARATISTS HAS INTENSIFIED IN

09:19.426 --> 09:20.693
RECENT DAYS-- THAT'S DELAYED

09:20.693 --> 09:21.861
INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATORS

09:21.861 --> 09:23.496
TRYING TO REACH THE SITE OF THE

09:23.496 --> 09:24.564
MALAYSIAN JETLINER THAT WENT

09:24.564 --> 09:26.099
DOWN IN EASTERN UKRAINE WITH 298

09:26.099 --> 09:27.133
PEOPLE ON BOARD.

09:27.133 --> 09:27.967
OUR REPORT BY ITN IS NARRATED BY

09:27.967 --> 09:30.336
JANE DODGE.

09:30.336 --> 09:31.871
>> THIS GRAINY AMATEUR FOOTAGE

09:31.871 --> 09:33.072
WAS REPORTEDLY FILMED IN THE

09:33.072 --> 09:36.409
REGION TODAY HEADING WESTWARD

09:36.409 --> 09:38.812
INCLUDING LORRY LOADS OF TROOPS

09:38.812 --> 09:40.313
BELIEVE TO BE PRO RUSSIANS,

09:40.313 --> 09:41.815
ROCKET LAUNCHERS AND HEAVY

09:41.815 --> 09:43.550
ARTILLERY.

09:43.550 --> 09:44.784
THE MILITARY HARDWARE A

09:44.784 --> 09:46.386
POSSIBLE RESPONSE TO THE

09:46.386 --> 09:48.188
UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT'S

09:48.188 --> 09:49.222
INTENSIFYING HOSTILITIES.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.890
IT HAS BEEN TRYING TO REGAIN

09:50.890 --> 09:52.792
CONTROL OF REBEL HELD TOWNS

09:52.792 --> 09:54.661
THIS WEEKEND AND SECURE THE

09:54.661 --> 09:57.864
CRASH SITE OF FLIGHT MH-17.

09:57.864 --> 09:59.566
THAT EXPLAINS WHY A TEAM OF

09:59.566 --> 10:01.034
INTERNATIONAL POLICE OFFICERS

10:01.034 --> 10:02.669
ONCE AGAIN DELAYED VISITING THE

10:02.669 --> 10:03.703
WRECKAGE.

10:03.703 --> 10:05.572
THE BODIES OF EIGHT PASSENGERS

10:05.572 --> 10:07.407
ARE STILL MISSING.

10:07.407 --> 10:08.608
>> WE WILL NOT RISK OUR UNARMED

10:08.608 --> 10:11.311
CIVILIAN OBSERVER MISSION TO

10:11.311 --> 10:12.512
DEPLOY TO A SITE WHERE WE CAN'T

10:12.512 --> 10:13.847
CONTROL THE RISKS.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.248
>> Reporter: FLIGHT MH-17

10:15.248 --> 10:17.283
CRASHED IN REBEL HELD TERRITORY

10:17.283 --> 10:23.122
78 KILOMETERS FROM DONETSK.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.058
TWO TOWNS TO THE NORTHWEST ARE

10:25.058 --> 10:28.328
TWO TOWNS THE UKRAINIANS ARE

10:28.328 --> 10:29.662
TRYING TO REGAIN OF CONTROL OF.

10:29.662 --> 10:31.464
THE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT WAS

10:31.464 --> 10:33.166
DRESSED FOR WAR YESTERDAY AS HE

10:33.166 --> 10:34.367
VISITED HIS TROOPS.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.469
THE THE BIG PRIZE TO SECURE

10:36.469 --> 10:38.438
IS REBEL CONTROLLED DONETSK,

10:38.438 --> 10:39.739
HOME TO MORE THAN A MILLION

10:39.739 --> 10:41.841
PEOPLE, NOW ALMOST COMPLETELY

10:41.841 --> 10:45.078
SURROUNDED BY GOVERNMENT TROOPS.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.880
>> AS WE WERE LEAVING DONETSK

10:46.880 --> 10:49.883
WE SAW A LARGE CONVOY OF

10:49.883 --> 10:51.584
MILITARY HARDWARE AND TROOPS OF

10:51.584 --> 10:55.188
THE UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT WHICH

10:55.188 --> 10:57.490
WAS HEADED TOWARDS DONETSK.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.059
I THINK THERE WERE AROUND 40,

11:00.059 --> 11:02.095
50 LARGE VEHICLES, MANY OF THEM

11:02.095 --> 11:03.663
CARRYING TANKS.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.232
SO I THINK WHAT IS HAPPENING IS

11:06.232 --> 11:08.368
THAT THE UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT

11:08.368 --> 11:12.272
IS USING THE MOMENTUM THAT WAS

11:12.272 --> 11:14.674
CREATED AFTER THE CRASH OF THE

11:14.674 --> 11:16.309
MALAYSIAN AIRLINES TO STEP

11:16.309 --> 11:18.144
UP THEIR CRACKDOWN ON THE

11:18.144 --> 11:21.247
SEPARATISTS' REBELLION.

11:24.817 --> 11:26.619
HE'S REPEATEDLY DENIED ARMING

11:26.619 --> 11:28.821
UKRAINE'S REBELS BUT THE U.S.

11:28.821 --> 11:30.390
STATE DEPARTMENT HAS RELEASED

11:30.390 --> 11:32.258
SATELLITE IMAGES WHICH THEY SAY

11:32.258 --> 11:34.427

AND IN OTHER STRATEGIC

11:56.583 --> 11:59.419

HAS BEEN TREATING THE DISEASE

12:16.703 --> 12:18.237
HAS DIED OF IT.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.772

- DEPEND ON FISH AS THEIR MAIN

14:21.894 --> 14:23.529
SOURCE OF PROTEIN.

14:23.529 --> 14:24.964
BUT SEVERAL SPECIES ARE NOW

14:24.964 --> 14:26.332
THREATENED BY OVERFISHING.

14:26.332 --> 14:28.501
RECENTLY, THE PRESIDENT OF THE

14:28.501 --> 14:30.670
TINY PACIFIC ISLAND NATION OF

14:30.670 --> 14:32.271
KIRIBATI ANNOUNCED A PLAN TO TRY

14:32.271 --> 14:33.639
TO HELP SAVE ONE OF THE WORLD'S

14:33.639 --> 14:35.408
MOST WIDELY CONSUMED TYPE OF

14:35.408 --> 14:37.276
FISH-- TUNA.

14:37.276 --> 14:38.377
NEWSHOUR CORRESPONDENT WILLIAM

14:38.377 --> 14:39.812
BRANGHAM REPORTS ABOUT THE PLAN

14:39.812 --> 14:40.847
AND LATER SAT DOWN WITH THE

14:40.847 --> 14:41.848
PRESIDENT OF KIRIBATI TO DISCUSS

14:41.848 --> 14:46.519
THE PROPOSAL.

14:46.519 --> 14:47.787
>> Reporter: THE U.S.

14:47.787 --> 14:48.921
STATE DEPARTMENT RECENTLY

14:48.921 --> 14:50.022
CONVENED ITS FIRST OCEANS

14:50.022 --> 14:51.424
CONFERENCE, BRINGING SCIENTISTS

14:51.424 --> 14:52.658
AND POLITICAL LEADERS FROM

14:52.658 --> 14:53.993
AROUND THE WORLD TO ADDRESS THE

14:53.993 --> 14:55.328
MANY THREATS TO THE WORLD'S

14:55.328 --> 14:56.629
OCEANS INCLUDING POLLUTION,

14:56.629 --> 14:58.664
CLIMATE CHANGE, AND OVERFISHING.

14:58.664 --> 14:59.999
>> THE PROTECTION OF OUR OCEANS

14:59.999 --> 15:01.601
IS A VITAL INTERNATIONAL

15:01.601 --> 15:03.603
SECURITY ISSUE.

15:03.603 --> 15:04.771
>> Reporter: SECRETARY OF STATE

15:04.771 --> 15:06.372
JOHN KERRY SAID THAT PROTECTING

15:06.372 --> 15:07.507
THE OCEANS WAS AN OBVIOUS

15:07.507 --> 15:08.941
CONCERN BOTH FOR THE U.S., AND

15:08.941 --> 15:10.476
FOR ALL NATIONS.

15:10.476 --> 15:12.845
>> PROTECTING OUR OCEAN IS ALSO

15:12.845 --> 15:14.213
A GREAT NECESSITY FOR GLOBAL

15:14.213 --> 15:16.816
FOOD SECURITY.

15:16.816 --> 15:18.317
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN A HEALTHY

15:18.317 --> 15:21.320
OCEAN AND LIFE ITSELF FOR EVERY

15:21.320 --> 15:22.955
SINGLE PERSON ON EARTH CANNOT BE

15:22.955 --> 15:25.324
OVERSTATED.

15:25.324 --> 15:26.492
>> Reporter: KERRY THEN

15:26.492 --> 15:27.960
INTRODUCED PRESIDENT ANOTE TONG,

15:27.960 --> 15:29.796
OF THE PACIFIC ISLAND NATION OF

15:29.796 --> 15:31.364
KIRIBATI, A MAN KERRY CALLED

15:31.364 --> 15:32.765
"ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST

15:32.765 --> 15:33.966
ADVOCATES FOR THE WORLD'S

15:33.966 --> 15:35.668
OCEANS"

15:35.668 --> 15:36.936
TONG'S COUNTRY IS NEARLY SEVEN

15:36.936 --> 15:38.204
THOUSAND MILES AWAY-- FAR OUT IN

15:38.204 --> 15:39.939
THE MIDDLE OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.774
YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF KIRIBATI

15:41.774 --> 15:45.611
BECAUSE IT'S APPROXIMATELY

15:45.611 --> 15:46.612
100,00 RESIDENTS ARE EXTREMELY

15:46.612 --> 15:48.080
VULNERABLE TO SEA-LEVEL RISE

15:48.080 --> 15:49.482
CAUSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE.

15:49.482 --> 15:50.883
IN FACT, KIRIBATI RECENTLY

15:50.883 --> 15:52.485
PURCHASED LAND IN FIJI AS A

15:52.485 --> 15:53.886
REFUGE FOR ITS PEOPLE IN

15:53.886 --> 15:56.355
ANTICIPATION OF WHEN RISING SEAS

15:56.355 --> 15:57.890
MAY MAKE IT TOO DANGEROUS TO

15:57.890 --> 16:00.026
CONTINUE LIVING HERE.

16:00.026 --> 16:01.460
BUT PRESIDENT TONG'S MOST RECENT

16:01.460 --> 16:03.162
CONCERN HAS BEEN OVERFISHING.

16:03.162 --> 16:05.364
HE'S WORKING WITH THE

16:05.364 --> 16:06.399
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CONSERVATION

16:06.399 --> 16:07.900
INTERNATIONAL TO PROTECT THE

16:07.900 --> 16:09.368
MARINE LIFE THAT LIVES ALONG THE

16:09.368 --> 16:10.570
RICH CORAL REEFS THAT RING HIS

16:10.570 --> 16:12.004
COUNTRY'S ISLANDS.

16:12.004 --> 16:13.806
THE AREA IS HOME TO A HUGE ARRAY

16:13.806 --> 16:14.874
OF SPECIES, MOST IMPORTANTLY

16:14.874 --> 16:17.410
TUNA.

16:17.410 --> 16:18.444
TONG WENT TO THAT STATE

16:18.444 --> 16:19.912
DEPARTMENT CONFERENCE TO

16:19.912 --> 16:22.014
ANNOUNCE THAT IN ORDER TO

16:22.014 --> 16:23.182
PROTECT THOSE TUNA, HE WAS

16:23.182 --> 16:24.984
BANNING COMMERCIAL FISHING IN

16:24.984 --> 16:26.485
WHAT'S CALLED "THE PHOENIX

16:26.485 --> 16:27.486
ISLANDS PROTECTED AREA."

16:27.486 --> 16:29.155
IT'S OVER 150,000 SQUARE MILES

16:29.155 --> 16:30.556
OF KIRIBATI'S TERRITORIAL

16:30.556 --> 16:32.291
WATERS-- AN AREA ROUGHLY THE

16:32.291 --> 16:33.192
SIZE OF CALIFORNIA.

16:33.192 --> 16:36.028
SOME CRITICS CLAIM KIRIBATI HAS

16:36.028 --> 16:37.496
PROMISED TO CLOSE THESE WATERS

16:37.496 --> 16:39.065
BEFORE BUT ONLY CLOSED A SMALL

16:39.065 --> 16:39.966
PORTION.

16:39.966 --> 16:42.001
BUT PRESIDENT TONG SAYS SOON

16:42.001 --> 16:43.436
THE ENTIRE AREA WILL BE

16:43.436 --> 16:44.570
PROTECTED.

16:44.570 --> 16:46.205
>> KIRIBATI HAS TAKEN THE

16:46.205 --> 16:48.174
DECISION TO FULLY CLOSE ALL

16:48.174 --> 16:50.309
COMMERCIAL FISHING ACTIVITIES

16:50.309 --> 16:52.078
WITHIN THE PHOENIX ISLANDS

16:52.078 --> 16:54.146
PROTECTED AREA WITH THE EFFECT

16:54.146 --> 16:58.818
FROM THE FIRST OF JANUARY 2015.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.052
>> Reporter: BECAUSE OF

17:00.052 --> 17:01.320
OVERFISHING, MANY OF THE WORLDS

17:01.320 --> 17:02.788
TUNA STOCKS ARE DEPLETED OR IN

17:02.788 --> 17:03.723
JEOPARDY.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.224
THE TUNA THAT COME FROM THE

17:05.224 --> 17:06.959
CENTRAL PACIFIC ARE NOW ONE OF

17:06.959 --> 17:08.694
THE LAST REMAINING RELATIVELY

17:08.694 --> 17:09.996
HEALTHY STOCKS OF THIS

17:09.996 --> 17:12.531
LUCRATIVE, CRUCIAL FISH.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.333
TUNA ARE KNOWN AS A PELAGIC

17:14.333 --> 17:15.268
SPECIES-- WHICH MEANS THEY

17:15.268 --> 17:16.769
MIGRATE HUGE DISTANCES ACROSS

17:16.769 --> 17:17.937
THE PACIFIC DURING THEIR

17:17.937 --> 17:19.338
LIFESPAN.

17:19.338 --> 17:20.606
SO WHILE KIRIBATI'S CLOSURE

17:20.606 --> 17:21.874
PROTECTS JUST ONE SMALL PART OF

17:21.874 --> 17:24.043
THE TUNA HABITAT, IT'S

17:24.043 --> 17:25.945
CONSIDERED AN IMPORTANT-- IF

17:25.945 --> 17:26.812
SYMBOLIC-- STEP IN PROTECTING

17:26.812 --> 17:29.682
THE ENTIRE FISHERY.

17:29.682 --> 17:30.950
I TALKED WITH PRESIDENT TONG THE

17:30.950 --> 17:31.817
DAY BEFORE HE ANNOUNCED THE

17:31.817 --> 17:32.785
CLOSURE.

17:32.785 --> 17:34.120
>> Reporter: PRESIDENT TONG, WHY

17:34.120 --> 17:35.588
DID YOU DECIDE THAT THIS WAS THE

17:35.588 --> 17:37.823
RIGHT TIME TO CLOSE THESE

17:37.823 --> 17:40.860
FISHING GROUNDS?

17:40.860 --> 17:41.661
>> FOR FAR TOO OFTEN IN THE

17:41.661 --> 17:42.428
PAST, WE STAND BY AND WATCH WHAT

17:42.428 --> 17:43.696
GOES ON.

17:43.696 --> 17:44.964
AND WE HAVE THEORIES, WE

17:44.964 --> 17:46.332
POSTULATE THEORIES AS TO HOW TO

17:46.332 --> 17:47.500
DEAL WITH IT, BUT I THINK WE

17:47.500 --> 17:49.869
WANT TO DO MORE THAN THAT.

17:49.869 --> 17:51.070
I THINK IT'S THE SAME CASE IN

17:51.070 --> 17:52.939
TERMS OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

17:52.939 --> 17:55.141
I THINK WE KNOW WHAT'S WRONG, WE

17:55.141 --> 17:56.742
BELIEVE WE KNOW WHAT SHOULD BE

17:56.742 --> 17:57.576
DONE, BUT WE CONTINUE NOT TO DO

17:57.576 --> 17:58.778
IT.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.146
WE CONTINUE TO WAIT FOR THE NEXT

18:00.146 --> 18:02.148
COUNTRY TO DO IT.

18:02.148 --> 18:03.616
AND DEFINITELY THE CASE IS THAT

18:03.616 --> 18:06.852
MANY AMERICANS EAT TUNA, EITHER

18:06.852 --> 18:09.689
SASHIMI OR CANNED, BUT WHAT WE

18:09.689 --> 18:10.923
SEE ON THE TABLE, WHAT WE SEE

18:10.923 --> 18:13.726
AROUND OUR DAILY LIVES, WE DON'T

18:13.726 --> 18:14.894
ALWAYS ASSOCIATE IT WITH

18:14.894 --> 18:16.529
SOMETHING ELSE BEYOND.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.164
BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THIS HAS

18:18.164 --> 18:19.598
TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.100
AND AT THE MOMENT THE MOST

18:21.100 --> 18:22.902
VIABLE TUNA FISHING GROUNDS THAT

18:22.902 --> 18:24.403
REMAIN VIABLE ARE THOSE IN THE

18:24.403 --> 18:25.705
WESTERN AND CENTRAL PACIFIC, IN

18:25.705 --> 18:27.740
OUR WATERS.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.108
AND SO LEADERSHIP HAS GOT TO BE

18:29.108 --> 18:30.609
TAKEN.

18:30.609 --> 18:35.348
>> Reporter: HOW WILL THIS BE

18:35.348 --> 18:36.549
ENFORCED THOUGH?

18:36.549 --> 18:37.750
AS YOU KNOW, THERE ARE MANY

18:37.750 --> 18:38.651
PROTECTED MARINE FISHERIES

18:38.651 --> 18:39.685
AROUND THE WORLD WHERE ILLEGAL

18:39.685 --> 18:40.720
FISHING IS STILL RAMPANT.

18:40.720 --> 18:41.887
SO HOW WILL KIRIBATI, WITH

18:41.887 --> 18:43.022
REALLY NO NAVY AND FEW RESOURCES

18:43.022 --> 18:44.123
BE ABLE TO PROTECT THIS

18:44.123 --> 18:45.658
PROTECTED AREA?

18:45.658 --> 18:46.993
>> WE DO HAVE MEASURES IN PLACE

18:46.993 --> 18:49.528
AND WE DO HAVE AGREEMENTS IN

18:49.528 --> 18:50.730
PLACE WHERE WE HAVE AGREED TO

18:50.730 --> 18:52.098
LOOK AFTER EACH OTHER'S

18:52.098 --> 18:54.066
EXCLUSIVE ZONE, PARTICULARLY

18:54.066 --> 18:56.235
FROM ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES.

18:56.235 --> 18:57.670
WE ALSO HAVE ARRANGEMENTS WITH

18:57.670 --> 18:59.772
OUR DEVELOPED PARTNERS INCLUDING

18:59.772 --> 19:01.774
THE UNITED STATES, WHEREBY THE

19:01.774 --> 19:02.708
U.S. COAST GUARD VESSELS GO INTO

19:02.708 --> 19:04.543
OUR WATERS AND THEY DO PROVIDE

19:04.543 --> 19:05.945
SURVEILLANCE AND THEY HAVE IN

19:05.945 --> 19:08.180
THE PAST ACTUALLY CAUGHT AND WE

19:08.180 --> 19:09.615
HAVE PROSECUTED ILLEGAL FISHING

19:09.615 --> 19:11.684
VESSELS.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.786
BUT I BELIEVE THAT IT'S GOT TO

19:13.786 --> 19:15.187
BE DONE AS A COLLABORATIVE

19:15.187 --> 19:15.855
EFFORT.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.990
WE CANNOT DO IT ALONE; WE

19:17.990 --> 19:19.325
SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DO IT ALONE,

19:19.325 --> 19:20.493
BECAUSE WE ARE DOING THIS FOR

19:20.493 --> 19:22.395
THE REST OF HUMANITY AS A FOOD

19:22.395 --> 19:23.863
SECURITY ISSUE, GLOBAL FOOD

19:23.863 --> 19:25.297
SECURITY ISSUE.

19:25.297 --> 19:27.233
AND SO OUR PARTNERS, OUR

19:27.233 --> 19:28.768
NEIGHBORS SHOULD BE WILLING, IF

19:28.768 --> 19:30.970
THEY ARE ABLE, TO CONTRIBUTE.

19:30.970 --> 19:34.206
>> Reporter: AS YOU KNOW, TUNA

19:34.206 --> 19:36.075
SPEND-- THEY CROSS AN ENORMOUS

19:36.075 --> 19:37.743
AMOUNT OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN, AND

19:37.743 --> 19:39.779
SO WHILE YOU MAY BE ABLE TO

19:39.779 --> 19:41.313
PROTECT THEM IN THE SHORT TIME

19:41.313 --> 19:42.681
WHEN THEY ARE IN YOUR WATERS,

19:42.681 --> 19:44.183
ISN'T THERE A CONCERN THAT

19:44.183 --> 19:45.184
THEY'RE EVENTUALLY GOING TO

19:45.184 --> 19:46.318
MIGRATE SOMEWHERE ELSE AND MIGHT

19:46.318 --> 19:47.520
BE UNPROTECTED AND SNATCHED UP

19:47.520 --> 19:48.287
ONCE THEY'VE LEFT YOUR

19:48.287 --> 19:49.622
NEIGHBORHOOD?

19:49.622 --> 19:50.990
>> THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THIS

19:50.990 --> 19:54.393
IS, THE TUNA ARE RENOWNED FOR

19:54.393 --> 19:55.261
BEING A PELAGIC SPECIES.

19:55.261 --> 19:56.195
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.263
BUT AT LEAST SOMEWHERE WHERE

19:57.263 --> 19:58.297
THEY KNOW THAT, WE'LL WE KNOW

19:58.297 --> 19:59.732
THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO FIND

19:59.732 --> 20:01.634
REFUGE.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.302
I HOPE THE TUNA LEARN THAT IN

20:03.302 --> 20:04.770
TIME, BUT I THINK IT'S BETTER

20:04.770 --> 20:06.372
THAN DOING NOTHING AT ALL.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.973
AND HOPEFULLY BY DOING THIS,

20:07.973 --> 20:09.208
OTHER NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES WILL

20:09.208 --> 20:11.377
DO THE SAME AND SO ON.

20:11.377 --> 20:15.514
HOPEFULLY IN TIME WE WILL HAVE

20:15.514 --> 20:17.216
SOMETHING MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE TO

20:17.216 --> 20:20.519
ENSURE THAT THE TUNA FISHERIES

20:20.519 --> 20:22.555
IN OUR PART OF THE WORLD DOESN'T

20:22.555 --> 20:23.923
SUFFER THE SAME FATE AS OTHER

20:23.923 --> 20:25.558
TUNA, FISHERIES IN DIFFERENT

20:25.558 --> 20:27.760
PARTS OF THE WORLD IN THE

20:27.760 --> 20:28.928
ATLANTIC, THE SALMON, THE COD

20:28.928 --> 20:31.330
AND WHATEVER, THE BLUEFIN IN THE

20:31.330 --> 20:33.499
ATLANTIC, THAT'S ALL GONE.

20:33.499 --> 20:34.433
WE DON'T WANT TO REPEAT THE SAME

20:34.433 --> 20:36.502
EXPERIENCE.

20:36.502 --> 20:37.703
>> Reporter: YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY

20:37.703 --> 20:38.804
SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF YOUR TIME

20:38.804 --> 20:40.473
TRYING TO DRAW THE WORLD'S

20:40.473 --> 20:42.007
ATTENTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND

20:42.007 --> 20:43.609
TO SEA-LEVEL RISE AND TO THE

20:43.609 --> 20:45.144
VERY REAL THREAT TO YOUR NATION.

20:45.144 --> 20:48.047
IS THERE A CONCERN THAT, AS SEA

20:48.047 --> 20:49.148
LEVELS CONTINUE TO RISE AND THE

20:49.148 --> 20:50.749
TERRITORIAL SIZE OF YOUR OWN

20:50.749 --> 20:52.084
COUNTRY IS THREATENED, THAT IT

20:52.084 --> 20:53.786
BECOMES HARDER AND HARDER TO

20:53.786 --> 20:55.254
PROTECT THE FISHERIES AROUND

20:55.254 --> 20:56.789
THEM?

20:56.789 --> 20:58.290
>> WELL, A LOT OF THINGS ARE

20:58.290 --> 20:59.592
GOING TO NEED PROTECTING, AND I

20:59.592 --> 21:02.194
THINK THE FIRST ANIMALS THAT

21:02.194 --> 21:03.796
WOULD NEED PROTECTING ARE OUR

21:03.796 --> 21:05.564
PEOPLE, OKAY? SECONDLY, OF

21:05.564 --> 21:07.199
COURSE THE QUESTION THAT ARISES

21:07.199 --> 21:08.567
AS TO WHAT HAPPENS TO OUR

21:08.567 --> 21:13.072
EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE.

21:13.072 --> 21:14.874
DOES IT DISAPPEAR WITH THE

21:14.874 --> 21:16.275
SUBMERGENCE OF OUR ISLANDS?

21:16.275 --> 21:17.309
WE BELIEVE NOT.

21:17.309 --> 21:19.078
I'VE LOOKED AND I'VE BEEN

21:19.078 --> 21:20.946
SEEKING ADVICE ON THIS, AND

21:20.946 --> 21:23.782
THERE'S NO LEGAL PRECEDENT.
