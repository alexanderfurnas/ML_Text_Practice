the school into book where the girls
were taken for many

06:57.889 --> 07:02.940
visiting this place was too much to bear
and yet despite all the International

07:02.940 --> 07:03.790
offers of help

07:03.790 --> 07:07.450
their torments and the ordeal being

in on a of the kidnap schoolgirls all
eyes were on nigeria's president

07:32.810 --> 07:36.410
criticize so much for not doing more he
said

07:36.410 --> 07:40.520
Nigeria was facing the same kind of war
the West had had to deal with especially

07:40.520 --> 07:41.650
this time

07:41.650 --> 07:45.860
that as initial we are facing attack

07:45.860 --> 07:50.470
of terrorist and fired by your
presidency a in Nigeria

07:50.470 --> 07:54.120
at this time you have already support a

07:54.120 --> 08:01.120
us to win the war against terror who
former Prime Minister Gordon Brown

08:01.820 --> 08:04.310
called for action against Boca harm
weeks ago

08:04.310 --> 08:09.310
he told me with so much lost time the
world had to face up to some hard truths

08:09.310 --> 08:13.400
we have to extend the search for these
girls not be on Nigeria

08:13.400 --> 08:18.349
and Cameroon Chad Tunisia and I feel
that they have been dispersed

08:18.349 --> 08:22.979
across Africa and we may never hear from
again my message to the families is

08:22.979 --> 08:26.300
we will not do everything in our power
even about slate we will do everything

08:26.300 --> 08:27.260
in our power

08:27.260 --> 08:30.479
to try to locate these girls time

08:30.479 --> 08:34.539
is critical as the kidnapping of the
girls heads towards the fourth week

08:34.539 --> 08:38.620
and the sense have urgency about taking
action rises by the day

08:38.620 --> 08:43.280
a small American team of military and
law enforcement

08:43.280 --> 08:47.870
and hostage negotiators is arriving in
Nigeria today to help the girls

08:47.870 --> 08:51.720
for more on that effort I'm joined by US
Assistant Secretary of State

08:51.720 --> 08:55.829
for African affairs Linda Thomas
Greenfield thank you for joining us

08:55.829 --> 08:59.510
and thank you for having me get me here
best assessment as a

08:59.510 --> 09:05.120
this evening how where the girls are
when I wish I could tell you where the

09:05.120 --> 09:06.000
girls are

09:06.000 --> 09:10.579
I don't think we have an answer to that
but I know that Nigerians don't have an

09:10.579 --> 09:11.459
answer to that

09:11.459 --> 09:14.920
they have been missing for more than
twenty four days

09:14.920 --> 09:18.200
and I think the question that everyone
has is where

09:18.200 --> 09:22.360
where are the girls there has been some
speculation that they have been split up

09:22.360 --> 09:23.980
in different locations

09:23.980 --> 09:27.540
we have heard that speculation that some
may have been

09:27.540 --> 09:31.140
taken across the border and into
neighboring countries

09:31.140 --> 09:35.320
are maybe in different locations inside
at Nigerian the forest and

09:35.320 --> 09:38.700
also in some small villages but again
this is all

09:38.700 --> 09:43.070
based on rumor and information that
we've not been able to confirm

09:43.070 --> 09:47.079
everybody from your boss secretary as
state carry this morning to the

09:47.079 --> 09:48.700
president United States have said

09:48.700 --> 09:52.589
the US will do all it can do what can
the US do

09:52.589 --> 09:57.540
we will do all we can do and the
president has instructed us to do that

09:57.540 --> 09:59.890
we are starting by sending

09:59.890 --> 10:06.010
a Marty at dimensional team and that
will include at the military civilians

10:06.010 --> 10:09.470
individuals that can work with the
nigerians

10:09.470 --> 10:13.990
on how to negotiate and how they can
approach sad

10:13.990 --> 10:17.930
returning the girls without harming them
I know you're a diplomat rather than a

10:17.930 --> 10:20.870
military person but this does this mean
we're not gonna have

10:20.870 --> 10:25.660
any kind that military intervention in
this situation at this time there are no

10:25.660 --> 10:26.420
plans

10:26.420 --> 10:29.970
that this is a military intervention we
are sending

10:29.970 --> 10:33.060
military advisors and to work

10:33.060 --> 10:36.459
at the side that Nigerians and provided
by Sen

10:36.459 --> 10:39.779
support to the Nigerians in their
efforts to retrieve

10:39.779 --> 10:43.829
these girls about satellite and Ron
imagery that might help

10:43.829 --> 10:48.610
us the nigerians have passed and this is
something that

10:48.610 --> 10:51.930
I we are considered not drones but
that's our light amber sorry this

10:51.930 --> 10:52.890
commercial

10:52.890 --> 10:57.050
satellite imagery that that could be
available to assist in this effort

10:57.050 --> 10:59.819
that is something that's being
considered you just mention that the

10:59.819 --> 11:03.740
Nigerian to pass for that help its there
seem to be some delay

11:03.740 --> 11:08.190
and the US offer up helping the
situation in Nigeria's

11:08.190 --> 11:11.800
our willingness to accept it what was
that gap about

11:11.800 --> 11:16.339
I'll we have not delayed in offering at
the Nigerian assistance

11:16.339 --> 11:19.819
we started working with the Nigerian
government on providing

11:19.819 --> 11:25.199
assists and several months ago I we have
had conversations with the

11:25.199 --> 11:29.870
I military elements as well as the
national security adviser

11:29.870 --> 11:33.540
I was out in Nigeria and December

11:33.540 --> 11:38.690
which I know Rodriguez send other team
members from USC ID

11:38.690 --> 11:42.490
we had some very productive discussions
with the nigerians

11:42.490 --> 11:47.699
on how we might be able to assess summer
that assistance has already been there

11:47.699 --> 11:51.199
provided to the Nigerians in terms of
helping them poor made

11:51.199 --> 11:56.290
their own intelligence information are
giving them advice at based on ion

11:56.290 --> 12:00.430
on experience and having dealt with
counterinsurgency zan

12:00.430 --> 12:04.140
Iraq and Afghanistan so you're speaking
specifically about the cooperation on

12:04.140 --> 12:08.150
the part of the US and the Nigerian
government to contain baccarat

12:08.150 --> 12:12.880
yes it it there Boca ron has been a
problem for some time

12:12.880 --> 12:16.670
so what progress has been made in that
joint effort

12:16.670 --> 12:20.329
I as you know back in November the US
government

12:20.329 --> 12:24.449
made a decision to sanction a book a ROM

12:24.449 --> 12:27.660
and so they are on our are terrorists
list

12:27.660 --> 12:31.290
and that gives ass the ability to

12:31.290 --> 12:35.520
look at what kinda financing their they
have and also

12:35.520 --> 12:38.650
to look at flows of money that they may
be have

12:38.650 --> 12:42.380
may have going in in their direction I
but

12:42.380 --> 12:45.390
this is a difficult to task

12:45.390 --> 12:48.470
as they are basically a group of bandits
that are

12:48.470 --> 12:54.260
hiding among among populations and it's
made it very difficult for the Nigerians

12:54.260 --> 12:54.730
to

12:54.730 --> 12:58.630
to capture them think it's fair to say
the US and other nations knew all that

12:58.630 --> 13:02.290
about poker on before November so why
did the designation not happen until

13:02.290 --> 13:02.760
their

13:02.760 --> 13:06.660
I think we started working on it long
before november

13:06.660 --> 13:09.770
itself long process to a

13:09.770 --> 13:14.319
to make a designation and the efforts
that went into getting that that's

13:14.319 --> 13:15.110
mentioned and

13:15.110 --> 13:18.670
filing was completed in November you
have to explain to people who don't know

13:18.670 --> 13:20.189
what you're talking about like me

13:20.189 --> 13:23.189
what what this is the long process what
takes so long I

13:23.189 --> 13:26.910
the actions are so obvious yeah we we
have to one thing we have to make sure

13:26.910 --> 13:28.850
that we have a right

13:28.850 --> 13:32.010
the people we're making the decision to
put on the list

13:32.010 --> 13:35.380
I it has to go through a process where a

13:35.380 --> 13:38.750
the Department of Treasury with the
Department of Justice

13:38.750 --> 13:42.459
and all of the work that needed to go
into that process

13:42.459 --> 13:46.800
was done and let us to come to the
decision to make the designation in

13:46.800 --> 13:47.500
November

13:47.500 --> 13:51.970
we are now where al Qaeda affiliate
cells are the one described them at work

13:51.970 --> 13:54.010
not only in Nigeria but also

13:54.010 --> 13:58.319
in Sudan and Somalia is there a
coordinated region all

13:58.319 --> 14:01.480
I effort to try to break that up

14:01.480 --> 14:04.560
I think regionally we have had number

14:04.560 --> 14:08.939
discussions with the African Union and
with the regional players

14:08.939 --> 14:11.949
across the continent to address

14:11.949 --> 14:17.060
the scorcher terrorism that is taking
place in a number of locations

14:17.060 --> 14:21.280
I'll whether it's in ass Somalia and
Kenya with OSHA Bob

14:21.280 --> 14:24.900
I where the the a counter LR

14:24.900 --> 14:28.790
a effort and also what baccarat man AQIM

14:28.790 --> 14:32.990
and and al Qaeda I think that it has to
be a multi-regional

14:32.990 --> 14:37.630
effort and we're certainly working with
our partners across Africa to address

14:37.630 --> 14:38.380
this issue

14:38.380 --> 14:42.339
do you feel that you're making progress
I think we're making slow progress but

14:42.339 --> 14:45.189
there's still a lot about work to be
done

14:45.189 --> 14:48.490
Linda Thomas green tea elicits so
insistent Secretary of State

14:48.490 --> 14:52.060
for african affairs thank you so much
for helping us out

14:52.060 --> 14:59.060
and thank you very much for having

15:02.250 --> 15:05.440
the woman who will likely be the new
face of the health care law

15:05.440 --> 15:10.120
testified today on capitol hill Sylvia
Mathews Burwell the president's budget

15:10.120 --> 15:10.840
director

15:10.840 --> 15:14.500
is mister Obama's nominee to replace
kathleen Sebelius

15:14.500 --> 15:19.190
Secretary of Health and Human Services
rarely is anything on the Affordable

15:19.190 --> 15:22.830
Care Act a bipartisan affair anymore in
congress

15:22.830 --> 15:27.010
but Burwell was well received by members
on both sides of the aisle

15:27.010 --> 15:30.210
as burl you have a reputation

15:30.210 --> 15:34.270
for competence and I would respectfully
suggest

15:34.270 --> 15:38.190
you're gonna need it that warning
notwithstanding republicans like lamar

15:38.190 --> 15:38.930
alexander

15:38.930 --> 15:42.630
mostly used the hearing to take a
knotted Burwell but if the health care

15:42.630 --> 15:43.130
law

15:43.130 --> 15:48.270
republicans would like to repair the
damage that Obamacare has done we'd like

15:48.270 --> 15:52.540
to prevent future damage as responsibly
and rapidly as we can

15:52.540 --> 15:57.110
sick but Burwell did not concede that
point instead in her opening statement

15:57.110 --> 16:00.840
she argued the effect that the law have
been positive was wrong the department's

16:00.840 --> 16:01.890
work to ensure

16:01.890 --> 16:06.090
accessible affordable quality health
care through the implementation of the

16:06.090 --> 16:07.310
Affordable Care Act

16:07.310 --> 16:10.690
is making a difference in the lives our
families and our communities

16:10.690 --> 16:15.230
while strengthening the economy if
confirmed Burwell would succeed kathleen

16:15.230 --> 16:16.020
Sebelius

16:16.020 --> 16:20.100
who announced her resignation last month
lead republicans roundly criticized her

16:20.100 --> 16:24.670
for the botched rollout of the federal
online insurance exchange last fall

16:24.670 --> 16:28.430
today South Carolina Republican Tim
Scott Press Burwell on whether

16:28.430 --> 16:31.800
she'd be an independent voice are I'd
ask you simply

16:31.800 --> 16:35.520
as secretary of HHS will you fight be

16:35.520 --> 16:40.440
Health and Human Services Secretary for
the american people or will you be as

16:40.440 --> 16:43.610
your predecessor has been the ambassador
of Obamacare

16:43.610 --> 16:46.630
I'm here to serve the american people
I'm part of the president's

16:46.630 --> 16:48.500
administration I'm honored to be
appointed

16:48.500 --> 16:52.270
person former assessor the American
people I believe it

16:52.270 --> 16:55.990
the president and his policies are
aligned with that will work

16:55.990 --> 16:59.580
but I am here to serve the american
people that line of questioning drew a

16:59.580 --> 17:00.850
strong rebuke from

17:00.850 --> 17:03.880
Iowa Democrat Tom Harkin the chair the
committee

17:03.880 --> 17:07.339
it is my my opinion

17:07.339 --> 17:11.360
based upon the years a work with
kathleen Sebelius Secretary earliest

17:11.360 --> 17:15.400
that she performed her job admirably and
she was

17:15.400 --> 17:19.240
a responsible a and attended

17:19.240 --> 17:22.439
Secretary of Health and Human Services
and carried out

17:22.439 --> 17:27.679
the law as we rode Democrats also touted
benefits at the law

17:27.679 --> 17:31.980
and kinetic its Chris Murphy zeroed in
on republican governors who are locked

17:31.980 --> 17:33.570
in embracing key provisions

17:33.570 --> 17:38.260
such as expanding Medicaid what are the
ways in which we can work in a flexible

17:38.260 --> 17:39.840
manner with the state's

17:39.840 --> 17:43.860
as they may be wake up to the reality
have how well the implementation is

17:43.860 --> 17:46.060
going after the initial botched rollout

17:46.060 --> 17:49.070
where the ways in which we can work with
some other states that haven't done

17:49.070 --> 17:51.220
things like connecticut at

17:51.220 --> 17:55.400
try to make this work im all 50 states
rather than just in a handful

17:55.400 --> 17:58.890
that have set up their own exchanges I
think there are two things it does come

17:58.890 --> 18:01.120
back to the point about the flexibility

18:01.120 --> 18:04.160
is one of the points and I think what's
important is to send the signal that

18:04.160 --> 18:07.650
folks are willing to have the
conversations as I said it's important

18:07.650 --> 18:11.250
if their fundamental principles started
late does in terms of the change you

18:11.250 --> 18:12.060
trying to get

18:12.060 --> 18:15.850
but be willing to have the conversations
and hear the ideas

18:15.850 --> 18:18.950
with their wells answers generally seem
to go down well

18:18.950 --> 18:22.590
some republicans even spoke of her
reputation for competence

18:22.590 --> 18:26.020
before taking over at the office of
management and budget she held

18:26.020 --> 18:29.870
leadership positions with the Walmart
Foundation and the Gates Foundation

18:29.870 --> 18:33.010
she also served in the Clinton
administration at the national economic

18:33.010 --> 18:33.970
council

18:33.970 --> 18:37.060
Richard burr of North Carolina cited
that background

18:37.060 --> 18:40.780
saying he plans to support the
nomination it's because she didn't come

18:40.780 --> 18:42.670
with the single experience

18:42.670 --> 18:46.960
dead would make urban sector she comes
with a portfolio

18:46.960 --> 18:51.700
%uh experience that would make her a
tremendous asset addressing some of the

18:51.700 --> 18:56.080
challenges that that agents specific
that agency specifically

18:56.080 --> 19:00.270
and uniquely has thank Burwell also got
an outside boost when

19:00.270 --> 19:03.670
America's health insurance plans and
industry trade group

19:03.670 --> 19:06.670
issued a statement calling her uniquely
qualified

19:06.670 --> 19:09.860
she still faces a separate confirmation
hearing before the Senate Finance

19:09.860 --> 19:10.870
Committee

19:10.870 --> 19:14.980
that hearing has not yet been scheduled
the reporter on that story of course was

19:14.980 --> 19:16.240
hari Sreenivasan

19:16.240 --> 19:20.919
as Rocky is there a lot of health care
that God has been a new report says

19:20.919 --> 19:25.040
the federal exchange was a bargain
compared to the state-run marketplace's

19:25.040 --> 19:32.040
which spent twice as much per enrollee
that stories on our rundown

19:38.360 --> 19:42.190
now to the continued fallout in
controversy over the attacks on the

19:42.190 --> 19:44.940
American consulate in Benghazi Libya

19:44.940 --> 19:48.350
two years ago four Americans including
ambassador

19:48.350 --> 19:53.330
were killed in Benghazi and republicans
argue there are on answer questions

19:53.330 --> 19:57.140
about what more could have been done to
prevent the deaths and the white house's

19:57.140 --> 19:58.800
role in the aftermath

19:58.800 --> 20:02.169
the house of representatives today moved
to form a special committee

20:02.169 --> 20:06.800
to investigate led by South Carolina
Republican congressman trade County

20:06.800 --> 20:11.400
a former prosecutor democratic
congressman Elijah Cummings of Maryland

20:11.400 --> 20:15.400
said it was all about politics but House
Speaker John bainer argue there are

20:15.400 --> 20:17.350
valid questions to pursue

20:17.350 --> 20:22.500
over the administration's actions we're
here to consider a resolution

20:22.500 --> 20:25.660
too great another participant committee

20:25.660 --> 20:29.740
to investigate what the speaker and and
525 chairman

20:29.740 --> 20:32.820
have already been investigating

20:32.820 --> 20:36.560
with all drew respect

20:36.560 --> 20:40.600
if the republicans want to fix the
problems would be a partisan

20:40.600 --> 20:43.730
investigation need more than just

20:43.730 --> 20:48.410
a new chairman avatar act tremendous
respect for mister gallery

20:48.410 --> 20:52.570
and i'm glad that he said the
fundraising should not be done

20:52.570 --> 20:57.260
on the deaths have these four people and
I hope that the republican conference

20:57.260 --> 21:01.640
family agree with that we are better
than the Act

21:01.640 --> 21:06.330
last week a line was crossed into places

21:06.330 --> 21:10.419
first came to light that the white house
did more to obscure what happened

21:10.419 --> 21:13.480
and why the mock we were led

21:13.480 --> 21:18.370
to believe sakib we now know that the
administration

21:18.370 --> 21:22.860
a defied a formal congressional subpoena

21:22.860 --> 21:26.160
our committee sought the full truth

21:26.160 --> 21:30.980
and the administration tried to make
sure that they wouldn't find it

21:30.980 --> 21:34.350
which means they tried to prevent the
American people from finding the truth

21:34.350 --> 21:38.850
as well with us now is congressional
reporter Robert koster

21:38.850 --> 21:43.250
the washington post he joins us from
capitol hill robber koster welcome

21:43.250 --> 21:47.669
back to the news hour it's been two
years since Ben Ghazi almost

21:47.669 --> 21:51.320
will be in September the speaker earlier
was against

21:51.320 --> 21:56.240
a new investigation what has caused him
to change his mind

21:56.240 --> 22:00.790
there was a really serve recent
documents by procured by judicial Watch

22:00.790 --> 22:02.419
a conservative group

22:02.419 --> 22:06.350
and these are documents including new
emails about how the white house

22:06.350 --> 22:10.300
messaged the attacks a right in the
immediate aftermath

22:10.300 --> 22:14.130
and and the release of these emails a
really has angered house republicans

22:14.130 --> 22:15.360
here on capitol hill

22:15.360 --> 22:18.890
and it has spurred them to create the
select committee so after all the in

22:18.890 --> 22:20.520
that we know there were four

22:20.520 --> 22:24.010
investigations underway there been a lot
of documents released

22:24.010 --> 22:28.500
so just in the release of these emails
that's what change the speakers Mon

22:28.500 --> 22:32.140
it's not only that I think that is the
main factor in that is the factor

22:32.140 --> 22:35.960
speaker banner has cited but there also
is a political element to it

22:35.960 --> 22:39.919
other conservative wing of the
Republican Party the GOP base

22:39.919 --> 22:43.120
they have been very frustrated about the
administration's handling

22:43.120 --> 22:47.300
up the attacks for a long time and I
headed the midterm elections Republican

22:47.300 --> 22:48.080
leadership

22:48.080 --> 22:51.690
there they are paying attention to the
base in the a.m the desires are those

22:51.690 --> 22:52.870
backbench conservative

22:52.870 --> 22:56.169
were also eager to have the Select
Committee what is the white house what

22:56.169 --> 22:58.669
is the administration saying in response
to the

22:58.669 --> 23:01.980
to this I what the republicans are
saying

23:01.980 --> 23:05.790
smells like something fishy was
happening democrats both at the White

23:05.790 --> 23:07.230
House and in Congress

23:07.230 --> 23:11.820
are skeptical this republican initiative
Nancy Pelosi the Democratic leader in

23:11.820 --> 23:12.440
the house

23:12.440 --> 23:16.220
has said I the democrats may even
boycott the select committee that will

23:16.220 --> 23:19.550
make that decision tomorrow when they
meet privately at the Capitol

23:19.550 --> 23:22.860
in at the white house %uh the democrats
there believe

23:22.860 --> 23:25.780
that they've already been investigations
into the Intelligence Committee on the

23:25.780 --> 23:27.820
Oversight Committee in the Foreign
Affairs Committee

23:27.820 --> 23:31.850
and elsewhere and I think that's enough
why is only the house pursuing this

23:31.850 --> 23:33.660
investigation one of the senate

23:33.660 --> 23:37.880
will simply now the house is dominated
by Republicans and that the democrats

23:37.880 --> 23:41.760
Senate is not and I think the house it
has always special with the oversight

23:41.760 --> 23:42.790
committee in the house

23:42.790 --> 23:46.649
they have really bad been delving into
this issue for a long time it animates

23:46.649 --> 23:47.890
the Republican Party

23:47.890 --> 23:51.770
and they feel it now because there is
such a divided Congress

23:51.770 --> 23:54.970
there's not much chance a bipartisan
deals and fiscal matters

23:54.970 --> 23:58.560
house republicans broadly speaking are
turning to oversight looking into Ben

23:58.560 --> 23:59.220
Ghazi

23:59.220 --> 24:01.919
looking into the Internal Revenue
Service in the administration's handling

24:01.919 --> 24:02.450
at that

24:02.450 --> 24:07.159
that's the focus right now for the GOP
you were saying I rubber casa not much

24:07.159 --> 24:11.060
a chance serves substantive legislation
I mean do you mean that literally that

24:11.060 --> 24:13.280
there's not much that's going to be
happening this year

24:13.280 --> 24:15.950
that's right we're really in a in a
phase now what we move toward summer

24:15.950 --> 24:17.770
campaign in the August recess

24:17.770 --> 24:21.710
and knees over Sands oversight and there
will be much time even for the Select

24:21.710 --> 24:22.250
Committee

24:22.250 --> 24:25.960
to do much work before the election
because %uh the August recess

24:25.960 --> 24:29.179
you're looking at republicans position
in themselves

24:29.179 --> 24:32.620
looking at Ben Ghazi and trying to
underscore before november

24:32.620 --> 24:36.060
reminding voters at this is at the top
of their list in terms of issues

24:36.060 --> 24:39.659
and as you alluded the democrats have a
tough decision to make about whether or

24:39.659 --> 24:41.190
not to participate

24:41.190 --> 24:44.370
in this special committee are they are
divided I get

24:44.370 --> 24:47.919
it is it there's been a an interesting
term today

24:47.919 --> 24:50.950
on capitol well-spoken speaking to some
house democrats

24:50.950 --> 24:55.100
and initially were very reluctant to
participate in the Select Committee

24:55.100 --> 24:57.740
but now because they know secretary
former Secretary of State Hillary

24:57.740 --> 24:58.640
Clinton

24:58.640 --> 25:02.399
is likely to be called they now want to
perhaps be on the committee to act as

25:02.399 --> 25:04.419
defenders former she is the party's

25:04.419 --> 25:07.550
about leading contender for the 2016
presidential

25:07.550 --> 25:11.520
campaign and if she is called they want
to be in that room

25:11.520 --> 25:14.780
robber cuz I also want to ask about want
something else we just heard congressman

25:14.780 --> 25:16.970
Cummings mention that is the fact that

25:16.970 --> 25:20.310
some Republicans are using the banned
GoDaddy a

25:20.310 --> 25:25.659
allegations to raise money for the party
where does that stand I know that

25:25.659 --> 25:28.570
congressman Galletti who's gonna be the
chairman of this committee said he

25:28.570 --> 25:29.080
thought it was

25:29.080 --> 25:33.070
inappropriate but then speaker bainer
today

25:33.070 --> 25:38.200
declined to say that its it that it's
wrong so what what's the thinking on

25:38.200 --> 25:38.800
that

25:38.800 --> 25:42.560
this is a case study and how the select
committee is complicated

25:42.560 --> 25:46.230
politically alright Traeger Audi a
former a federal prosecutor from South

25:46.230 --> 25:47.980
Carolina is chairing the Select
Committee

25:47.980 --> 25:51.760
speaker bainer they're trying to present
a sober I'll look for the republicans in

25:51.760 --> 25:52.270
the house

25:52.270 --> 25:55.870
a seriousness to this entire process yet
almost immediately

25:55.870 --> 25:59.980
but the NRCC the campaign arm at the
house GOP started a fund raiser offer

25:59.980 --> 26:01.190
this entire initiative

26:01.190 --> 26:05.940
and so you have sober on one hand and
fundraising and political on the other

26:05.940 --> 26:09.500
it can be hard bounce republicans to
make and speaker banner today in a press

26:09.500 --> 26:12.850
conference did not address the
fundraising from the NRCC related to Ben

26:12.850 --> 26:13.500
Ghazi

26:13.500 --> 26:17.710
I and i think that is a a testament to
his his ability to his inability to

26:17.710 --> 26:18.950
grapple with that tension

26:18.950 --> 26:22.669
is is there is this something the
republicans believe they can

26:22.669 --> 26:26.270
raise money offer well I think they have
not not

26:26.270 --> 26:29.850
only can they but they have for quite
some time II

26:29.850 --> 26:33.340
spent a lot on out on the campaign trail
and when I talk to republican

26:33.340 --> 26:38.140
base voters tea party conservatives Ben
Ghazi more than jobs it seems

26:38.140 --> 26:41.649
more than my any other issue is at the
top of their lists are concerned

26:41.649 --> 26:44.679
they really believe the Obama
administration is out of line and how it

26:44.679 --> 26:46.500
handled the response to these attacks

26:46.500 --> 26:49.669
and they want the pressure in the
leadership day in and day out calls

26:49.669 --> 26:50.690
emails eccentric

26:50.690 --> 26:55.010
to go in going into it more and just
quickly more than health care

26:55.010 --> 26:58.390
even though I mean I think Obamacare
ahead 20-14 is certainly

26:58.390 --> 27:02.030
at the top at that same list but I it
Obamacare

27:02.030 --> 27:05.060
and Ben Ghazi when I'm out on the trail
that's what I hear is a reporter

27:05.060 --> 27:07.820
I think the republican leadership would
echo that if you had a conversation with

27:07.820 --> 27:08.560
them

27:08.560 --> 27:15.560
Robert cost of the washington post we
thank you thank you

27:20.249 --> 27:23.940
the cost and affordability a good child
care is the focus of the next

27:23.940 --> 27:26.769
installment in our series parenting now

27:26.769 --> 27:30.139
it's a major concern for families
throughout the country and in different

27:30.139 --> 27:30.789
ways

27:30.789 --> 27:34.710
it cuts across lines a class and then
come the news are at: économiques

27:34.710 --> 27:36.980
correspondent paul solomon has the story

27:36.980 --> 27:40.629
part of his reporting making sense %uh
financial news

27:40.629 --> 27:47.629
we money Point Baltimore teacher
Danielle spiro gave birth to her

27:48.659 --> 27:49.330
daughter

27:49.330 --> 27:52.350
evil last year she had to quit her job

27:52.350 --> 27:55.419
there was no way we I was gonna be a
whatever for

27:55.419 --> 28:00.649
daycare Tiffany berard worked at Walmart
in Laurel Maryland

28:00.649 --> 28:05.039
when she had her second daughter out
made twelve thousand for the whole year

28:05.039 --> 28:09.230
and I'm daycare was cause then I wanna
say 275 to 300

28:09.230 --> 28:13.070
a week just for the newborn it that's
more than she was earning

28:13.070 --> 28:18.489
in Alexandria Virginia mother-of-two
lisa boyle and her husband can make the

28:18.489 --> 28:19.249
payments

28:19.249 --> 28:22.470
still close to half the market income
goes to childcare

28:22.470 --> 28:25.739
depending on where you live in America
these days

28:25.739 --> 28:30.389
full-time infant care can run to twenty
four thousand dollars a year

28:30.389 --> 28:34.419
the net prague a heads the advocacy
group childcare aware

28:34.419 --> 28:39.109
in most regions of the country a child
care is the most expensive

28:39.109 --> 28:42.429
apart in the family's budget in most
places

28:42.429 --> 28:46.070
infant here now costs more than state
college tuition

28:46.070 --> 28:50.830
it's a cost rising as much as eight
times faster than family income in some

28:50.830 --> 28:51.539
places

28:51.539 --> 28:55.429
and it presents a sordid generational
catch-22

28:55.429 --> 28:59.179
your kids figured it needed Vantage is
like quality

28:59.179 --> 29:04.169
in Fenton and day care well to prosper
in school and the workplace

29:04.169 --> 29:07.169
but with stagnant wages you can't afford
them

29:07.169 --> 29:10.350
and yet says Fraga the research

29:10.350 --> 29:15.119
is unequivocal we know that during the
first couple have years of life

29:15.119 --> 29:18.379
the and brain is growing at a very rapid
rate

29:18.379 --> 29:22.330
and that's where we really should be
putting investment President Obama

29:22.330 --> 29:26.539
called for universal preschool in this
year's State of the Union address

29:26.539 --> 29:30.249
one of the best investments we can make
in a child's life

29:30.249 --> 29:33.259
is high-quality early education but so
far

29:33.259 --> 29:37.220
nothing's happened and parents like
Danielle spiro

29:37.220 --> 29:41.899
are still on their own going begin
Spyros teacher's salary wasn't enough to

29:41.899 --> 29:44.249
cover the cost of caring for her
daughter

29:44.249 --> 29:47.639
I was after taxes bring home about five
hundred dollars a week

29:47.639 --> 29:50.859
and down with our mortgage and
everything out there just wasn't going

29:50.859 --> 29:51.330
to work

29:51.330 --> 29:54.350
perches spiro is the family's primary
earner

29:54.350 --> 29:59.159
her husband is a student after she
joined her mom's consulting for

29:59.159 --> 30:05.070
she hired a nanny she loves but even on
her seventy thousand dollars salary

30:05.070 --> 30:08.710
can only afford part-time to bridge the
gap

30:08.710 --> 30:14.119
command she put her 1-year-old in the
cheapest home daycare she could find

30:14.119 --> 30:18.840
it proved a poor alternative the TV was
on mister the day

30:18.840 --> 30:23.029
it just wasn't an ideal situation but I
didn't really have very many choices

30:23.029 --> 30:27.700
spiro pulled her out and now watches her
daughter herself when the nanny is in

30:27.700 --> 30:28.240
there

30:28.240 --> 30:33.109
I am waking up with her as somewhere
between 5:30 and six in the morning

30:33.109 --> 30:38.690
and I'm with her all day and I A put her
to bed around 6:30 7 o'clock at night

30:38.690 --> 30:42.419
eat clean house I get a little on Jan

30:42.419 --> 30:47.599
hand and start my work sometimes she
finishes at one in the morning

30:47.599 --> 30:53.269
for later Tiffany Borough Road cut back
from full-time work two weekends

30:53.269 --> 30:57.399
to save on child care when her daughter
amelia came along

30:57.399 --> 31:01.419
she was one in daycare and I am it was
really expensive and it was taken the

31:01.419 --> 31:02.509
majority of

31:02.509 --> 31:06.769
my paycheck in cinema has been shipped
paycheck I didn't wanna be a stay at

31:06.769 --> 31:07.239
home mom

31:07.239 --> 31:11.409
now was forced to basically take the
part time position and forced to take a

31:11.409 --> 31:12.809
media out-of-date care

31:12.809 --> 31:15.840
which perot word believed was benefiting
the baby

31:15.840 --> 31:19.619
mainly with soft skills this plays a big
role in their

31:19.619 --> 31:24.669
socialize interacting with other kids in
fact day care costs are driving more

31:24.669 --> 31:26.649
mothers to opt out altogether

31:26.649 --> 31:30.009
almost one-third now stay at home

31:30.009 --> 31:33.549
the most in more than two decades women

31:33.549 --> 31:37.379
girl 38 the

31:37.379 --> 31:41.460
Crystal City children center costs over
twenty thousand dollars a year for a

31:41.460 --> 31:43.399
full-time infant care

31:43.399 --> 31:47.289
hi but typical in the wealthy DC suburbs

31:47.289 --> 31:52.090
for high-quality care however there's
little margin between costs and revenues

31:52.090 --> 31:56.169
says director llewellyn Matthews people
have three teachers and their

31:56.169 --> 31:59.869
and you have only nine children so if
you look at the tuition from nine

31:59.869 --> 32:00.899
children

32:00.899 --> 32:04.330
to pay three teachers plus the overhead

32:04.330 --> 32:07.889
light he rent it's very very small

32:07.889 --> 32:13.549
by pay your average is barely sixteen
dollars an hour

32:13.549 --> 32:18.580
more but if the center paid more i'd
have to increase my tuition

32:18.580 --> 32:23.279
lisa boyle the center's assistant
director understands the whipsaw better

32:23.279 --> 32:24.080
than most

32:24.080 --> 32:27.990
the jack she uses almost all her salary

32:27.990 --> 32:31.230
to pay for her two children to come here

32:31.230 --> 32:34.490
even though she gets a discount for
3-year-old son

32:34.490 --> 32:38.980
in the end I work to earn about a
hundred dollars

32:38.980 --> 32:43.549
every weekend well can swing it because
her husband works too

32:43.549 --> 32:47.289
plus she's convinced it's an important
investment

32:47.289 --> 32:50.919
when looking at alternatives that were
cheaper it was always

32:50.919 --> 32:54.809
you know were quality so it's that the
choice that we've made

32:54.809 --> 32:59.369
and to invest in our children's
education and that 023

32:59.369 --> 33:03.179
he just can't get those years back it
was another one of those decisions where

33:03.179 --> 33:04.369
we went back and forth

33:04.369 --> 33:09.019
and you know eventually too baby when
hunter

33:09.019 --> 33:12.549
single moms like Paula Wilson a box and
Hill Maryland

33:12.549 --> 33:17.869
don't have such choices which she simply
can't afford a place like Crystal City

33:17.869 --> 33:21.749
everything is on all I don't have a
someone to

33:21.749 --> 33:26.309
you know shared a bills where so I had
to make sure I'm

33:26.309 --> 33:30.789
you know plan everything out to it full
Wilson a hotel maid sensor

33:30.789 --> 33:33.409
three-year-old Daniel to a family-run

33:33.409 --> 33:36.639
daycare she likes and can just afford

33:36.639 --> 33:39.740
but it's twenty minutes away and she
can't afford

33:39.740 --> 33:45.339
a car every day have to figure out how
day is going to get to daycare

33:45.339 --> 33:50.730
a minority have clothes and daycares in
that area but they're way too expensive

33:50.730 --> 33:56.220
all so wilson asks friends and family to
help with transportation

33:56.220 --> 33:59.450
there are child care subsidies available
but

33:59.450 --> 34:03.419
she doesn't qualify so you make
seventeen dollars our

34:03.419 --> 34:07.399
you must be able to afford it but they
don't look at the fact that sometimes

34:07.399 --> 34:09.829
the hotel is slowing never know

34:09.829 --> 34:13.389
weighing is going to be slow meanwhile
Tiffany Borough Road

34:13.389 --> 34:17.849
recently lost her job at Walmart before
we were struggling now we have to

34:17.849 --> 34:19.149
struggle even more

34:19.149 --> 34:23.349
to make is me we need the income so we
can make sure that we have read

34:23.349 --> 34:26.529
how we can make sure that we have food
and clothing for the children

34:26.529 --> 34:29.690
for such families infant and child care

34:29.690 --> 34:33.089
are luxuries but says lynette Fraga

34:33.089 --> 34:36.740
it's also an economic and educational
imperative families

34:36.740 --> 34:41.309
have to work and when they have to work
they need quality settings to put their

34:41.309 --> 34:42.079
children

34:42.079 --> 34:45.569
n on to be cared and nurtured and

34:45.569 --> 34:48.980
developed for later school success open
and close

34:48.980 --> 34:52.500
unfortunately these are quality settings

34:52.500 --> 34:57.920
that a great many Americans just can't
afford

34:57.920 --> 35:02.260
even parents who work full-time often
can't afford backup childcare

35:02.260 --> 35:05.400
read the story of a single mom who feels
caught between the

35:05.400 --> 35:08.609
needing to care for her kids when
they're not at school and climbing the

35:08.609 --> 35:09.920
ladder at work

35:09.920 --> 35:16.920
that's on making sense

35:21.470 --> 35:25.770
now to what different look at the cost
of kids the ever-rising price tags for

35:25.770 --> 35:26.680
college

35:26.680 --> 35:31.380
how do you assess the value of one's
degree and have higher education overall

35:31.380 --> 35:35.859
as a graduate moves on in life many
studies have looked at job placement in

35:35.859 --> 35:37.549
income as a key metric

35:37.549 --> 35:41.540
but a new study measures it differently
focusing on whether a graduate has a

35:41.540 --> 35:42.970
good life in terms of

35:42.970 --> 35:46.680
well-being satisfaction and engagement
in a career

35:46.680 --> 35:50.369
the report comes from a survey of more
than 30,000 graduate

35:50.369 --> 35:55.630
in all 50 states it was done by gallup
in partnership with Purdue University

35:55.630 --> 36:00.470
and the Lumina Foundation earlier this
week I spoke with the president Purdue

36:00.470 --> 36:03.819
also the former governor Indiana mitch
Daniels

36:03.819 --> 36:08.650
and for the record the Lumina Foundation
is a funder the NewsHour

36:08.650 --> 36:12.700
mitch Daniels welcome to the NewsHour
thanks for me. so why did you want to

36:12.700 --> 36:14.640
undertake this kind of study

36:14.640 --> 36:18.730
started as us at purdue has won
University feeling we should be

36:18.730 --> 36:21.400
accountable we wanted to know with some

36:21.400 --> 36:25.700
rigor an authority how r grains were
doing

36:25.700 --> 36:30.200
and for so that we can report at the
potential future students

36:30.200 --> 36:33.099
and secondly so maybe we could learn
things that would help us become better

36:33.099 --> 36:34.990
than I found the folks at gallup

36:34.990 --> 36:38.660
with twenty or thirty years of research
in this area we're very interested in

36:38.660 --> 36:39.819
something broader in

36:39.819 --> 36:44.210
that was today so what it one of the
most interesting findings here

36:44.210 --> 36:48.259
is that when you look at what's happened
to graduates and this is

36:48.259 --> 36:51.630
the survey was across the country it
didn't matter

36:51.630 --> 36:56.560
so much whether they went to a private
college or a public college

36:56.560 --> 36:59.750
I or or even how selective

36:59.750 --> 37:03.680
the school was in determining what kinda
life they had afterwards

37:03.680 --> 37:07.500
tell us about that probably one of the
most surprising lot a surprise in your

37:07.500 --> 37:08.040
hood

37:08.040 --> 37:12.480
maybe nothing surpasses that no
statistically significant difference as

37:12.480 --> 37:15.020
you just said between public and private

37:15.020 --> 37:18.380
so-called elite and and

37:18.380 --> 37:22.440
up larger schools I like ours turns out

37:22.440 --> 37:27.980
that what matters a overwhelmingly is
not where you went to school but

37:27.980 --> 37:32.170
how you went and how the school approach
the process your education

37:32.170 --> 37:35.509
and what it what did you mean by that
how did you measure how

37:35.509 --> 37:39.089
how engage up folks were when

37:39.089 --> 37:43.990
again gallup has decades and tens of
millions have interviews and named aid

37:43.990 --> 37:48.130
by now have a very good method for dis
determining well-being in all its

37:48.130 --> 37:50.160
domains is really important judy

37:50.160 --> 37:53.740
to know that we were yes we were
interested in how our graduates are

37:53.740 --> 37:55.799
graduate all graduates were doing

37:55.799 --> 37:59.359
materially where they employ them where
they are earning a good

37:59.359 --> 38:03.410
living and all that but also there's
physical well-being and social

38:03.410 --> 38:07.960
and and in the sense that engagement
with work in community

38:07.960 --> 38:11.270
and that's really what we've always said
college

38:11.270 --> 38:14.579
should produce people who thrive in all
those

38:14.579 --> 38:19.040
areas and turns out that what really
matters is

38:19.040 --> 38:23.609
did at least one professor shows
specific interest in you and give you

38:23.609 --> 38:24.770
coaching in

38:24.770 --> 38:28.900
mentoring did you have a work experience
and internship some sort of

38:28.900 --> 38:33.089
experiential learning ago that went
along with your classroom learning these

38:33.089 --> 38:34.500
are the kinda lessons that

38:34.500 --> 38:38.540
we all can make our school and many
others better now the implication is

38:38.540 --> 38:38.980
that

38:38.980 --> 38:42.440
that a lot of people been measuring the
wrong things are thinking about the

38:42.440 --> 38:43.500
wrong things

38:43.500 --> 38:47.560
when they pick a school or think about
the school they went yeah it sure is an

38:47.560 --> 38:51.569
implication especially when the spread
of costs across the schools which

38:51.569 --> 38:54.569
we now know or not producing better
outcomes

38:54.569 --> 38:59.720
is so gigantic and not produce were land
grant school we were put there to

38:59.720 --> 39:03.599
along with our sister schools to throw
open the gates at higher education

39:03.599 --> 39:05.609
beyond the elites

39:05.609 --> 39:09.520
a this country and when we got it be
serious about it

39:09.520 --> 39:14.220
but now we know that if we can do that
affordably for students so they can

39:14.220 --> 39:18.000
have just as good an education on the
other end do you think the results mitch

39:18.000 --> 39:20.589
Daniels about other survey like this

39:20.589 --> 39:23.869
wall will make other schools feel more
comfortable

39:23.869 --> 39:27.470
about not having to keep a raising costs
and keep

39:27.470 --> 39:32.140
paying evermore for new buildings a
faculty and so on

39:32.140 --> 39:37.410
I think that snow school should have
gotten the the memo about that already

39:37.410 --> 39:38.630
you're hearing it

39:38.630 --> 39:42.440
the in the in perfectly legitimate
criticism

39:42.440 --> 39:47.170
the in public discourse this year the
highest percentage a record percentage a

39:47.170 --> 39:47.890
freshman

39:47.890 --> 39:52.589
past over their first choice school for
a second or third choice

39:52.589 --> 39:56.079
almost always on the basis of cost and
so

39:56.079 --> 39:59.380
I think that many the excesses that you
just mentioned

39:59.380 --> 40:03.500
really a run their course so what's the
main message that you would want folks

40:03.500 --> 40:04.890
to take away

40:04.890 --> 40:08.359
from this in young people and their
parents who were thinking about

40:08.359 --> 40:11.430
the next several years go to school
prepared

40:11.430 --> 40:14.660
to to drawn the lessons here too the

40:14.660 --> 40:18.839
search out the experiential
opportunities as well as complete

40:18.839 --> 40:20.150
traditional classroom

40:20.150 --> 40:24.089
to go to school with some a reputation
for the engagement

40:24.089 --> 40:27.420
faculty closely in the teaching and

40:27.420 --> 40:30.960
pay pay close attention to cost because
a

40:30.960 --> 40:34.599
very likely you're not buying greater
quality for the higher

40:34.599 --> 40:38.329
sticker price you're being charged and
one other thing you mentioned that with

40:38.329 --> 40:39.960
the survey also

40:39.960 --> 40:44.970
found that those graduates who carry a
lot of student debt when they leave that

40:44.970 --> 40:48.609
can very much affect what they do right
I think we've all

40:48.609 --> 40:51.930
this sense that student that was a big
big problem

40:51.930 --> 40:55.839
the survey tells us that it's an even
bigger problem than we thought

40:55.839 --> 41:00.540
that in a linear fashion the more data
student leaves with even if it's not

41:00.540 --> 41:05.790
that much by today's standards it brings
down their so-called well-being across

41:05.790 --> 41:09.009
all these dimensions financial social
health

41:09.009 --> 41:12.140
status and so forth and another

41:12.140 --> 41:16.690
very troublesome finding them more debt
you have the less likely Arctic ever

41:16.690 --> 41:18.560
start a business so that's

41:18.560 --> 41:23.339
that's bad at the individual level on
bad societal Ian economically

41:23.339 --> 41:26.839
mitch Daniels president at Purdue
University thinking about

41:26.839 --> 41:30.029
the ways people ought to think about at
the school

41:30.029 --> 41:37.029
they choose to go to thank you hun
thinking that

41:40.509 --> 41:45.190
veteran affairs secretary Eric Shinseki
is pushing back against calls

41:45.190 --> 41:49.290
for him to resign this comes after
allegations that dozens of patients have

41:49.290 --> 41:50.000
died

41:50.000 --> 41:53.190
because the delay treatment added agency
hospital

41:53.190 --> 41:58.599
jeffrey Brown reports all those in favor
the motion to issue the Spain will say I

41:58.599 --> 42:01.640
I all those opposed no

42:01.640 --> 42:05.410
the house Veterans Affairs Committee
voted overwhelmingly this morning

42:05.410 --> 42:09.240
to subpoena communications between
Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki

42:09.240 --> 42:11.640
and his colleagues

42:11.640 --> 42:16.490
the focus allegations that employees at
VA facilities in Phoenix Arizona

42:16.490 --> 42:21.930
and Fort Collins Colorado falsified
records on delays in treating patients

42:21.930 --> 42:25.069
a retired doctor in Phoenix would work
to the hospital

42:25.069 --> 42:28.589
came forward with allegations it up to
4tb a patient

42:28.589 --> 42:33.210
died while awaiting care on Monday the
head of the nation's largest veterans

42:33.210 --> 42:34.920
group the American Legion

42:34.920 --> 42:38.579
called for Shin sexys resignation there
needs to be a change

42:38.579 --> 42:43.339
and that change me so occur at the top
the administration needs to take steps

42:43.339 --> 42:47.869
now is long overdue they have they
should have taken steps

42:47.869 --> 42:51.859
months ago keys time three Republican
senators including John Cornyn of Texas

42:51.859 --> 42:56.390
quickly join that called on the
president needs to find a new leader

42:56.390 --> 43:00.529
do like leaders organization how to the
wilderness

43:00.529 --> 43:04.040
and back to providing the service that
are better in scissor but House Speaker

43:04.040 --> 43:08.150
John Boehner said today the real
priority is making it easier fishing

43:08.150 --> 43:09.950
sexyy to fire people

43:09.950 --> 43:14.020
I'm not ready to to join though the
course a people calling for him

43:14.020 --> 43:18.540
to step down other problems a at the VA
are systemic

43:18.540 --> 43:21.540
and I don't believes that the just

43:21.540 --> 43:25.509
change in some other top he's going to
actually get

43:25.509 --> 43:29.329
to the solutions that many of us were
looking for Democrats have generally

43:29.329 --> 43:30.930
defended the secretary

43:30.930 --> 43:34.589
while demanding improvements in care for
the nine million people in the VA

43:34.589 --> 43:35.910
medical system

43:35.910 --> 43:39.180
for his part in Sec Ian says she wants
TEP down

43:39.180 --> 43:43.000
he told the Wall Street Journal
yesterday I serve at the pleasure of the

43:43.000 --> 43:43.829
President

43:43.829 --> 43:47.290
I sign on to make some changes I have
work to do

43:47.290 --> 43:51.029
the VA inspector general is now
investigating the allegations are false

43:51.029 --> 43:52.290
applying records

43:52.290 --> 43:56.359
and white House spokesman Jay Carney
says President Obama is standing by the

43:56.359 --> 43:57.200
Secretary

43:57.200 --> 44:00.450
the president remains confident in
secretary Shin sexys

44:00.450 --> 44:03.839
ability to lead the department to take
appropriate action

44:03.839 --> 44:07.079
based on the ideas findings ending those
findings

44:07.079 --> 44:11.480
chance ekie has now ordered a nationwide
review love access to care

44:11.480 --> 44:16.319
all be a clinton's we invited veterans
affairs secretary Shinseki to appear on

44:16.319 --> 44:18.319
tonight's program he declined

44:18.319 --> 44:22.099
so to tell us more about what happened
in Phoenix and the wider implications

44:22.099 --> 44:25.119
we turn to Associated Press reporter
Brian skoloff

44:25.119 --> 44:28.330
and Philip Carter he's a senior fellow
with the Center for a New American

44:28.330 --> 44:29.430
Security

44:29.430 --> 44:33.730
is a former army officer who writes
often on issues involving veterans

44:33.730 --> 44:38.000
Ryan's girl so let me start with you
tell us more first about the specific

44:38.000 --> 44:39.349
allegations here

44:39.349 --> 44:44.160
VA was falsifying records have
appointments with patients

44:44.160 --> 44:48.369
yeah it does the allegations on way to
doctor who retired longtime physician

44:48.369 --> 44:52.239
with the VA after about twenty years a
service retired in December

44:52.239 --> 44:55.690
and then came public with these
allegations that I

44:55.690 --> 44:58.890
administration at the VA hospital
instructed staff to keep this

44:58.890 --> 45:02.000
secret waiting list to hide wait times
are

45:02.000 --> 45:05.480
sometimes patience for waiting six to
nine months to get in there

45:05.480 --> 45:08.940
but the wait list was showing that they
were getting appointments within

45:08.940 --> 45:12.160
two weeks he also claims because at this
weight Leicester

45:12.160 --> 45:15.339
up to forty patients may have died while
awaiting this care

45:15.339 --> 45:18.380
well explain that Brian because the
alligators doesn't the it's not

45:18.380 --> 45:20.410
necessarily the forty people died

45:20.410 --> 45:25.890
because they weren't seen but they would
that they died during that waiting time

45:25.890 --> 45:29.330
exactly and we also have to make make
perfectly clear here that

45:29.330 --> 45:33.069
these are all still allegations as you
noted the inspector general's office has

45:33.069 --> 45:36.210
investigators here in Phoenix poring
over records interviewing staff

45:36.210 --> 45:39.950
trying to get to the truth right now
what we have is this doctor and two

45:39.950 --> 45:42.469
other former be employees making this
claimed

45:42.469 --> 45:46.460
and your Jackley correct i mean the the
claims are that up to 40 patients may

45:46.460 --> 45:48.359
have died while awaiting care

45:48.359 --> 45:51.940
but you know first evolved be a
administration here in Phoenix deny any

45:51.940 --> 45:54.319
these allegations but they also point
out that

45:54.319 --> 45:57.830
if there were doubts while patients were
waiting doctors appointments

45:57.830 --> 46:01.469
they may work very well may could have
happened from a heart attack or a car

46:01.469 --> 46:04.839
accident things unrelated to the care
that they were seeking so

46:04.839 --> 46:08.029
again by on the inspector general's down
here we'll have to wait to see what the

46:08.029 --> 46:09.119
probe turned up

46:09.119 --> 46:12.750
I will tho Carter there there is a large
larger context you're right the VA has

46:12.750 --> 46:14.910
been under pressure and criticized for

46:14.910 --> 46:18.580
a systemic problems and not keeping up
with demand

46:18.580 --> 46:22.029
the wars we've been fighting that's
right these allegations strike a chord

46:22.029 --> 46:25.150
because even though there's widespread
patient satisfaction with the VA's

46:25.150 --> 46:27.150
massive hospital system

46:27.150 --> 46:31.200
there also repeated allegations like
this and in fact the Government

46:31.200 --> 46:33.109
Accountability Office the j.o

46:33.109 --> 46:37.060
substantiated many of these a couple
years ago with a series of reports on

46:37.060 --> 46:37.430
how

46:37.430 --> 46:40.480
unreliable the VA's wait time

46:40.480 --> 46:44.560
systems were and that's been a known
problem within the VA

46:44.560 --> 46:48.529
that even though they've known about it
they've not fixed in the years well

46:48.529 --> 46:52.630
and in fact presumably it is that very
thing that may have caused the pressure

46:52.630 --> 46:56.520
in Phoenix and other places too to
falsified the documents I sOooo

46:56.520 --> 47:00.540
that sparked in part of it is also the
potential linkage between performance

47:00.540 --> 47:01.440
incentives

47:01.440 --> 47:06.279
and wat time said is that the reported
wait times are the targets for those

47:06.279 --> 47:07.279
wait times

47:07.279 --> 47:10.640
are part of the employment contracts for
certain VA officials

47:10.640 --> 47:14.770
they're also very visible metres up
success for VA medical centers

47:14.770 --> 47:19.060
and there's an allegation at least that
VA personnel may have

47:19.060 --> 47:22.569
the tweak the stats in order to look
better on those measures

47:22.569 --> 47:26.250
so we have the allegations in Phoenix
Fort Collins

47:26.250 --> 47:29.509
are you here is is it look like

47:29.509 --> 47:32.890
going to be hearing about this and other
places as well these practices there are

47:32.890 --> 47:35.460
also reports coming out of Austin

47:35.460 --> 47:40.020
and San Antonio yet you have to remember
the VA's a massive health care system

47:40.020 --> 47:41.779
151 hospitals

47:41.779 --> 47:46.430
800-plus clinics and so if these
conditions existed at the Phoenix center

47:46.430 --> 47:48.170
which I should say is also home to the

47:48.170 --> 47:52.580
second largest veterans community the
country they may exist in other large

47:52.580 --> 47:56.700
facilities or small facilities to it is
a speaker better said

47:56.700 --> 47:59.880
most likely a systemic issue well Brian
skoloff AE

47:59.880 --> 48:04.880
you said that there in phoenix the VA
people at the hospital have denied

48:04.880 --> 48:09.099
these allegations tell us a little bit
more about the reaction so far

48:09.099 --> 48:12.779
well yeah I mean I good point was raised
there need these allegations

48:12.779 --> 48:16.950
if they are very very serious and and
they doctor foot the

48:16.950 --> 48:21.299
for be a ploy came out with them first
reclaims exactly what your guests just

48:21.299 --> 48:22.219
said that

48:22.219 --> 48:25.759
the reason the administrators were
having these wait times a

48:25.759 --> 48:30.119
fabricated whether that their pad their
pockets with the with bonus checks am

48:30.119 --> 48:33.200
director Sharon how many as a director
the VA health care system here in

48:33.200 --> 48:33.770
Phoenix

48:33.770 --> 48:36.900
prior to it being her being placed on
administrative leave

48:36.900 --> 48:40.500
last week told made that cheap flat-out
denies this

48:40.500 --> 48:45.239
she makes roughly 169 170 thousand
dollars a year for bonus last year was

48:45.239 --> 48:47.369
about ninety three hundred dollars

48:47.369 --> 48:50.609
I you know chichi scoffs at the notion
that she would

48:50.609 --> 48:55.040
sit back and watch veterans died to make
an extra nine thousand dollars a in

48:55.040 --> 48:58.869
in bonus money again though these are
all allegations but if proven true

48:58.869 --> 49:00.739
they're they're very serious allegations

49:00.739 --> 49:05.020
butts that the cheaper staff and the
hospital administrator be manly denied

49:05.020 --> 49:05.460
that

49:05.460 --> 49:09.790
any secret waiting list was created that
the ever told staff to create the seeker

49:09.790 --> 49:10.589
waiting list

49:10.589 --> 49:14.270
and that staff is really just confused
with the changeover from

49:14.270 --> 49:17.349
paperwork actual paperwork to an
electronic waiting list

49:17.349 --> 49:20.560
but again you know our at this point
it's a he said she said Intel a mess

49:20.560 --> 49:21.569
Gators get to the truth

49:21.569 --> 49:25.460
wealth or carter at the national level
though there is a lot of pressure now on

49:25.460 --> 49:29.540
a I'm generations Aki there's an awful
lot of pressure and a lot of folks are

49:29.540 --> 49:33.319
analogize in this now to the water read
scandal from six years ago where

49:33.319 --> 49:37.160
their reports I love terrible living
conditions at the Walter Reed Army

49:37.160 --> 49:38.140
Medical Center

49:38.140 --> 49:43.299
which is not a VA facility and those led
to the downfall of the Army's medical

49:43.299 --> 49:44.819
leadership as a result

49:44.819 --> 49:48.650
are but folks are trying to figure out
here in washington where did you fix

49:48.650 --> 49:52.460
responsibility within the chain of
command is it at the secretary level

49:52.460 --> 49:55.700
is it below that at the regional level
the hospital level

49:55.700 --> 50:00.420
are down below and I think that there's
a a a consensus building at least

50:00.420 --> 50:03.719
and speaker painters comments illustrate
that to wait for the investigation

50:03.719 --> 50:06.739
before we fix accountability for these
issues

50:06.739 --> 50:09.810
now G secretary Shinseki announced this
face to face

50:09.810 --> 50:14.500
Rd right today yesterday at all all the
facilities across the country

50:14.500 --> 50:18.040
do we know what that will entail do we
know how long it will take

50:18.040 --> 50:21.770
no we don't know the details of that we
do know that it was announced

50:21.770 --> 50:27.200
earlier in April arm and that that was
part of the effort to you

50:27.200 --> 50:31.250
understand how much of an issue this is
throughout the VA's massive health care

50:31.250 --> 50:32.210
system

50:32.210 --> 50:35.589
secretary Shinseki trying to get ahead
of the story as much as possible

50:35.589 --> 50:39.279
while also fighting the perception that
he's not doing enough Brian skoloff do

50:39.279 --> 50:42.859
you have any more on that on how that's
going to work there in phoenix

50:42.859 --> 50:46.759
well I mean it could be weeks down here
trying to get to the truth of things but

50:46.759 --> 50:49.950
you know a good point was raised there
is it that it is no secret

50:49.950 --> 50:53.880
that the BA is overwhelmed with veteran
seeking care either from

50:53.880 --> 50:58.180
previous wars more recent wars there are
lot of veterans even care

50:58.180 --> 51:02.250
and and there really a swarming this
hospital some you look the VA is already

51:02.250 --> 51:04.660
acknowledged that twenty-three patients
in recent years

51:04.660 --> 51:08.469
had died due to delayed care so so
there's no there there is no secret that

51:08.469 --> 51:11.730
there is an issue with the late care the
allegations made here in Phoenix though

51:11.730 --> 51:12.890
are very serious

51:12.890 --> 51:16.650
that there was a cover-up in order for
these administrators to make money and

51:16.650 --> 51:18.410
and get bonus checks am

51:18.410 --> 51:21.599
so I I guess we'll wait and see but I
but again as our guest noted

51:21.599 --> 51:24.799
there's no secret that the VA has a
master's it needs to deal with

51:24.799 --> 51:27.849
I Brian skoloff Phil Carter thank you
both very much

51:27.849 --> 51:34.849
Inc thank you

51:37.520 --> 51:41.550
again the major developments at the day
nigeria's president pledged to find more

51:41.550 --> 51:43.940
than 270 schoolgirls

51:43.940 --> 51:48.950
kidnapped by Islamist militant militants
rebels in Syria set off a huge bomb in a

51:48.950 --> 51:50.840
lot below that level the hotel

51:50.840 --> 51:54.760
used by government militia report set up
to a hundred people were killed

51:54.760 --> 51:57.930
and the US House voted to set up a
