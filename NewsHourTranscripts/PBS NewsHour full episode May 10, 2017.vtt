I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

00:13.633 --> 00:15.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Judy Woodruff is away.

00:15.133 --> 00:17.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

troubles and what can be done

to save its economy.

00:19.966 --> 00:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

the final push for votes in
France's presidential election,

a look at the race that's
upended French politics.

How an innovative program in
San Diego is cutting costs of
diabetes management by looking

00:24.500 --> 00:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at the big picture of health.

00:26.266 --> 00:28.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

ATHENA PHILIS-TSIMIKAS,
Scripps Whittier Diabetes
Institute: It's not that
easy to expect someone

00:43.233 --> 00:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to remember to test their
blood sugar, take their pill,
to go out and take that walk,

00:50.333 --> 00:53.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to have exactly the right
meal on the table all the
time to take care of this.

00:55.466 --> 01:00.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
And it's Friday.

01:03.466 --> 01:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and Michael Gerson
are here to talk about what's
next for the Republicans'

01:26.133 --> 01:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
health care bill and the
political stories this week.

01:28.233 --> 01:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:32.433 --> 01:34.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:34.533 --> 01:38.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
U.S. economy is showing
signs of rebounding,
after a lackluster first

01:42.233 --> 01:44.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
quarter.

01:44.766 --> 01:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Labor Department
reports that employers
added a net of 211,000
jobs in April, up sharply

01:49.000 --> 01:51.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from the month of March.

01:51.100 --> 01:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The unemployment rate for
April fell to 4.4 percent,
a nearly 10-year low.

01:57.166 --> 02:00.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The strong showing could
increase odds that the
Federal Reserve will
raise interest rates

02:00.900 --> 02:03.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
again next month.

02:03.500 --> 02:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Somalia, a U.S. Navy
SEAL has been killed in
a raid on the Islamist
militant group Al-Shabaab.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the first American combat
death there since 1993, when
two helicopters were shot

02:12.933 --> 02:15.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
down in Mogadishu.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. officials say the SEAL
died on a mission supporting
Somali forces yesterday.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Two other Americans
were also wounded.

02:21.066 --> 02:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thousands of Afghans turned
out today to hail the return
of a former warlord to Kabul.

02:28.500 --> 02:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar
responded with a demand
that U.S. and other outside
forces leave Afghanistan.

02:33.666 --> 02:37.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He rallied the crowd with a
call for peace with the Taliban,
and he criticized the Afghan

02:37.066 --> 02:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government for its
cooperation with the U.S.

02:39.700 --> 02:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GULBUDDIN HEKMATYAR, Afghan
Warlord (through translator):
Let's all end this war together

02:46.633 --> 02:50.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in our country first, and tell
the foreign forces that Afghans
are able to sort out their

02:50.600 --> 02:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
issues themselves, and that we
want them to leave Afghanistan.

02:54.900 --> 02:58.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No one has any justification for
the presence of foreign troops.

02:58.066 --> 03:00.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
U.S. now has about 8,000
troops in Afghanistan.

03:00.733 --> 03:05.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Next week, the Pentagon is
widely expected to recommend
sending more troops.

03:07.600 --> 03:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia's Defense Ministry
announced today that four newly
declared safe zones in Syria

03:10.333 --> 03:12.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will be closed to U.S.
coalition aircraft.

03:12.466 --> 03:16.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's part of a deal
that Russia, Turkey and
Iran signed yesterday.

03:16.200 --> 03:17.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It took effect tonight.

03:17.933 --> 03:22.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Syrian military planes
will also be banned from
the restricted areas.

03:22.100 --> 03:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.N. Human Rights Office
is condemning China for an
ongoing crackdown of activists

03:27.966 --> 03:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and their defense lawyers.

03:29.633 --> 03:33.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The agency said today
there's been a continued
pattern or harassment.

03:33.566 --> 03:38.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Within recent days, a prominent
defense lawyer and his
family were seized by police.

03:40.566 --> 03:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in this country, President
Trump signed the omnibus bill
to fund the government through

03:42.333 --> 03:43.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
September.

03:43.333 --> 03:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It totals some $1.2 trillion.

03:45.933 --> 03:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now the focus shifts to
the fate of the Republican
health care bill that
passed the House yesterday.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the White House,
Deputy Spokeswoman Sarah
Huckabee Sanders said
the president understands

03:55.133 --> 03:57.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there are calls to
revise the measure.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Â®MD-BSARAH HUCKABEE
SANDERS, Deputy White
House Press Secretary:
He's committed to reforming

03:59.266 --> 04:00.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our health care system.

04:00.900 --> 04:02.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You're going to see
that process take place.

04:02.933 --> 04:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're not going to get ahead
of the legislative process.

04:05.333 --> 04:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We expect there to be some
changes, but we expect the
principles and main pillars of

04:11.800 --> 04:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the health care bill as it
exists to remain the same.

04:14.400 --> 04:18.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Several key
Republican senators said today
they probably cannot support the

04:18.366 --> 04:19.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
House bill.

04:19.966 --> 04:23.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
President Trump has
lost his second nominee
for Army secretary.

04:23.266 --> 04:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Green withdrew today,
saying -- quote - - "false and
misleading attacks" made his

04:27.400 --> 04:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nomination a distraction.

04:29.433 --> 04:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He drew fire for saying that
being transgender is a disease,
and deploring -- quote -- "the

04:35.366 --> 04:38.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
indoctrination of Islam
in public schools."

04:38.633 --> 04:43.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president's initial nominee,
Vincent Viola, withdrew because
of financial entanglements.

04:43.400 --> 04:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Wall Street closed out
the week on the higher note.

04:46.500 --> 04:51.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 55 points to close
near 21007, the Nasdaq rose

04:51.200 --> 04:54.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
25 points, and the
S&amp;P 500 added nine.

04:54.600 --> 04:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the week, all three indexes
gained less than 1 percent.

04:58.766 --> 05:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Puerto Rico in bankruptcy --
we talk to the territory's

05:02.766 --> 05:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
governor; candidates make
their last appeals ahead
of a French election
with global consequences;

05:09.700 --> 05:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can South Sudan find a
way out of its brutal
civil war?; and much more.

05:19.266 --> 05:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Puerto Rico went over the
financial cliff this week.

05:27.466 --> 05:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. territory home to
more than three million people
essentially filed for bankruptcy

05:32.300 --> 05:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so it can restructure more
than $120 billion in debt
and pension obligations.

05:38.766 --> 05:41.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It would be the largest
municipal bankruptcy
in U.S. history.

05:41.433 --> 05:46.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It owes $72 billion to
creditors, many of whom
are angry they will
have to eat big losses

05:47.166 --> 05:49.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in bankruptcy court.

05:49.166 --> 05:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thousands of protesters took
to the streets this week as
the pain spreads throughout the

05:52.333 --> 05:54.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
island.

05:54.400 --> 05:58.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The government is reducing
public services, pensions are
likely to be cut, and, today,

05:58.200 --> 06:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it announced it will close
184 schools, forcing 27,000
students to find another school.

06:05.233 --> 06:10.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Its economy remains
mired in a slump, while
more than 45 percent of
the people there below

06:10.933 --> 06:12.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the poverty line.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Its governor, Ricardo Rossello,
joins me now from San Juan.

06:14.533 --> 06:16.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Governor, thank
for being with us.

06:16.533 --> 06:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is the argument that you're
going to be making in court
on why you should be allowed

06:19.233 --> 06:20.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to restructure your
financial obligations?

06:20.833 --> 06:22.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

06:22.866 --> 06:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICARDO ROSSELLO, Puerto Rico:
Well, what we asked, Hari,
was essentially to have the

06:25.500 --> 06:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
courts' protection, so that we
wouldn't be attacked by some
-- what we feel are frivolous

06:31.100 --> 06:33.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lawsuits.

06:33.500 --> 06:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have ensued a
conversation with different
creditors, and our hope
is that we can find

06:36.666 --> 06:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a consensual renegotiation
route based on the fiscal plan
that we have implemented and

06:43.433 --> 06:45.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's been certified
for Puerto Rico.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Well, how
much worse is it going to get?

06:48.000 --> 06:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is just a day after the
announcement and you're already
talking about cutting back

06:51.500 --> 06:53.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on schools.

06:53.533 --> 06:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What other public services
are you going to have
to tighten your belt on?

06:55.533 --> 06:57.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

06:57.533 --> 07:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICARDO ROSSELLO: Well, the
schools initiative was one that
was established for a couple

07:00.900 --> 07:03.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of months.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have just announced today
which schools are the ones
that were going to be closed

07:05.133 --> 07:07.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

07:07.166 --> 07:11.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This initiative, of course,
has some fiscal relief, but the
objective is for our children

07:11.066 --> 07:16.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to actually consolidate
and that we can get
more human resource to
give a better service

07:17.200 --> 07:18.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to the kids, to the
children of Puerto Rico.

07:18.733 --> 07:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What about the
$49 billion in pension payments?

07:21.666 --> 07:25.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that's the people
of Puerto Rico that have
been paying into this.

07:25.500 --> 07:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are they likely to see?

07:26.866 --> 07:28.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

07:28.933 --> 07:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICARDO ROSSELLO: Well, we're
working on a budget right
now, and part of the strategy

07:32.233 --> 07:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we have ensued on the
fiscal plan is a pay-go system,
so that we're going to make

07:38.533 --> 07:43.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sure those pension
recipients get the funding.

07:46.266 --> 07:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, there's still a discussion
with the fiscal oversight plan
on how those cuts are going

07:49.633 --> 07:51.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to ensue.

07:51.566 --> 07:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our proposal was that it's
supposed to be on a progressive
scale, so that those that

07:57.733 --> 08:01.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are most vulnerable, those
that receive less than $2,000
in pensions, will actually not

08:03.700 --> 08:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get a cut, and those that
receive higher will start
getting a progressive
cut on their pension.

08:10.100 --> 08:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Governor,
I know Puerto Rico is home to
you and it's home to the people

08:12.033 --> 08:14.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who live there.

08:14.100 --> 08:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I have got to ask, how
can you keep your people
from leaving the island?

08:17.200 --> 08:19.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Right now, you have
unemployment at 12 percent.

08:19.166 --> 08:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have lost 10 percent of your
population in the last 10 years.

08:22.200 --> 08:25.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have lost 20 percent of the
jobs that are on the island.

08:25.400 --> 08:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If I was a resident of Puerto
Rico, why wouldn't I just pick
up and move to Florida or Texas

08:31.266 --> 08:31.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or anywhere on the mainland?

08:31.800 --> 08:33.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

08:33.833 --> 08:36.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICARDO ROSSELLO: That's been
happening so far because we
haven't made the proper changes.

08:36.900 --> 08:39.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We haven't made the
changes to government.

08:39.533 --> 08:44.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Expenditures have gone
rampant in Puerto Rico, lack
of accountability, total
lack of accountability.

08:44.433 --> 08:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what we're proposing
right now is a complete
change in that direction now.

08:48.533 --> 08:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know there are going to be
some challenges during these
cuts and the right-sizing of

08:54.133 --> 08:56.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government.

08:56.266 --> 08:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The truth of the matter is that
we are being very aggressive, so
that we can lay the foundations

09:01.900 --> 09:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for investors to come to
Puerto Rico, for jobs to be
created, and for opportunities

09:04.900 --> 09:06.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to ensue.

09:06.866 --> 09:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And our objective, again, is
for Puerto Rico, for the people
of Puerto Rico who want to

09:12.333 --> 09:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stay here, for them to have
the opportunity to stay here.

09:14.766 --> 09:17.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, there's one last
thing we need to point out.

09:17.866 --> 09:22.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it is a fact that Puerto
Rico is a colonial territory
of the United States.

09:22.166 --> 09:27.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This puts us in a very
significant disadvantage
to all of the other
states and to all of the

09:27.066 --> 09:29.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
other American citizens.

09:29.166 --> 09:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As a matter of comparative,
the U.S. citizens, the Puerto
Ricans that live in the United

09:35.400 --> 09:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States have much better incomes,
more than twice as much,
participate in the labor force

09:41.700 --> 09:45.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of greater scales, have
better results in the
education system and so forth.

09:47.400 --> 09:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the one key difference
is that Puerto Rico is
a colonial territory.

09:53.100 --> 09:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't have representation.

09:54.766 --> 09:57.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We have a difficult time
getting funding from
the federal government.

09:57.900 --> 10:02.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, this is another
critical component
that we need to change.

10:02.233 --> 10:06.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So,
in the meantime, as your
population continues to
move to the mainland,

10:06.733 --> 10:09.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
your tax base shrinks, which
only compounds this problem.

10:09.966 --> 10:10.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

10:10.966 --> 10:11.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RICARDO ROSSELLO: Right.

10:11.966 --> 10:13.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I agree.

10:13.500 --> 10:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we're trying our best to
develop sort of strategies.

10:17.100 --> 10:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have already turned into law
a labor reform law that will
allow for more opportunities

10:23.266 --> 10:25.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to ensue.

10:25.166 --> 10:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have also established a
permits law that will facilitate
permits in Puerto Rico.

10:31.400 --> 10:35.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are about to roll out a
comprehensive tax reform that
will enhance the base and will

10:36.666 --> 10:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reduce the rates in Puerto Rico.

10:38.933 --> 10:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And energy has been a big
challenge in Puerto Rico.

10:41.600 --> 10:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are pushing very aggressively
with a comprehensive agenda, so
that we can collaborate with the

10:48.000 --> 10:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
private sector and reduce
a lot of the costs.

10:50.133 --> 10:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Your debt
has been tax-free, which made
it very, very sought after for

10:55.533 --> 10:57.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
municipal bond
funds, 401(k) funds.

10:57.500 --> 11:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you say to U.S.
taxpayers who have helped --
they kind of put their faith in

11:02.466 --> 11:03.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your future.

11:03.966 --> 11:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What happens if their retirement
funds suffer because of this?

11:06.300 --> 11:08.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

11:08.366 --> 11:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICARDO ROSSELLO: Listen, I
just arrived to this position
a little over a hundred days

11:10.833 --> 11:12.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ago.

11:12.866 --> 11:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am 38 years old, and I want to
live in Puerto Rico and I want
to create a path forward for

11:17.300 --> 11:19.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
growth.

11:19.366 --> 11:23.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I realize that have come at the
most challenging times to become
governor, but I want to push

11:24.733 --> 11:26.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
things forward.

11:26.700 --> 11:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know that, with clear
leadership, with a clear path
forward, understanding that the

11:30.366 --> 11:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
times are tough and that there
are great challenges, if we put
a step in the right direction, I

11:37.400 --> 11:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think we can push forward for
a better Puerto Rico and, of
course, renegotiation efforts

11:44.566 --> 11:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with different creditors,
so that it is something
that is reasonable
for them and something

11:49.133 --> 11:51.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that is reasonable for us.

11:51.300 --> 11:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What's been
your most recent conversation
with the Trump administration?

11:53.400 --> 11:55.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Just recently, the
president tweeted out.

11:55.166 --> 11:57.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It didn't seem very supportive
of a bailout for Puerto Rico.

11:57.566 --> 12:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I know you met with the
treasury secretary in February.

12:00.333 --> 12:02.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What's been the last
thing that you agree on?

12:02.433 --> 12:04.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

12:04.533 --> 12:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICARDO ROSSELLO: So, we
met with the secretary of
health and human services.

12:07.933 --> 12:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We met with the administrator
of CMS, and we actually got
a letter supporting what our

12:15.066 --> 12:17.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
claim was for Puerto Rico.

12:17.066 --> 12:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The secretary stated that Puerto
Rico needed $900 million to
have a path forward, to have

12:24.800 --> 12:26.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
some runway.

12:26.433 --> 12:28.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not a bailout.

12:28.466 --> 12:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's actually the moneys that
were assigned to Puerto Rico
and that we need to have a

12:34.166 --> 12:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
system that actually works.

12:36.733 --> 12:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're already cutting, mind
you, over $300 million in health
care expenditures over the

12:42.900 --> 12:44.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coming years.

12:44.466 --> 12:46.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So we're putting our part.

12:46.566 --> 12:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the health care system over
here collapses because we have
a lack of funding, the cost

12:51.933 --> 12:55.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to the U.S. taxpayer
base is much higher.

12:57.733 --> 13:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For every dollar that is spent
here in Puerto Rico for a
patient, all of the states and

13:02.200 --> 13:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the federal government would
have to pay $4 for that.

13:04.200 --> 13:07.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So this is not a
bailout by any means.

13:07.700 --> 13:09.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's reasonable ask.

13:09.833 --> 13:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's what's fair for Puerto
Rico, and we're doing so in
a context where we're already

13:14.833 --> 13:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
making changes, we're already
cutting costs, and we would
prevent much more costs on the

13:21.200 --> 13:23.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
state level and on the
federal level if we do this.

13:23.266 --> 13:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Governor of Puerto Rico Ricardo
Rossello, thank you for joining

13:25.733 --> 13:26.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

13:26.733 --> 13:28.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RICARDO ROSSELLO:
Thank you so much.

13:30.100 --> 13:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the most
closely watched presidential
election in France in decades,

13:41.466 --> 13:43.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
voters head to the
polls this Sunday.

13:43.500 --> 13:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the second round run-off
between centrist Emmanuel Macron
and far-right leader Marine

13:47.266 --> 13:48.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Le Pen.

13:48.733 --> 13:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Special correspondent
Malcolm Brabant is there.

13:50.733 --> 13:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The candidates
spent their final day of
campaigning in vastly different

13:54.433 --> 13:56.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
places.

13:56.433 --> 13:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Centrist and heavy favorite
Emmanuel Macron strolled around
the small town of Rodez in

13:59.933 --> 14:01.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the southwest of France.

14:01.533 --> 14:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But he told a local radio
station he's not relaxing.

14:04.333 --> 14:08.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EMMANUEL MACRON, French
Presidential Candidate
(through translator):
I know the French men

14:08.066 --> 14:10.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and women, and you don't
dictate their choices.

14:10.700 --> 14:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So until the last minute, they
can decide, react, change.

14:14.100 --> 14:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So one must remain concentrated.

14:16.700 --> 14:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: To the
north, far-right candidate
Marine Le Pen got a
hostile reception outside

14:21.166 --> 14:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the famed Reims Cathedral.

14:23.533 --> 14:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later, she tweeted: "Monsieur
Macron's supporters act
with violence everywhere,
even in a symbolic

14:28.066 --> 14:29.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and sacred place.

14:29.300 --> 14:30.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No dignity."

14:30.766 --> 14:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And in an interview in Paris,
she took aim at her rival.

14:34.033 --> 14:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARINE LE PEN, French
Presidential Candidate
(through translator): Mr.
Macron is the candidate

14:37.900 --> 14:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the elites, he is the
candidate of the oligarchy,
he is the candidate of the big

14:42.266 --> 14:44.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
private interests.

14:44.333 --> 14:47.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Macron
has been buoyed this
week by an endorsement
from former President

14:47.266 --> 14:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obama and a solid performance
in Wednesday's bruising debate.

14:51.633 --> 14:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Le Pen's anti-immigrant
National Front has kept
pressing its case in places like

14:56.133 --> 14:57.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Yonne Valley.

14:57.500 --> 15:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here, the Front is
preaching to the converted.

15:00.100 --> 15:04.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Former soldier Pascal
Roi supports Le Pen's
pledge to crack down
on Islamist militants.

15:04.933 --> 15:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PASCAL ROI, France
(through translator):
Regarding terrorism, she's
promised to expel people

15:11.533 --> 15:14.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
flagged as threats to
national security and
dual nationals as well.

15:14.733 --> 15:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is going to remove a burden
so we can keep a better eye
on the rest of the population.

15:18.800 --> 15:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Most of those
attending this final campaign
gathering were either seniors

15:24.400 --> 15:25.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or middle-aged.

15:25.333 --> 15:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There were no people of color.

15:27.900 --> 15:32.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The youngest voter was student
nurse Marie Buzetti, who
favors Le Pen's plan to follow

15:32.366 --> 15:34.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Britain out of the
European Union.

15:34.433 --> 15:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIE BUZETTI, France (through
translator): Today, we need
to regain our independence.

15:41.400 --> 15:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, we are the puppets
of the European Union
and it needs to change.

15:44.833 --> 15:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The National
Front has been accused of
preying on fears and whipping up

15:49.500 --> 15:51.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hatred.

15:51.600 --> 15:55.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Parliamentary candidate
Ludovic Vigreux didn't
hold back, warning that
Sharia law might one

15:55.400 --> 15:58.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

"We need Marine," he said.

16:01.133 --> 16:02.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
France needs Marine.

16:02.233 --> 16:03.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And Marine needs you."

16:03.633 --> 16:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As you can hear, they're
chanting "Marine for president."

16:09.600 --> 16:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And here in the countryside,
she may do very well.

16:12.533 --> 16:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But nationally it's not
looking good for her at all.

16:14.933 --> 16:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All the opinion polls suggest
that Emmanuel Macron is going
to win by a majority of 60

16:20.666 --> 16:22.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
percent to 40 percent.

16:22.566 --> 16:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Yonne Valley is
one of the poorest
districts of rural France.

The lack of job prospects
have forced many

Le Pen's Frexit plans
worry marketing executive
David De Silva, and so
he will vote for the

16:34.666 --> 16:37.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pro-European candidate
Emmanuel Macron.

16:37.133 --> 16:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID DE SILVA, France (through
translator): We have access to
everything, a great marketplace,

16:44.900 --> 16:47.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and it would be a
shame to lose that.

16:47.233 --> 16:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, we obviously can't
live without Europe.

16:49.900 --> 16:53.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: One of the
most important factors in this
election is the large number

16:53.500 --> 16:55.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of undecided voters.

16:55.233 --> 16:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If millions abstain, it
could benefit Marine Le Pen.

16:59.900 --> 17:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Restaurant worker Joanna
Thurloy voted for left-winger
Jean-Luc Melenchon in the first

17:04.833 --> 17:08.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
round and now faces
a major dilemma.

17:08.100 --> 17:13.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOANNA THURLOY, France
(through translator):
I don't feel understood
by either side, because,

17:16.466 --> 17:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Emmanuel Macron,
it's all about capitalism
and speculation.

17:21.166 --> 17:25.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Marine Le Pen, it's
her family history of
being on the extreme right.

17:25.066 --> 17:27.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have already
been through this.

17:27.600 --> 17:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: There's
an undertone of defiance
and maybe even desperation
amongst the Front

17:32.133 --> 17:34.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
supporters as they
chant, "We will win."

17:34.933 --> 17:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In order for Le Pen to enter
the presidential palace, there
will have to be a political

17:38.833 --> 17:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
surprise of Brexit or
Donald Trump proportions.

17:41.933 --> 17:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the mantra to
which parliamentary candidate
Julien Odoul is clinging.

17:46.300 --> 17:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIEN ODOUL, Parliamentary
Candidate (through translator):
Because she's the only one who

17:50.533 --> 17:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
speaks to the French, the only
one who speaks to the forgotten
ones, all those French who've

17:54.833 --> 17:56.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been abandoned for decades.

17:56.866 --> 18:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: France's
national anthem, written in
the 18th century, is all about

18:02.266 --> 18:04.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
conflict.

18:04.266 --> 18:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If Marine Le Pen upsets the
odds and wins on Sunday, France
and the European Union will

18:07.766 --> 18:11.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
face a major upheaval.

18:11.400 --> 18:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the pollsters believe French
voters want stability and will
follow the Dutch in rejecting

18:19.300 --> 18:20.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
right-wing nationalism.

18:20.900 --> 18:24.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Malcolm Brabant

18:24.233 --> 18:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Late today,
Emmanuel Macron's campaign said
they have been hacked and the

18:31.133 --> 18:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
internal documents have been
posted online just hours before
voters head to the polls.

18:34.100 --> 18:39.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It issued a statement saying it
won't tolerate the undermining
of democracy's vital interests.

18:50.100 --> 18:52.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Stay with us.

18:52.133 --> 18:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
empowering diabetes patients to
control their own health; Mark

18:55.366 --> 19:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Shields and Michael Gerson
weigh in on the GOP health care
plan; and a college president's

19:00.100 --> 19:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
plea for protecting free speech.

19:02.666 --> 19:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But first: All this week,
we have brought you reports
from South Sudan on the roots

19:09.566 --> 19:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of its conflict, the famine
there, and the use of
rape as a weapon of war.

19:13.233 --> 19:17.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And from neighboring Uganda,
we met South Sudanese refugees
fleeing for a better life.

19:17.900 --> 19:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tonight, we ask, what will
it take to end the violence?

19:21.366 --> 19:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we turn to Nii Akuetteh.

19:23.733 --> 19:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has led a number of nonprofit
organizations that promoted
democracy and good governance

19:27.533 --> 19:28.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Africa.

19:28.666 --> 19:30.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He is now an
independent analyst.

19:30.800 --> 19:35.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Brian Adeba, he is
the associate director
for policy at The Enough
Project, which advocates

19:36.400 --> 19:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for accountability for genocide
and atrocities in Africa.

19:38.400 --> 19:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Nii Akuetteh, the
world's youngest country,
how did we get here so fast?

19:41.833 --> 19:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NII AKUETTEH, Independent
Analyst: I think it's because,
in their fight for independence,

19:48.766 --> 19:52.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the rest of the world focused
on who they were fighting,
Khartoum, and I think we didn't

19:54.233 --> 19:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pay enough attention to the
rivalries and the dissensions
and the fault lines within

19:59.133 --> 20:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the South Sudanese leadership.

20:01.700 --> 20:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And also, while they
took control of the new
country with the rules to
be written and resources

20:08.533 --> 20:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and rivalries, I also do think
that the death of John Garang,
who everything says was an

20:15.600 --> 20:20.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
outstanding leader, his
death in a helicopter
crash also led to that.

20:20.466 --> 20:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Finally, I think the world
needs to pay more attention
to what's going on.

20:24.333 --> 20:26.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
Anything to add?

20:26.000 --> 20:29.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BRIAN ADEBA, The Enough
Project: Well, indeed
what he said is true.

20:29.733 --> 20:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At independence, a small
group of people in the ruling
party, a small group of elites

20:34.400 --> 20:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hijacked government and all its
institutions, and ensued on a
corruption spree that created

20:40.666 --> 20:43.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a lot of dissension
within the party.

20:43.800 --> 20:48.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ultimately, in the end,
rivalries started appearing
in the party because
of this corruption.

20:52.933 --> 20:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The state became the most
prized asset that everyone
was vying for control of.

20:57.800 --> 21:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Unfortunately, for the ruling
party itself, because it had
incapacitated the ability of

21:04.800 --> 21:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
institutions to mitigate this
conflict, in the end, the
conflict began to be expressed

21:10.933 --> 21:12.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in violent terms.

21:12.166 --> 21:14.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's where
we are right now.

21:14.200 --> 21:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So,
stopping the conflict is the
first priority for everyone.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why hasn't worked?

21:17.533 --> 21:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why hasn't it worked so
far, whatever we have tried?

21:20.233 --> 21:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NII AKUETTEH: I think one
of the methods, one of the
measures that people have talked

21:24.366 --> 21:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about that have not actually
implemented is stopping the
flow of arms into the country.

21:30.566 --> 21:33.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's like pouring
gasoline on fire.

21:33.033 --> 21:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And various international
players behind the
scenes are reluctant,
both in the region and

21:39.233 --> 21:40.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
then globally.

21:40.433 --> 21:41.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think that's
one of the things.

21:41.933 --> 21:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the other thing is
that not enough pressure.

21:44.033 --> 21:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, the people who are doing
-- the leadership doing the
fighting, they have not suffered

21:50.466 --> 21:52.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
from it.

21:52.566 --> 21:56.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think one other aspect of
the fighting that needs to be
stressed is, heartbreakingly,

21:58.400 --> 22:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it has become ethnicized,
so that ordinary people
are being killed.

22:01.233 --> 22:02.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are ethnic militias.

22:02.966 --> 22:07.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So I think stopping it
will be -- is going to
be quite a challenge.

22:07.066 --> 22:09.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRIAN ADEBA: It's true.

22:09.133 --> 22:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The missing element here is
leverage, what can be done to
exert leverage, so that the

22:15.400 --> 22:17.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
parties in the conflict
change their calculations
towards peace.

22:17.900 --> 22:19.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's been missing.

22:19.866 --> 22:23.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have suggested that
targeted pressures, targeted
sanctions are essential, an arms

22:24.766 --> 22:27.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
embargo.

22:27.333 --> 22:30.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Targeted sanctions are
essential because most of
these transactions happen
in the U.S. dollars.

22:32.766 --> 22:36.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that gives the U.S.
jurisdiction to act
within the toolkit here,
the precious toolkit

22:37.466 --> 22:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
available to
policy-makers in the U.S.

22:39.733 --> 22:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are measures that can
be enacted to trace these
assets, to seize these assets

22:46.733 --> 22:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in some aspects, and to send
a message to the perpetrators
of this conflict that there

22:49.833 --> 22:51.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is a price to pay for war.

22:51.966 --> 22:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is that the
most effective way to do it,
because the U.S. dollar is the

22:54.800 --> 22:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sort of currency of the day?

22:56.933 --> 23:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NII AKUETTEH: Oh, I agree
totally, because also ,on the
global stage, the U.S. looms

23:01.833 --> 23:03.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
large.

23:03.733 --> 23:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the U.S. was a
leader in supporting the
independence of South Sudan.

23:09.700 --> 23:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But even if you take a more
narrow view of U.S.' own
national interests, it's always

23:16.033 --> 23:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been said that ungoverned
spaces breed terrorism,
which eventually can
come to affect the U.S.

23:20.533 --> 23:24.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, frankly, when I
look down the road, this
is an American issue.

23:24.600 --> 23:29.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, the fighters are
South Sudanese, the
victims are South Sudanese.

23:29.166 --> 23:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it should concern Americans.

23:31.233 --> 23:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, for one, think
that Congress needs to make
its voice strong and push the

23:35.333 --> 23:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State Department to work
with various organizations,
because, otherwise,
it will get worse, and

23:42.300 --> 23:46.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that -- we will then see that
it's beginning to affect the
American interests in ways that

23:46.800 --> 23:48.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cannot be missed.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Brian, as
he points out, the U.S. was
instrumental in trying to birth

23:50.300 --> 23:52.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this nation.

23:52.700 --> 23:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But is this administration
going to -- are there
any indications that
they're going to

23:55.300 --> 23:57.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pay as close attention to this?

23:57.366 --> 24:01.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BRIAN ADEBA: Well,
I'm quite optimistic.

24:01.400 --> 24:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we look back at the
statements -- the statement
that the U.S. ambassador
to the United Nations,

24:08.366 --> 24:12.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nikki Haley, uttered a few
weeks ago, it was the very first
time that a member of the Trump

24:14.133 --> 24:17.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
administration had come out
very strongly on South Sudan.

24:17.766 --> 24:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She chided how her
counterparts in the Security
Council for inaction on
South Sudan and suggested

24:24.800 --> 24:29.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that perhaps it's time
now to broach or examine
the possibility of an
arms embargo to stop

24:31.300 --> 24:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the carnage that is going on.

24:33.500 --> 24:38.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She also called out
the president of South
Sudan for continuing to
perpetuate the conflict

24:40.300 --> 24:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and also the other
political elements
involved in this conflict.

24:45.733 --> 24:49.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, that's encouraging.

24:49.166 --> 24:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From a multilateral perspective,
an arms embargo is very, very
essential, and the U.S. has

24:55.266 --> 24:56.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a lot of room and
opportunity to use that.

24:56.766 --> 24:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is that the
best way for us to move forward?

24:58.833 --> 25:01.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is it through a body
like the United Nations?

25:01.366 --> 25:03.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Is there something the
United States should
be doing independent?

25:03.933 --> 25:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NII AKUETTEH: I think so.

25:06.733 --> 25:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The region original organization
IGAD, Sudan, Uganda, Kenya,
Ethiopia, all of them have

25:15.400 --> 25:17.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
played a great role.

25:17.033 --> 25:21.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, in fact, up until
some time ago, they
played a positive role.

25:21.100 --> 25:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But now, in fact, the reason
that there has been no push on
the leadership in South Sudan

25:25.433 --> 25:28.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is because IGAD
itself is divided.

25:28.033 --> 25:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And within IGAD, what I'm
saying is, the U.S., apart from
pressure like Brian has said, on

25:35.433 --> 25:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Sudanese leaders, South
Sudanese leaders, to also put
pressure on the countries in the

25:40.900 --> 25:42.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
region.

25:42.366 --> 25:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, U.S. relations with
Khartoum is warming up.

25:45.566 --> 25:47.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It has good relations
with Uganda.

25:47.500 --> 25:49.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It has good relations
with Ethiopia.

25:49.033 --> 25:51.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It has good
relations with Kenya.

25:51.066 --> 25:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I, for one, think the U.S.
should also put pressure on
these countries to come to

25:57.500 --> 26:00.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a meeting of the
minds, because they are
backing different sides.

26:00.200 --> 26:04.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All
right, Nii Akuetteh, Brian
Adeba, thank you both.

26:04.300 --> 26:09.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NII AKUETTEH: Thank
you for having us.

26:13.200 --> 26:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: More than
eight million Americans suffer
from diabetes, and more than

26:19.633 --> 26:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
$320 billion are spent every
year treating the disease.

26:23.633 --> 26:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But an innovative program
in San Diego is trying to
improve health and reduce those

26:27.266 --> 26:31.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
costs by encouraging better
self-management of the disease.

26:31.266 --> 26:34.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Special correspondent
Cat Wise has our report.

26:34.433 --> 26:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Fifty-one year old
Alma Ayala is not a doctor
or a nurse, but she is on the

26:41.766 --> 26:45.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
front lines of the diabetes
epidemic in her community.

26:45.766 --> 26:50.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's a peer educator for a
program called Project Dulce,
which works with people who

26:50.266 --> 26:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have diabetes or are at risk of
developing the chronic illness.

26:56.866 --> 26:59.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Her classes are
part informational,
part support group.

26:59.733 --> 27:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ayala says the goal of the
program, which has been held
up as a national model, is for

27:06.133 --> 27:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people to feel empowered
about changing their health.

27:08.500 --> 27:12.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's something she didn't
feel 30 years ago when she
was first diagnosed with the

27:12.900 --> 27:14.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
disease.

27:14.100 --> 27:15.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALMA AYALA, Project
Dulce: I was devastated.

27:15.500 --> 27:17.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I didn't want to hear
the word diabetes.

27:17.633 --> 27:22.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I felt that my life was
done, that I was signing
a certificate of death.

27:22.300 --> 27:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Here in San Diego
County, nearly half the adult
population has pre-diabetes

27:28.400 --> 27:30.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and about 8 percent
have diabetes.

27:30.400 --> 27:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a disease that affects
all socioeconomic groups and
races, but the Latino community

27:35.133 --> 27:37.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has been disproportionately
impacted.

27:37.766 --> 27:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the population
Project Dulce has been targeting
for the past 20 years.

27:41.900 --> 27:46.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALMA AYALA: There are lots
of barriers for the Latino
community, language, insurance.

27:48.333 --> 27:51.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sometimes, doctors don't have
the time to spend with them.

27:51.466 --> 27:56.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the classes that we provide
is that extra support, working
together with a clinical

27:57.766 --> 27:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
team to help our
participants stay healthy.

27:59.866 --> 28:04.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: The program
is scattered throughout
12 clinics in Latino
neighborhoods throughout

28:04.300 --> 28:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
San Diego County and was
designed by several local health
care organizations, including

28:09.000 --> 28:11.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Scripps Whittier
Diabetes Institute.

28:11.633 --> 28:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dr. Athena Philis-Tsimikas
is an endocrinologist
who oversees the program.

28:16.200 --> 28:18.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

28:18.233 --> 28:20.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ATHENA PHILIS-TSIMIKAS, Scripps
Whittier Diabetes Institute:
This is a disease in which you

28:20.400 --> 28:23.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have to do a number of
management components,
not only every day,
but many times a day.

28:28.033 --> 28:32.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's not that easy to expect
someone to remember to test
their blood sugar, take their

28:32.200 --> 28:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pill, to go out and take that
walk, to have exactly the
right meal on the table all the

28:39.133 --> 28:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
time to take care of this.

28:41.233 --> 28:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't see any lows there, so
I don't think we have to worry
that you might dip down too

28:44.700 --> 28:46.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
low.

28:46.700 --> 28:49.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: To help patients,
a team is set up at each
clinic with a physician, nurse

28:49.666 --> 28:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
practitioner, a dietitian
and multiple peer
counselors like Ayala who
come from the communities

28:55.833 --> 28:57.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they serve and also
have the disease.

28:57.533 --> 28:59.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

28:59.633 --> 29:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ATHENA PHILIS-TSIMIKAS: If you
can train these other people
and professionals to help you

29:02.500 --> 29:07.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
do the other components
that take longer, but
are still absolutely
necessary, then you're

29:07.033 --> 29:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
using your team to work very
synergistically to deliver
everything that patient needs in

29:11.466 --> 29:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
order to improve their care.

29:13.133 --> 29:17.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: The program
is now adding another
layer, technology.

29:17.033 --> 29:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last year, Tsimikas conducted
a study to see if patients
receiving daily text messages

29:23.200 --> 29:25.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
could manage their
disease even better.

29:25.166 --> 29:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Artist Gloria Favela-Rocha
was one of the participants.

29:28.766 --> 29:33.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's a muralist who does large
scale works for hospitals,
schools and private clients.

29:35.733 --> 29:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She says, before the study,
she often forgot to regularly
check her glucose levels.

29:39.666 --> 29:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Project Dulce changed that.

29:41.666 --> 29:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GLORIA FAVELA-ROCHA, Diabetes
Patient: The text message would
come every day at the same

29:43.733 --> 29:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time, so if I would lose track
of where I was during my day,
I would hear it ring, and

29:50.066 --> 29:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so I would start checking
my blood sugars, send
in my result right away.

29:54.066 --> 29:59.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would send me back a
message according to whatever
my result was, like good job,

30:01.000 --> 30:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or maybe you need to
eat something that has a
little more protein today.

30:03.733 --> 30:06.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, it was just very --
it was very convenient.

30:06.366 --> 30:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Dr. Tsimikas' team
has also been studying the
effects of continuous glucose

30:11.200 --> 30:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
monitoring, which uses Bluetooth
technology to send results
to the patient and physician

30:16.800 --> 30:18.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in real time.

30:18.733 --> 30:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAGDALENA HERNANDEZ, Diabetes
Patient: This device is
reading my sugar levels.

30:21.033 --> 30:25.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: Magdalena
Hernandez wears a small
monitor on her stomach.

30:25.433 --> 30:27.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAGDALENA HERNANDEZ: I love it.

30:27.566 --> 30:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I love it because I don't have
to prick my finger many times
during the day, and it alerts

30:33.533 --> 30:35.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
me when my blood sugar
goes high or goes low.

30:35.733 --> 30:38.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAT WISE: And what happens
if your levels go above 200?

30:38.766 --> 30:40.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What do you do?

30:40.866 --> 30:44.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAGDALENA HERNANDEZ: I grab
a bottle of water, and I get
up and walk for five minutes.

30:47.066 --> 30:52.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Thirty miles away,
Dr. Tsimikas is also able to
keep tabs on Hernandez's levels.

30:53.433 --> 30:55.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

30:55.600 --> 30:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ATHENA PHILIS-TSIMIKAS: This
is just over the last three
hours, that she probably ate

30:57.133 --> 31:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
breakfast here, it went
up, and is now declining.

31:00.133 --> 31:05.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: This technology
has been on the market for
several years, but has not been

31:06.900 --> 31:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
widely used because
of cost and a somewhat
complicated user interface.

31:09.833 --> 31:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Tsimikas says those barriers
are being reduced and she
predicts it will have a big

31:14.533 --> 31:15.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
impact on health.

31:15.733 --> 31:17.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

31:17.800 --> 31:20.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ATHENA PHILIS-TSIMIKAS:
It is reinforcement to
both the patient and
to the provider that's

31:20.100 --> 31:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
helping to make
recommendations on whether
this is working or not.

31:23.566 --> 31:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's really going
to revolutionize the way we
can take care of patients.

31:28.266 --> 31:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Dr. Tsimikas says
the objective is to prevent
the serious complications that

31:35.566 --> 31:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can accompany diabetes,
including blindness,
kidney failure, amputations
or heart failure.

31:41.633 --> 31:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAGDALENA HERNANDEZ: I really
love the black beans and
all the vegetables in here.

31:44.700 --> 31:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: According to studies
conducted by the University
of California, San Diego, and

31:49.100 --> 31:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
elsewhere, Project Dulce has
helped lower patients' blood
sugar and cholesterol levels,

31:53.566 --> 31:58.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
while at the same time
reduced the number of
costly hospitalizations
and emergency room

31:58.333 --> 32:00.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
visits.

32:00.900 --> 32:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While some elements of
the program are being
used in other communities,
Project Dulce stands

32:04.266 --> 32:06.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
out for its
comprehensive approach.

32:06.366 --> 32:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, why aren't similar
initiatives being rolled out in
every neighborhood in America?

32:10.733 --> 32:12.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

32:12.833 --> 32:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ATHENA PHILIS-TSIMIKAS: It's
probably the way we reimburse
for each of these components.

32:15.033 --> 32:17.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's probably
the biggest hurdle.

32:17.266 --> 32:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We traditionally have reimbursed
only for physician visits.

32:20.800 --> 32:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we could find a way to
actually reimburse for each of
these components, it may be more

32:25.200 --> 32:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sustainable for the future.

32:27.400 --> 32:31.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Or maybe we simply reimburse
based on our success.

32:31.966 --> 32:36.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you are successful in
achieving better outcomes,
maybe then you pay for what led

32:38.800 --> 32:40.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to those better outcomes.

32:40.866 --> 32:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: In the coming weeks,
Project Dulce will begin a new
study of patients that combines

32:47.966 --> 32:51.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
text messaging with
continuous glucose
monitoring and a wireless
pill box that will alert a

32:52.866 --> 32:56.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nurse if a patient isn't
taking his or her medication.

32:58.400 --> 33:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
From San Diego, I'm Cat
Wise for the "PBS NewsHour."

33:04.900 --> 33:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now to the
analysis of Shields and Gerson.

33:12.800 --> 33:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist
Mark Shields and Washington
Post columnist Michael Gerson.

33:16.633 --> 33:18.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
David Brooks is away.

33:18.666 --> 33:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's start with this
little party that was on
the Rose Garden yesterday.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The beer cases were brought in.

33:22.533 --> 33:24.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There was a
celebratory atmosphere.

33:24.633 --> 33:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump rightfully
brought the House Republicans
there after they pushed their

33:28.966 --> 33:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
health care repeal and replace
bill through the House.

33:31.233 --> 33:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How did they manage to do this?

33:33.233 --> 33:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, first of
all, the event itself, the only
thing more -- or as unseemly

33:40.633 --> 33:45.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the self-congratulatory
bus trip to the White House --
it was like after you had won

33:47.600 --> 33:51.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an office softball game and
you break out the beer -- were
the Democrats on the House

33:52.633 --> 33:56.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
floor taunting bye,
bye, bye to Republicans.

33:56.833 --> 33:58.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is trivializing
a moral issue.

33:58.900 --> 34:03.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this -- to me, that's what
health care is, whether in
fact it is a right of a citizen

34:05.166 --> 34:07.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in this country to health care.

34:07.166 --> 34:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it's a serious
question, whether we share our
benefits and share our burdens,

34:10.833 --> 34:15.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or whether in fact
we're all in this alone.

34:15.133 --> 34:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what the House passed
yesterday was something
that just had to be done.

34:22.166 --> 34:25.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, otherwise, you're
staring into the abyss of
total political failure.

34:27.533 --> 34:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans had gone through
four elections where the one
unanimous position they had

34:30.633 --> 34:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all taken as a party
was the repeal of Barack
Obama's Affordable Care Act.

34:37.700 --> 34:41.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Sixty-two times, they
courageously and boldly
voted to do, knowing it
didn't count, knowing

34:42.300 --> 34:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it wasn't going to go anywhere.

34:44.333 --> 34:48.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The 63rd time was
tougher, because what
they passed yesterday
has serious implications

34:51.800 --> 34:55.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
for them politically
and certainly for the
people of the country.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MICHAEL GERSON: It's
a great moral issue.

34:57.200 --> 35:00.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But this passed because
Paul Ryan got granular.

35:00.600 --> 35:05.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He identified who he needed
and what they wanted and
essentially gave it to them.

35:06.733 --> 35:09.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, moderates get
the high-risk fund.

35:09.733 --> 35:13.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Freedom Caucus
gets the waivers.

35:13.700 --> 35:17.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He just put on the table
what he needed to get
across the finish line.

35:17.466 --> 35:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, that doesn't make it a good
bill or even a coherent bill.

35:20.900 --> 35:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think the trust here is
that Ryan will hand this off
to McConnell, McConnell has

35:27.900 --> 35:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some rational process that the
House can no longer produce,
because of its own internal

35:31.333 --> 35:36.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
dynamics, and that they
might get an improved
product at the end.

35:38.433 --> 35:41.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The other thing that's
worth noting that is
really fascinating is
the almost absence of

35:42.933 --> 35:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
presidential leadership
in producing this victory.

35:45.133 --> 35:47.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He was really not very
engaged or involved.

35:47.700 --> 35:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paul Ryan is learning to live
without the normal role of the
president in the legislative

35:53.900 --> 35:54.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
process.

35:54.900 --> 35:56.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it is unique, his absence.

35:56.566 --> 35:59.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So,
what happens by the time
it gets to the Senate?

35:59.566 --> 36:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nancy Pelosi has already
said, listen, this is the vote
that's going to be tattooed on

36:02.566 --> 36:04.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you come reelection time.

36:04.566 --> 36:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But more important, the Senate's
going to change it in some
way shape or form, if they

36:08.033 --> 36:09.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
move forward at all.

36:09.033 --> 36:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, they are.

36:10.400 --> 36:13.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Just one quick point
to Michael's point.

36:13.233 --> 36:18.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is the $8 billion
fig leaf -- and it was a fig
leaf -- that they're going to

36:20.100 --> 36:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cover people with a preexisting
condition, which was the
price to get Billy Long and

36:28.100 --> 36:33.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fred Upton, represents less
than one-fifth of 1 percent
of the cost of Medicaid.

36:36.733 --> 36:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not going to last
beyond a couple of months.

36:40.700 --> 36:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was just something that they
could go back and sell to their
own constituencies and for

36:46.433 --> 36:48.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their own purposes.

36:48.133 --> 36:49.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's meaningless.

36:49.366 --> 36:51.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But what's going to
happen in the Senate?

36:51.333 --> 36:53.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I will say this.

36:53.000 --> 36:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have just seen the high
watermark for this legislation.

36:57.833 --> 37:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every Republican in the
House who voted for it
will have to answer for it.

37:04.766 --> 37:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is a stand-alone
piece of it, whatever
happens in the Senate.

37:07.866 --> 37:09.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And nobody really knows.

37:09.966 --> 37:13.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are 11 Republican
governors, don't forget
- - and this is where
this starts to count

37:13.600 --> 37:18.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - who expanded, accepted the
Medicaid expansion, and who have
covered people in their state,

37:21.066 --> 37:26.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and from John Kasich, to
Rick Snyder in Michigan,
to Gary Herbert in
Utah, to Brian Sandoval

37:28.533 --> 37:30.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in Nevada, across the country.

37:30.600 --> 37:33.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so it's a different
dynamic in the Senate.

37:33.633 --> 37:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have got states represented
by senators like Rob Portman,
a traditional conservative,

37:40.266 --> 37:43.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
who is going to fight
for the preservation
of Medicaid expansion.

37:43.000 --> 37:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: The Senate is
acting pretty much from scratch.

37:47.366 --> 37:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're not going to the
House bill and building on it.

37:50.633 --> 37:52.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're taking away.

37:52.133 --> 37:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lamar Alexander has been charged
to produce their own approach.

37:55.500 --> 38:00.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There's a small group
of senators that is
kind of diverse, at
least within the caucus,

38:01.533 --> 38:03.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that is working on this.

38:03.500 --> 38:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Senator McConnell has
promised them some time for
deliberation, unlike the way the

38:08.066 --> 38:10.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
House passed this.

38:10.200 --> 38:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, the probably -- is exactly
what you're talking about.

38:14.033 --> 38:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Collins has already
announced she will not support
a bill that doesn't include

38:17.933 --> 38:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Planned Parenthood funding, OK?

38:20.500 --> 38:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The bill will not include
Planned Parenthood funding.

38:24.300 --> 38:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That means that
Republicans need 51 votes.

38:27.500 --> 38:32.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They have got a margin
of one in producing this
piece of legislation.

38:33.766 --> 38:36.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's no margin of
error for them here.

38:36.366 --> 38:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All
right, let's talk about
another Rose Garden event
that happened yesterday,

38:39.933 --> 38:43.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really kind of talking
about religion in
politics, and the Trump
administration bringing that

38:43.866 --> 38:46.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the fore.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He signed an executive order
easing an IRS rule limiting
political activity by houses

38:49.033 --> 38:51.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of worship.

38:51.066 --> 38:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was also on day that
President Trump proclaimed a
national day of prayer and had

38:53.600 --> 38:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a statement saying -- quote
-- "All human beings have the
right to practice their faith

38:57.433 --> 39:00.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in private and in
the public square."

39:00.333 --> 39:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The public square portion,
does that raise any concerns?

39:04.033 --> 39:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It doesn't to me,
and it apparently didn't to the
American Civil Liberties Union

39:09.600 --> 39:12.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
either.

39:12.266 --> 39:17.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I happen to believe that
this was a strict political
payoff, in symbolic terms, that

39:19.200 --> 39:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
evangelical white Christians
had been his most supporters;
81 percent of them voted

39:23.233 --> 39:25.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for him.

39:25.200 --> 39:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I, for one, will break
with liberal ranks and make the
case that America's original

39:31.766 --> 39:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sin existed until organized
religion, namely, the
American Methodists, the
Anglican evangelicals,

39:40.566 --> 39:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Quakers led the
fight to abolish slavery.

39:44.600 --> 39:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There wouldn't have been a civil
rights bill, legislation in
this country without the active

39:49.233 --> 39:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
involvement of Jewish, Catholic
and Protestant, particularly
black Protestant leadership,

39:56.066 --> 39:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so -- as well as peace movement.

39:59.333 --> 40:03.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, I'm not as concerned
about the involvement
in the public square.

40:03.333 --> 40:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump's religiosity
has always been
rather elusive to me.

40:08.933 --> 40:09.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

40:09.866 --> 40:11.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Sorry.

40:11.900 --> 40:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this a backdoor option or
a possibility where this could
be sort of Citizens United

40:15.700 --> 40:18.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2.0?

40:18.133 --> 40:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's just today build
the church of Mark
and Michael, totally
tax-exempt organizations,

40:23.533 --> 40:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
raise as much money as you
want, donate to whatever
political party you would like?

40:25.133 --> 40:28.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MICHAEL GERSON: Well,
I don't know if it
even accomplishes that.

40:28.233 --> 40:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, the Johnson amendment,
you know, I have never seen
anywhere, encountered someone

40:34.766 --> 40:38.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
complaining about
rigorous enforcement of
the Johnson amendment.

40:38.033 --> 40:40.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have been around
this a long time.

40:40.833 --> 40:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a nonexistent issue.

40:42.233 --> 40:45.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a solution in
search of a problem.

40:45.066 --> 40:46.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it is a sop.

40:46.433 --> 40:48.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is an empty symbol.

40:48.500 --> 40:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The problem here that we're
seeing more recently is not that
religion is hurting the public

40:54.633 --> 40:56.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
square too much.

40:56.566 --> 41:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's that politics is
undermining and invading the
credibility of religion itself.

41:03.433 --> 41:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People who support Donald
Trump, many of them were
people who said that
Bill Clinton's character

41:09.033 --> 41:12.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mattered more than
anything else.

41:12.033 --> 41:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And now they're embracing Trump.

41:14.333 --> 41:17.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And people are looking at this
and saying that this is a joke.

41:17.900 --> 41:21.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is hypocrisy.

41:21.033 --> 41:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so I think the risk here
is actually to religion.

41:24.933 --> 41:26.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: To
that point, I mean...

41:26.966 --> 41:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It's a good point.

41:28.900 --> 41:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On your point, yes, I am deeply
concerned, and have been,
and especially now that we

41:35.966 --> 41:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have got a smokescreen
of charitable religious
institutions being formed
basically for political

41:42.000 --> 41:44.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ends, and for partisan
political purpose.

41:44.800 --> 41:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what it amounts to in public
policy terms is, I'm making
a donation, a tax-deducted

41:52.100 --> 41:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
donation, for a political
purpose to support my political
cause or your political cause,

41:58.566 --> 42:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which I think is absolutely
wrong, and it's a corruption.

42:00.833 --> 42:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: I just haven't
seen much evidence of it.

42:02.633 --> 42:04.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
I don't know...

42:04.633 --> 42:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: We have certainly
seen -- we have seen phony,
bogus charitable foundations

42:08.133 --> 42:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
created for that purpose.

42:10.266 --> 42:12.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: I
don't socially if this
happens already, but
do you end up picking

42:12.533 --> 42:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your church a little bit
more because you know how
that church is going to vote?

42:15.833 --> 42:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm going to reveal my Hindu
roots here, but I thought
Jesus was an independent, not a

42:19.666 --> 42:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Democrat or a Republican.

42:20.900 --> 42:23.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MICHAEL GERSON: Well,
I think that's true.

42:23.133 --> 42:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whenever a pastor makes a
political statement, they're at
risk of alienating a portion of

42:30.233 --> 42:33.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
their congregation on
issues that have nothing
to do with religion, or
at least their judgment

42:35.366 --> 42:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is not particularly
sanctified on these issues.

42:39.800 --> 42:44.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, I would rather go to the
average bartender for political
advice than the average priest

42:46.733 --> 42:47.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or minister.

42:47.733 --> 42:49.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:49.866 --> 42:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: So, you know,
I think that they don't have
an expertise in many of these

42:53.033 --> 42:55.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issues.

42:55.200 --> 42:59.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that's up to laymen
in the church and that,
from the pulpit, there
needs to be fairness.

43:00.700 --> 43:01.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes,
all right, Michael
Gerson, Mark Shields.

43:01.966 --> 43:03.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: It's a
good point you make.

43:03.500 --> 43:04.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
All right, thank you.

43:04.500 --> 43:05.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

43:05.733 --> 43:06.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
Thank you very much.

43:06.666 --> 43:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you, Hari.

43:07.600 --> 43:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right.

43:10.033 --> 43:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tomorrow night here in
Washington, the prestigious
PEN/Faulkner Award for
Fiction will be given.

43:15.466 --> 43:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown talks with the
winning author, the latest in
our "NewsHour" Bookshelf series.

43:18.333 --> 43:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: An immigrant
couple from West Africa working
for a wealthy New York family

43:24.500 --> 43:26.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as the great recession
is about to hit in 2008.

43:26.866 --> 43:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The novel "Behold the Dreamers"
is a story of the contemporary
American dream through

43:31.400 --> 43:34.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the lens of class,
race and immigration.

43:34.200 --> 43:39.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Author Imbolo Mbue came to
the U.S. from Cameroon in 1998
and became a citizen in 2014.

43:41.266 --> 43:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is first nurse novel.

43:42.900 --> 43:45.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And because of that, even
more congratulations to you.

43:45.166 --> 43:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IMBOLO MBUE, Author, "Behold the
Dreamers": Thank you, Jeffrey.

43:47.200 --> 43:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You're working
here in a great American fiction
tradition about immigration.

43:52.433 --> 43:53.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What did you want to
bring to that story?

43:53.900 --> 43:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What did you want to tell?

43:55.933 --> 43:59.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IMBOLO MBUE: Well, when I start
writing this novel, it wasn't
very much about immigration.

43:59.666 --> 44:01.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was about the
financial crisis.

44:01.866 --> 44:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was very interested in how
the financial crisis affected
the lives of New Yorkers from

44:06.566 --> 44:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
different economic statutes.

44:09.166 --> 44:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I wanted to write
about an immigrant from
my country who gets a job
as a chauffeur (INAUDIBLE)

44:13.566 --> 44:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
executive, but, of course, an
immigrant coming here for the
American dream and facing the

44:20.533 --> 44:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
financial crisis, I wanted to
write about how that affected
him and how -- and also

44:25.966 --> 44:29.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
explore like the dreams
and hopes he has himself
when he came to America.

44:29.533 --> 44:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I ended up writing about
the immigrant experience, coming
here, realizing what America

44:36.500 --> 44:38.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really is like, and also
deciding whether it is
really worth staying here.

44:38.566 --> 44:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, these
characters, the main characters,
Jende and Neni, from Cameroon,

44:42.500 --> 44:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're experiencing both
sides of the American dream.

44:46.500 --> 44:51.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They tell us that they see
it as both wonderful and
awful at the same time.

44:51.266 --> 44:53.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
IMBOLO MBUE: Yes.

44:53.266 --> 44:57.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's very complex, this idea
of the American dream, because,
on one hand, when we're back

44:59.133 --> 45:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in our countries, we especially,
when I was growing up in
Cameroon, we had this image

45:01.733 --> 45:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of American being the sort of
promised land, and this country
where you go to and you work

45:06.466 --> 45:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hard and you get to achieve
this life, a lot of material
success, a house and nice cars

45:11.433 --> 45:12.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and (INAUDIBLE) accounts.

45:12.900 --> 45:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is what they
came for, Jende and Neni.

45:16.033 --> 45:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then they got here, and they
see the realities of social --
a lot of social issues, economic

45:22.366 --> 45:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inequity, and racism and
sexism, and all of those issues.

45:25.933 --> 45:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they have to deal with it.

45:28.000 --> 45:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they also have -- see
what it's like for people
who achieve the dream.

45:31.200 --> 45:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But by
doing that and by setting
it in that period, you're
also raising question

45:36.200 --> 45:37.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of class, right?

45:37.200 --> 45:39.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
IMBOLO MBUE: Right.

45:39.200 --> 45:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But, as a writer,
you have to see this couple
-- you have to see everybody

45:41.700 --> 45:42.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with some sympathy.

45:42.866 --> 45:43.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
IMBOLO MBUE: Right,
right, right.

45:43.700 --> 45:44.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right?

45:44.900 --> 45:46.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, the Edwards family,
which is wealthy...

45:46.233 --> 45:47.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
IMBOLO MBUE: Right.

45:47.766 --> 45:49.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: ...
and the immigrant
family, they get along.

45:49.833 --> 45:50.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They don't get along.

45:50.833 --> 45:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are all kinds of clashes.

45:51.833 --> 45:53.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But for you, what?

45:53.533 --> 45:55.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What are they?

45:55.600 --> 45:58.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IMBOLO MBUE: Well, for me, it
was, I had a lot of empathy
for the immigrants, because

45:58.100 --> 45:59.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I am an immigrant.

45:59.566 --> 46:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I am from the same town where
Jende and Neni come from.

46:02.600 --> 46:04.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So I know those struggles.

46:04.666 --> 46:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The struggles of the Edwards,
the 1 percent, people who
have that amount of privilege,

46:10.966 --> 46:13.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is not something that I have
dealt with during my life.

46:13.966 --> 46:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I had to push myself to
think about, what are their
struggles, and what does it take

46:18.900 --> 46:20.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to hold this dream
life together?

46:20.400 --> 46:22.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Because they do
have the dream life.

46:22.100 --> 46:23.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have a house
in the Hamptons.

46:23.200 --> 46:25.333 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
They live on the
Upper East Side.

46:25.333 --> 46:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have so many privileges.

46:28.166 --> 46:30.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And yet they have
their own struggles.

46:30.166 --> 46:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, on one hand, I had one
family that was living the dream
and that family growing after

46:34.066 --> 46:36.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the dream.

46:36.033 --> 46:38.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when the recession
happened, both families had to
deal with the consequences.

46:38.900 --> 46:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You referred
to your own background.

46:41.500 --> 46:43.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How much is this your story?

46:43.966 --> 46:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IMBOLO MBUE: In many ways,
you know, I was like Jende and
Neni, in the fact that, when

46:48.133 --> 46:52.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I came here, I thought
America would be a
sort of promised land.

46:52.766 --> 46:55.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I do believe that it
is a wonderful country.

46:55.133 --> 46:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it's a country that
offers a lot of immigrants.

46:57.133 --> 47:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, at the same time, this
American dream, what I have seen
is that it's not accessible,

47:03.766 --> 47:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that somebody like Jende,
a black man without a good
education, and he's also dealing

47:09.800 --> 47:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with not having papers, that
somebody like that, the odds
of moving out of poverty is

47:13.133 --> 47:15.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very difficult.

47:15.133 --> 47:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You're also
dealing in this very difficult
and divisive issue over illegal

47:20.766 --> 47:23.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
immigration, because
they overstay what
they're allowed to.

47:23.033 --> 47:24.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
IMBOLO MBUE: Right,
right, the visa.

47:24.300 --> 47:25.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: They want
to stay in the country.

47:25.333 --> 47:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're facing deportation.

47:27.000 --> 47:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, you know there's a great
debate in the country over this.

47:30.433 --> 47:32.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
IMBOLO MBUE: Right.

47:32.600 --> 47:36.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: I mean,
you portray them as
sympathetic characters
who want to work hard.

47:37.466 --> 47:38.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
IMBOLO MBUE: Right.

47:38.466 --> 47:40.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right.

47:40.400 --> 47:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But you know
that there are plenty of
people who would say, well, I'm

47:41.600 --> 47:42.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sorry, you're not
playing by the rules.

47:42.400 --> 47:43.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
IMBOLO MBUE: Right.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right.

47:44.233 --> 47:46.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it is a very,
very complex issue.

47:46.266 --> 47:51.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that, for me, as a
writer, that my job is to tell
the story and let the reader

47:53.066 --> 47:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decide: Should I empathize with
people like Jende who don't
have papers, or I should vilify

47:55.800 --> 47:57.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them?

47:57.033 --> 48:00.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't -- this is not
a moralizing story.

48:00.166 --> 48:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think people can read my book
and use it as pro-immigration
or use it as anti-immigration

48:05.733 --> 48:07.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
argument.

48:07.166 --> 48:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My place is to tell the story
honestly and completely.

48:09.233 --> 48:13.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But I think that it is
important to understand
each other's stories.

48:13.066 --> 48:18.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's so easy to put people
in a box and say, oh, people
without any papers, but who are

48:19.266 --> 48:20.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
these people, what
are their stories?

48:20.400 --> 48:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I also am a citizen, right?

48:21.833 --> 48:24.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, I also understand
the citizen perspective.

48:24.533 --> 48:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am an immigrant and
I'm a citizen, and I
know what it's like to
be both and to understand

48:31.533 --> 48:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that desire to come here and
work hard, but also that desire
to, like, think about America's

48:34.366 --> 48:36.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
future.

48:36.466 --> 48:39.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let me ask
you finally, as I said,
this is your first novel.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And you won a big award.

48:41.033 --> 48:44.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's got to be a bit of a
surprise, a welcome surprise,
right, for a young writer.

48:44.966 --> 48:45.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
IMBOLO MBUE: Yes.

48:45.966 --> 48:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Yes, it is a good privilege.

48:47.400 --> 48:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I started writing this
book when I was unemployed.

48:49.833 --> 48:52.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I had lost my job at the
end of the financial crisis.

48:52.666 --> 48:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, this hit
-- that hit you personally?

48:54.700 --> 48:55.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
IMBOLO MBUE: Yes.

48:55.700 --> 48:56.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

48:56.700 --> 48:59.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

48:59.166 --> 49:01.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I thought that writing
a story about people
from my hometown and
other New Yorkers who

49:01.366 --> 49:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have met in some ways and
talk about their own struggles.

49:05.600 --> 49:07.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And then I got a novel,
and it got published.

49:07.633 --> 49:11.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And to win an award
like the PEN/Faulkner,
it is a great honor.

49:11.233 --> 49:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right.

49:12.733 --> 49:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, the award-winning book
is "Behold the Dreamers."

49:14.366 --> 49:18.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Imbolo Mbue, thank
you very much.

49:18.500 --> 49:23.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMBOLO MBUE: Thank you, Jeffrey.

49:25.533 --> 49:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally: We
are headed into commencement
season, and each week seems to

49:31.166 --> 49:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bring a new fight over
whose ideas should be heard.

49:34.433 --> 49:38.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, Trinity College
President Joanne Berger-Sweeney
shares her Humble Opinion that

49:38.366 --> 49:42.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
universities are exactly
the place for these
difficult conversations.

49:42.066 --> 49:44.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Have a listen.

49:44.133 --> 49:47.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOANNE BERGER-SWEENEY,
President, Trinity
College: These days, you
can't miss the criticism

49:47.533 --> 49:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
aimed at higher education.

49:49.500 --> 49:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We hear it: We're a bunch
of intolerant elites.

49:53.200 --> 49:55.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Our students are
precious snowflakes.

49:55.633 --> 50:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As educators, we're
stifling speech and thought,
and we're not preparing
students for the real

50:01.666 --> 50:02.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
world.

50:02.666 --> 50:04.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Frankly, I get it.

50:04.766 --> 50:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lately, some campus protests
around the country have gone
awry in truly ugly ways.

50:11.533 --> 50:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now it's commencement season.

50:13.766 --> 50:18.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are controversial speakers
going to be uninvited and
ceremonies halted by protests?

50:20.200 --> 50:24.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If so, all of us in higher
education should be ashamed.

50:26.733 --> 50:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's our job as educators to
uphold free speech and to teach
the responsibilities that come

50:32.033 --> 50:34.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with that freedom.

50:34.066 --> 50:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, yes, we must provide
safe spaces, spaces that are
safe for speech, not from it.

50:42.566 --> 50:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it seems more than ever
that we're just refusing
to hear one another.

50:49.033 --> 50:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maybe that's because listening
to the other side can hurt.

50:51.900 --> 50:56.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Let me tell you, as an
African-American woman,
I have heard it all, and
a lot of it has hurt.

51:00.600 --> 51:05.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I didn't have to agree with it,
like when I was told a black
girl couldn't be a scientist,

51:07.200 --> 51:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but I didn't have the
option of not hearing it.

51:10.533 --> 51:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now I'm the first woman, the
first person of color, the first
neuroscientist to be president

51:16.866 --> 51:18.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Trinity College.

51:18.466 --> 51:20.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But guess what?

51:20.533 --> 51:24.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not representing just
African-Americans, or
women, or neuroscientists.

51:26.433 --> 51:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm representing Trinity
College, a community with a
variety of points of view.

51:31.766 --> 51:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have to be true to myself,
but I can't be a responsible
leader without teaching students

51:37.366 --> 51:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this important lesson:
Silencing voices and refusing
to listen harms us all.

51:44.933 --> 51:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why, for my first
commencement as president
in 2015, I awarded
honorary degrees to both

51:51.766 --> 51:56.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a retired Air Force general
and a renowned peace advocate.

51:58.766 --> 52:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why, this year,
we will hear a commencement
speech from philosopher Daniel

52:04.466 --> 52:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dennett, a well-known
atheist, beside the
statue of our founding
president, an Episcopalian

52:09.666 --> 52:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bishop, exposing students to
different perspectives and
helping them bridge divides.

52:16.033 --> 52:19.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This work is deeply
personal to me.

52:19.533 --> 52:24.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It may be the most important
work I will do as president.

52:24.200 --> 52:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When we teach students how to
analyze an opposing argument and
sharpen their own, how to relate

52:31.233 --> 52:35.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
across differences, how
to listen and be heard,
we are preparing our
students for the real

52:37.200 --> 52:38.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
world.

52:38.866 --> 52:43.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In fact, we're giving
them the tools to make
our world a lot better.

52:45.233 --> 52:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And before
we go, as we reported earlier,
French presidential candidate

52:56.633 --> 53:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Emmanuel Macron's campaign
said it was the victim
of a massive hack.

53:00.900 --> 53:05.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It said hundreds of authentic
and fake internal documents have
been leaked hours before the

53:05.766 --> 53:07.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
vote.

53:07.800 --> 53:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also, The Dallas Morning News
reports a police officer in
suburban Dallas has been charged

53:10.900 --> 53:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with murder over the weekend
killing of a teenager.

53:13.433 --> 53:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The officer fired a rifle
into a car as it left a party.

53:17.733 --> 53:22.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On the "NewsHour" online
right now: Read how a
recent reporting trip
to coal country in

53:22.466 --> 53:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
West Virginia inspired a
journalist's 7-year-old
son to turn water pollution
in his own neighborhood

53:28.366 --> 53:30.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into a science fair experiment.

53:30.466 --> 53:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our
Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:33.666 --> 53:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Robert Costa is
gearing up for "Washington
Week" this evening.

53:37.233 --> 53:39.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Robert, what do you got?

53:39.233 --> 53:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: Tonight, we look
at the policy and politics
behind the House bill to replace

53:42.833 --> 53:44.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Obamacare.

53:44.833 --> 53:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it becomes law, how much of
it will change who gets coverage
and how much will it cost?

53:48.066 --> 53:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will have some answers
and analysis later tonight
on "Washington Week" -- Hari.

53:52.333 --> 53:54.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
Thank you, Robert.

53:54.900 --> 53:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On "PBS NewsHour Weekend"
Saturday: how the youth
vote could determine
France's next president

53:58.133 --> 54:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and what the two candidates are
doing to win over the young.

54:01.433 --> 54:02.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Join me tomorrow.

54:02.900 --> 54:05.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Judy Woodruff will
be back here on Monday.

54:05.233 --> 54:06.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's the "NewsHour"
for tonight.

54:06.666 --> 54:07.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

54:07.666 --> 54:08.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Have a great weekend.

54:08.666 --> 54:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you, and see you soon.
