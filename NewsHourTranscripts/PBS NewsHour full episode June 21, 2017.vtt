HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.

00:05.600 --> 00:06.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

00:06.600 --> 00:08.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Judy Woodruff is away.

00:08.600 --> 00:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: 21
state election systems targeted
by Russian hackers during

00:12.466 --> 00:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
last year's presidential race.

00:14.766 --> 00:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Homeland security officials
testify before Congress in
the ongoing investigation.

00:19.400 --> 00:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also ahead, $50 million later,
Republican Karen Handel prevails
over Democrat Jon Ossoff

00:26.400 --> 00:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Georgia's special election
-- what the race means for
future elections in the Trump

00:30.033 --> 00:32.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
era.

00:32.200 --> 00:36.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Plus: A heat wave blasts
through the Southwest,
starting fires, shutting
down power and grounding

00:37.966 --> 00:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
flights -- the increased
risk of spiking temperatures
due to climate change.

00:41.400 --> 00:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: We have a
finely-tuned civilization,
and as the temperature
goes up, even though

00:48.400 --> 00:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it has only gone up a degree
Celsius over a hundred years,
it does create pockets of

00:52.266 --> 00:54.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
these heat waves.

00:54.200 --> 00:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:55.400 --> 00:57.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:57.933 --> 01:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We are now
on the eve of seeing a Senate
proposal for health care,

01:12.100 --> 01:14.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
including replacing the
Affordable Care Act.

01:14.600 --> 01:18.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Republican leaders plan
to release their bill
tomorrow, after working
on it behind closed

01:18.300 --> 01:20.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
doors for weeks.

01:20.333 --> 01:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Late today, The Washington Post
reported a draft bill largely
mirrors the House's version,

01:27.000 --> 01:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but with some notable changes.

01:28.966 --> 01:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will end Medicaid expansion
more gradually, but cut it
deeply in the long term.

01:32.766 --> 01:37.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It also removes language
that restricts federally
subsidized health plans
from covering abortions.

01:38.633 --> 01:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins joins me now.

01:40.700 --> 01:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lisa, considering the process
here, tomorrow's going to be
an unveiling of this draft, not

01:44.900 --> 01:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just to the public, but even
to a lot of Republicans.

01:47.133 --> 01:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

01:48.666 --> 01:51.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Most Republican senators have
not seen the language yet, Hari.

01:51.266 --> 01:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They tell me that they will see
it tomorrow around 9:30 a.m.

01:54.233 --> 01:55.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Eastern time.

01:55.966 --> 01:57.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That's when Republican
senators will gather
for this exact reason.

01:57.866 --> 01:59.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
When will we see it?

01:59.100 --> 02:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
When will the public see it?

02:00.733 --> 02:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans tell me that is
at the same time, 9:30 a.m.

02:04.500 --> 02:05.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Eastern, online.

02:05.700 --> 02:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Not clear exactly where yet.

02:07.733 --> 02:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hari, even as we wait for
the exact bill, today, we're
hearing from some key senators

02:12.000 --> 02:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that they have alarm bells
ringing in their heads.

02:15.100 --> 02:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Remember, Republicans can only
lose two Republican senators
and still have this bill pass.

02:19.400 --> 02:24.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Well, today, Rand Paul
told me he sees what he
hears as Obamacare-lite.

02:26.033 --> 02:28.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And another senator, Ron
Johnson of Wisconsin,
told me he's concerned.

02:28.333 --> 02:30.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He asked for more time
to review this bill.

02:30.433 --> 02:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said a vote next week,
as is planned, is too soon.

02:33.966 --> 02:37.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said he's not getting more
time and he's not sure he
can get to yes without it.

02:37.966 --> 02:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Speaking of
health care, today was also
an important day, a deadline

02:41.166 --> 02:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for insurance companies to
figure out whether they were
going to participate in some of

02:44.733 --> 02:46.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the exchanges or not.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: This is
critical for what kind
of options people will
have on the individual

02:49.300 --> 02:51.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
markets.

02:51.400 --> 02:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so far, today, Hari, we
have learned some news from some
insurers pulling out of markets,

02:54.733 --> 02:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in fact, Anthem and
Blue Cross/Blue Shield
pulling out of markets
in Wisconsin and Indiana.

03:01.766 --> 03:05.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's really a mixed story,
Hari, because we're also seeing
new insurers enter in places

03:07.066 --> 03:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like Tennessee, which will
have three more options for
insurance than it did last year.

03:10.333 --> 03:12.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And also I spoke to a
company called Medica.

03:12.466 --> 03:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They plan on offering
insurance throughout Iowa.

03:15.500 --> 03:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That will be new for
them this year, adding
another option for Iowans.

03:18.733 --> 03:21.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But here's comes the
catch, Hari, in a way.

03:21.200 --> 03:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Medica says, to do that,
they're planning to increase
premiums by 43 percent.

03:24.933 --> 03:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we will get more news
here, but it's a really mixed
picture, all of these insurers

03:29.500 --> 03:31.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saying there's
instability in the market.

03:31.600 --> 03:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Lisa Desjardins joining us
from Capitol Hill, many thanks.

03:36.066 --> 03:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news:
Congressional Republicans
and the Trump White
House celebrated their

03:39.733 --> 03:42.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
latest win in a
special election.

03:42.266 --> 03:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican Karen Handel held a
GOP House seat in the Atlanta
suburbs, beating Democrat Jon

03:46.400 --> 03:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ossoff in Tuesday's vote.

03:48.433 --> 03:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was the most expensive
U.S. House race ever, and both
candidates called for unity

03:53.100 --> 03:55.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last night.

03:55.166 --> 03:58.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREN HANDEL (R), Georgia
Congresswoman-Elect: To the Jon
Ossoff supporters, know that my

03:58.866 --> 04:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
commitments, they extend to
every one of you as well.

04:02.700 --> 04:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We may have some different
beliefs, but we are part of
one community, the community of

04:08.433 --> 04:09.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Sixth District.

04:09.233 --> 04:11.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

04:11.366 --> 04:12.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JON OSSOFF (D), Georgia
Congressional Candidate:
We showed the world
that in places where no

04:12.800 --> 04:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one thought it was even possible
to fight, we could fight.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

04:17.200 --> 04:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON OSSOFF: We showed them that
we can still build coalitions
of people who may not see

04:21.033 --> 04:24.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
eye to eye on everything, but
rather than demonizing each
other, we find common ground

04:24.766 --> 04:27.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to move forward.

04:27.300 --> 04:30.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Another
special House election
in South Carolina was
closer than expected,

04:32.133 --> 04:34.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but Republicans won
that one as well.

04:34.533 --> 04:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump tweeted that
Democrats are losing because
they're obstructing action

04:38.133 --> 04:40.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on health care and tax cuts.

04:40.166 --> 04:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's in Iowa this evening
for a campaign-style rally.

04:43.200 --> 04:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, Montana Republican
Greg Gianforte formally
joined the U.S. House today.

04:47.533 --> 04:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He won a special election
last month, despite
body-slamming a reporter.

04:52.233 --> 04:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's since been convicted
of misdemeanor assault.

04:54.933 --> 04:59.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, House Speaker Paul
Ryan presided as Gianforte
took the oath of office.

04:59.066 --> 05:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He replaces Ryan Zinke, who
became interior secretary.

05:02.733 --> 05:07.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The FBI confirms the
gunman who opened fire
on House Republicans
last week acted alone.

05:09.700 --> 05:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Investigators said today that
James Hodgkinson of Belleville,
Illinois, had no ties to any

05:13.433 --> 05:15.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
terror group.

05:15.100 --> 05:18.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He attacked lawmakers
at a baseball practice
in Alexandria, Virginia.

05:18.033 --> 05:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House Majority Whip
Steve Scalise was gravely
wounded, and the hospital
upgraded his condition

05:22.766 --> 05:24.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to fair today.

05:24.700 --> 05:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A police officer was stabbed
at an airport in Flint,
Michigan, today, and the FBI is

05:28.400 --> 05:31.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
looking at it as an
act of terrorism.

05:31.533 --> 05:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Officials charged a Canadian man
who came to the U.S. last week.

05:34.433 --> 05:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The man yelled "God is great" in
Arabic and made comments about
Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.

05:39.233 --> 05:43.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The officer was stabbed
in the neck, and officials
later said he was at a
hospital and his condition

05:43.500 --> 05:45.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was satisfactory.

05:45.900 --> 05:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Saudi Arabia, the
kingdom's ailing 81-year-old
monarch elevated his
much younger son to the

05:50.633 --> 05:52.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
role of successor today.

05:52.666 --> 05:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The decision comes at a moment
of economic challenges and
high tensions with regional

05:56.733 --> 05:59.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
rival Iran.

05:59.200 --> 06:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
The custodian of the
two holy mosques, King
Salman bin Abdulaziz

06:05.333 --> 06:07.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Al Saud, has issued
royal decrees.

06:07.366 --> 06:10.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
announcement was read
on state television.

06:10.700 --> 06:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
King Salman named his son,
31-year-old Mohammed bin Salman,
crown prince, next in line to

06:16.633 --> 06:18.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the throne.

06:18.033 --> 06:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He also became interior
minister, in charge of security.

06:21.233 --> 06:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The king's nephew, Mohammed
bin Nayef, lost both titles.

06:24.733 --> 06:27.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But he appeared with
the new crown prince,
and pledged loyalty.

06:27.533 --> 06:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMMED BIN NAYEF,
Nephew of King (through
translator): I am content.

06:30.433 --> 06:33.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I am going to rest now,
and may God be with you.

06:33.533 --> 06:38.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
announcement capped
Prince Mohammed's meteoric
rise to power since

06:38.066 --> 06:40.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his father assumed
the throne in 2015.

06:40.733 --> 06:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Peter Waldman, a writer for
Bloomberg Businessweek, profiled
the young prince last year.

06:45.400 --> 06:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER WALDMAN, Bloomberg
Businessweek: He wants to bring
entrepreneurship and initiative

06:49.333 --> 06:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and kind of a high-tech
sensibility to Saudi Arabia.

06:52.733 --> 06:57.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On social issues, he is
relatively progressive,
meaning that he clearly
can see a point in

07:00.200 --> 07:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time when women will be
driving and can essentially
travel and take jobs
without their husband's

07:04.933 --> 07:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or male guardian's permission.

07:07.500 --> 07:12.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: He was
already defense minister,
and firmly opposes
dialogue with Shiite Iran,

07:13.933 --> 07:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fierce rival to the Saudis
and their Sunni allies.

07:17.033 --> 07:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prince Mohammed has
also overseen the Saudi
military campaign against
Yemen's Shiite Houthi

07:23.166 --> 07:25.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rebels in a proxy war
with the Iranians.

07:25.100 --> 07:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER WALDMAN: His confrontation
with Iran across the Persian
Gulf is a bit dangerous.

07:31.966 --> 07:35.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has said and is willing
to do military interventions
in Yemen, most notably, where

07:37.366 --> 07:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lots of civilians have
died in this ongoing war.

07:40.933 --> 07:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People worry that he doesn't
necessarily have the wisdom
of age and experience.

07:47.866 --> 07:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: On the
domestic side, the prince has
championed economic reforms.

07:51.133 --> 07:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wants to reduce the country's
dependence on oil, and allow
an initial public offering

07:57.533 --> 08:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of stock in the state-owned
oil giant, Saudi Aramco.

08:00.666 --> 08:05.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The elevation of Mohammed bin
Salman came after he met with
President Trump during the

08:05.100 --> 08:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
president's visit last month.

08:07.633 --> 08:12.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House said
President Trump called
Prince Mohammed today to
offer his congratulations.

08:14.066 --> 08:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Elsewhere in the Middle East,
President Trump's son-in-law and
senior adviser, Jared Kushner,

08:16.433 --> 08:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spent today in the region,
pushing Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks.

08:20.466 --> 08:23.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Kushner met first with
Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.

08:23.466 --> 08:27.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Later, he met with President
Mahmoud Abbas of the
Palestinian Authority.

08:27.766 --> 08:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Iraq, the Islamic State
group has destroyed a
historic mosque in Mosul.

08:35.266 --> 08:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The centuries-old site is
where the group's leader,
Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,
declared a so-called

08:39.333 --> 08:43.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Islamic caliphate in
2014, shortly after
ISIS captured the city.

08:45.166 --> 08:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It comes as Iraqi forces are
pushing into the Old City,
the group's last stronghold

08:48.333 --> 08:50.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Mosul.

08:50.300 --> 08:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's been a new confrontation
in the skies over the Baltic
Sea for the second day in

08:54.333 --> 08:56.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a row.

08:56.400 --> 08:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia released footage today
that shows a NATO fighter
jet near a plane carrying the

08:59.966 --> 09:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Russian defense minister.

09:01.666 --> 09:05.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Then, a Russian fighter
moves in, before the
NATO plane pulls away.

09:05.266 --> 09:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NATO says it was following
standard procedure.

09:08.166 --> 09:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in this country, Tropical
Storm Cindy crawled toward
the Gulf Coast, drenching a

09:12.333 --> 09:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stretch from Eastern Texas
to the Florida Panhandle.

09:15.100 --> 09:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both Louisiana and Alabama
declared emergencies
over fears of flooding.

09:18.333 --> 09:22.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The storm is expected
to make landfall near
the Texas-Louisiana
border overnight, and

09:22.433 --> 09:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
could dump a foot of rain.

09:24.366 --> 09:25.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Louisiana Governor
John Bel Edwards:

09:25.900 --> 09:27.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

09:27.900 --> 09:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN BEL EDWARDS (D), Louisiana:
This will be a severe weather
event that will primarily

09:33.900 --> 09:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
consist of threats of rain and
flooding, but there also is
a potential for wind damage

09:37.933 --> 09:40.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as well.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
No one should be under
the belief that this
storm is only going to
affect coastal Louisiana

09:46.866 --> 09:49.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or Southeastern Louisiana.

09:49.166 --> 09:51.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This storm is going to
affect the entire state.

09:51.866 --> 09:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A 10-year-old
died on the Alabama coast
after being struck by a log

09:55.966 --> 09:58.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
washed in on a storm
surge from Cindy.

has acquitted a former
police officer in the
shooting of a black

10:04.400 --> 10:06.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
man last August.

10:06.533 --> 10:10.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Dominique Heaggan-Brown
had been charged with
first-degree reckless
homicide in the shooting

10:11.200 --> 10:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of 23-year-old Sylville Smith.

10:13.500 --> 10:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It happened after a traffic
stop and a brief foot chase.

10:16.800 --> 10:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Smith had a gun, but appeared
to be throwing it over a fence.

10:19.566 --> 10:22.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The shooting sparked
two nights of riots.

10:22.433 --> 10:25.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The CEO and co-founder
of Uber has resigned.

10:25.633 --> 10:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Travis Kalanick stepped down
overnight amid turmoil at
the ride-hailing company.

10:29.366 --> 10:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Uber faces allegations of
sexual harassment and theft of
trade secrets, plus a federal

10:35.833 --> 10:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
investigation into whether
it misled local regulators.

10:38.700 --> 10:43.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial average lost
57 points to close at 21410.

10:43.400 --> 10:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 46 points, and
the S&amp;P 500 dropped a point.

10:48.166 --> 10:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the former homeland security
secretary testifies before

10:52.766 --> 10:57.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congress on the Russia
investigation; what
Georgia's special election
means for Democrats'

10:59.700 --> 11:03.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chances to take back the House;
how cities are bracing for
potential cuts to Medicaid;

11:03.966 --> 11:08.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and much more.

11:15.766 --> 11:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Capitol Hill today, current
and former U.S. government
officials testified before

11:19.700 --> 11:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
members of the House and
Senate Intelligence Committees,
painting a clearer portrait of

11:24.433 --> 11:27.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
how Russia meddled in
the 2016 U.S. elections.

11:27.633 --> 11:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A current FBI official told
the Senate Intelligence
Committee how the Russian
government directed

11:34.533 --> 11:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cyber-attacks to wage an
information campaign that
favored then-candidate Trump.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Homeland Security official
Jeanette Manfra also
offered new details on
how Russians attempted

11:44.966 --> 11:47.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to interfere with
state election systems.

11:47.466 --> 11:51.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEANETTE MANFRA, Department
of Homeland Security:
As of right now we have
evidence of 21 states

11:51.200 --> 11:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
- - or election-related systems
in 21 states that were targeted.

11:55.266 --> 12:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: But in no case were
actual vote tallies altered
in any way, shape, or form?

12:01.600 --> 12:03.633 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
JEANETTE MANFRA:
That is correct.

12:03.633 --> 12:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In a separate
and almost simultaneous hearing
before House Intelligence,

12:07.066 --> 12:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
former Secretary of Homeland
Security Jeh Johnson described
learning about Russian hacking

12:11.333 --> 12:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into Democratic National
Committee systems months
after the FBI became aware.

12:16.133 --> 12:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEH JOHNSON, Former U.S.
Secretary of Homeland Security:
It had been some months before I

12:19.666 --> 12:24.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was learning of this that the
FBI and the DNC had been in
contact with each other about

12:25.533 --> 12:27.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

12:27.266 --> 12:29.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I wasn't happy to
be learning about this
several months later.

12:29.833 --> 12:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Very clearly, I wasn't
pleased that we were not
in there helping them
patch this vulnerability.

12:37.466 --> 12:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We get more
on the Senate Intelligence
Committee's Russia investigation

12:41.533 --> 12:46.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now with one of its key
members, Senator James Lankford,
Republican from Oklahoma.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He joins us now
from Capitol Hill.

12:47.766 --> 12:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Senator, thanks for being here.

12:49.833 --> 12:54.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This afternoon, we heard
multiple DHS officials
say that they have
more and more evidence

12:56.500 --> 12:59.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Russia tried to interfere
in the campaigns or interfere
in the election systems in 21

12:59.200 --> 13:01.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
different states.

13:01.300 --> 13:03.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And while they stress that
none of the votes were flipped
in any of these states, they

13:03.300 --> 13:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did say that some of these
intrusions kind of made it
past of the security systems.

13:07.600 --> 13:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, my question is, why
not release the information
on which states or which
localities were compromised?

13:13.066 --> 13:14.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:14.600 --> 13:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD (R), Oklahoma: So
the FBI has a very clear policy.

13:15.533 --> 13:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They don't expose victims.

13:17.633 --> 13:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they consider these
states to be victims of an
intrusion on the outside.

13:20.100 --> 13:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the states want to be able
to say that or if they want
to be able to release that,

13:23.800 --> 13:25.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
obviously, they're
welcome to do.

13:25.933 --> 13:30.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But for a location that
was actually attacked by
an outside force they're
not going to release

13:31.133 --> 13:32.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Some of those will
continue to come out.

13:34.433 --> 13:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some of those states will say,
yes, we're one of the states,
and the list will eventually

13:36.233 --> 13:38.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
come out.

13:38.333 --> 13:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You agree it's
important, regardless whether if
you're Democrat or Republican,

13:40.300 --> 13:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make sure that these
things are fixed, especially
between now and 2018?

13:42.633 --> 13:43.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:43.866 --> 13:45.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JAMES LANKFORD:
Absolutely, it is.

13:45.866 --> 13:48.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were really three
simultaneous hearings today, one
in the House, two in the Senate,

13:48.566 --> 13:52.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
both of them in the
Senate dealing with state
election systems and
also dealing with state

13:52.300 --> 13:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
penetrations from outside actors
trying to be able to reach
into multiple state agencies.

13:57.200 --> 14:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Since the
investigation into Russian
meddling began, has anything

14:01.233 --> 14:03.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
changed your opinion
in how serious this is?

14:03.833 --> 14:05.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:05.366 --> 14:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: Oh, no, it
hasn't changed my opinion.

14:07.033 --> 14:09.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I serve on the Intel
Committee and I have
been very aware of it.

14:09.066 --> 14:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think more Americans are
aware of what is going on, as
we try to engage our federal

14:11.600 --> 14:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government to be able to
step up to the level of
risk that we really face.

14:15.900 --> 14:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of states have become
more aware of it, and their
state CIOs, chief information

14:20.066 --> 14:23.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
officers, and other agencies
are now stepping up to say this
is a real threat and we need

14:23.866 --> 14:25.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to be able to
treat it seriously.

14:25.933 --> 14:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Since this
began, we have reports just in
the last couple of days from

14:32.866 --> 14:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The New York Times now that says
the CIA director, Mike Pompeo,
continued to brief Michael Flynn

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even after he was given
information that Michael
Flynn might be compromised.

14:45.166 --> 14:46.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Was this -- was this
handled appropriately?

14:46.166 --> 14:47.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:47.433 --> 14:48.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JAMES LANKFORD: It was
handled appropriately.

14:48.933 --> 14:50.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was very surprised at
The New York Times story.

14:50.566 --> 14:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They get some things right.

14:51.933 --> 14:54.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For this one, it seemed
much ado about nothing.

14:54.500 --> 14:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fact that in the earliest
days Michael Flynn was there
and that there were some people

14:58.533 --> 15:01.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the previous administration
that didn't like Michael
Flynn or thought that he had

15:01.800 --> 15:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been challenged before, this
administration, the current
administration, was still trying

15:05.733 --> 15:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to determine that, and to be
able to put that off on Mike
Pompeo, who had also just been

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hired days before, literally ,
they're confronting Mike Pompeo,
saying he could have -- should

15:17.533 --> 15:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have confronted a White
House official days into
his new post, I think,
is an unfair reevaluation

15:20.900 --> 15:22.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or rewrite of history.

15:22.933 --> 15:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This also
seems to -- from an outsider's
perspective, even when it comes

15:28.866 --> 15:31.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to intelligence-gathering,
there's a layer of politics
on it and a layer of distrust,

15:31.800 --> 15:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because you would think that
by the time the information
filters up to the head of the

15:35.300 --> 15:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CIA, that whoever is coming up
with that information is putting
country first and not party.

15:39.933 --> 15:40.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:40.933 --> 15:43.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES LANKFORD: Correct.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you would also assume that
there is a way to be able to
interpret that information.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at times, you see an
accusation that may be released
out, for instance, with Michael

15:47.933 --> 15:52.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Flynn, to say he might have
been compromised, he might have
been vulnerable to blackmail.

15:52.666 --> 15:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you actually see that
information, I think a lot of
Americans will look at it and

15:56.133 --> 15:58.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
go, what in the world
are they talking about?

15:58.066 --> 16:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One analyst will look at one
thing and see it one way.

16:01.066 --> 16:03.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Another analyst will
look at it and see it an
entirely different way.

16:03.900 --> 16:07.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There's more open to
interpretation here than
what the Americans are
being led to believe

16:07.966 --> 16:09.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in this by that story.

16:09.366 --> 16:11.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I would just tell people
to take a deep breath.

16:11.400 --> 16:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's not try to revise history
of what was actually going on
in literally the very first

16:15.633 --> 16:18.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
week of a new administration
as they were getting organized.

16:18.433 --> 16:21.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is there
any concern that Michael Flynn
had access to information that

16:21.766 --> 16:23.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he shouldn't have had?

16:23.000 --> 16:24.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:24.466 --> 16:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: No, I haven't
seen that concern on that.

16:26.533 --> 16:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is the national security
adviser working next to the
president, so in his time that

16:30.633 --> 16:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he was the national
security adviser, he is
working in the White House.

16:33.866 --> 16:35.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He should have access
to that information.

16:35.866 --> 16:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obviously, once the president
fired him, he should have
access to no information at all

16:39.833 --> 16:42.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at that point.

16:42.433 --> 16:45.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You have
also had the opportunity
to listen to Mike Rogers
in -- I'm sorry -- you

16:45.666 --> 16:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have had the head of the
DNI and the head of the CIA
in closed-door sessions.

16:49.933 --> 16:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Has anything that they have told
you, without having to reveal
it here, given you any greater

16:54.200 --> 16:56.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sense of comfort or a
greater sense of alarm?

16:56.233 --> 16:57.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:57.466 --> 16:59.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JAMES LANKFORD:
No, they haven't.

16:59.433 --> 17:01.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obviously, when we walk through
classified information and
sources and methods and how

17:01.166 --> 17:03.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things are determined, we get
a chance to see the raw data.

17:03.900 --> 17:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Very often, what comes out in
open hearings is an impression
that has been made, and then

17:07.833 --> 17:10.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you look back at the data and
you have to determine whether
I would agree or disagree

17:10.800 --> 17:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with that same impression.

17:12.800 --> 17:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are walking through
all the investigations
in a very bipartisan way.

17:15.933 --> 17:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Senate Intelligence
Committee is a very bipartisan
committee where we try to look

17:19.666 --> 17:21.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at all the information,
have real conversations.

17:21.666 --> 17:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You don't have Republicans and
Democrats behind closed doors.

17:24.266 --> 17:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have people passionate
about national security
behind closed doors.

17:27.066 --> 17:29.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think that's the
way that it should be.

17:29.100 --> 17:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The White
House is supposed to announce,
possibly as early as this week,

17:33.300 --> 17:37.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to settle this question
on whether or not there
exists recordings of
conversations between

17:37.800 --> 17:42.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the president and former
Director James Comey.

17:42.466 --> 17:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a member of the Senate
Intelligence Committee,
do you have any reason
to believe that there

17:45.900 --> 17:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are or that there are not tapes?

17:47.300 --> 17:48.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

17:48.300 --> 17:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: We don't know.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have, obviously, made
the request that we would
receive those recordings.

17:52.333 --> 17:54.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It would clear up a
lot of the issues.

17:54.400 --> 17:58.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Obviously, the former
FBI director, Jim Comey,
said he released out
his memos that were of

18:01.033 --> 18:04.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an FBI document that after he
left employment he released them
out anyway to try to proactively

18:04.366 --> 18:05.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cut that off.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I wish he wouldn't
have done that.

18:07.833 --> 18:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if we have recordings, we
could get the recordings and
get all the information out

18:11.100 --> 18:13.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

18:13.066 --> 18:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But at this point, if there
is a recording, based on a
tweet from the president saying

18:15.533 --> 18:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he -- that Jim Comey better
hope that there aren't, I
would, quite frankly, tell you,

18:19.666 --> 18:21.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
if the White House
has recordings, they
should release them.

18:21.833 --> 18:23.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That settles the issue.

18:23.500 --> 18:26.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: If
there are recordings, is
that concerning to you?

18:26.066 --> 18:28.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

18:28.100 --> 18:30.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: Well, it would
only be a question for me to
figure out why they're trying to

18:30.166 --> 18:35.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
record what's happening
in the White House and
what is happening in
private conversations.

18:36.333 --> 18:38.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If there are, we need to
get the information out.

18:38.366 --> 18:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's resolve the issues and
try to determine why those were
happening, what was the source

18:40.800 --> 18:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of those, and then that will
help settle a lot of issues.

18:43.300 --> 18:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Senator James Lankford from the
Senate Intelligence Committee

18:46.533 --> 18:49.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and from Oklahoma,
thanks so much.

18:49.933 --> 18:51.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

18:51.133 --> 18:55.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES LANKFORD: You bet.

18:55.800 --> 18:58.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

18:58.133 --> 19:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We return now
to the results of yesterday's
special elections in Georgia

19:05.200 --> 19:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and South Carolina, and what
both parties can learn from
these congressional races as

19:07.666 --> 19:09.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we look ahead to
next year's midterms.

19:09.833 --> 19:11.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang has more on that.

19:11.866 --> 19:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Joining me now to
look at what happened in these
two Southern races and the

19:14.933 --> 19:19.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
big takeaways for both
Democrats and Republicans
are Karine Jean-Pierre.

19:19.266 --> 19:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's a senior adviser
for MoveOn.org and worked
in the Obama White House.

19:24.033 --> 19:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And David Avella, chairman
of GOPAC, a Republican
political action committee
focused on developing

19:30.233 --> 19:31.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
candidates to run
for higher office.

19:31.533 --> 19:33.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Karine, David, thanks
for joining us.

19:33.500 --> 19:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two special elections,
two Republican districts,
Republicans held on.

19:37.500 --> 19:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One was being highly
watched, one not so much.

19:40.133 --> 19:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The one being highly
watched wasn't as close as
people thought it might be.

19:44.233 --> 19:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The one that nobody seemed to
be watching was much closer.

19:46.933 --> 19:49.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, what did we
learn last night?

19:49.066 --> 19:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Karine, let's start with you.

19:50.066 --> 19:51.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What did we learn yesterday?

19:51.966 --> 19:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, Democratic
Strategist: Well, there's
a few big takeaways.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But I do want to be clear here.

19:55.200 --> 20:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, the one that we watched,
which is Georgia 6, we didn't
come as close as we thought,

20:01.333 --> 20:04.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but he was dealing with
a 24-point deficit.

20:04.300 --> 20:08.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If you think about Tom
Price, who won that
district in November,
he got as close as five

20:08.933 --> 20:11.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
points, which I
think says a lot.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It says that district is a
gerrymandered district that is
a stronghold for Republicans.

20:16.900 --> 20:19.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It is a Republican
plus-eight district.

20:19.333 --> 20:22.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so I think getting
that close says a lot.

20:22.333 --> 20:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is a lot of takeaways
that I take from it, which is,
number one, I think, in 2018,

20:29.766 --> 20:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if we're now able to
play in Georgia and South
Carolina, we're going
to be able to play in

20:32.733 --> 20:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of different other states,
because Georgia and South
Carolina are deep red states.

20:39.700 --> 20:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And also just looking at
South Carolina for a second,
it went under the radar.

20:41.733 --> 20:44.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We weren't able -- it did
better than we expected.

20:44.933 --> 20:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To me, that's going to be more
like 2018 because you are going
to have 435 races that you're

20:51.166 --> 20:53.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not going to be able
to pay attention to.

20:53.233 --> 20:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think there are some
similarities there, which
are you're just not going to

20:57.133 --> 20:59.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have the focus that
did you with Georgia 6.

20:59.566 --> 21:01.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: David,
what did we learn now?

21:01.133 --> 21:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID AVELLA, Chairman,
GOPAC: Here are the facts.

21:03.100 --> 21:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
South Carolina 5 was only
competitive because Republicans
didn't pay attention to it.

21:06.733 --> 21:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats did exactly what they
needed to do, which was to try
to sneak up on the Republicans.

21:10.933 --> 21:13.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It failed.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in Georgia 5, this is a
race that every poll except
one said Jon Ossoff was going

21:18.066 --> 21:19.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to win, and he
didn't come close.

21:19.466 --> 21:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Five points is not a close win.

21:22.766 --> 21:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans should feel good
about what happened yesterday.

21:25.833 --> 21:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But here is the bigger lesson,
and it's really for the U.S.
Senate, not the U.S. House.

21:29.700 --> 21:32.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These four special elections
all say the same thing.

21:32.466 --> 21:37.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Karine's team cannot put enough
progressives together for
the nine Democrats who sit in

21:37.366 --> 21:40.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
seats where Donald
Trump won their states.

21:40.733 --> 21:44.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if they're going to get
reelected, they have got to find
Republicans and independents

21:44.766 --> 21:46.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that are willing to
come vote for them.

21:46.866 --> 21:50.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if they're going to do
that, they better find something
in the Trump agenda that they

21:50.566 --> 21:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can vote for that they can go
back home and tell folks they're
supporting the president's

21:54.366 --> 21:55.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
agenda.

21:55.633 --> 21:57.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Karine,
what about that?

21:57.700 --> 22:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it enough for the Democrats
just to be against everything
that the Republicans are

22:00.500 --> 22:01.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
doing?

22:01.766 --> 22:02.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE:
I completely agree.

22:02.700 --> 22:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We cannot just be anti-Trump.

22:04.800 --> 22:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to actually have a
-- I believe a progressive,
clear vision, and be able to

22:08.300 --> 22:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talk about that vision and be
able to define ourselves before
the Republicans do, but also

22:12.933 --> 22:17.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
use that vision to be
able to draw that stark
contrast with Donald Trump.

22:17.766 --> 22:21.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so that is, I think, a
lesson that we learned from
yesterday which is incredibly

22:21.733 --> 22:23.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
important.

22:23.766 --> 22:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I do want to point out
that there are about 70 to 80
districts that are going to

22:25.900 --> 22:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
come up in 2018 that are not
as red at all as Georgia and
South Carolina that we will

22:32.033 --> 22:33.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be competitive in.

22:33.233 --> 22:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I just want to be clear.

22:34.733 --> 22:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And also special elections are
special elections for a reason.

22:37.300 --> 22:40.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We shouldn't put too
much stock into this.

22:40.100 --> 22:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2005, Democrats lost special
elections and then in 2006
they won the majority back

22:45.700 --> 22:47.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the House.

22:47.833 --> 22:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: David, is there --
going back to what Karine said
in her first answer, is there

22:54.400 --> 22:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reason to be concerned
on the Republican side
that, in every special
election, the Republicans

23:00.566 --> 23:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
- - the Democrats -- I'm
sorry -- have outperformed,
have done better than
they have done in previous

23:05.333 --> 23:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
congressional elections, and
in some cases have done better
than President Trump did

23:10.233 --> 23:11.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in those districts?

23:11.366 --> 23:13.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID AVELLA:
Republicans still won.

23:13.233 --> 23:15.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republicans are still
in the majority.

23:15.733 --> 23:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if Republicans
pass tax reform, pass a
health care system that's
better than Obamacare,

23:22.766 --> 23:25.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
keeps Americans safe, and
works on an infrastructure
bill, it will a good
day for Republicans in

23:25.666 --> 23:27.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2018.

23:27.733 --> 23:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have far more control over
our fate in 2018 if we do
the things that we need to do

23:32.533 --> 23:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that voters elected us to do.

23:33.800 --> 23:35.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: I want to get
back to the health care.

23:35.033 --> 23:37.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But, Karine, I also
want to ask you.

23:37.066 --> 23:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The one thing in the Georgia
race that the Republicans
did apparently effectively is

23:43.233 --> 23:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they draped Nancy Pelosi
around the shoulders of
the Democratic candidate.

23:48.733 --> 23:50.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is that a concern going
into the midterms?

23:50.766 --> 23:52.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: I think
this is -- goes back to
what I was saying earlier.

23:52.633 --> 23:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have to define yourself
first before Republicans do.

23:57.466 --> 24:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And to me like, remember,
this is a deep red district.

24:01.233 --> 24:03.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Both of them were.

24:03.633 --> 24:05.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And to me, it's like
it's an old playbook.

24:05.933 --> 24:08.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Most people don't know
who Nancy Pelosi is.

24:08.900 --> 24:11.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Most people don't
know who Paul Ryan is.

24:11.000 --> 24:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, like, once again, this was
in a different type of district
that Democrats -- it shouldn't

24:15.800 --> 24:17.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have been competitive
in the first place.

24:17.466 --> 24:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID AVELLA: Poor Karine has
to redefine what victory means.

24:21.100 --> 24:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You either win and you
get to go to Washington
and govern, or you don't.

24:25.566 --> 24:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's much discussion
today about should Nancy
Pelosi go or shouldn't she go?

24:29.833 --> 24:31.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And progressives are
saying she should go.

24:31.600 --> 24:32.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And some are saying
she shouldn't.

24:32.900 --> 24:35.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Republicans are
saying, please keep her.

24:35.400 --> 24:39.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Nancy Pelosi is only the
messenger for a larger
progressive cause.

24:39.900 --> 24:42.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The problem isn't,
per se, Nancy Pelosi.

24:42.500 --> 24:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the ideas that
she's ultimately pushing.

24:44.833 --> 24:48.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There's enough Americans
who support that view to
get Democrats elected.

24:48.933 --> 24:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: David, you mentioned
health care, that if they can
-- they need to get -- they

24:55.833 --> 24:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need to pass things,
they need to get some
victories up on the board.

24:57.833 --> 25:01.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How important politically is --
we're going to see the health
care bill tomorrow in the

25:01.800 --> 25:04.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Senate -- getting
a vote by July?

25:04.800 --> 25:09.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The public support for
the health care bill
has been dropping since
the House introduced

25:10.533 --> 25:12.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it and passed it.

25:12.633 --> 25:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there concern that, you do
this, and you get saddled with
an unpopular bill, much the

25:17.800 --> 25:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
same way that the Democrats
did eight years ago?

25:19.900 --> 25:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID AVELLA: Well, we have to
have a bill that helps bring
-- keep premiums in line,

25:24.366 --> 25:29.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that ultimately gives good
access to health care, which
we're not talking about the fact

25:29.166 --> 25:34.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that every month another
state goes down, more
health care providers,
so that more Americans

25:36.033 --> 25:38.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have to go find health insurance
somewhere else in a system
where there may have only

25:38.300 --> 25:41.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been that one health care
provider on the insurance side.

25:41.866 --> 25:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Republicans need to deliver
a health care bill that gets
rid of the taxes that Obamacare

25:46.433 --> 25:50.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
put on, that not only will
make health care better, but
will also help create jobs and

25:50.333 --> 25:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spur the economy, but, two,
will allow doctors and patients
to keep a strong relationship

25:56.766 --> 26:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
between each other, and provides
ultimately access to everyone.

26:01.133 --> 26:02.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Less than
30 seconds, Karine.

26:02.133 --> 26:04.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Go ahead.

26:04.200 --> 26:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Well, my
friend David needs to read the
CBO score of the House bill,

26:07.000 --> 26:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which what we're hearing,
that Senate bill is very
similar to the House bill.

26:10.533 --> 26:12.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Look, it's cruel.

26:12.600 --> 26:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the House bill was mean,
it sounds like the Senate
bill is going to be cruel.

26:14.966 --> 26:19.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, honestly, it's not even
about politics or electoral
-- elections at this point.

26:19.500 --> 26:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's about taking people
off of their health care.

26:22.666 --> 26:24.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's about people
potentially dying.

26:24.900 --> 26:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what we're seeing is the
Republicans want to kick off
tens of millions of people and

26:31.300 --> 26:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hurt our most vulnerable,
and that is a problem.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID AVELLA: But that is
what Obamacare is doing.

26:34.033 --> 26:35.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE:
No, that is not true.

26:35.966 --> 26:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is not true, not
according to the CBO score,
an independent office.

26:38.000 --> 26:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID AVELLA: More and more
people are losing their health
insurance every month under the

26:38.800 --> 26:39.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
current Obamacare.

26:39.466 --> 26:40.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

26:40.966 --> 26:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: We're going to
have to leave it there.

26:42.133 --> 26:43.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're going to
know more tomorrow.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm sure we will talk more
about this after tomorrow.

26:45.066 --> 26:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Karine Jean-Pierre, David
Avella, thanks for joining us.

26:47.233 --> 26:51.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID AVELLA: Thank you.

26:51.966 --> 26:56.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE:
Thanks, John.

26:56.700 --> 26:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

26:59.566 --> 27:04.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the
"NewsHour": why is a heat
wave baking the Southwest
and grounding flights?;

27:06.533 --> 27:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plus, actor Alan Alda explains
what he has learned on how
to communicate effectively.

27:11.900 --> 27:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But first: As we heard, Senate
Republicans are pushing hard
to pass their own bill next

27:16.633 --> 27:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
week to replace and overhaul
the Affordable Care Act.

27:18.866 --> 27:23.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One of the key issues,
major cuts to Medicaid,
the joint federal-state
program that provides

27:23.633 --> 27:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
health care to
low-income Americans,
the elderly and disabled.

27:27.400 --> 27:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was expanded under Obamacare.

27:29.600 --> 27:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But now 14 million Medicaid
recipients stand to lose that
coverage under a bill passed

27:34.566 --> 27:36.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by the House.

27:36.533 --> 27:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reports out tonight say there
will be even deeper cuts
under the Senate version.

27:40.100 --> 27:44.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Cat Wise
reports from Los Angeles on
how these cuts could directly

27:44.100 --> 27:46.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
affect patients.

27:46.166 --> 27:50.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: A homeless man on
Skid Row hoping to finally
get a roof over his head.

27:52.333 --> 27:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A middle-class mom
earning an income to
care of her disabled son.

27:56.033 --> 28:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A working-class truck
driver getting care for his
complex medical problems.

28:00.900 --> 28:05.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Three very different lives,
with a common thread now at
risk of being cut: Medicaid.

28:07.900 --> 28:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Los Angeles is well known
for its Hollywood stars
with glamorous lifestyles.

28:11.300 --> 28:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the city is also home to
many who are less fortunate.

28:15.066 --> 28:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The working poor and homeless
here have benefited from
the Affordable Care Act.

28:18.900 --> 28:23.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In fact, about 1.2
million residents gained
health insurance through
the Medicaid expansion.

28:25.033 --> 28:27.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But all that may
be about to change.

28:27.966 --> 28:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Republican plan to replace
the Affordable Care Act, passed
by the House of Representatives

28:32.333 --> 28:37.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in May and now being
considered by the Senate,
would fundamentally
alter Medicaid in two

28:37.166 --> 28:39.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
key ways.

28:39.133 --> 28:43.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, the ACA's Medicaid
expansion -- that offered states
the option of covering most

28:43.400 --> 28:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
non-disabled childless adults
with incomes below and just
above the poverty line -- would

28:49.266 --> 28:51.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
end within several years.

28:51.366 --> 28:52.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: We're going to
get this passed through the

28:52.600 --> 28:53.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Senate.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I feel so confident.

28:55.600 --> 28:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: The House bill, which
President Trump cheered in
May, but has since reportedly

28:58.033 --> 29:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
called mean, also calls for
converting the entire program
from one with no cap on dollars

29:04.466 --> 29:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spent to one where states
get a fixed amount of money.

29:06.900 --> 29:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would give state
governments more flexibility
about how to spend
Medicaid dollars, but would

29:13.966 --> 29:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cut the amount they receive
by more than $800 billion
over a decade, according
to the Congressional

29:17.400 --> 29:18.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Budget Office.

SEN.

29:20.366 --> 29:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: I think we will have
ample opportunity to read

29:21.300 --> 29:23.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and amend the bill.

29:23.733 --> 29:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: A Senate version,
which would eventually
need to be merged with
the House bill before

29:26.533 --> 29:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
becoming law, is still being
crafted, but is said to include
many of these same adjustments,

29:33.433 --> 29:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
though with a potentially
longer rollback of the
Medicaid expansion.

29:36.666 --> 29:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
California stands to lose more
than any other state under
the House version, $6 billion

29:41.600 --> 29:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a year starting in 2020, and
more than $24 billion by 2027.

29:48.033 --> 29:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those cuts could have a
big impact on this group.

29:49.900 --> 29:52.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WOMAN: I think you
have hypertension,
diabetes, neuropathy.

29:52.833 --> 29:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: For the last several
years, Los Angeles County
has been deploying teams of

30:00.333 --> 30:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nurses, mental health
and substance counselors
and formerly homeless
peer advocates throughout

30:03.933 --> 30:05.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Skid Row.

30:05.933 --> 30:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their goal is to improve health
outcomes for this medically
complex and costly homeless

30:09.633 --> 30:12.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
population by
giving them a home.

30:12.866 --> 30:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This Housing for Health program
uses Medicaid dollars to fund
supportive services, like

30:17.833 --> 30:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mental health counseling and
substance abuse treatment in
locations where new housing is

30:22.300 --> 30:24.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
being offered.

30:24.333 --> 30:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the day we tagged along, the
team reconnected with a client
who had been wanting to get

30:27.233 --> 30:28.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
off the streets.

30:28.433 --> 30:29.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Are you familiar
with the (INAUDIBLE)

30:29.233 --> 30:30.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
MAN: No?

30:30.233 --> 30:31.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: No?

30:31.233 --> 30:33.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK.

30:33.266 --> 30:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that's like -- that's the
one everyone likes, because
you can get your own room.

30:34.433 --> 30:37.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: That sounds
like my kind of room.

30:37.166 --> 30:38.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Yes, exactly.

30:38.200 --> 30:39.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

30:39.400 --> 30:41.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN: It was a blessing
to find him here.

30:41.500 --> 30:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will basically link him to
services and help him get to
the point where he wants to

30:46.666 --> 30:48.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
be.

30:48.800 --> 30:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Nearly 3,000 people
have received housing so far,
and the goal is to get 7,000

30:51.833 --> 30:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more off the streets by 2020.

MITCH KATZ, Director,
Los Angeles County Health
Agency: We have had
dramatic drops in emergency

30:57.633 --> 31:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
department visits
and hospitalizations
following housing people.

31:03.800 --> 31:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Dr. Mitch Katz is
the director of the Los Angeles
Health Agency, and he has

31:08.066 --> 31:10.100 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
been leading the
county's effort.

31:10.100 --> 31:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We met at the Star Apartments,
a 100-unit building in the heart
of Skid Row with a community

31:14.233 --> 31:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
garden, various counseling
services and a health
clinic on the main floor.

31:21.200 --> 31:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The monthly rent is covered
by county general funds,
donations, and residents.

31:24.333 --> 31:27.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the services provided
are covered by Medicaid.

31:27.966 --> 31:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dr. Katz took me on a tour
of a recently vacated unit.

31:31.633 --> 31:33.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

31:33.666 --> 31:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH KATZ: You will see that,
although the space is small,
it has everything that you

31:37.233 --> 31:38.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
would need.

31:38.300 --> 31:40.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have a refrigerator,
stove, sink.

31:40.900 --> 31:44.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not grand, but it really
changes somebody's life.

31:44.433 --> 31:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over a hundred people
came directly out of the
hospital bed, or directly
from the emergency

31:50.500 --> 31:52.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
room, and are now living here.

31:52.566 --> 31:57.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I can take care of them for
way less than it costs to be
in the hospital, and they will

31:59.233 --> 32:01.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have a much higher-quality life.

32:01.366 --> 32:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: The ACA's Medicaid
changes have also been felt
by a much wider swathe of the

32:07.900 --> 32:10.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
population, low-income,
often working adults who
previously had no access
to health insurance.

32:13.366 --> 32:18.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that was the
story for 60-year-old
Jorge Arias, a former
self-employed truck driver.

32:20.366 --> 32:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Arias, who has had Medicaid
for the last two years, is a
patient at the Saban Community

32:25.466 --> 32:28.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinic, a non-profit federally
qualified health center which
opened its doors to low-income

32:28.866 --> 32:32.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
clients 50 years ago.

32:32.033 --> 32:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last year, Arias had emergency
surgery after a heart specialist
determined he had three

32:37.766 --> 32:38.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
blocked arteries.

32:38.700 --> 32:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Without insurance, he says:

32:40.766 --> 32:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JORGE ARIAS, Medicaid Recipient:
I would not even be alive, you
know, because, no medications,

32:44.333 --> 32:46.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
no doctors.

32:46.300 --> 32:49.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIE HUDMAN, CEO, Saban
Community Clinic: Well, we see
about 18,000 to 20,000 patients

32:49.166 --> 32:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a year; 10,000 of them have
Medicaid, and over 8,000 of
them got it with the expansion

32:55.766 --> 32:57.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
under the ACA.

32:57.266 --> 32:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAT WISE: Julie Hudman
is the CEO of the clinic.

32:59.966 --> 33:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIE HUDMAN: Before we had
the ACA, someone would come in
and, depending on their income,

33:04.233 --> 33:08.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
we'd take a co-pay,
and it typically was
around $18 per person.

33:08.133 --> 33:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, when a patient comes
in with Medicaid, we receive
about $200 for the visit.

33:15.133 --> 33:18.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The difference between the
$18 and the $200, $225 is, you
know, a huge source of revenue

33:21.000 --> 33:24.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for us, and allows us
to stabilize, to keep
our doors open, and then
actually expand services.

33:26.133 --> 33:30.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: So, how have
you been this week?

33:30.333 --> 33:31.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Fine.

33:31.333 --> 33:33.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Yes, I'm good.

33:33.433 --> 33:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Some of those new
services include mental health
counseling, which could be cut

33:35.533 --> 33:39.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
back if the clinic
loses funding.

33:39.466 --> 33:43.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Traditional Medicaid programs,
like those for the disabled
and long-term care for the

33:43.033 --> 33:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
elderly, could also be impacted.

33:46.300 --> 33:51.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Victoria and Steve Rosen
are the proud, adopted
parents of 16-year-old
Max, who has a number

33:53.300 --> 33:56.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of health problems due
to prenatal exposure
to drugs and alcohol.

33:56.833 --> 33:58.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VICTORIA ROSEN,
California: So this is Max.

33:58.900 --> 34:03.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
When we first met him
in the NICU, he had a
very rough beginning.

34:03.200 --> 34:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Max is the
recipient of a Medicaid-funded
program called In-Home
Supportive Services.

34:10.866 --> 34:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Victoria earns about
$3,500 a month through
the program to help Max
with things like personal

34:15.733 --> 34:17.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
care and feeding.

34:17.666 --> 34:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That financial support has
been key for the family because
helping Max is a full-time

34:21.933 --> 34:25.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
job, and Victoria hasn't been
able to work outside the home.

34:25.066 --> 34:27.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
VICTORIA ROSEN: It helps
us survive, basically.

34:27.033 --> 34:30.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, before this, we
were, you know, in debt.

34:30.800 --> 34:33.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We don't spend a
lot of extra money.

34:33.600 --> 34:35.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And all the money
we spend is on Max.

34:35.666 --> 34:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: But many supportive
Medicaid service programs like
this one are considered optional

34:42.533 --> 34:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
under traditional Medicaid,
and if states have to take on
more financial responsibility

34:49.066 --> 34:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for Medicaid with the new
Republican plan, health analysts
and program leaders say the

34:53.900 --> 34:57.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
optional services
are likely to be cut.

34:57.500 --> 35:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
To the Rosens, that doesn't
make a lot of sense.

35:00.200 --> 35:02.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STEVE ROSEN, California:
IHSS saves money.

35:02.833 --> 35:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would be more expensive to
take care of someone like Max
in an institutional setting

35:09.333 --> 35:11.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
than it is to have
him in his own house.

35:11.566 --> 35:16.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Many Republicans say
these programs may be important,
but Medicaid is simply out

35:17.166 --> 35:19.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of control.

35:19.166 --> 35:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL CANNON, Cato Institute:
Medicaid has grown into this
incredibly wasteful program,

35:21.233 --> 35:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rife with fraud, siphoning lots
of money away from the people
the program should be helping.

35:28.066 --> 35:31.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Michael Cannon is
the director of health policy
studies at the Cato Institute,

35:31.266 --> 35:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a libertarian think tank.

35:33.266 --> 35:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cannon is concerned the current
legislation being considered
by Congress wouldn't go far

35:37.600 --> 35:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
enough in axing federal
Medicaid regulations and turning
over control to the states.

35:42.600 --> 35:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL CANNON: So, what
Congress should be doing here
is saying to the states, look,

35:45.933 --> 35:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we don't know how to run these
programs better than you.

35:48.400 --> 35:52.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We will continue our
contribution to your
Medicaid programs, but
we're going to give

35:52.433 --> 35:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you a fixed amount of money.

35:54.433 --> 35:57.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not going to grow from
one year to the next, but we're
also going to give you full

35:57.900 --> 36:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
flexibility to run your
programs the way you think
is best for your state.

36:04.766 --> 36:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States will have a much greater
incentives then to eliminate
fraud, to make sure that

36:06.766 --> 36:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those Medicaid dollars are
being spent on the people the
program was meant to help,

36:11.300 --> 36:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and not on the people the
program wasn't meant to help.

36:13.533 --> 36:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Back in Los Angeles,
the health department's Dr.
Katz says he has no problem

36:17.800 --> 36:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
working within a budget as
long as it is a fair one.

36:20.533 --> 36:22.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

36:22.166 --> 36:24.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MITCH KATZ: If you
give me flexibility,
I can do a better job.

36:24.500 --> 36:26.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I could do a better
job for less money.

36:26.933 --> 36:29.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I can't do 70
cents on the dollar.

36:29.866 --> 36:32.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Then, I'm actually going
to have to cut services.

36:32.100 --> 36:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: While the health care
debates continue in Washington,
the teams on Skid Row are still

36:39.066 --> 36:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hitting the streets looking
for people to help, and hoping
they can do so for a very

36:42.200 --> 36:43.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
long time.

36:43.733 --> 36:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Cat
Wise in Los Angeles, California.

36:52.700 --> 36:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now let's turn
to the extreme heat wave baking
the West and Southwest parts

37:03.333 --> 37:04.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the country.

37:04.800 --> 37:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Temperatures are well
above the 100-degree mark.

37:07.000 --> 37:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In California, it was 127
degrees yesterday in Death
Valley, 122 in Palm Springs.

37:13.866 --> 37:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Phoenix, the temperature
is expected to top out
at 118 degrees today.

37:16.600 --> 37:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, it's been so hot
there, more than 40 flights
were canceled or delayed because

37:22.933 --> 37:26.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
some planes can't safely
lift off in that heat.

37:26.533 --> 37:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A new analysis published in the
journal "Nature Climate Change"
this week also said climate

37:32.933 --> 37:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
change is leading to more
heat waves in general.

37:35.000 --> 37:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It found that 30 percent of the
world's population is exposed
to potentially deadly heat for

37:40.833 --> 37:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
20 days per year or more.

37:43.100 --> 37:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the subject of our weekly
segment on the Leading Edge
of science with Miles O'Brien.

37:47.400 --> 37:49.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let's start with what's
happening in Phoenix.

37:49.533 --> 37:51.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Miles, you have flown
for a long time.

37:51.666 --> 37:54.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We have always heard of
flights being delayed
because it's too cold.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How can a flight not take
off because it's so hot?

37:56.933 --> 38:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes, Hari, if
it weren't for the snow and
ice, the winter would be the

38:00.200 --> 38:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
perfect time to fly, because
a wing achieves flight, it
derives lift based on the number

38:06.900 --> 38:09.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of air molecules
that surround it.

38:09.133 --> 38:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, as the temperature heat
up, those molecules command.

38:13.433 --> 38:16.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We know that, when you
warm things up, things
expand generally.

38:16.333 --> 38:21.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So there are fewer
air molecules, so it
takes greater amount of
speed for that aircraft

38:21.133 --> 38:23.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to fly.

38:23.133 --> 38:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if the runway isn't long
enough to support that -- in
other words, if the temperature

38:26.100 --> 38:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is so high that there are so
few molecules there to lift
the wing that you don't have

38:30.333 --> 38:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
enough runway to get going
fast enough, you're grounded.

38:33.166 --> 38:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
so this is still smaller
planes that were affected.

38:37.033 --> 38:39.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What's the difference
with the bigger planes?

38:39.033 --> 38:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, the larger
planes, the Boeing 737s, the
big airliners, are designed

38:43.233 --> 38:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to operate in a wider range of
circumstances, for one thing.

38:46.266 --> 38:51.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are kind of a global
product that has to operate in
all kinds of intense conditions.

38:51.000 --> 38:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, frankly, it just
costs more to certify
them to these parameters.

38:55.833 --> 39:00.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In addition, a 737, for example,
has a lot more potential
payload, so you can take off

39:02.000 --> 39:04.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
some cargo and still
fly the mission.

39:04.233 --> 39:09.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
These smaller planes
are not designed with
as much versatility, and
because they're smaller,

39:09.000 --> 39:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have less capability
to reduce the payload
and thus take off.

39:13.266 --> 39:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And really, ultimately, they
have charts in there that a
pilot has to look at, and there

39:17.400 --> 39:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will be a maximum temperature,
given the altitude of
the field, et cetera.

39:21.866 --> 39:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And if you exceed that, you
legally cannot take off.

39:24.900 --> 39:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There are
lots of runways that are too
short to deal with this kind

39:29.366 --> 39:31.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of heat.

39:31.333 --> 39:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we talked about in Phoenix,
but, say, a place like La
Guardia is just as confined

39:33.833 --> 39:37.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
or San Francisco is
just constrained by a
certain amount of space.

39:37.266 --> 39:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes, so
researchers looked at this.

39:38.733 --> 39:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The La Guardia runway is about
7,000 feet, runways there.

39:42.233 --> 39:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And while that's about 20 feet
above sea level, and thus the
air is denser there, by virtue

39:49.166 --> 39:53.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of where it is and it doesn't
get quite as hot, nevertheless,
at that length, you still

39:55.633 --> 39:57.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
- - there are still some
parameters and constraints
that we have to be
watching as the climate

39:57.966 --> 40:00.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gets warmer.

40:00.100 --> 40:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This goes into the larger
subject, Hari, of how our
civilization is designed.

40:03.100 --> 40:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you're thinking about a
beach house on a barrier island
or a runway at La Guardia

40:07.600 --> 40:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or at Phoenix Sky Harbor,
we have a finely-tuned
civilization, and as
the temperature goes

40:14.566 --> 40:17.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up, even though it has only
gone up a degree Celsius over
a hundred years, it does create

40:18.833 --> 40:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pockets of these heat waves.

40:21.466 --> 40:24.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're not exactly sure
why, probably because the
jet stream is weakening
and causing high-pressure

40:24.866 --> 40:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
systems to park in these places.

40:26.766 --> 40:30.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I spoke with a climate
scientist who has looked
into this extensively.

40:30.766 --> 40:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's at Columbia University --
Radley Horton is his name --
as part of a series I did for

40:35.666 --> 40:37.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the weather app MyRadar.

40:37.733 --> 40:40.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RADLEY HORTON, Columbia
University: If we look
at the last decade
or two, we are seeing

40:40.366 --> 40:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
twice as many record-breaking
extreme heat events, cities
that are breaking their daily

40:47.366 --> 40:50.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
record highs for a given day,
compared to the ratio compared
to the number of cities

40:52.000 --> 40:54.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
having record-breaking
cold temperatures.

40:54.166 --> 40:58.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you make temperatures just
a couple degrees warmer on the
hottest days, that means much

40:58.366 --> 41:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more demand for air
conditioning, for
example, which means much
greater risk of the power

41:02.766 --> 41:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going out, precisely at those
temperatures, those times when
people are so sensitive to

41:09.166 --> 41:11.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just a little more warming from
a public health perspective.

41:11.833 --> 41:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That goes a
bit to that Goldilocks effect
you are talking about, because

41:14.933 --> 41:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even our infrastructure and
our systems are built for us
to be within a certain range.

41:19.100 --> 41:21.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Exactly.

41:21.166 --> 41:24.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why we need
to be really watching the
effects of climate change.

41:24.866 --> 41:29.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's easy to dismiss
a one-degree Celsius
increase and say, well,
that's not a big deal,

41:29.833 --> 41:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but, in isolated locations, in
specific locations, whether it's
Phoenix or whether it's Miami

41:36.766 --> 41:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Beach or whether it's another
city that has a sea level
problem that it is dealing with,

41:42.600 --> 41:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or whether it's California
dealing with wildfires,
those particular pockets,
those problems are

41:45.733 --> 41:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exacerbated by that
overall increase in the
temperature of the climate,
the overall temperature

41:52.233 --> 41:54.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the planet.

41:54.333 --> 41:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it causes changes to our
weather systems which we're
just beginning to understand.

42:00.133 --> 42:02.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Researchers are just
getting a handle on it.

42:02.133 --> 42:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So in the
case of this news about Phoenix
and the air -- do airlines,

42:05.333 --> 42:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who think about buying planes
years and years out -- these are
hundreds of millions of dollars'

42:09.433 --> 42:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
worth of purchases -- do they
think differently about what
kind of jets to buy or where to

42:13.266 --> 42:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
park all those jets, in a
place with a long runway?

42:15.766 --> 42:20.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Hari, I
think this is something
the aviation industry
has not gotten out ahead

42:21.233 --> 42:23.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of.

42:23.300 --> 42:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I suspect there are a lot of
conversations going right now
as we have seen this record

42:25.566 --> 42:27.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
heat wave.

42:27.600 --> 42:31.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a similar record
heat wave last year as well
which caused similar problems.

42:31.066 --> 42:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the airlines are going to
have to contend with this, the
airliner makers, and airports

42:36.833 --> 42:38.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as well.

42:38.700 --> 42:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The longest runway at Phoenix
Sky Harbor is a little
more than 11,000 feet.

42:41.500 --> 42:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They might have to think
about extending that runway.

42:43.533 --> 42:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What about La Guardia, though?

42:44.533 --> 42:45.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that even possible?

42:45.766 --> 42:48.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is it possible to
even consider that?

42:48.100 --> 42:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All these things get factored
into the consequences
of climate change and
how we as civilization

42:53.166 --> 42:55.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can adapt to it.

42:55.266 --> 42:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
science correspondent Miles
O'Brien, thanks so much.

43:00.133 --> 43:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: You're welcome.

43:06.333 --> 43:10.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now a
lesson in communication
from an unlikely, but
very familiar source.

43:13.400 --> 43:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the latest addition to
the "NewsHour" Bookshelf.

43:16.033 --> 43:18.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has that.

43:18.133 --> 43:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One enormous
turn in the life of Alan Alda,
his 11- year run in the 1970s

43:24.766 --> 43:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and '80s as the star of
"MASH," one of the most beloved
programs in television history.

43:31.500 --> 43:32.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALAN ALDA, Author, "If
I Understood You, Would
I Have This Look on
My Face?": Hello, and

43:32.733 --> 43:34.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
welcome to "Scientific
American Frontiers."

43:34.800 --> 43:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Another, by
his own account, came in 1993,
when he began to host the PBS

43:39.833 --> 43:42.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
series "Scientific
American Frontiers."

43:42.333 --> 43:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was a non-scientist learning
on the go, using his trademark
humor and wit to get the

43:48.800 --> 43:51.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
experts to explain complicated
ideas in accessible language.

43:51.966 --> 43:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALAN ALDA: What keeps the
water from going in here?

43:54.100 --> 43:55.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I mean, it's...

43:55.333 --> 43:56.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: Well, it's
actually tapered.

43:56.833 --> 43:57.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you look at the hatch,
it's like a porthole.

43:57.666 --> 43:58.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALAN ALDA: Oh, I see.

43:58.966 --> 44:01.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: And pressure
pushes them down.

44:01.133 --> 44:03.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN ALDA: What I brought
to it was curiosity and
a huge fund of ignorance.

44:03.766 --> 44:05.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

44:05.833 --> 44:08.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN ALDA: And I just was
after them until it could fill
up the ignorance a little bit

44:08.566 --> 44:10.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with real stuff.

44:10.566 --> 44:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that process of connecting
with them, getting them to
be who they were, because

44:17.600 --> 44:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they were worried about
getting me to understand it,
so it was much more personal.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's when I realized
that you could build on that.

44:26.733 --> 44:28.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You can help people
do that all the time.

44:28.933 --> 44:31.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
OK, now he's leaving.

44:31.533 --> 44:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: First, he
worked to help scientists
and science writers do
it all the time, helping

44:35.133 --> 44:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to found the Center for
Communicating Science at Stony
Brook University in New York.

44:42.166 --> 44:45.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now comes a book for the rest
of us, with the colorful title
"If I Understood You, Would

44:46.200 --> 44:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I Have This Look on My Face?"

44:48.266 --> 44:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Alan Alda and I met recently at
Lisner Auditorium in Washington
before he gave a talk about

44:54.166 --> 44:56.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the problem and promise
of communicating.

44:56.166 --> 45:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN ALDA: What I think I found
is, that it's all based on a
personal connection, that if

45:02.466 --> 45:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can sort of understand in some
way, make some approximation
of what you are thinking

45:07.900 --> 45:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and feeling, it's easier
for me to get inside your
head with my message.

45:13.433 --> 45:17.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If I don't know how you're
receiving it, if I can't see
how it's landing on you, then

45:17.933 --> 45:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm just spraying it at you.

45:20.033 --> 45:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm just trying to pour it
over your head, but I'm not
really connecting with you.

45:22.733 --> 45:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, that connection -- this
is what I don't understand --
that connection with another

45:27.066 --> 45:28.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
person feels so good.

45:28.933 --> 45:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why do we retreat from it?

45:30.533 --> 45:32.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't understand that.

45:32.666 --> 45:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We're living in
a time where there's not only
skepticism, but even outright

45:36.433 --> 45:40.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hostility from a lot of
people towards science.

45:40.266 --> 45:42.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is that just a
communication problem?

45:42.300 --> 45:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN ALDA: I think it's largely
a communication problem, because
there has to be trust, and

45:49.166 --> 45:53.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you get trust through --
one way you get trust is
through good communication.

45:54.166 --> 45:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are lives at stake.

45:55.233 --> 45:56.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Take doctors.

45:56.266 --> 45:58.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

45:58.233 --> 46:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN ALDA: When patients
regard their doctors as being
empathic, at least one study has

46:04.833 --> 46:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shown that the patients are
19 percent more likely to
follow the doctor's advice.

46:10.566 --> 46:13.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, in that 19 percent, I
imagine some lives are at stake.

46:13.100 --> 46:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes,
so some of this is
life-and-death communication.

46:15.300 --> 46:16.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ALAN ALDA: Yes.

46:16.300 --> 46:17.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

46:17.300 --> 46:19.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

46:19.433 --> 46:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN ALDA: Science needs to
be understood by the public,
so they can support science.

46:22.000 --> 46:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't tell the people I
care about the most the most
important thing I can tell them,

46:28.033 --> 46:30.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that I do care.

46:30.066 --> 46:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For Alda, better
communicating starts with better
person-to-person relating,

46:33.966 --> 46:36.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a concept he had to
learn as a young actor.

46:36.566 --> 46:38.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ALAN ALDA: I knew you
were supposed to relate
in the beginning.

46:38.866 --> 46:40.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

46:40.366 --> 46:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALAN ALDA: And I would do
the best I could to relate.

46:42.433 --> 46:45.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I thought it meant leaning
into the other person's face,
so I was sort of stooped over

46:45.766 --> 46:47.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
most of the time.

46:47.333 --> 46:49.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:49.800 --> 46:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN ALDA: But, little
by little, I realized you
can relate to somebody
on the stage even

46:52.000 --> 46:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
if their back is turned to you.

46:53.533 --> 46:55.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You pick up whatever
clues you can.

46:55.633 --> 46:59.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when you don't have clues
to pick up, you can estimate
what they're probably thinking

46:59.366 --> 47:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by virtue of what's just been
said, or what you have said,
or what you have just written

47:04.133 --> 47:06.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

47:06.133 --> 47:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can picture what the
reader is thinking with
each sentence you put down.

47:10.033 --> 47:12.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It really affects all
forms of communication.

47:12.766 --> 47:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In several
chapters of the book, you
describe these training sessions

47:16.533 --> 47:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that you had with
scientists and many others.

47:18.800 --> 47:21.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But then you talk about
improv classes, right?

47:21.966 --> 47:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Improv, we think of as comedy.

47:23.733 --> 47:25.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALAN ALDA: I know.

47:25.400 --> 47:29.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Most improvisation that
people are aware of is
comedy improvisation.

47:29.066 --> 47:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But that's not what we teach.

47:30.733 --> 47:35.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We teach a much purer
form of improvisation in
the form of exercises.

47:37.100 --> 47:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're all designed one
on top of the other, starting
with a very basic kind of

47:43.200 --> 47:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exercise that enables you to
do the next one, and then that
enables you to do the next one,

47:47.700 --> 47:51.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and they all put you in
touch with the other person.

47:51.166 --> 47:55.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You have to observe the
other person, and really
carefully to improvise.

47:55.300 --> 48:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have to know -- I have to
know, from your body language
and your face, what you're doing

48:01.200 --> 48:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and what you're thinking.

48:02.133 --> 48:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm reading your face right now.

48:03.100 --> 48:04.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's really fun.

48:04.100 --> 48:05.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Let's make it...

48:05.100 --> 48:06.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

48:06.100 --> 48:07.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What's going on?

48:07.100 --> 48:08.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:08.100 --> 48:10.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ALAN ALDA: Yes.

48:10.133 --> 48:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, I hear you following me,
and then I hear you thinking,
I wonder what I will ask

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
next?

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Really?

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You could see that?

48:16.000 --> 48:17.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

48:17.666 --> 48:18.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ALAN ALDA: Yes, from
-- yes, mostly when you
look down at the paper.

48:18.333 --> 48:19.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:19.266 --> 48:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, right.

48:20.066 --> 48:21.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's a dead giveaway.

48:21.000 --> 48:22.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Hmm.

48:22.233 --> 48:23.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALAN ALDA: Yes, but
I'm picking it up.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You know.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's so funny.

48:26.033 --> 48:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Once in a while I will be
talking to somebody and I will
think I'm connected to them.

48:28.766 --> 48:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I will say, wait a second.

48:30.366 --> 48:32.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
In my head, I will say this.

48:32.166 --> 48:33.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What color is his eyes?

48:33.500 --> 48:36.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What color are his eyes?

48:36.233 --> 48:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's the shape of his nose?

48:37.233 --> 48:38.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

48:38.833 --> 48:40.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And then you realize,
what, you're not really
paying attention.

48:40.900 --> 48:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN ALDA: I got -- I realize,
when I think back, there's
been sort of a blob where your

48:43.100 --> 48:44.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
face would -- should be.

48:44.766 --> 48:46.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:46.200 --> 48:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I hope I
haven't dissolved to blobness.

48:48.100 --> 48:50.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALAN ALDA: No, you're
not blobby at all, no.

48:50.066 --> 48:51.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK.

48:51.066 --> 48:53.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

48:53.100 --> 48:55.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's good to know, and also
good to see in his work with
scientists and writers an

48:55.466 --> 48:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attempt to bridge the worlds
of science and the arts.

48:59.433 --> 49:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALAN ALDA: They didn't used
to be kept apart so much.

49:06.433 --> 49:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Science and art, or the arts
and humanities often were --
in Greek times and later, were

49:11.866 --> 49:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
considered to be different
aspects of the same inquiry,
the same exploration of being

49:17.566 --> 49:19.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
alive in the universe.

49:19.766 --> 49:24.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think they're long-lost
lovers, yearning to be reunited.

49:25.900 --> 49:28.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's nothing -- they
should be reunited.

49:28.333 --> 49:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're reuniting them with
this work on communication,
because it's both an
art and a science to

49:34.500 --> 49:38.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
figure out what's the best way
to learn to communicate better.

49:38.766 --> 49:43.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: All
right, Alan Alda's book
is "If I Understood
You, Would I Have This

49:43.533 --> 49:44.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Look on My Face?"

49:44.666 --> 49:45.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's quite a title.

49:45.900 --> 49:47.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALAN ALDA: Well, you
have quite a face.

49:47.666 --> 49:48.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:48.833 --> 49:49.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN:
Thank you very much.

49:49.666 --> 49:50.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALAN ALDA: Thank you.

49:50.666 --> 49:52.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I had fun with you.

49:52.866 --> 49:57.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Nice
to talk to you.

49:58.600 --> 50:01.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALAN ALDA: Thank you.

HARI SREENIVASAN: And to our
"NewsHour" Shares, something
that caught our eye that may be

50:05.566 --> 50:07.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of interest to you, too.

50:07.633 --> 50:12.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This year marks the 60th
anniversary of the debut
of a musical oddity,
the Great Stalacpipe

50:13.500 --> 50:16.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Organ of Virginia's
Luray Caverns.

50:16.033 --> 50:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"NewsHour" recently got a
behind-the-scenes look at the
one-of-a-kind instrument from

50:19.533 --> 50:21.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
those who know it best.

50:21.133 --> 50:25.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Cavern historian John
Shaffer starts us off.

50:25.133 --> 50:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN SHAFFER, Luray
Caverns Corporation: Luray
caverns is home to the
largest musical instrument

50:33.800 --> 50:37.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the world, the
Great Stalacpipe Organ.

50:37.733 --> 50:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it plays the stalactites.

50:42.533 --> 50:46.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The organ was created
by Leland W. Sprinkle.

50:46.133 --> 50:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Sprinkle toured the caverns
in 1954 with his young son,
and, at that time, the guides

50:53.066 --> 50:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would tap stalactites to
show that the different sizes
give off different tones.

50:57.633 --> 51:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LARRY MOYER, Operations Manager:
What he did was take rubber
mallets and a concept of an

51:03.966 --> 51:05.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
organ and put it all
together Into an instrument.

51:05.900 --> 51:07.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm Larry Moyer.

51:07.433 --> 51:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I am operations manager for
the Great Stalacpipe Organ.

51:14.300 --> 51:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're actually standing
inside the organ as it plays,
because the stalactites cover

51:18.566 --> 51:21.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
over three-and-a-half
acres around us.

51:21.433 --> 51:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Basically, we call it
like a player-type piano.

51:25.733 --> 51:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the sheet of plastic is
your song, and as the drum
rotates, the metal brushes fall

51:30.300 --> 51:35.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
into contact through
holes in the plastic
and sends the notes out.

51:36.766 --> 51:38.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, on occasion, we will
have an organist present.

51:38.766 --> 51:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OTTO PEBWORTH, Organist: A pipe
organ produces its sounds by
forcing air through columns.

51:44.966 --> 51:49.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What we are doing here is,
we are actually playing a
37-note percussion instrument.

51:51.133 --> 51:53.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My name is Otto Pebworth.

51:53.166 --> 51:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I play the organ here at Luray
Caverns, and I have been playing
pipe organs now for close

51:59.300 --> 52:03.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to 30 years.

52:03.266 --> 52:07.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's very settling,
very soothing.

52:07.166 --> 52:12.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just have a chance just
to stop and let everything
go quiet and make music.

52:13.466 --> 52:17.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's what makes
it the nicest thing.

52:17.566 --> 52:22.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A room like this lends itself
more towards the more peaceful
things like "Moonlight Sonata"

52:24.733 --> 52:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or some of the Bach preludes.

52:28.966 --> 52:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Stalacpipe Organ is a
totally unique instrument
unto itself, and,
because of that, you can

52:40.433 --> 52:45.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
just hear something that
is just totally natural
and totally special.

52:46.200 --> 52:51.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Can't be duplicated.

52:53.666 --> 52:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
