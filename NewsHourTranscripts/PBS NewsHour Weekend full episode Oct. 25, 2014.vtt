00:28.662 --> 00:30.530

APPEALED FOR CALM FOLLOWING THE

00:52.386 --> 00:53.687
NEWS THAT A NEW YORK DOCTOR WHO

00:53.687 --> 00:55.789
TREATED EBOLA PATIENTS IN AFRICA

00:55.789 --> 00:57.357
HAS BEEN HOSPITALIZED WITH THE

00:57.357 --> 00:59.326
DISEASE HIMSELF.

>> WE HAVE TO BE GUIDED BY THE

01:00.327 --> 01:02.796
FACTS, NOT FEAR.

01:02.796 --> 01:04.665
YESTERDAY, NEW YORKERS SHOWED US

01:04.665 --> 01:05.666
THE WAY.

01:05.666 --> 01:06.733
THEY DID WHAT THEY DO EVERY

01:06.733 --> 01:08.702
DAY-- JUMPING ON BUSES, RIDING

01:08.702 --> 01:10.170
THE SUBWAY, CROWDING INTO

01:10.170 --> 01:11.805
ELEVATORS, HEADING INTO WORK,

01:11.805 --> 01:13.707
GATHERING IN PARKS.

01:13.707 --> 01:16.143
THAT SPIRIT, THAT DETERMINATION

01:16.143 --> 01:17.177
TO CARRY ON IS PART OF WHAT

01:17.177 --> 01:18.211

01:22.282 --> 01:24.084
WAS QUARANTINED AFTER RETURNING

01:24.084 --> 01:25.385
FROM AFRICA, WAS DETERMINED

01:25.385 --> 01:27.354
TODAY NOT TO HAVE EBOLA.

01:27.354 --> 01:28.722
EVEN SO, SHE'LL REMAIN IN

01:28.722 --> 01:31.325
QUARANTINE FOR ANOTHER 20 DAYS.

01:38.365 --> 01:39.866

01:44.771 --> 01:46.974

01:46.974 --> 01:47.708
DAYS.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.609
ILLINOIS TODAY ADOPTED A SIMILAR

01:49.609 --> 01:50.310
POSITION.

01:50.310 --> 01:52.112
THE NEW STATE RULES ARE TOUGHER

01:52.112 --> 01:53.847
THAN THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.182

INVESTIGATING WHAT PROMPTED THE

02:08.862 --> 02:10.130
INCIDENT, WHICH LEFT STILL

02:10.130 --> 02:11.565
ANOTHER TEEN DEAD.

02:11.565 --> 02:12.899
THE GUNMAN, WHO LATER KILLED

02:12.899 --> 02:14.768
HIMSELF, WAS IDENTIFIED AS A 14-

02:14.768 --> 02:16.103
YEAR-OLD FRESHMAN.

02:16.103 --> 02:17.704
HE WAS A COUSIN OF TWO OF THE

02:17.704 --> 02:18.939
PEOPLE HE SHOT.

02:18.939 --> 02:20.607
AUTHORITIES SAID HE USED A 40-

02:20.607 --> 02:22.109
CALIBER HANDGUN THAT WAS

02:22.109 --> 02:23.977
PURCHASED LEGALLY.

02:45.565 --> 02:47.434
AMERICAN TEEN HAD BEEN SHOT DEAD

02:47.434 --> 02:49.036
BY ISRAELI TROOPS.

02:49.036 --> 02:49.970
ISRAELI AUTHORITIES SAID THE

02:49.970 --> 02:51.238
TROOPS OPENED FIRE AFTER THE

02:51.238 --> 02:53.140
TEEN TOSSED A FIREBOMB IN THEIR

OFFICIALS THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS

03:45.592 --> 03:46.827
ABOUT THE EBOLA SCARE.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.161
TONIGHT, WE WANT TO GO INTO MUCH

03:48.161 --> 03:49.362
GREATER DETAIL ABOUT WHEN THE

03:49.362 --> 03:51.198
DISEASE IS DANGEROUS AND WHEN

03:51.198 --> 03:51.998
IT'S NOT.

SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH AT

COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HERE IN NEW

03:57.604 --> 03:58.472
YORK.

03:58.472 --> 04:00.073
FIRST, LET ME I GUESS START WITH

04:00.073 --> 04:02.042
THE NEWS FROM YESTERDAY WHEN THE

04:02.042 --> 04:03.143
TWO GOVERNORS SAID THEY WERE

04:03.143 --> 04:04.611
GOING TO TAKE THESE INCREASED

04:04.611 --> 04:06.313
MEASURES OF QUARANTINING MEDICAL

04:06.313 --> 04:07.481
WORKERS WHO COME BACK FROM THESE

04:07.481 --> 04:08.181
COUNTRIES.

04:08.181 --> 04:10.584
WILL THIS WORK OR IS THIS MORE

04:10.584 --> 04:12.652
OF A SYSTEMATIC RESPONSE TO THE

04:12.652 --> 04:14.020
FEAR THAT PEOPLE HAVE?

04:14.020 --> 04:15.989
>> I THINK LARGELY IT'S

04:15.989 --> 04:17.657
SOMETHING THAT LOOKS GOOD AND

04:17.657 --> 04:19.159
WILL MAKE US FEEL BETTER, BUT I

04:19.159 --> 04:21.128
THINK IT IS LARGELY A RESPONSE

04:21.128 --> 04:22.462
TO THE FEAR.

04:22.462 --> 04:24.331
AFTER ALL, THESE HEALTH CARE

04:24.331 --> 04:26.199
WORKERS, ALTHOUGH THEY MAY BE

04:26.199 --> 04:27.934
THE MOST LIKELY TO BE INFECTED

04:27.934 --> 04:29.436
BECAUSE OF THEIR CLOSE CONTACT

04:29.436 --> 04:32.005
WITH THE PATIENTS, ARE ALSO THE

04:32.005 --> 04:33.406
ONES WHO ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE

04:33.406 --> 04:35.475
RESPONSIBLE TO TAKE THEIR

04:35.475 --> 04:37.177
TEMPERATURE AND BE CAREFUL.

04:37.177 --> 04:38.278
>> Sreenivasan: THERE'S THIS

04:38.278 --> 04:40.347
LINE IN THE SAND ABOUT

04:40.347 --> 04:42.215
SYMPTOMATIC VERSUS ASYMPTOMATIC,

04:42.215 --> 04:43.083
THAT PEOPLE ARE CONTAGIOUS WHEN

04:43.083 --> 04:44.050
THEY'RE SYSTEMATIC.

04:44.050 --> 04:45.785
HOW DO WE KNOW ABOUT EBOLA THAT

04:45.785 --> 04:48.088
IT IS NOT CONTAGIOUS BEFORE THE

04:48.088 --> 04:50.624
VICTIM STARTS SHOWING SYMPTOMS?

04:50.624 --> 04:52.058
>> WELL, EVERYTHING WE KNOW

04:52.058 --> 04:54.027
ABOUT EBOLA IS BASED ON THE

04:54.027 --> 04:57.197
EXPERIENCE OF 24 EPIDEMICS FROM

04:57.197 --> 04:59.332
1976 ON.

04:59.332 --> 05:01.168
THE VIRUS, I DON'T THINK, HAS

05:01.168 --> 05:02.569
CHANGED THAT SIGNIFICANTLY.

05:02.569 --> 05:05.205
AND GENERALLY, THESE DON'T

05:05.205 --> 05:06.039
CHANGE THAT MUCH.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.507
SO WHAT WE DO KNOW FROM PAST

05:07.507 --> 05:11.044
EXPERIENCE IS IT REQUIRES DIRECT

05:11.044 --> 05:13.680
CONTACT WITH INFECTED BODILY

05:13.680 --> 05:15.982
FLUIDS OF THE PATIENT, OR

05:15.982 --> 05:18.051
SOMETIMES IN THE CASE OF THOSE

05:18.051 --> 05:20.820
WHO SUCCUMB, THE CORPSE, THE

05:20.820 --> 05:22.756
SKIN CAN ALSO BE INFECTIOUS.

05:22.756 --> 05:25.192
SO IF THEY'RE NOT BLEEDING OR

05:25.192 --> 05:26.826
VOMITING OR DOING ANY OF THOSE

05:26.826 --> 05:27.961
OTHER THINGS, THERE ARE NO

05:27.961 --> 05:30.330
INFECTED LIQUIDS TO COME IN

05:30.330 --> 05:32.566
CONTACT WITH, THE LIKELIHOOD IS

05:32.566 --> 05:34.301
VERY GREAT THAT THEY'RE NOT

05:34.301 --> 05:35.402
GOING TO BE ABLE TO INFECT

05:35.402 --> 05:36.836
ANYONE UNTIL THEY SHOW SYMPTOMS.

05:36.836 --> 05:37.938
>> Sreenivasan: ONE OF THE

05:37.938 --> 05:39.439
CONCERNS HAS BEEN HOW VIRUSES

05:39.439 --> 05:40.907
HAVE MUTATED IN THE PAST.

05:40.907 --> 05:44.110
IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OF THE

05:44.110 --> 05:45.679
POSSIBILITY THAT THIS VIRUS

05:45.679 --> 05:47.013
COULD MUTATE INTO SOMETHING

05:47.013 --> 05:48.448
THAT'S NOT JUST TRANSMITTED FROM

05:48.448 --> 05:50.417
BODILY FLUIDS BUT SOMETHING THAT

05:50.417 --> 05:52.752
COULD BE TRANSMITTED BY AIR OR

05:52.752 --> 05:54.221
ANY OTHER WAY?

05:54.221 --> 05:55.121
>> WELL, ALL OF THESE VIRUSES

05:55.121 --> 05:56.289
MUTATE.

05:56.289 --> 05:59.426
HIV DOES, INFLUENZA DOES, AND,

05:59.426 --> 06:00.894
EBOLA, OF COURSE, HAS BEEN

06:00.894 --> 06:03.530
STUDIED RECENTLY AND A NUMBER OF

06:03.530 --> 06:05.265
MUTATIONS HAVE BEEN SHOWN BUT WE

06:05.265 --> 06:08.034
DON'T HAVE ANY EXAMPLE EVER OF

06:08.034 --> 06:09.669
ANY VIRUS THAT WHATEVER

06:09.669 --> 06:11.972
MUTATIONS IT'S UNDERGONE HAS

06:11.972 --> 06:14.341
CHANGED IN ITS ROUTE OF

06:14.341 --> 06:15.575
TRANSMISSION.

06:15.575 --> 06:17.310
HIV HAS HAD MANY OPPORTUNITIES

06:17.310 --> 06:19.779
TO DO THAT, AND IT STILL HASN'T

06:19.779 --> 06:21.748
REALLY FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED IN

06:21.748 --> 06:22.849
THAT RESPECT.

06:22.849 --> 06:26.286
WITH EBOLA, IT MAY NOT BE SO

06:26.286 --> 06:29.155
MUCH MUTATION OR THE AMOUNT OF

06:29.155 --> 06:30.657
MUTATION BUT, YOU KNOW, JUST

06:30.657 --> 06:32.292
SIMPLY THE EXPERIENCE WE HAVE

06:32.292 --> 06:33.693
WITH IT SUGGESTS THAT IT'S NOT

06:33.693 --> 06:35.161
GOING TO CHANGE THAT MUCH.

06:35.161 --> 06:36.162
>> Sreenivasan: OKAY, I'D

06:36.162 --> 06:36.963
LIKE TO DISCUSS A COUPLE OF THE

06:36.963 --> 06:38.331
SCENARIOS THAT NEW YORKERS HERE

06:38.331 --> 06:39.599
WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT AND

06:39.599 --> 06:40.867
PERHAPS ABSTRACT FROM THAT

06:40.867 --> 06:41.735
SOMETHING THAT THE REST OF THE

06:41.735 --> 06:42.669
COUNTRY COULD LEARN.

06:42.669 --> 06:46.840
IF THIS DOCTOR WAS STANDING A

06:46.840 --> 06:49.442
FOOT AWAY ON A SUBWAY CAR OR IF

06:49.442 --> 06:51.478
I HAD TAKEN THE TAXI AFTER HE

06:51.478 --> 06:53.446
USED IT, WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF

06:53.446 --> 06:55.882
GETTING IT IF HE WAS SHOWING

06:55.882 --> 06:57.450
SYMPTOMS VERSUS IF HE WAS NOT?

06:57.450 --> 06:59.653
IF THERE WERE SYMPTOMS AND IF,

06:59.653 --> 07:01.254
FOR EXAMPLE, HE HAD LEFT SOME

07:01.254 --> 07:02.989
BLOOD BEHIND OR VOMITED OR

07:02.989 --> 07:04.824
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, THEN THERE

07:04.824 --> 07:06.459
MIGHT BE SOME RISK, ESPECIALLY

07:06.459 --> 07:08.995
IF ONE HAPPENED TO TOUCH IT, OR

07:08.995 --> 07:12.432
TOUCH IT TO THEIR EYES OR NOSE,

07:12.432 --> 07:16.102
BUT IN MOST CASES, THERE IS VERY

07:16.102 --> 07:17.137
LITTLE RISK.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.238
AND IF THERE ARE NO SYMPTOMS

07:18.238 --> 07:19.739
THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY OF THIS

07:19.739 --> 07:21.374
MATERIAL TO LEAVE BEHIND.

07:21.374 --> 07:23.276
AND THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH VIRUS

07:23.276 --> 07:25.478
IN SWEAT DURING THE EARLY

07:25.478 --> 07:26.379
STAGES.

07:26.379 --> 07:27.981
SO I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY

07:27.981 --> 07:30.083
UNLIKELY, IN FACT ALMOST

07:30.083 --> 07:31.318
IMPOSSIBLE, FOR SOMEONE TO GET

07:31.318 --> 07:33.920
INFECTED BY AN ASYMPTOMATIC

07:33.920 --> 07:35.488
PATIENT, ONE WHO HAS NOT YET

07:35.488 --> 07:36.990
SHOWN SYMPTOMS OF DISEASE.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.058
>> Sreenivasan: ONE OF THE

07:38.058 --> 07:39.526
CONCERNS HERE FOR EXAMPLE IF HE

07:39.526 --> 07:40.960
HAD TOUCHED A SPECIFIC BOWLING

07:40.960 --> 07:41.961
BALL AND IF SOMEBODY ELSE HAD

07:41.961 --> 07:43.196
TOUCHED THAT, RIGHT?

07:43.196 --> 07:44.831
AGAIN, IT HAS TO BE BLOOD OR

07:44.831 --> 07:45.932
VOMIT OR SOMETHING ELSE?

07:45.932 --> 07:47.667
>> YES, IN GENERAL, AND IN

07:47.667 --> 07:49.569
GENERAL, THEY HAVE TO HAVE HAD

07:49.569 --> 07:50.970
SYMPTOMS ALREADY.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.405
AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES

07:52.405 --> 07:53.973
THAT I THINK BEAR THIS OUT.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.976
ONE OF THE MOST SEVERELY ILL

07:56.976 --> 07:59.346
PATIENTS, PATRICK SAWYER, FLEW

07:59.346 --> 08:02.782
FROM MONROVIA, SICK AS COULD BE.

08:02.782 --> 08:04.451
HE WAS SO SICK HE COULD BARELY

08:04.451 --> 08:08.088
GET ON THE PLANE TO LAGOS,

08:08.088 --> 08:10.123
NIGERIA, WHERE HE THOUGHT HE HAD

08:10.123 --> 08:11.958
TO GO TO A MEETING AND INSISTED

08:11.958 --> 08:12.859
ON GOING.

08:12.859 --> 08:15.428
AND THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT

08:15.428 --> 08:18.531
ACTUALLY DID CONTACT TRACING AND

08:18.531 --> 08:21.735
FOUND ALL THE ONES THEY COULD OF

08:21.735 --> 08:23.136
THE OTHER PASSENGERS ON THE

08:23.136 --> 08:23.937
PLANE.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.939
I THINK THEY FOUND 56 OTHER

08:25.939 --> 08:28.041
PASSENGERS, AND NOT A SINGLE ONE

08:28.041 --> 08:29.709
HAD BECOME INFECTED.

08:29.709 --> 08:32.078
SO IT'S-- UNLESS YOU'RE REALLY

08:32.078 --> 08:33.313
GETTING VERY CLOSE, LIKE THE

08:33.313 --> 08:34.948
HEALTH CARE WORKERS WHO ARE

08:34.948 --> 08:36.483
TAKING CARE OF THE PATIENTS,

08:36.483 --> 08:37.684
IT'S JUST NOT THAT EASY TO

08:37.684 --> 08:38.651
CATCH.

08:38.651 --> 08:39.686
>> Sreenivasan: SO THERE WAS A

08:39.686 --> 08:40.787
LOT OF CONCERN IN NEW YORK WHEN

08:40.787 --> 08:42.355
INITIALLY THAT FIRST NIGHT WE

08:42.355 --> 08:44.224
HEARD THIS PATIENT HAD A 103

08:44.224 --> 08:45.759
TEMPERATURE, AND THEN IT WAS

08:45.759 --> 08:48.061
CLARIFIED THAT IT WAS 100.3.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.929
WHAT'S THE TEMPERATURE THAT WE

08:49.929 --> 08:51.865
SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT?

08:51.865 --> 08:53.133
>> WELL, THIS DEPENDS, OF

08:53.133 --> 08:54.868
COURSE, WHAT YOUR NORMAL BODY

08:54.868 --> 08:56.236
TEMPERATURE IS BECAUSE SOME

08:56.236 --> 08:57.804
PEOPLE MAY HAVE A LITTLE BIT

08:57.804 --> 08:59.773
LOW, OR A LITTLE BIT HIGH FROM

08:59.773 --> 09:00.974
THE TEXTBOOK.

09:00.974 --> 09:06.980
BUT 103 IS CERTAINLY, AS IN THE

09:06.980 --> 09:10.450
DUNCAN CASE, 103 WOULD BE

09:10.450 --> 09:12.051
CERTAINLY SOMETHING I WOULD BE

09:12.051 --> 09:13.620
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT.

09:13.620 --> 09:16.756
100.3 I THINK IS STILL SOMETHING

09:16.756 --> 09:18.391
TO CONSIDER GIVEN HIS

09:18.391 --> 09:20.760
CIRCUMSTANCES; HE PROBABLY KNEW

09:20.760 --> 09:21.795
THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING

09:21.795 --> 09:22.529
SIGNIFICANT.

09:22.529 --> 09:24.164
ORDINARILY, YOU MIGHT THINK YOU

09:24.164 --> 09:25.999
WERE COMING DOWN WITH A COLD OR

09:25.999 --> 09:28.201
THE FLU OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

09:28.201 --> 09:29.335
BUT IF YOU HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT

09:29.335 --> 09:32.705
WITH EBOLA-INFECTED PATIENTS YOU

09:32.705 --> 09:34.874
MIGHT HAVE A LOWER THRESHOLD FOR

09:34.874 --> 09:36.342
BEING CONCERNED AND DOING

09:36.342 --> 09:37.577
SOMETHING.

09:37.577 --> 09:38.578
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

09:38.578 --> 09:39.512
DR. STEPHEN MORSE FROM THE

09:39.512 --> 09:40.613
MAILMAN SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH

09:40.613 --> 09:41.548
AT COLUMBIA UNIVESITY, THANKS SO

09:41.548 --> 09:42.415
MUCH.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.650
>> THANK YOU.

09:53.526 --> 09:54.561
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW TO OUR

09:54.561 --> 09:56.663
SIGNATURE SEGMENT.

09:56.663 --> 09:58.231
TONIGHT, WE EXPLORE A TOPIC THAT

09:58.231 --> 09:59.866
AFFECTS MILLIONS OF PARENTS

09:59.866 --> 10:01.401
ACROSS THE NATION, THOSE WHOSE

10:01.401 --> 10:02.502
CHILDREN PLAY SOCCER.

10:02.502 --> 10:03.837
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CONSIDERED A

10:03.837 --> 10:04.871
SAFE ALTERNATIVE TO FOOTBALL,

10:04.871 --> 10:06.239
BUT AT LEAST ONE LEADING

10:06.239 --> 10:07.807
NEUROSURGEON AND ONE OF

10:07.807 --> 10:09.676
AMERICA'S BEST-KNOWN SOCCER

10:09.676 --> 10:11.377
STARS NOW BELIEVE THE GAME POSES

10:11.377 --> 10:12.545
RISKS NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD

10:12.545 --> 10:13.913
BEFORE, THE LINK BETWEEN HEADING

10:13.913 --> 10:16.249
AND CONCUSSIONS.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.784
IN FACT, SOCCER IS ONE OF THE

10:17.784 --> 10:19.052
LEADING CAUSES OF CONCUSSIONS

10:19.052 --> 10:20.920
AMONG KIDS PLAYING SPORTS.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.056
HOW GREAT ARE THE RISKS?

10:23.056 --> 10:23.890
THE NEWSHOUR'S WILLIAM BRANGHAM,

10:23.890 --> 10:25.291
WHOSE THREE KIDS PLAY SOCCER,

10:25.291 --> 10:30.430
WENT LOOKING FOR ANSWERS.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.130
>> ALL RIGHT, HERE, MY MAN, WE

10:31.130 --> 10:32.398
ARE JUST GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT

10:32.398 --> 10:36.402
YOUR EARS.

10:36.402 --> 10:37.337
>> Reporter: DR. RICHARD FLYER

10:37.337 --> 10:38.438
HAS BEEN MY FAMILY'S

10:38.438 --> 10:39.439
PEDIATRICIAN FOR 13 YEARS, AND,

10:39.439 --> 10:40.373
TO BE TOTALLY HONEST, I LOVE THE

10:40.373 --> 10:41.040
GUY.

10:41.040 --> 10:41.908
I ADMIRE HIM AND I TRUST HIM.

10:41.908 --> 10:43.443
BUT THREE YEARS AGO, WHEN MY SON

10:43.443 --> 10:44.444
JACK WAS TEN, FLYER SAID

10:44.444 --> 10:47.280
SOMETHING THAT FLOORED US.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.882
HE TOLD JACK HE WANTED HIM TO

10:48.882 --> 10:51.818
STOP PLAYING SOCCER, COMPLETELY.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.419
FLYER ARGUED THAT THE DOZENS AND

10:53.419 --> 10:55.555
DOZENS OF KIDS HE'D SEEN WITH

10:55.555 --> 10:57.123
SERIOUS, SOMETIMES LIFE-ALTERING

10:57.123 --> 10:58.358
CONCUSSIONS-- SOME OF THEM FROM

10:58.358 --> 11:00.226
HEADING THE BALL-- HAD CONVINCED

11:00.226 --> 11:01.427
HIM THAT SOCCER ITSELF WAS NOT

11:01.427 --> 11:03.630
SAFE.

11:03.630 --> 11:05.598
>> WE NEED TO LOOK AT THESE

11:05.598 --> 11:07.634
SPORTS REALISTICALLY AND SAY,

11:07.634 --> 11:08.902
"ARE THEY REALLY SOMETHING WE

11:08.902 --> 11:10.837
WANT OUR CHILDREN TO DO?"

11:10.837 --> 11:12.939
DO WE WANT TO, IN THE NAME OF

11:12.939 --> 11:13.840
SPORT, PUT A CHILD'S BRAIN IN

11:13.840 --> 11:15.875
HARM'S WAY?

11:15.875 --> 11:17.143
>> Reporter: FLYER'S WARNING GOT

11:17.143 --> 11:20.780
ME AND MY WIFE TORY TO TAKE A

11:20.780 --> 11:21.548
LONG AND UNCOMFORTABLE LOOK AT

11:21.548 --> 11:22.315
WHETHER THE SPORT OUR THREE KIDS

11:22.315 --> 11:23.750
LOVE IS SAFE.

11:23.750 --> 11:24.851
THE BENEFITS THEY GET OUT OF THE

11:24.851 --> 11:26.119
GAME?

11:26.119 --> 11:28.588
THOSE ARE OBVIOUS, BUT ARE THEY

11:28.588 --> 11:30.023
WORTH THE RISKS OF A SERIOUS

11:30.023 --> 11:30.890
INJURY?

11:30.890 --> 11:31.891
FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS, WE'VE

11:31.891 --> 11:32.659
BEEN STRUGGLING WITH A DILEMMA

11:32.659 --> 11:33.526
THAT'S FACING REALLY MILLIONS OF

11:33.526 --> 11:34.928
PARENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.896
>> I JUST FEEL REALLY CONFUSED

11:36.896 --> 11:40.400
AND WORRIED AND JUST UNSURE WHAT

11:40.400 --> 11:42.101
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO NOW.

11:42.101 --> 11:43.102
>> Reporter: IT'S IMPORTANT TO

11:43.102 --> 11:43.970
SAY THAT WE BECAME A SOCCER

11:43.970 --> 11:46.339
FAMILY PARTLY BY DESIGN.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.840
OUR THREE KIDS ARE JACK, WHO'S

11:47.840 --> 11:49.142
13, GAVIN IS 11, AND ALLY IS

11:49.142 --> 11:51.077
NINE.

11:51.077 --> 11:52.078
WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE, THEY ALL

11:52.078 --> 11:53.446
TRIED A LOT OF DIFFERENT SPORTS,

11:53.446 --> 11:54.914
BUT WHEN IT CAME TIME TO

11:54.914 --> 11:56.950
OFFICIALLY JOIN A TEAM, WE

11:56.950 --> 11:59.152
REALLY STEERED THEM TO SOCCER,

11:59.152 --> 11:59.986
WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS A "SAFE"

11:59.986 --> 12:00.920
SPORT COMPARED TO SOMETHING LIKE

12:00.920 --> 12:03.389
FOOTBALL.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.224
>> BROWN LEFT WITH THE GAME WITH

12:05.224 --> 12:06.593
A CONCUSSION.

12:06.593 --> 12:08.061
>> I THINK I KNEW ENOUGH, AND

12:08.061 --> 12:09.596
THIS WAS NOW 10 YEARS AGO, TO

12:09.596 --> 12:11.297
>> I THINK I KNEW ENOUGH-- AND

12:11.297 --> 12:12.332
THIS IS NOW TEN YEARS AGO-- TO

12:12.332 --> 12:13.266
KNOW THAT FOOTBALL WASN'T REALLY

12:13.266 --> 12:14.133
AN OPTION FOR OUR KIDS.

12:14.133 --> 12:15.234
>> Reporter: BECAUSE IT WASN'T

12:15.234 --> 12:16.002
SAFE.

12:16.002 --> 12:16.869
>> BECAUSE IT WAS CONSIDERED

12:16.869 --> 12:17.704
UNSAFE.

12:17.704 --> 12:18.504
>> Reporter: THEN, IN 2008, THAT

12:18.504 --> 12:19.839
IDEA WAS DRIVEN HOME BY AN AWFUL

12:19.839 --> 12:21.608
TRAGEDY IN OUR TOWN.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.576
A 16 YEAR-OLD FOOTBALL PLAYER AT

12:23.576 --> 12:25.111
MONTCLAIR HIGH SCHOOL, RYNE

12:25.111 --> 12:26.012
DOUGHERTY, DIED FROM A BRAIN

12:26.012 --> 12:27.313
HEMORRHAGE HE GOT TACKLING

12:27.313 --> 12:28.848
DURING A GAME.

12:28.848 --> 12:29.749
THREE WEEKS BEFORE, HE'D HAD

12:29.749 --> 12:30.783
ANOTHER HARD HIT AND A

12:30.783 --> 12:32.518
CONCUSSION.

12:32.518 --> 12:33.519
THE WHOLE TOWN WAS REALLY SHAKEN

12:33.519 --> 12:34.887
UP BY HIS DEATH.

12:34.887 --> 12:35.989
DID WE CONSOLE OURSELVES,

12:35.989 --> 12:37.256
THINKING, WELL, THAT COULDN'T

12:37.256 --> 12:38.257
HAPPEN TO OUR KIDS?

12:38.257 --> 12:39.025
I DON'T KNOW.

12:39.025 --> 12:42.195
MAYBE.

12:42.195 --> 12:42.929
BUT WE KEPT SIGNING THE KIDS UP,

12:42.929 --> 12:43.963
AND THEY WERE PLAYING AND LOVING

12:43.963 --> 12:48.034
SOCCER.

12:48.034 --> 12:49.636
>> I REALLY LIKE PLAYING, HOW

12:49.636 --> 12:50.837
THERE ARE POSITIONS, BECAUSE

12:50.837 --> 12:52.271
THERE'S, LIKE, A SPECIAL THING

12:52.271 --> 12:53.706
THAT YOU HAVE TO DO WHEN YOU'RE

12:53.706 --> 12:55.174
DOING IT SO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE

12:55.174 --> 12:56.676
AN IMPORTANT PART OF IT.

12:56.676 --> 13:00.413
>> YOU GET TO MOVE AROUND A LOT,

13:00.413 --> 13:03.349
AND THAT YOU HAVE TO BE A GOOD

13:03.349 --> 13:04.717
TEAM, NOT JUST BE COMPOSED OF

13:04.717 --> 13:05.385
GOOD PLAYERS.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.319
>> SOCCER IS JUST THE BEST SPORT

13:06.319 --> 13:07.453
THERE IS, PERIOD.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.588
>> Reporter: THAT SAID, I CAN'T

13:08.588 --> 13:09.422
PRETEND THAT DR. FLYER'S

13:09.422 --> 13:10.356
WARNINGS WEREN'T ALWAYS

13:10.356 --> 13:11.257
SOMEWHERE IN THE BACK OF OUR

13:11.257 --> 13:13.993
MINDS.

13:13.993 --> 13:16.029
IN 2012, ONE OF JACK'S SOCCER

13:16.029 --> 13:17.330
MATES, A BOY NAMED NICK GRAHAM,

13:17.330 --> 13:19.032
WENT UP FOR A HEADER, FELL TO

13:19.032 --> 13:20.266
THE GROUND AND SUFFERED SUCH A

13:20.266 --> 13:21.534
SEVERE CONCUSSION THAT HIS

13:21.534 --> 13:22.468
HEADACHES AND DIZZINESS DIDN'T

13:22.468 --> 13:23.903
GET BETTER FOR MONTHS.

13:23.903 --> 13:24.937
NICK LEFT THE TEAM AND HASN'T

13:24.937 --> 13:27.440
PLAYED SINCE.

13:27.440 --> 13:30.910
WITHIN THE LAST YEAR, AT LEAST

13:30.910 --> 13:32.278
THREE OF JACK'S TEAMMATES HAVE

13:32.278 --> 13:33.246
SUFFERED CONCUSSIONS.

13:33.246 --> 13:33.980
DID THAT MAKE US THINK ABOUT

13:33.980 --> 13:34.814
TAKING JACK OR ANY OF OUR KIDS

13:34.814 --> 13:35.815
OUT OF SOCCER?

13:35.815 --> 13:38.618
HONESTLY, NO.

13:38.618 --> 13:40.820
SEEING THEM LEARN THE VALUE OF

13:40.820 --> 13:41.988
HARD WORK AND DEDICATION, HOW TO

13:41.988 --> 13:43.589
HANDLE THE SUCCESSES AND THE

13:43.589 --> 13:44.724
FAILURES, IT ALL SEEMED WORTH IT

13:44.724 --> 13:45.925
TO US.

13:45.925 --> 13:47.960
>> IN THIS DAY AND AGE, THERE'S

13:47.960 --> 13:49.295
SO MANY WARNINGS, PARENTAL

13:49.295 --> 13:50.463
WARNINGS.

13:50.463 --> 13:52.532
IT'S NOT SAFE TO WALK TO SCHOOL,

13:52.532 --> 13:54.000
IT'S NOT SAFE TO DRINK THAT

13:55.001 --> 13:56.302
THAT SCREEN.

13:56.302 --> 13:58.971
THERE'S SO MANY "NO'S."

13:58.971 --> 14:00.506
AND QUITE FRANKLY, SOME OF THE

14:00.506 --> 14:01.974
THINGS IN LIFE THAT ARE THE MOST

14:01.974 --> 14:02.875
FUN AND ARE MOST REWARDING HAVE

14:02.875 --> 14:06.012
SOME RISK INVOLVED.

14:06.012 --> 14:10.683

14:11.918 --> 14:13.052
WHAT I'M SAYING IS, SOCCER IS

14:13.052 --> 14:14.020
FUN AND IT'S THRILLING AND IT'S

14:14.020 --> 14:14.854
EXCITING AN...

14:18.658 --> 14:19.792
TO TAKE THAT AWAY FROM THEM.

14:19.792 --> 14:20.893
>> Reporter: BUT THEN, DURING

14:20.893 --> 14:24.197
THE 2014 WORLD CUP, WHICH WE

14:24.197 --> 14:24.964
LOVED BUT ALSO WHERE WE SAW SOME

14:24.964 --> 14:25.998
OF THOSE REALLY BRUTAL BLOWS TO

14:25.998 --> 14:27.533
THE HEAD, I READ THIS STORY

14:27.533 --> 14:29.202
ABOUT A MOVEMENT TO TAKE HEADING

14:29.202 --> 14:30.636
OUT OF KID'S SOCCER BECAUSE OF

14:30.636 --> 14:33.206
CONCERN OVER CONCUSSIONS.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.373
I RAISED THIS QUESTION WITH A

14:34.373 --> 14:35.541
FRIEND WHO'S SPENT HIS ENTIRE

14:35.541 --> 14:36.909
LIFE AROUND THE GAME.

14:36.909 --> 14:37.610
DECLAN CARNEY WAS BORN IN

14:37.610 --> 14:39.312
IRELAND.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.513
HE MANAGES MY SON JACK'S TEAM,

14:40.513 --> 14:41.247
AND OUR SONS HAVE PLAYED

14:41.247 --> 14:42.882
TOGETHER FOR SEVERAL YEARS.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.417
>> THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT

14:44.417 --> 14:46.018
CONCUSSIONS NEED TO BE DEALT

14:46.018 --> 14:47.253
WITH AND NEED TO BE TAKEN VERY

14:47.253 --> 14:48.888
SERIOUSLY WHENEVER THEY HAPPEN.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.257
BUT IF SOCCER, HEADING A SOCCER

14:51.257 --> 14:52.892
BALL WAS ACTUALLY A REAL DANGER

14:52.892 --> 14:54.660
OF SOME SORT OF BRAIN INJURY, I

14:54.660 --> 14:56.429
THINK IT WOULD'VE EXHIBITED

14:56.429 --> 14:58.531
ITSELF SOMEWHERE IN MEDICAL

14:58.531 --> 15:00.533
HISTORY IN EUROPE OR IN SOUTH

15:00.533 --> 15:02.301
AMERICA OR IN ASIA, WHERE PEOPLE

15:02.301 --> 15:04.670
PLAY SOCCER PRETTY MUCH ALL

15:04.670 --> 15:07.140
THEIR LIFE AND HAVE DONE FOR THE

15:07.140 --> 15:09.175
LAST 80, 100 YEARS.

15:09.175 --> 15:09.976
AND I DON'T THINK THE SCIENCE

15:09.976 --> 15:12.578
SAYS IT'S THERE.

15:12.578 --> 15:13.412
>> Reporter: I CHECKED, AND

15:13.412 --> 15:14.447
DECLAN IS RIGHT; THERE AREN'T

15:14.447 --> 15:16.215
ANY LARGE-SCALE, LONG TERM

15:16.215 --> 15:17.550
STUDIES CONNECTING SOCCER TO

15:17.550 --> 15:19.018
BRAIN INJURY AMONG THE MILLIONS

15:19.018 --> 15:20.286
OF SOCCER PLAYERS IN EUROPE OR

15:20.286 --> 15:21.888
SOUTH AMERICA OR ASIA.

15:21.888 --> 15:23.956
BUT THAT ARTICLE I READ CITED

15:23.956 --> 15:25.591
ONE SMALL AMERICAN STUDY SHOWING

15:25.591 --> 15:26.893
THAT ADULT AMATEUR SOCCER

15:26.893 --> 15:28.628
PLAYERS WHO HEADED THE BALL A

15:28.628 --> 15:30.830
LOT-- BETWEEN ABOUT 900 AND

15:30.830 --> 15:32.431
1,500 TIMES A YEAR-- SHOWED

15:32.431 --> 15:34.300
ABNORMALITIES IN THEIR BRAINS

15:34.300 --> 15:35.067
REPRESENTED HERE BY THE RED AND

15:35.067 --> 15:37.036
YELLOW SECTIONS.

15:37.036 --> 15:38.271
THESE ARE EFFECTS SIMILAR TO

15:38.271 --> 15:39.972
WHAT YOU'D SEE IN CONCUSSIONS,

15:39.972 --> 15:42.008
BUT MANY OF THESE PLAYERS SAID

15:42.008 --> 15:43.743
THEY HADN'T HAD CONCUSSIONS.

15:43.743 --> 15:45.178
THE SUGGESTION BEING THAT BRAIN

15:45.178 --> 15:47.613
TRAUMA MIGHT BE OCCURRING FROM A

15:47.613 --> 15:48.581
LOT OF HEADING WITHOUT OBVIOUS

15:48.581 --> 15:50.349
SYMPTOMS.

15:50.349 --> 15:55.021
KEEP IN MIND, 900 TO 1,500

15:55.021 --> 15:55.922
HEADERS A YEAR IS FAR MORE THAN

15:55.922 --> 15:57.089
ANY KID I KNOW EVER HEADS THE

15:57.089 --> 15:57.824
BALL, EVEN WITH REGULAR

15:57.824 --> 15:58.724
PRACTICE.

15:58.724 --> 15:59.625
BUT THAT ARTICLE ALSO QUOTED

15:59.625 --> 16:02.428
THIS MAN, DR. ROBERT CANTU.

16:02.428 --> 16:04.096
HE'S A NEUROSURGEON, CO-DIRECTS

16:04.096 --> 16:05.798
A BRAIN STUDY CENTER AT BOSTON

16:05.798 --> 16:07.166
UNIVERSITY, AND IS ONE OF THE

16:07.166 --> 16:08.100
NATION'S TOP EXPERTS ON YOUTH

16:08.100 --> 16:10.136
CONCUSSIONS.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.404
CANTU ACKNOWLEDGES THE SCIENCE

16:11.404 --> 16:12.738
CONNECTING SOCCER WITH BRAIN

16:12.738 --> 16:14.707
INJURY IS LIMITED.

16:14.707 --> 16:15.875
HE'S IN FACT CALLED FOR MUCH

16:15.875 --> 16:17.243
MORE RESEARCH.

16:17.243 --> 16:18.845
BUT EVEN SO, HE THINKS IT'S

16:18.845 --> 16:20.046
BETTER TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY AND

16:20.046 --> 16:21.047
NOT ALLOW YOUNG KIDS TO HEAD THE

16:21.047 --> 16:23.616
BALL.

16:23.616 --> 16:24.750
>> IF YOU TOOK HEADING OUT OF

16:24.750 --> 16:26.252
SOCCER, IT WOULDN'T BE BEHIND

16:26.252 --> 16:27.019
FOOTBALL IN THE INCIDENCE OF

16:27.019 --> 16:28.054
CONCUSSION.

16:28.054 --> 16:29.322
IT WOULDN'T EVEN BE IN THE HIGH-

16:29.322 --> 16:31.157
RISK GROUP.

16:31.157 --> 16:33.392
IT WOULD BE IN A LOW-RISK GROUP.

16:33.392 --> 16:35.595
>> Reporter: CANTU TOLD ME THAT

16:35.595 --> 16:38.097
HEADING THE BALL AS WELL AS THE

16:38.097 --> 16:40.233
COLLISIONS AND THE HARD FALLS TO

16:40.233 --> 16:41.367
THE GROUND THAT OFTEN ACCOMPANY

16:41.367 --> 16:42.368
THEM ARE PROBLEMATIC FOR KIDS

16:42.368 --> 16:44.503
BECAUSE UNLIKE ADULT BRAINS,

16:44.503 --> 16:45.438
KIDS' BRAINS ARE STILL

16:45.438 --> 16:46.172
DEVELOPING.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.206
>> THE YOUNG BRAIN IS LARGELY

16:47.206 --> 16:48.741
NOT MYELINATED.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.509
MYELIN IS THE COATING OF NERVE

16:50.509 --> 16:52.812
FIBERS THAT CONNECT NERVE CELLS,

16:52.812 --> 16:53.479
SIMILAR TO COATING ON A

16:53.479 --> 16:55.348
TELEPHONE WIRE.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.048
IT HELPS TRANSMISSION, BUT IT

16:56.048 --> 16:58.517
ALSO GIVES STRENGTH.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.019
AND SO, WHEN YOU VIOLENTLY SHAKE

17:00.019 --> 17:01.721
THE YOUNG BRAIN, YOU HAVE A MUCH

17:01.721 --> 17:04.190
GREATER CHANCE TO DISRUPT NERVE

17:04.190 --> 17:05.892
FIBERS AND THEIR CONNECTIONS

17:05.892 --> 17:07.260
THAN YOU DO AN ADULT BRAIN.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.095
>> Reporter: AND THERE'S THIS:

17:09.095 --> 17:10.796
A KID'S HEAD SITS ON A LESS

17:10.796 --> 17:12.398
DEVELOPED NECK AND TORSO THAN AN

17:12.398 --> 17:13.499
ADULT'S, SO THE SAME BLOW MIGHT

17:13.499 --> 17:14.667
CAUSE MORE DAMAGE TO A KID THAN

17:14.667 --> 17:16.736
A GROWNUP.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.971
>> SO, YOU'VE GOT A "BOBBLE

17:18.971 --> 17:20.306
HEAD" DOLL EFFECT WITH OUR

17:20.306 --> 17:22.942
YOUNGSTERS SO THAT THE VERY

17:22.942 --> 17:24.543
MINIMAL IMPACT IS NOW GOING TO

17:24.543 --> 17:26.078
SET THEIR BRAIN IN MUCH MORE

17:26.078 --> 17:27.046
MOTION THAN IT WOULD AN ADULT

17:27.046 --> 17:28.714
BRAIN WITH A STRONG NECK.

17:28.714 --> 17:29.815
>> Reporter: CANTU SAYS

17:29.815 --> 17:31.450
STRENGTHENING KID'S NECK MUSCLES

17:31.450 --> 17:33.019
CAN HELP, BUT THOSE SOCCER

17:33.019 --> 17:34.387
HELMETS AND HEADGEAR DON'T

17:34.387 --> 17:35.821
REALLY OFFER MUCH PROTECTION, SO

17:35.821 --> 17:37.823
HE SAYS THERE'S ONLY ONE THING

17:37.823 --> 17:39.425
LEFT TO DO.

17:39.425 --> 17:40.760
>> TAKE THE MOST INJURIOUS

17:40.760 --> 17:42.228
ACTIVITY FOR HEAD INJURY OUT OF

17:42.228 --> 17:43.896
IT, BUT LET THE REST OF THE

17:43.896 --> 17:45.598
SPORT GO ON.

17:45.598 --> 17:46.465
AND THAT'S PLAYING SOCCER

17:46.465 --> 17:49.435
WITHOUT HEADING.

17:49.435 --> 17:50.202
>> Reporter: SOME OTHERS WHO

17:50.202 --> 17:51.237
KNOW FAR MORE ABOUT THE GAME

17:51.237 --> 17:52.104
THAN I DO ARE LISTENING TO

17:52.104 --> 17:53.406
CANTU, ONE OF WHOM YOU MIGHT

17:53.406 --> 17:56.375
RECOGNIZE.

17:56.375 --> 17:57.410
BRANDI CHASTAIN'S DRAMATIC

17:57.410 --> 17:58.611
PENALTY SHOT AGAINST CHINA WON

17:58.611 --> 18:02.348
THE 1999 WORLD CUP FOR THE U.S.

18:02.348 --> 18:03.716
SHE ALSO HELPED WIN GOLD FOR THE

18:03.716 --> 18:05.818
U.S. AT TWO DIFFERENT OLYMPICS.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.520
SHE NOW LIVES IN NORTHERN

18:07.520 --> 18:08.754
CALIFORNIA WITH HER HUSBAND AND

18:08.754 --> 18:10.589
HER EIGHT-YEAR-OLD SON JADEN.

18:10.589 --> 18:11.457
SHE COACHES HIS TEAM AND HELPS

18:11.457 --> 18:12.858
COACH A DIVISION 1 TEAM AT SANTA

18:12.858 --> 18:15.394
CLARA UNIVERSITY.

18:15.394 --> 18:16.562
SHE, ALONG WITH SEVERAL OF HER

18:16.562 --> 18:17.964
FORMER TEAMMATES FROM THE U.S.

18:17.964 --> 18:19.465
NATIONAL TEAM, HAVE JOINED

18:19.465 --> 18:20.499
FORCES WITH DR. CANTU'S

18:20.499 --> 18:22.802
ORGANIZATION.

18:22.802 --> 18:25.271
>> WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE HEADING

18:25.271 --> 18:26.605
IN YOUTH SOCCER, 14 AND UNDER.

18:26.605 --> 18:27.640
>> Reporter: THE INTERESTING

18:27.640 --> 18:30.176
THING IS, JUST A FEW YEARS AGO,

18:30.176 --> 18:31.877
CHASTAIN WAS ON NBC SAYING THAT

18:31.877 --> 18:33.045
HEADING WAS SAFE FOR KIDS AS

18:33.045 --> 18:34.080
LONG AS THEY WERE TRAINED

18:34.080 --> 18:35.614
CORRECTLY.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.750
>> IT'S A PART OF THE GAME, IT'S

18:37.750 --> 18:39.518
AN IMPORTANT PART, AND IT'S A

18:39.518 --> 18:41.988
BEAUTIFUL PART OF THE GAME.

18:41.988 --> 18:43.089
>> Reporter: AT THE TIME, YOU

18:43.089 --> 18:44.590
WERE SAYING, "I THINK THAT IT

18:44.590 --> 18:45.891
CAN BE TAUGHT TO KIDS, AND IT

18:45.891 --> 18:46.926
SHOULD STAY IN THE GAME FOR

18:46.926 --> 18:48.861
KIDS."

18:48.861 --> 18:50.129
NOW, YOU THINK DIFFERENTLY.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.230
I WONDER WHAT WAS IT IN

18:51.230 --> 18:51.897
PARTICULAR THAT CHANGED YOUR

18:51.897 --> 18:54.367
MIND?

18:54.367 --> 18:55.368
>> I THINK IT WAS HEARING THE

18:55.368 --> 18:56.469
INFORMATION THAT DR. CANTU WAS

18:56.469 --> 18:58.371
PUTTING OUT.

18:58.371 --> 18:59.772
THE MORE I STARTED HEARING ABOUT

18:59.772 --> 19:00.873
IT AND THE MORE RESEARCH THAT

19:00.873 --> 19:03.876
HAS COME OUT, I JUST THOUGHT,

19:03.876 --> 19:06.579
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO PROTECT

19:06.579 --> 19:07.613
THEM, AND THIS DOESN'T NEED TO

19:07.613 --> 19:08.280
EXIST AT THIS YOUNG AGE.

19:08.280 --> 19:09.415
>> Reporter: CHASTAIN ADMITTED

19:09.415 --> 19:10.316
THAT SO FAR THEIR CAMPAIGN

19:10.316 --> 19:12.418
REALLY HASN'T TAKEN OFF.

19:12.418 --> 19:13.219
JUST A HANDFUL OF PROGRAMS HAVE

19:13.219 --> 19:15.388
REMOVED HEADING.

19:15.388 --> 19:16.622
SHE SAYS THE LEAD REALLY HAS TO

19:16.622 --> 19:17.556
COME FROM THE TOP, FROM THE

19:17.556 --> 19:19.992
INTERNATIONAL GOVERNING BODY OF

19:19.992 --> 19:22.361
SOCCER, FIFA, AND THE U.S.

19:22.361 --> 19:23.262
SOCCER FEDERATION.

19:23.262 --> 19:24.263
THOSE ORGANIZATIONS ARE

19:24.263 --> 19:25.798
CURRENTLY BEING SUED BY A GROUP

19:25.798 --> 19:27.700
OF SOCCER PARENTS IN CALIFORNIA

19:27.700 --> 19:28.768
WHO SAY THE GROUPS HAVEN'T DONE

19:28.768 --> 19:29.835
ENOUGH TO PROTECT KIDS FROM HEAD

19:29.835 --> 19:32.038
INJURY.

19:32.038 --> 19:32.905
WE REACHED OUT TO FIFA AND TO

19:32.905 --> 19:33.839
THE U.S. SOCCER FEDERATION FOR

19:33.839 --> 19:35.207
COMMENT.

19:35.207 --> 19:36.542
WHILE NEITHER WOULD GO ON THE

19:36.542 --> 19:38.844
RECORD, CITING THE LITIGATION,

19:38.844 --> 19:39.612
THEY BOTH SAID THAT PLAYER

19:39.612 --> 19:41.981
SAFETY IS A PRIORITY, AND THE

19:41.981 --> 19:43.816
FEDERATION INDICATED HEADING AND

19:43.816 --> 19:45.251
CONCUSSIONS ARE AMONG THE TOPICS

19:45.251 --> 19:46.819
REGULARLY REVIEWED BY ITS POLICY

19:46.819 --> 19:49.255
MAKERS.

19:49.255 --> 19:50.389
BACK IN NEW JERSEY, THE SOCCER

19:50.389 --> 19:52.491
SEASON GOES ON.

19:52.491 --> 19:53.526
WE SEE A FAIR AMOUNT OF HEADING,

19:53.526 --> 19:54.460
ESPECIALLY IN MY OLDER SON'S

19:54.460 --> 19:56.095
GAMES.

19:56.095 --> 19:57.229
THE BOYS TAKE HARD ONES, SOFT

19:57.229 --> 19:58.964
ONES.

19:58.964 --> 20:02.268
THEY SCORE GOALS WITH THEM.

20:02.268 --> 20:03.836
OUR SOCCER CLUB, MONTCLAIR

20:03.836 --> 20:05.838
UNITED, SAYS IT'S VERY CONCERNED

20:05.838 --> 20:07.873
ABOUT CONCUSSIONS AND TRAINS OUR

20:07.873 --> 20:09.675
COACHES THOROUGHLY, BUT THEY SAY

20:09.675 --> 20:10.609
THEY DON'T MAKE THE RULES AND SO

20:10.609 --> 20:11.577
HEADING REMAINS A PART OF OUR

20:11.577 --> 20:13.446
GAME.

20:13.446 --> 20:14.413
AND QUITE FRANKLY, THERE'S A LOT

20:14.413 --> 20:15.448
OF DOUBT ON A LOT OF PEOPLE'S

20:15.448 --> 20:16.282
MINDS THAT HEADING IS A PROBLEM

20:16.282 --> 20:17.983
AT ALL.

20:17.983 --> 20:19.051
>> I HAVE A 13-YEAR-OLD SON THAT

20:19.051 --> 20:20.086
I WANT TO PROTECT AS MUCH AS

20:20.086 --> 20:21.587
ANYBODY WANTS TO PROTECT THEIR

20:21.587 --> 20:23.589
SON, BUT I WILL LET MY SON HEAD

20:23.589 --> 20:25.858
A BALL BECAUSE I SEE NO EVIDENCE

20:25.858 --> 20:28.894
WHATSOEVER THAT THERE IS A

20:28.894 --> 20:30.863
DANGER FOR ANYBODY IN YOUTH

20:30.863 --> 20:33.332
SOCCER PLAYING, HEADING A BALL.

20:33.332 --> 20:34.767
>> Reporter: BUT THEN, OUR

20:34.767 --> 20:35.601
PEDIATRICIAN, DR. FLYER, SAYS

20:35.601 --> 20:36.902
TAKING HEADING OUT DOESN'T GO

20:36.902 --> 20:38.871
FAR ENOUGH IN HIS OPINION.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.039
HE SAYS WHAT HE'S SEES IN HIS

20:40.039 --> 20:41.340
OWN PATIENTS IS EVIDENCE ENOUGH

20:41.340 --> 20:42.308
THAT THE SPORT ISN'T SAFE FOR

20:42.308 --> 20:43.876
KIDS.

20:43.876 --> 20:44.777
>> WE HAD THIS 30-YEAR

20:44.777 --> 20:46.645
EXPERIMENT.

20:46.645 --> 20:47.980
THE RESULTS ARE COMING IN.

20:47.980 --> 20:48.914
IT'S NOT SAFE FOR CHILDREN TO DO

20:48.914 --> 20:50.282
THIS.

20:50.282 --> 20:52.751
IT'S A CONTACT SPORT.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.120
YOU KNOW, THAT'S ALMOST A

20:54.120 --> 20:55.454
EUPHEMISM.

20:55.454 --> 20:57.423
IT'S A BRAIN-INJURING SPORT.

20:57.423 --> 20:58.824
AND IF I DON'T GET THIS
