THIS AFTERNOON WITH CUBAN

00:46.647 --> 00:48.282
PRESIDENT RAUL CASTO, THE FIRST

00:48.282 --> 00:49.783
MEETING OF ITS KIND IN MORE THAN

00:49.783 --> 00:50.984
50 YEARS AND THE LATEST IN A

00:50.984 --> 00:52.920
SERIES OF DEVELOPMENTS POINTING

00:52.920 --> 00:54.021
TO A NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS

00:54.021 --> 00:56.123
BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.

00:56.123 --> 00:58.292
THIS AFTER A WIDELY PHOTOGRAPHED

00:58.292 --> 00:59.559
HANDSHAKE LAST NIGHT AND A PHONE

00:59.559 --> 01:00.460
CALL BETWEEN THE TWO MEN EARLIER

01:00.460 --> 01:01.128
IN THE WEEK.

01:01.128 --> 01:02.396
THE NEWSHOUR'S WILLIAM BRANGHAM

01:06.667 --> 01:08.135
PANAMA, BOTH PRESIDENT OBAMA AND

01:08.135 --> 01:09.903
CUBAN PRESIDENT RAUL CASTRO

01:09.903 --> 01:11.672
HAILED THE RECENT IMPROVEMENT IN

01:11.672 --> 01:12.873
RELATIONS BETWEEN THEIR TWO

01:12.873 --> 01:15.309
LONG-ESTRANGED NATIONS.

01:15.309 --> 01:16.543
>> THIS SHIFT IN U.S. POLICY

01:16.543 --> 01:17.311
REPRESENTS A TURNING POINT FOR

01:17.311 --> 01:19.479
OUR ENTIRE REGION.

01:19.479 --> 01:21.448
THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT CASTRO

01:21.448 --> 01:22.282
AND I ARE BOTH SITTING HERE

01:22.282 --> 01:23.483
TODAY MARKS AN HISTORIC

01:23.483 --> 01:24.351
OCCASION.

01:24.351 --> 01:28.221
AND I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT IF WE

01:28.221 --> 01:31.024
CAN CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND

01:31.024 --> 01:33.327
SEIZE THIS MOMENTUM IN PURSUIT

01:33.327 --> 01:34.361
OF MUTUAL INTERESTS, THEN BETTER

01:34.361 --> 01:35.595
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED

01:35.595 --> 01:37.230
STATES AND CUBA WILL CREATE NEW

01:37.230 --> 01:38.732
OPPORTUNITIES FOR COOPERATION

01:38.732 --> 01:39.866
ACROSS OUR REGION.

01:39.866 --> 01:41.368
>> Reporter: PRESIDENT CASTRO

01:41.368 --> 01:43.170
OFFERED A LITANY OF COMPLAINTS

01:43.170 --> 01:45.105
ABOUT ONGOING U.S. TREATMENT OF

01:45.105 --> 01:46.807
HIS COUNTRY BUT SAID HE DIDN'T

01:46.807 --> 01:48.241
HOLD OBAMA RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT

01:48.241 --> 01:49.977
CAME BEFORE HIS PRESIDENCY,

01:49.977 --> 01:51.678
INCLUDING THE ECONOMIC BLOCKADE

01:51.678 --> 01:53.347
THE U.S. HAS MAINTAINED AGAINST

01:53.347 --> 01:55.148
CUBA FOR OVER HALF A CENTURY.

01:55.148 --> 01:57.150
>> (translated): WE'VE

01:57.150 --> 01:59.619
PUBLICLY EXPRESSED TO PRESIDENT

01:59.619 --> 02:02.055
OBAMA OUR RECOGNITION OF HIS

02:02.055 --> 02:04.024
VALIANT DECISION TO INVOLVE

02:04.024 --> 02:05.559
HIMSELF IN A DEBATE WITH THE

02:05.559 --> 02:06.994
CONGRESS OF HIS COUNTRY TO PUT

02:06.994 --> 02:07.761
AN END TO THE BLOCKADE AGAINST

02:07.761 --> 02:08.895
CUBA.

02:08.895 --> 02:09.997
>> Reporter: HOURS LATER, THE

02:09.997 --> 02:10.764
TWO LEADERS HAD THEIR PRIVATE

02:10.764 --> 02:11.798
MEETING.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.233
LAST NIGHT, THEY SHOOK HANDS--

02:13.233 --> 02:14.234
YET ANOTHER PUBLIC GESTURE OF

02:14.234 --> 02:15.569
GOODWILL.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.904
THEY MADE HEADLINES WITH ANOTHER

02:17.904 --> 02:19.373
HANDSHAKE BACK IN 2013 AT NELSON

02:19.373 --> 02:20.107
MANDELA'S FUNERAL IN SOUTH

02:20.107 --> 02:22.476
AFRICA.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.710
THE GATHERING IN PANAMA IS JUST

02:23.710 --> 02:25.078
THE LATEST STEP IN PRESIDENT

02:25.078 --> 02:26.380
OBAMA'S EFFORTS TO RENEW

02:26.380 --> 02:27.714
RELATIONS WITH CUBA, WHICH HAVE

02:27.714 --> 02:29.016
BEEN FROZEN SINCE PRESIDENT

02:29.016 --> 02:30.550
DWIGHT EISENHOWER SEVERED

02:30.550 --> 02:32.819
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS OVER

02:32.819 --> 02:34.254
CONCERNS THAT FIDEL CASTRO WAS

02:34.254 --> 02:35.956
TURNING HIS ISLAND NATION INTO

02:35.956 --> 02:38.158
AN OUTPOST OF SOVIET COMMUNISM.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.292
BUT LAST DECEMBER, AFTER 18

02:39.292 --> 02:40.894
MONTHS OF SECRET TALKS,

02:40.894 --> 02:42.062
PRESIDENT OBAMA ANNOUNCED THE

02:42.062 --> 02:43.497
RESTORATION OF DIPLOMATIC

02:43.497 --> 02:45.032
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO

02:45.032 --> 02:46.767
COUNTRIES AND URGED WHAT HE

02:46.767 --> 02:48.635
CALLED A "SERIOUS DEBATE" ABOUT

02:48.635 --> 02:50.904
LIFTING THE ECONOMIC EMBARGO.

02:50.904 --> 02:54.307
THIS WEEKEND'S SUMMIT OF THE

02:54.307 --> 02:55.208
AMERICAS MEETING WAS THE FIRST

02:55.208 --> 02:56.243
TIME U.S. OFFICIALS DIDN'T BLOCK

02:56.243 --> 02:57.110
CUBA'S ATTENDANCE AT THE

02:57.110 --> 02:58.011
GATHERING.

02:58.011 --> 02:58.979
>> Sreenivasan: BACK IN THIS

02:58.979 --> 03:00.047
COUNTRY, HUNDREDS OF MOURNERS

03:00.047 --> 03:01.481
GATHERED IN SOUTH CAROLINA TODAY

03:01.481 --> 03:03.483
TO PAY RESPECTS TO WALTER SCOTT,

03:03.483 --> 03:05.085
THE UNARMED AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN

03:05.085 --> 03:06.520
GUNNED DOWN LAST WEEK BY A NORTH

03:06.520 --> 03:08.155
CHARLESTON POLICE OFFICER.

03:08.155 --> 03:09.423
THE SHOOTING, WHICH WAS RECORDED

03:09.423 --> 03:11.525
BY A BYSTANDER, SHOWED SCOTT

03:11.525 --> 03:12.359
BEING SHOT IN THE BACK AS HE RAN

03:12.359 --> 03:13.693
AWAY FROM OFFICER MICHAEL

03:13.693 --> 03:14.561
SLAGER.

03:14.561 --> 03:15.929

03:17.631 --> 03:19.433
SCOTT'S CASKET, DRAPED BY AN

A SECOND MAN HAS BEEN CHARGED IN

03:29.009 --> 03:30.777
CONNECTION WITH THAT ALLEGED

03:30.777 --> 03:32.312
FOILED PLOT TO SET OFF A CAR

03:32.312 --> 03:34.714
BOMB AT AN ARMY BASE IN KANSAS.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.083
ALEXANDER BLAIR WAS CHARGED WITH

03:36.083 --> 03:37.751
FAILING TO REPORT A FELONY.

03:37.751 --> 03:38.952
IF CONVICTED, HE COULD FACE UP

03:38.952 --> 03:40.620
TO THREE YEARS IMPRISONMENT.

03:40.620 --> 03:42.923
AUTHORITIES CLAIM HE KNEW OF

03:42.923 --> 03:44.124
JOHN BOOKER'S PLANS TO PLANT THE

03:44.124 --> 03:45.592
BOMB IN AN EFFORT TO KILL AS

03:45.592 --> 03:46.460
MANY SOLDIERS AS POSSIBLE AT

03:46.460 --> 03:48.261
FORT REILY.

03:48.261 --> 03:49.463
BOOKER WAS ARRESTED YESTERDAY IN

03:49.463 --> 03:51.098
AN F.B.I. STING OPERATION.

03:51.098 --> 03:52.532
A MUSLIM CLERIC SAID TODAY

03:52.532 --> 03:54.067
BOOKER IS MENTALLY ILL.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.669
TO MARK THE UPCOMING FIFTH

03:55.669 --> 03:57.370
ANNIVERSARY OF THE "DEEPWATER

03:57.370 --> 03:59.139
HORIZON" EXPLOSION AND THE HUGE

03:59.139 --> 04:00.907
GULF OIL SPILL THAT FOLLOWED,

04:00.907 --> 04:01.942
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS SET

04:01.942 --> 04:02.976
TO ANNOUNCE NEW REGULATIONS

04:02.976 --> 04:04.778
COVERING OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS

04:04.778 --> 04:05.445
DRILLING.

04:05.445 --> 04:06.379
THIS, ACCORDING TO THE "NEW YORK

04:06.379 --> 04:07.114
TIMES."

04:07.114 --> 04:07.881
THE NEWSPAPER SAYS THE

04:07.881 --> 04:09.082
ADMINISTRATION WILL PROPOSE

04:09.082 --> 04:10.750
TIGHTENING SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

04:10.750 --> 04:12.819
ON WHAT ARE KNOWN AS BLOWOUT

04:12.819 --> 04:14.588
PREVENTERS, WHAT IT DESCRIBES AS

04:14.588 --> 04:16.289
THE LAST LINE OF PROTECTION TO

04:16.289 --> 04:17.557
PREVENT EXPLOSIONS IN UNDERSEA

04:17.557 --> 04:19.493
OIL AND GAS WELLS.

04:19.493 --> 04:20.694
EVEN AS IT MOVES TO TIGHTEN

04:20.694 --> 04:21.962
SAFETY RULES, THE OBAMA

04:21.962 --> 04:23.597
ADMINISTRATION HAS SIGNALED THAT

04:23.597 --> 04:24.764
IT WILL OPEN UP NEW AREAS IN THE

04:24.764 --> 04:27.134
ATLANTIC TO DRILLING.

04:27.134 --> 04:28.401
THE PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY

04:28.401 --> 04:29.603
HAVE MADE PUBLIC THEIR TAX

04:29.603 --> 04:30.904
RETURNS, AND THEY SHOW THAT THE

04:30.904 --> 04:31.972
OBAMAS' ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME

04:31.972 --> 04:33.673
LAST YEAR WAS A LITTLE LESS THAN

04:33.673 --> 04:35.375
$500,000.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.277
THAT'S ACTUALLY THE LOWEST

04:37.277 --> 04:38.345
AMOUNT SINCE 2004 AS ROYALTIES

04:38.345 --> 04:39.846
FROM THE PRESIDENT'S BOOK SALES

04:39.846 --> 04:41.248
DECLINED.

04:41.248 --> 04:43.617
THE OBAMAS PAID MORE THAN

04:43.617 --> 04:45.385
$93,000 IN TAXES, JUST LESS THAN

04:45.385 --> 04:47.521
20% OF THEIR INCOME; AND THEY

04:47.521 --> 04:48.355
DONATED MORE THAN $70,000 TO

04:48.355 --> 04:50.323
CHARITY, NEARLY 15% OF THEIR

04:50.323 --> 04:51.691
INCOME.

04:51.691 --> 04:53.026
A FLORIDA EYE CLINIC HAS AGREED

04:53.026 --> 04:55.162
TO PAY ONE OF ITS FORMER

04:55.162 --> 04:56.796
EMPLOYEES $150,000 AFTER BEING

04:56.796 --> 04:58.198
SUED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

04:58.198 --> 04:58.965
FOR ALLEGED TRANSGENDER

04:58.965 --> 05:01.668
DISCRIMINATION.

05:01.668 --> 05:03.470
THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY

05:03.470 --> 05:04.604
COMMISSION SAID BRANDI BRANSON

05:04.604 --> 05:05.872
WAS WRONGFULLY FIRED AFTER

05:05.872 --> 05:06.973
TRANSITIONING FROM MALE TO

05:06.973 --> 05:08.642
FEMALE.

05:08.642 --> 05:09.943
ACTIVISTS SAY THE RULING COULD

05:09.943 --> 05:10.944
HELP ESTABLISH NEW LEGAL

05:10.944 --> 05:11.811
PROTECTIONS FOR TRANSGENDER

05:11.811 --> 05:13.980
AMERICANS.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.291
>> Sreenivasan: FOR MORE ABOUT

05:24.291 --> 05:25.358
THE SUMMIT OF THE AMERICAS AND

05:25.358 --> 05:26.826
THE CHANGING U.S.-CUBAN

05:26.826 --> 05:27.561
RELATIONSHIP, WE ARE JOINED NOW

05:27.561 --> 05:28.962
BY CARLA ROBBINS.

05:28.962 --> 05:29.729
SHE IS AN ADJUNCT SENIOR FELLOW

05:29.729 --> 05:30.764
AT THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN

05:30.764 --> 05:31.665
RELATIONS.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.332
SO, WHY WAS THIS MEETING SO

05:32.332 --> 05:33.233
IMPORTANT?

05:33.233 --> 05:34.401
>> IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN 50

05:34.401 --> 05:35.835
YEARS THERE WAS A DIRECTOR OF

05:35.835 --> 05:37.370
DIRECT CONVERSATION BETWEEN A

05:37.370 --> 05:39.673
CUBAN PRESIDENT AND AMERICAN

05:39.673 --> 05:40.807
PRESIDENT.

05:40.807 --> 05:41.708
OF COURSE, OBVIOUSLY, THE FIRST

05:41.708 --> 05:43.109
TIME SINCE COMMUNIST RULE CAME

05:43.109 --> 05:43.810
TO CUBA, AND IT IS GOING TO BE

05:43.810 --> 05:45.212
THE BEGINNING OF A NEW AND

05:45.212 --> 05:47.414
BEAUTIFUL FRIENDSHIP.

05:47.414 --> 05:48.248
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT CAME OUT

05:48.248 --> 05:49.950
OF THE MEETING, WHAT DIDN'T?

05:49.950 --> 05:51.017
>> WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT

05:51.017 --> 05:52.052
CAME OUT OF THE MEETING JUST

05:52.052 --> 05:54.621
YET, BUT PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID HE

05:54.621 --> 05:55.755
WANTS TO NORMALIZE

05:55.755 --> 05:56.790
RELATIONSHIPS.

05:56.790 --> 05:57.757
THEY WANT TO OPEN EMBASSIES.

05:57.757 --> 05:59.593
RIGHT NOW, THERE ARE

05:59.593 --> 06:01.394
INTERSECTIONS BOTH IN CUBA AND

06:01.394 --> 06:01.895
THE UNITED STATES.

06:01.895 --> 06:04.297
SO IT'S THE BEGINNING OF

06:04.297 --> 06:05.699
NORMALIZING RELATIONS, BUT

06:05.699 --> 06:08.301
THE EMBARGO IS NOT GOING TO BE

06:08.301 --> 06:08.868
LIFTED YET.

06:08.868 --> 06:09.703
>> Sreenivasan: THE EMBARGO

06:09.703 --> 06:10.503
IS NOT GOING TO BE LIFTED AND

06:10.503 --> 06:12.305
THERE'S A BIG CATCH THAT CUBA IS

06:12.305 --> 06:13.707
INTERESTED IN IS GETTING OFF THE

06:13.707 --> 06:15.375
LIST OF STATE-SPONSORED TERROR.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.409
THEY ARE STILL ON THERE.

06:16.409 --> 06:17.711
>> THEY ARE STILL ON THERE, AND

06:17.711 --> 06:19.112
CASTRO HAS SAID THEY ARE NOT

06:19.112 --> 06:21.081
EVEN GOING TO OPEN THE EMBASSIES

06:21.081 --> 06:22.349
UNTIL THAT HAPPENS.

06:22.349 --> 06:23.516
THE PRESIDENT WAS VERY COY THIS

06:23.516 --> 06:24.017
WEEK.

06:24.017 --> 06:26.253
HE SAID HE GOT HIS

06:26.253 --> 06:27.454
RECOMMENDATION FROM THE STATE

06:27.454 --> 06:26.386
DEPARTMENT BUT HE HASN'T SAID

06:26.386 --> 06:27.554
WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE.

06:27.554 --> 06:30.724
WHETHER IT HAPPENS TODAY OR IN A

06:30.724 --> 06:32.459
FEW WEEKS, IT WILL DEFINITELY

06:32.459 --> 06:33.059
HAPPEN.

06:33.059 --> 06:33.827
>> Sreenivasan: AND THIS HAS

06:33.827 --> 06:35.195
A RIPPLE EFFECT BECAUSE

06:35.195 --> 06:36.129
BUSINESSES DON'T WANT TO BE

06:36.129 --> 06:37.797
DOING BUSINESS WITH A COUNTRY ON

06:37.797 --> 06:38.164
THAT LIST.

06:38.164 --> 06:40.100
>> MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT'S THE

06:40.100 --> 06:41.635
BANKING SANCTIONS ISSUE THAT

06:41.635 --> 06:42.869
THEY'RE VERY SENSITIVE.

06:42.869 --> 06:44.337
CUBANS SAY THEY CAN'T EVEN USE A

06:44.337 --> 06:45.272
CREDIT CARD.

06:45.272 --> 06:46.039
AMERICAN COMPANIES AND

06:46.039 --> 06:47.240
PARTICULARLY THE TELECOM

06:47.240 --> 06:48.408
COMPANIES, WHICH IS WHAT

06:48.408 --> 06:49.242
OBAMA HOPES IS GOING TO

06:49.242 --> 06:50.477
GO IN THERE BECAUSE THAT'S THE

06:50.477 --> 06:51.911
WHOLE POINT OF THE OPENING, THEY

06:51.911 --> 06:53.079
DON'T WANT TO GET ON THE WRONG

06:53.079 --> 06:54.347
SIDE OF THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT.

06:54.347 --> 06:55.382
>> Sreenivasan: SO, RAUL CASTRO

06:55.382 --> 06:57.050
WAS ALLOTTED HIS EIGHT MINUTES,

06:57.050 --> 06:58.451
HE WENT FOR 48 MINUTES AND

06:58.451 --> 07:01.021
DECIDED TO GIVE THE ENTIRE

07:01.021 --> 07:03.056
AUDIENCE A HISTORY LESSON OF

07:03.056 --> 07:04.090
CUBA-U.S. RELATIONS.

07:04.090 --> 07:07.060
>> 48 MINUTES IS VERY SHORT FOR

07:07.060 --> 07:07.694
CASTRO TO SPEAK.

07:07.694 --> 07:08.461
>> Sreenivasan: HE RAILED

07:08.461 --> 07:09.696
AGAINST U.S. POLICY BUT SPARED

07:09.696 --> 07:11.431
OBAMA.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.533
>> HE APOLOGIZED TO OBAMA.

07:13.533 --> 07:15.502
HE SAID, "YOUNGSTER, YOU'RE

07:15.502 --> 07:16.436
NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ONE."

07:16.436 --> 07:17.704
THIS IS A MOMENT, AN

07:17.704 --> 07:18.605
EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT ON BOTH

07:18.605 --> 07:19.506
SIDES FOR THE TWO OF THEM.

07:19.506 --> 07:20.240
>> Sreenivasan: COMPARE THAT

07:20.240 --> 07:21.841
TO THE HEAD OF VENEZUELA, THE

07:21.841 --> 07:25.779
HEAD OF ECUADOR MAKING VERY

07:25.779 --> 07:27.080
BOMBASTIC STATEMENTS AGAINST

07:27.080 --> 07:31.351
CURRENT U.S. POLICY AS THEY WERE

07:31.351 --> 07:32.018
SPEAKING.

07:32.018 --> 07:33.286
>> ON THE OTHER HAND, THIS WAS A

07:33.286 --> 07:34.621
SORT OF AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT

07:34.621 --> 07:35.789
IN THE SENSE THAT OBAMA WAS

07:35.789 --> 07:37.624
VERY, VERY DEEPLY EMBRACED BY

07:37.624 --> 07:38.825
THE... BY EVERYONE ELSE THERE

07:38.825 --> 07:40.894
BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN INSISTING

07:40.894 --> 07:42.195
FOR THE LAST TWO SUMMITS THAT

07:42.195 --> 07:44.497
THE U.S. GET RID OF THIS RELIC

07:44.497 --> 07:45.665
OF THE COLD WAR, WHICH IS THE

07:45.665 --> 07:49.169
EMBARGO-- SORRY, THE END OF THIS

07:49.169 --> 07:50.036
RELATIONSHIP.

07:50.036 --> 07:51.004
>> Sreenivasan: NONE OF THIS

07:51.004 --> 07:51.738
HAPPENS IN A VACUUM.

07:51.738 --> 07:52.872
THIS IS HAPPENING AT A TIME WHEN

07:52.872 --> 07:54.040
WE'RE STILL IN CONVERSATIONS

07:54.040 --> 07:57.010
WITH IRAN, AND KIND OF PAINT

07:57.010 --> 07:57.977
THOSE CONNECTIONS FOR US.

07:57.977 --> 08:01.014
WHY DOES ONE AFFECT THE OTHER?

08:01.014 --> 08:02.248
>> WELL, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

08:02.248 --> 08:04.384
IRAN OBVIOUSLY IS THE BOGEYMAN

08:04.384 --> 08:05.352
BUT CUBA HAS BEEN THE BOGEYMAN

08:05.352 --> 08:07.721
FOR A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME.

08:07.721 --> 08:08.888
THE NEGOTIATION WITH IRAN AND

08:08.888 --> 08:09.989
THE SANCTIONS ON IRAN IS THE

08:09.989 --> 08:11.591
NUMBER ONE... THE NUMBER

08:11.591 --> 08:12.826
ONE LEGACY ISSUE, AND OBVIOUSLY

08:12.826 --> 08:13.927
THE NUMBER ONE NATIONAL SECURITY

08:13.927 --> 08:15.395
ISSUE BECAUSE OF THE NUCLEAR

08:15.395 --> 08:16.896
RELATIONSHIP AND GREAT CONCERN

08:16.896 --> 08:17.497
THERE.

08:17.497 --> 08:17.130
AND THE SAME PEOPLE OPPOSED

08:17.130 --> 08:21.201
TO LIFTING-- IMPROVING RELATIONS

08:21.201 --> 08:23.169
WITH CUBA ARE VERY, VERY MUCH

08:23.169 --> 08:24.571
OPPOSED TO LIFTING SANCTIONS

08:24.571 --> 08:25.271
ON IRAN.

08:25.271 --> 08:26.539
AND THE PRESIDENT HAS TO BE VERY

08:26.539 --> 08:27.741
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS NOTION THAT

08:27.741 --> 08:29.442
SOMEHOW HE IS SOFT ON DICTATORS.

08:29.442 --> 08:30.410
>> Sreenivasan: AND THIS IS,

08:30.410 --> 08:31.911
OF COURSE, IN THE CONTEXT OF AT

08:31.911 --> 08:33.012
LEAST A COUPLE OF PEOPLE

08:33.012 --> 08:34.080
ANNOUNCING THEIR PRESIDENTIAL

08:34.080 --> 08:34.948
CAMPAIGNS TOMORROW.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.883
>> MARCO RUBIO, VERY CONCERNED

08:36.883 --> 08:38.985
ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW.

08:38.985 --> 08:39.853
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A HEARING

08:39.853 --> 08:42.389
ON THIS LEGISLATION IN WHICH THE

08:42.389 --> 08:43.556
CONGRESS IS INSISTING THAT IT'S

08:43.556 --> 08:44.624
GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A VOICE ON

08:44.624 --> 08:45.759
THE LIFTING OF SANCTIONS, AND

08:45.759 --> 08:46.493
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ON

08:46.493 --> 08:46.993
TUESDAY.

08:46.993 --> 08:47.694
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

08:47.694 --> 08:48.762
CARLA ROBBINS FROM THE COUNCIL

08:48.762 --> 08:49.729
ON FOREIGN RELATIONS, THANKS SO

08:49.729 --> 08:50.363
MUCH.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.398
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

09:01.007 --> 09:02.142
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW TO OUR

09:02.142 --> 09:04.277
SIGNATURE SEGMENT.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.078
TONIGHT, WE TAKE YOU TO HAWAII,

09:05.078 --> 09:06.279
A STATE WHOSE RESIDENTS HAVE THE

09:06.279 --> 09:07.881
HIGHEST MONTHLY ELECTRICITY

09:07.881 --> 09:09.282
BILLS IN THE NATION.

09:09.282 --> 09:10.216
AFTER ALL, IT TAKES PLENTY OF

09:10.216 --> 09:11.885
TIME AND MONEY TO SHIP OIL AND

09:11.885 --> 09:13.753
COAL THERE, SO IT MAKES SENSE

09:13.753 --> 09:15.455
THAT MORE AND MORE HAWAIIANS ARE

09:15.455 --> 09:16.423
TURNING TO AN ANOTHER,

09:16.423 --> 09:17.757
POTENTIALLY LESS EXPENSIVE

09:17.757 --> 09:19.192
SOURCE OF ENERGY, ONE THAT'S ALL

09:19.192 --> 09:21.327
AROUND THEM: THE SUN.

09:21.327 --> 09:23.329
BUT CONVERTING TO SOLAR ENERGY

09:23.329 --> 09:24.964
HAS PROVEN ANYTHING BUT SIMPLE

09:24.964 --> 09:26.666
IN HAWAII, AND WHAT'S HAPPENING

09:26.666 --> 09:28.435
THERE COULD BE A PREVIEW OF

09:28.435 --> 09:29.836
THINGS TO COME ELSEWHERE IN THE

09:29.836 --> 09:30.603
NATION.

09:30.603 --> 09:31.571
NEWSHOUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

09:31.571 --> 09:33.406
MIKE TAIBBI REPORTS FROM OAHU,

09:33.406 --> 09:34.641
HAWAII.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.344
>> Reporter: THEY'RE EVERYWHERE

09:38.344 --> 09:39.913
ON OAHU-- ON THE ROOFS OF

09:39.913 --> 09:41.147
BUSINESSES, LIBRARIES AND ONE

09:41.147 --> 09:43.349
HOUSE AFTER ANOTHER.

09:43.349 --> 09:45.084
THE AMOUNT OF ROOFTOP SOLAR NOW

09:45.084 --> 09:46.519
ACCOUNTS FOR 12% OF THE ELECTRIC

09:46.519 --> 09:48.221
UTILITY'S USERS.

09:48.221 --> 09:50.156
THAT'S MORE THAN 20 TIMES THE

09:50.156 --> 09:50.990
NATIONAL AVERAGE, BY FAR THE

09:50.990 --> 09:52.725
HIGHEST PENETRATION OF

09:52.725 --> 09:53.660
INDIVIDUAL ROOFTOP SOLAR IN THE

09:53.660 --> 09:55.261
COUNTRY.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.363
BUT IN THIS TROPICAL STATE,

09:57.363 --> 09:58.565
WHERE THE COMBINATION OF SKY-

09:58.565 --> 10:00.433
HIGH ENERGY PRICES, ABUNDANT

10:00.433 --> 10:02.702
SUNSHINE AND FEDERAL AND STATE

10:02.702 --> 10:04.671
TAX CREDITS MAKES GOING SOLAR A

10:04.671 --> 10:06.339
NO-BRAINER, THE VERY POPULARITY

10:06.339 --> 10:07.807
OF THESE PANELS HAS BECOME A

10:07.807 --> 10:08.475
PROBLEM.

10:08.475 --> 10:09.509
SO, WE DRIVE UP, AND YOU HAVE

10:09.509 --> 10:10.543
THESE LOVELY SOLAR PANELS ON

10:10.543 --> 10:10.977
YOUR ROOF.

10:10.977 --> 10:12.078
HOW'S THAT WORKING OUT FOR YOU?

10:12.078 --> 10:12.946
>> (LAUGHS)

10:12.946 --> 10:13.379
IT'S NOT!

10:13.379 --> 10:14.547
>> Reporter: NOT WORKING OUT

10:14.547 --> 10:16.716
BECAUSE BY THE TIME AIRCRAFT

10:16.716 --> 10:17.851
MECHANIC CARLTON HO JOINED THE

10:17.851 --> 10:20.220
ROOFTOP SOLAR PARADE IN

10:20.220 --> 10:22.155
SEPTEMBER 2013, THERE WERE SO

10:22.155 --> 10:23.857
MANY PEOPLE IN HIS AREA THAT HAD

10:23.857 --> 10:25.558
INSTALLED PANELS THAT THE LOCAL

10:25.558 --> 10:27.093
UTILITY COMPANY TOLD HIM AND

10:27.093 --> 10:28.094
MANY OTHERS "DON'T TURN ON THAT

10:28.094 --> 10:29.562
SWITCH YET."

10:29.562 --> 10:30.430
SO, IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF

10:30.430 --> 10:31.598
TURNING THE SWITCH ON AND YOU

10:31.598 --> 10:32.198
HAVE JUICE.

10:32.198 --> 10:34.033
>> YEAH.

10:34.033 --> 10:35.034
>> Reporter: FROM YOUR OWN ROOF.

10:35.034 --> 10:37.070
>> AND EVERYTHING IS AWESOME!

10:37.070 --> 10:37.871
>> Reporter: BUT IT'S NOT THAT

10:37.871 --> 10:38.705
SIMPLE.

10:38.705 --> 10:39.906
WHEN YOU INSTALL SOLAR PANELS,

10:39.906 --> 10:40.740
YOU'RE STILL RELIANT ON THE

10:40.740 --> 10:42.876
LOCAL UTILITY.

10:42.876 --> 10:43.977
WHEN IT'S DARK OR WHEN THE SUN

10:43.977 --> 10:45.879
ISN'T SHINING, YOU NEED THE GRID

10:45.879 --> 10:48.648
TO PROVIDE ELECTRICITY.

10:48.648 --> 10:49.516
EVEN SO, SOLAR CUSTOMERS HAVE A

10:49.516 --> 10:50.917
FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT

10:50.917 --> 10:52.752
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UTILITY

10:52.752 --> 10:54.487
BECAUSE WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING

10:54.487 --> 10:56.789
ANY EXTRA ENERGY THEIR PANELS

10:56.789 --> 10:57.891
GENERATE IS SUPPLIED BACK TO THE

10:57.891 --> 10:59.158
GRID.

10:59.158 --> 11:01.127
THAT EARNS A CREDIT, FURTHER

11:01.127 --> 11:03.563
REDUCING THEIR ELECTRIC BILLS.

11:03.563 --> 11:05.532
IN SOME SECTIONS OF OAHU, WITH

11:05.532 --> 11:07.834
SO MANY HOMEOWNERS GOING SOLAR,

11:07.834 --> 11:09.269
THE UTILITY SAID THE SAFETY AND

11:09.269 --> 11:11.437
RELIABILITY OF THE GRID COULD BE

11:11.437 --> 11:12.672
THREATENED, AND IT SLOWED TO A

11:12.672 --> 11:13.506
CRAWL THE APPROVALS OF NEW

11:13.506 --> 11:15.074
SYSTEMS.

11:15.074 --> 11:17.143
>> WE'VE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS,

11:17.143 --> 11:18.711
BUT WE KNOW THERE IS STILL MORE

11:18.711 --> 11:19.646
TO DO AS WE INCREASE ROOFTOP

11:19.646 --> 11:20.647
SOLAR.

11:20.647 --> 11:21.781

11:25.051 --> 11:25.985
COMPANY, OR HECO AS THE UTILITY

11:25.985 --> 11:27.687
IS KNOWN.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.889
>> WHAT WAS HAPPENING WAS THAT

11:29.889 --> 11:32.191
POWER, WHICH NORMALLY FLOWS FROM

11:32.191 --> 11:33.826
THE GRID TO OUR CUSTOMERS, WAS

11:33.826 --> 11:36.162
NOW BEGINNING TO FLOW BACK INTO

11:36.162 --> 11:39.899
THOSE SUBSTATIONS, SUBSTATIONS

11:39.899 --> 11:41.367
WHICH WERE NOT 30, 40 YEARS AGO

11:41.367 --> 11:42.101
DESIGNED TO OPERATE IN THAT

11:42.101 --> 11:43.202
MANNER.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.604
>> Reporter: IN ADDITION, HECO

11:44.604 --> 11:45.505
HAD A HARD TIME MEASURING ALL

11:45.505 --> 11:47.307
THAT SOLAR.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.242
>> SO, RIGHT NOW, WE DON'T KNOW

11:49.242 --> 11:50.810
EXACTLY HOW MUCH POWER ROOFTOP

11:50.810 --> 11:51.611
SOLAR IS PRODUCING AT ANY GIVEN

11:51.611 --> 11:52.478
MOMENT.

11:52.478 --> 11:54.080
>> Reporter: SO, YOU CAN'T SEE

11:54.080 --> 11:56.049
AT ALL WHAT 10% TO 12% OF YOUR

11:56.049 --> 11:56.816
CUSTOMER BASE IS PROVIDING?

11:56.816 --> 11:57.917
>> WE CANNOT.

11:57.917 --> 11:59.485
WE CANNOT SEE THAT.

11:59.485 --> 12:01.287
>> Reporter: BUT WHILE HECO

12:01.287 --> 12:02.555
STUDIED THE PROBLEM, HOMEOWNERS

12:02.555 --> 12:03.222
LIKE CARLTON HO WERE LEFT

12:03.222 --> 12:04.924
WAITING.

12:04.924 --> 12:06.159
IN HIS CASE, WAITING FOR A YEAR

12:06.159 --> 12:07.093
AND A HALF WHILE HIS SYSTEM SAT

12:07.093 --> 12:08.361
UNUSED.

12:08.361 --> 12:09.228
IT'S GOT TO BE FRUSTRATING.

12:09.228 --> 12:12.231
>> YES.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.766
LIKE, YOU COME HOME, YOU LOOK AT

12:13.766 --> 12:15.134
THE PANELS ON YOUR CEILING, AND

12:15.134 --> 12:16.369
YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING

12:16.369 --> 12:17.070
WITH IT.

12:17.070 --> 12:17.870
THE BILL COMES EVERY MONTH.

12:17.870 --> 12:18.805
YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TWO BILLS

12:18.805 --> 12:19.739
BECAUSE I STILL HAVE MY

12:19.739 --> 12:20.907
FINANCING.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.342
I HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT.

12:22.342 --> 12:23.376

13:03.549 --> 13:05.118
WHEN THE UTILITY SLOWED NEW

13:05.118 --> 13:06.386
APPROVALS; THERE WERE HUNDREDS

13:06.386 --> 13:07.687
OF LAYOFFS AND STOCKPILES OF

13:07.687 --> 13:09.789
SOLAR EQUIPMENT.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.257
BUT THOSE SOLAR CUSTOMERS

13:11.257 --> 13:12.859
WAITING TO TURN ON THEIR SYSTEMS

13:12.859 --> 13:14.694
OR EVEN GET PERMISSION TO START

13:14.694 --> 13:16.095
CONSTRUCTION KNEW THAT GOING

13:16.095 --> 13:18.131
SOLAR WOULD STILL BE A GOOD

13:18.131 --> 13:19.666
DEAL; A SYSTEM UP AND RUNNING

13:19.666 --> 13:21.434
WOULD REDUCE THEIR ENERGY BILLS

13:21.434 --> 13:23.469
DRAMATICALLY.

13:23.469 --> 13:24.637
IN THE MEANTIME, NON-SOLAR

13:24.637 --> 13:26.439
CUSTOMERS-- STILL THE MAJORITY--

13:26.439 --> 13:28.041
WERE PAYING MUCH MORE TO

13:28.041 --> 13:29.676
MAINTAIN THE PUBLIC GRID THAN

13:29.676 --> 13:31.878
THOSE WITH THEIR OWN PANELS ON

13:31.878 --> 13:33.646
THE ROOF, A DISPARITY THAT HECO

13:33.646 --> 13:35.915
SUGGESTED COULD BE UNFAIR.

13:35.915 --> 13:37.216

13:37.216 --> 13:38.985
WHO USES THE GRID SHOULD PAY

13:38.985 --> 13:40.453
THEIR SHARE TO MAINTAIN AND

13:40.453 --> 13:41.888
IMPROVE IT BECAUSE EVERYONE

13:41.888 --> 13:43.589
BENEFITS FROM IT.

20:30.496 --> 20:32.631
FOUND THAT NEARLY ALL HAD MOVED

20:37.870 --> 20:39.405
WHO WAS IN VERY DIRE STRAITS,

20:39.405 --> 20:40.306
AND HE DESCRIBED HER AS THE

20:40.306 --> 20:41.707
CLASS TRAGEDY.

20:41.707 --> 20:44.677
SHE WAS LIVING WITH AN ABUSIVE

CAMPBELL SOUP WHICH APPARENTLY

21:02.628 --> 21:04.263
WAS A FACTORY THAT HIRED A LOT

21:04.263 --> 21:06.298
OF AFRICAN AMERICAN WORKERS.

21:06.298 --> 21:08.934
SO, SOME PEOPLE WERE LIVING VERY

21:08.934 --> 21:10.903
MIDDLE-CLASS LIVES, BUT NEARLY

21:10.903 --> 21:12.404
ALL OF THE FAMILIES THAT HE MET

21:12.404 --> 21:13.672

CHANGED DRAMATICALLY.
