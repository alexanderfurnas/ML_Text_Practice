BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS

03:51.031 --> 03:52.599
REPORTEDLY TRACKED AND STORED

03:52.599 --> 03:54.234
BILLIONS OF RECORDS OF INTERNET

03:54.234 --> 03:56.203
USE BY BRITISH CITIZENS AND

03:56.203 --> 03:58.305
PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE U.K., IN AN

03:58.305 --> 04:00.207
EFFORT TO TRACK EVERY VISIBLE

04:00.207 --> 04:02.209
USER ON THE INTERNET.

04:02.209 --> 04:03.143
THAT FINDING COMES FROM THE

INTERCEPT WEBSITE, WHICH IS

04:13.453 --> 04:14.621
JOINS ME NOW, VIA SKYPE, FROM

04:14.621 --> 04:15.789
BRIGHTON, ENGLAND.

04:15.789 --> 04:18.291
FIRST OF ALL, EXPLAIN THE SCALE

04:18.291 --> 04:19.326
OF SURVEILLANCE THAT WAS

04:19.326 --> 04:21.161
HAPPENING FROM THE BRITISH

04:21.161 --> 04:22.462
EQUIVALENT OF THE N.S.A., THE

04:22.462 --> 04:24.664
G.C.H.Q.

04:24.664 --> 04:26.133
>> WELL, THE SKILL IS QUITE

04:26.133 --> 04:27.000
PHENOMENAL.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.869
I MEAN, IT'S HARD TO TRANSLATE

04:28.869 --> 04:29.970
IT WHEN YOU JUST SEE THE

04:29.970 --> 04:30.804
NUMBERS.

04:30.804 --> 04:33.607
BUT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT 30 TO

04:33.607 --> 04:36.743
100 BILLION METADATA RECORDS OF

04:36.743 --> 04:40.347
PHONE CALLS AND E-MAILS EVERY

04:40.347 --> 04:43.049
SINGLE DAY, SO VAST, VAST

04:43.049 --> 04:44.684
QUANTITIES OF INFORMATION

04:44.684 --> 04:45.585
THEY'RE SWEEPING UP.

04:45.585 --> 04:48.955
AND THEY'RE TALKING BY 2030

04:48.955 --> 04:51.825
HAVING IN PLACE THE WORLD'S

04:51.825 --> 04:53.727
LARGEST SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM,

04:53.727 --> 04:56.496
SURPASSING WHAT THE N.S.A. AND

04:56.496 --> 04:58.231
U.S. HAS BUILT.

04:58.231 --> 04:59.299
>> Sreenivasan: WHEN SOMEBODY

04:59.299 --> 05:02.235
HEARS THAT THERE'S MILLIONS AND

05:02.235 --> 05:03.837
BILLIONS AND POSSIBLY TRILLIONS

05:03.837 --> 05:05.372
OF PIECES OF DATA THEY'LL SAY,

05:05.372 --> 05:06.306
YOU KNOW, WHAT, HOW DO YOU

05:06.306 --> 05:08.909
ACTUALLY IDENTIFY THIS IS

05:08.909 --> 05:10.777
SPECIFICALLY ME THAT'S DOING

05:10.777 --> 05:12.445
THIS, OR GOING TO THE SITE, OR

05:12.445 --> 05:13.713
SAYING THIS THING IN A CHAT

05:13.713 --> 05:15.115
ROOM?

05:15.115 --> 05:17.551
>> WELL, I MEAN, WE HAVE-- WE

05:17.551 --> 05:19.085
DON'T ACTUALLY-- ONE OF THE

05:19.085 --> 05:20.887
INTERESTING PARTS OF THE STORY

05:20.887 --> 05:23.156
IS THAT WE HAD A BUNCH OF

05:23.156 --> 05:25.559
SPECIFIC CASES WHERE, FOR

05:25.559 --> 05:27.460
EXAMPLE, WE HAD MONITORED

05:27.460 --> 05:29.396
SOMETHING LIKE 200,000 PEOPLE

05:29.396 --> 05:31.698
FROM SOMETHING LIKE 185

05:31.698 --> 05:32.899
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, SO ALMOST

05:32.899 --> 05:34.601
EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.

05:34.601 --> 05:42.642
IN ONE CASE THEY DECIDED TO PICK

05:42.642 --> 05:45.345
OUT JUST ONE OF THESE PEOPLE.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.881
IT SEEMS LIKE AT RANDOM, WHAT

05:47.881 --> 05:49.249
WEB SITE HE HAD BEEN VIEWING.

05:49.249 --> 05:52.419
IT'S KIND OF AN ALL-SEEING

05:52.419 --> 05:54.020
SYSTEM.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.455
WHEN YOU'RE GATHERING THAT

05:55.455 --> 05:57.724
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION, THAT'S

05:57.724 --> 06:01.494
SOMETHING THAT DOES HAVE AN

06:01.494 --> 06:02.762
IMPACT OR EFFECT.

06:02.762 --> 06:05.465
>> Sreenivasan: THE QCHQ HAS

06:05.465 --> 06:07.834
EVEN MORE LAX OVERSIGHT THAN THE

06:07.834 --> 06:09.369
N.S.A.

06:09.369 --> 06:12.672
IN YOUR ARTICLED YOU POINTED TO

06:12.672 --> 06:13.940
A COUPLE OF CASES OF ALMOST

06:13.940 --> 06:16.676
CORPORATE ESPIONAGE.

06:16.676 --> 06:21.615
>> WE HAVE THE CASE WHERE THEY

06:21.615 --> 06:23.550
WERE MONITORING PEOPLE LISTENING

06:23.550 --> 06:25.452
TO INTERNET RADIO SHOWS.

06:25.452 --> 06:26.353
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF OTHER

06:26.353 --> 06:28.321
REALLY FASCINATING AND IMPORTANT

06:28.321 --> 06:30.223
CASE WHERE'S THEY'VE USED THIS

06:30.223 --> 06:34.461
INFORMATION TO-- MAJOR EUROPEAN

06:34.461 --> 06:37.664
TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES.

06:37.664 --> 06:38.765
THE REASON THEY DID DID THAT IS

06:38.765 --> 06:40.033
THEY WANTED TO GET INTO THESE

06:40.033 --> 06:41.901
COMPANIES' SYSTEMS AND STEAL

06:41.901 --> 06:43.236
INFORMATION THEY HELD IN THEIR

06:43.236 --> 06:44.738
SYSTEMS BECAUSE THAT WOULD HELP

06:44.738 --> 06:48.241
THEM SPY ON OTHER PEOPLE.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.611
ALSO, IN THESE CASES, THESE

06:51.611 --> 06:53.813
AMOUNTED TO MAJOR CYBER ATTACKS,

06:53.813 --> 06:55.649
CYBERATTACKS IN EUROPE ON ALLIED

06:55.649 --> 06:58.218
COUNTRIES, COMPANIES IN ALLIED

06:58.218 --> 07:04.057
COUNTRIES.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.158
AND SO, YOU KNOW, THE

07:05.158 --> 07:06.593
RAMIFICATIONS ARE QUITE SEVERE.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.628
EVEN IN TERMS OF THE EUROPEAN

07:08.628 --> 07:10.964
UNION, WHAT THE U.K. AGENCY IS

07:10.964 --> 07:12.666
DOING IN EUROPE.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.000
>> Sreenivasan: RYAN GALLAGHER

07:14.000 --> 07:14.934
FROM THE INTERCEPT, THANK YOU SO

07:14.934 --> 07:16.069
MUCH FOR JOINING ME.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.405
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON.

07:28.682 --> 07:29.749
>> Sreenivasan: POPE FRANCIS'

07:29.749 --> 07:31.351
VISIT COMES AT TIME WHEN U.S.

07:31.351 --> 07:32.919
CATHOLIC CHURCH ATTENDANCE HAS

07:32.919 --> 07:34.854
SHRUNK BY HALF IN THE PAST 40

07:34.854 --> 07:37.057
YEARS, AND WHEN 40% OF AMERICAN

07:37.057 --> 07:38.458
CATHOLICS WHO'VE LEFT THE CHURCH

07:38.458 --> 07:41.227
SAY THEY DON'T INTEND TO RETURN.

07:41.227 --> 07:42.929
BUT SINCE FRANCIS' ELEVATION TO

07:42.929 --> 07:44.864
THE PAPACY IN 2013, THERE'S BEEN

07:44.864 --> 07:47.100
A SLIGHT UPTICK IN ORDINATIONS--

07:47.100 --> 07:48.001
THE NUMBER OF MEN BECOMING

07:48.001 --> 07:49.069
PRIESTS.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.437
THE POPE WILL SPEND HIS FINAL

07:50.437 --> 07:52.339
EVENING IN THE U.S. TONIGHT AT A

07:52.339 --> 07:54.007
SEMINARY JUST OUTSIDE OF

07:54.007 --> 07:55.675
PHILADELPHIA, WHERE A DIVERSE

07:55.675 --> 07:57.544
GENERATION OF YOUNG MEN IS

07:57.544 --> 07:59.179
STUDYING TO BECOME THE CHURCH'S

07:59.179 --> 08:00.647
NEXT LEADERS.

08:00.647 --> 08:01.514
THE NEWSHOUR'S STEPHEN FEE

08:01.514 --> 08:02.916
VISITED THAT SEMINARY AND HAS

08:02.916 --> 08:05.118
THIS REPORT.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.286
>> Reporter: AT THE ST. CHARLES

08:06.286 --> 08:07.787
BORROMEO SEMINARY OUTSIDE

08:07.787 --> 08:11.024
PHILADELPHIA, 146 MEN ARE ON THE

08:11.024 --> 08:13.126
DECADE-LONG PATH TO BECOMING

08:13.126 --> 08:14.594
PRIESTS.

08:14.594 --> 08:15.428
THE CLASSROOMS LOOK

08:15.428 --> 08:16.963
CONVENTIONAL, AND YOU WOULD FIND

08:16.963 --> 08:18.898
SOME OF THE COURSES LIKE SPANISH

08:18.898 --> 08:20.633
AND PHILOSOPHY AT ANY AMERICAN

08:20.633 --> 08:22.535
COLLEGE.

08:22.535 --> 08:23.937
BUT YOU'LL SELDOM FIND WOMEN

08:23.937 --> 08:25.538
HERE, AS THE CHURCH STILL

08:25.538 --> 08:27.540
DOESN'T PERMIT WOMEN PRIESTS OR

08:27.540 --> 08:29.242
FOR ITS PRIESTS TO MARRY.

08:29.242 --> 08:30.677
AND CELIBACY IS STILL PART OF

08:30.677 --> 08:32.679
THE JOB DESCRIPTION.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.481
THAT VOW IS A WORTHY SACRIFICE,

08:34.481 --> 08:36.116
ACCORDING TO THE SEMINARIANS WE

08:36.116 --> 08:37.717
MET DURING OUR VISIT.

08:37.717 --> 08:38.451
DO YOU THINK THERE ARE

08:38.451 --> 08:39.386
MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT WHO

08:39.386 --> 08:40.754
SEMINARIANS ARE AND WHO PRIESTS

08:40.754 --> 08:41.921
ARE?

08:41.921 --> 08:43.790
>> OH YEAH.

08:43.790 --> 08:44.724
>> Reporter: LIKE WHAT?

08:44.724 --> 08:46.359
>> I JUST THINK THEY THINK WE'RE

08:46.359 --> 08:47.527
NOT LIKE NORMAL GUYS IN THE

08:47.527 --> 08:48.328
SENSE THAT WE DON'T WATCH

08:48.328 --> 08:49.262
MOVIES, WE DON'T WATCH TV.

08:49.262 --> 08:50.430
WE DON'T PLAY SPORTS, YOU KNOW.

08:50.430 --> 08:51.030
>> Reporter: DO YOU DO ANY OF

08:51.030 --> 08:51.564
THOSE THINGS?

08:51.564 --> 08:52.832
>> YES!

08:52.832 --> 08:54.534
>> Reporter: ORIGINALLY FOUNDED

08:54.534 --> 08:56.236
IN 1832 TO EDUCATE 500

08:56.236 --> 08:58.471
SEMINARIANS, TODAY ST. CHARLES

08:58.471 --> 08:59.873
ENROLLS LESS THAN A THIRD OF

08:59.873 --> 09:01.274
THAT FIGURE.

09:01.274 --> 09:03.109
THAT PARALLELS A NATIONWIDE

09:03.109 --> 09:04.644
TREND.

09:04.644 --> 09:06.446
SINCE 1970, THE NUMBER OF

09:06.446 --> 09:08.248
AMERICAN PRIESTS HAS DROPPED BY

09:08.248 --> 09:11.384
40%, FROM NEARLY 60,000 TO JUST

09:11.384 --> 09:13.887
OVER 37,000 TODAY.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.321
AND AS THE CATHOLIC POPULATION

09:15.321 --> 09:17.490
SHRINKS IN THE NORTH AND EAST

09:17.490 --> 09:19.492
AND GROWS IN THE SOUTH AND WEST,

09:19.492 --> 09:21.094
THOUSANDS OF PARISHES ARE

09:21.094 --> 09:22.896
WITHOUT PASTORS.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.831
BUT SINCE 2012, THERE'S BEEN A

09:24.831 --> 09:27.066
SMALL INCREASE IN ORDINATIONS IN

09:27.066 --> 09:30.403
THE U.S., FROM 457 THREE YEARS

09:30.403 --> 09:33.706
AGO TO 515 LAST YEAR.

09:33.706 --> 09:35.742
AT ST. CHARLES, 20 MEN ENROLLED

09:35.742 --> 09:37.377
IN THE SEMINARY THIS YEAR, UP

09:37.377 --> 09:39.612
FROM SIX MEN THE YEAR BEFORE.

09:39.612 --> 09:41.781
18-YEAR-OLD PHIL TRAN BEGAN HIS

09:41.781 --> 09:43.450

09:45.151 --> 09:47.287
VIETNAMESE-AMERICAN FAMILY, TRAN

09:47.287 --> 09:48.588

09:48.588 --> 09:50.957
TEACHINGS FROM A YOUNG AGE.

09:50.957 --> 09:52.058
>> SO IT'S FUNNY, BECAUSE FOR

09:52.058 --> 09:53.293
MOST OF MY LIFE, THE PRIESTHOOD

09:53.293 --> 09:55.161
WAS SOMETHING I KIND OF RAN AWAY

09:55.161 --> 09:56.596
FROM.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.431
I'VE ALWAYS HAD PEOPLE GOING UP

09:58.431 --> 09:59.499
TO ME, TELLING ME I'D MAKE A

09:59.499 --> 10:00.400
GOOD PRIEST.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.468
>> Reporter: BY SIXTH GRADE,

10:01.468 --> 10:02.535
FRIENDS AND FAMILY JOKINGLY

10:02.535 --> 10:04.838
CALLED HIM FATHER PHIL.

10:04.838 --> 10:05.905
STILL, WHEN HE FINISHED HIGH

10:05.905 --> 10:08.074

MECHANICAL ENGINEERING AT

10:09.676 --> 10:10.777
PHILADELPHIA'S DREXEL

10:10.777 --> 10:12.345
UNIVERSITY, WHERE HE WAS OFFERED

10:12.345 --> 10:14.247
A PARTIAL SCHOLARSHIP.

10:14.247 --> 10:15.548
>> KNOWING WHO I AM AS A PERSON,

10:15.548 --> 10:17.050
KNOWING THAT I WANT TO LIVE MY

10:17.050 --> 10:18.284
LIFE AS A MAN OF GOD, KNOWING

10:18.284 --> 10:21.788
THAT I HAVE A SERVANT HEART,

10:21.788 --> 10:24.157
THAT MADE ME JUST REALIZE THAT,

10:24.157 --> 10:26.292
YOU KNOW-- I LOVE MATH, I LOVE

10:26.292 --> 10:27.594
SCIENCE, I LOVE ENGINEERING, BUT

10:27.594 --> 10:29.896
I COULDN'T SEE MYSELF ENJOYING

10:29.896 --> 10:30.964
THAT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,

10:30.964 --> 10:32.031
WHEN I KNOW THAT I COULD BE

10:32.031 --> 10:32.966
TOUCHING PEOPLE'S LIVES IN A

10:32.966 --> 10:33.967
MORE DIRECT WAY, IN A WAY THAT

10:33.967 --> 10:35.835
GOD MIGHT BE CALLING ME TO DO.

10:35.835 --> 10:36.803
>> Reporter: TRAN IS ONE OF FOUR

10:36.803 --> 10:38.738
SEMINARIANS OF VIETNAMESE ORIGIN

10:38.738 --> 10:40.139
TO ENROLL AT ST. CHARLES THIS

10:40.139 --> 10:41.908
YEAR-- A SIGN OF THE CHANGING

10:41.908 --> 10:44.310
DEMOGRAPHICS WITHIN THE CHURCH.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.879
OVER THE PAST 40 YEARS, THE

10:45.879 --> 10:47.747
NUMBER OF FOREIGN-BORN CATHOLICS

10:47.747 --> 10:49.682
IN THE U.S. HAS INCREASED FIVE-

10:49.682 --> 10:51.651
FOLD, WITH AN INFLUX FROM ASIA

10:51.651 --> 10:54.087
AND LATIN AMERICA.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.822
MANUEL FLORES WAS BORN IN PUERTO

10:55.822 --> 10:57.790
RICO AND SAID, AT FIRST HIS

10:57.790 --> 10:59.359
MOTHER WAS DISAPPOINTED IN HIS

10:59.359 --> 11:00.827
CHOICE TO BECOME A PRIEST

11:00.827 --> 11:02.028
BECAUSE THAT MEANT HE WOULD

11:02.028 --> 11:04.097
NEVER MARRY OR HAVE CHILDREN.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.532
>> BEING IN A HISPANIC FAMILY,

11:05.532 --> 11:06.866
IT'S ABOUT THE FAMILY.

11:06.866 --> 11:08.101
SO, YOU KNOW, SHE WAS KIND OF

11:08.101 --> 11:09.802
HALF EXPECTING ME TO BE A

11:09.802 --> 11:11.671
FATHER, YOU KNOW, TO CHILDREN,

11:11.671 --> 11:14.140
BE MARRIED AND SUCH.

11:14.140 --> 11:16.075
BUT AND SHE KIND OF, AFTER I

11:16.075 --> 11:18.077
ENTERED, IT KIND OF BECAME MORE

11:18.077 --> 11:20.013
OF AN ACCEPTING KIND OF THING

11:20.013 --> 11:20.880
WITH MY MOTHER.

11:20.880 --> 11:25.084
SHE WAS VERY LOVING ABOUT IT.

11:25.084 --> 11:25.952
>> Reporter: BISHOP TIMOTHY

11:25.952 --> 11:28.187
SENIOR OVERSEES ST. CHARLES.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.490
AS A SEMINARIAN HERE IN 1979, HE

11:30.490 --> 11:32.458
MET POPE JOHN PAUL II WHEN HE

11:32.458 --> 11:34.093
VISITED PHILADELPHIA.

11:34.093 --> 11:35.495
TODAY, BISHOP SENIOR IS

11:35.495 --> 11:36.829
PREPARING FOR ANOTHER PAPAL

11:36.829 --> 11:38.331
VISIT.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.133
HE ATTRIBUTES THE RECENT UPTICK

11:40.133 --> 11:42.068
IN SEMINARIANS TO A GENERATIONAL

11:42.068 --> 11:43.102
CHANGE.

11:43.102 --> 11:44.938
>> WELL I DO THINK THAT THERE'S

11:44.938 --> 11:48.207
A SENSE AMONG YOUNGER PEOPLE

11:48.207 --> 11:51.010
TODAY, AMONG THE MILLENNIALS, OF

11:51.010 --> 11:52.278
THE IMPORTANCE OF SERVICE, OF A

11:52.278 --> 11:55.515
LIFE OF SERVICE AND GIVING BACK,

11:55.515 --> 11:58.151
AND AN ATTENTIVENESS TO THE

11:58.151 --> 11:59.919
NEEDS OF THOSE WHO ARE LESS

11:59.919 --> 12:01.321
FORTUNATE, AN AWARENESS THAT

12:01.321 --> 12:04.357
SOMEHOW HOW I'VE BEEN BLESSED IS

12:04.357 --> 12:05.992
ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY.

12:05.992 --> 12:07.126
>> Reporter: BISHOP SENIOR SAYS

12:07.126 --> 12:08.528
IT'S HARD TO SAY WHY THE NUMBER

12:08.528 --> 12:10.430
OF SEMINARIANS HAS INCHED UP,

12:10.430 --> 12:12.031
BUT HE BELIEVES POPE FRANCIS'

12:12.031 --> 12:14.434
FOCUS ON SERVING THE POOR AND

12:14.434 --> 12:15.401
REACHING OUT TO THOSE

12:15.401 --> 12:17.236
DISAFFECTED BY THE CHURCH MIGHT

12:17.236 --> 12:18.504
BE FACTORS.

12:18.504 --> 12:20.840
>> THERE WAS FOR TOO LONG-- AND

12:20.840 --> 12:21.874
THE HOLY FATHER HAS SAID THIS--

12:21.874 --> 12:23.910
I THINK A PRESUMPTION THAT IT'S

12:23.910 --> 12:26.779
LIKE THE CATHOLIC FAITH IS THE

12:26.779 --> 12:27.981
GIFT OF THE SACRAMENTS: THE

12:27.981 --> 12:30.750
EUCHARIST, THE CONFESSION, ALL

12:30.750 --> 12:33.486
OF OUR TRADITION.

12:33.486 --> 12:34.887
IT'S KIND OF, HERE IT IS, TAKE

12:34.887 --> 12:36.789
IT OR LEAVE IT.

12:36.789 --> 12:39.792
AND IT CAN'T BE THAT WAY.

12:39.792 --> 12:41.094
THE CHURCH NEEDS TO TURN OUTWARD

12:41.094 --> 12:42.328
AND TO AGAIN MEET PEOPLE WHERE

12:42.328 --> 12:44.097
THEY ARE AND HELP THEM TO

12:44.097 --> 12:47.033
DISCOVER THAT GREAT GIFT AGAIN.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.134
>> Reporter: ARE WE SEEING THE

12:48.134 --> 12:50.837
CLERGY CHANGE ALONG WITH THE

12:50.837 --> 12:51.671
CHANGES IN THE COMPLEXION OF THE

12:51.671 --> 12:52.905
GREATER CHURCH?

12:52.905 --> 12:54.407
>> THEY HAVE TO.

12:54.407 --> 12:55.408
OUR PRESBYTERATE NEEDS TO

12:55.408 --> 12:56.676
REFLECT THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE

12:56.676 --> 12:58.311
PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE.

12:58.311 --> 12:59.579
I'M THINKING HERE IN THE

12:59.579 --> 13:01.080
ARCHDIOCESE OF PHILADELPHIA

13:01.080 --> 13:02.248
THAT, YOU KNOW, ST. CHARLES

13:02.248 --> 13:04.951
SEMINARY TODAY IS 16% LATINO.

13:04.951 --> 13:05.918
>> Reporter: BUT THAT DIVERSITY

13:05.918 --> 13:07.854
DOESN'T INCLUDE WOMEN, DESPITE

13:07.854 --> 13:09.455
THE FACT THAT MORE THAN HALF OF

13:09.455 --> 13:11.391
AMERICAN CATHOLICS BELIEVE THE

13:11.391 --> 13:13.259
CLERGY SHOULD INCLUDE THEM.

13:13.259 --> 13:14.427
AND IT DOESN'T INCLUDE MARRIED

13:14.427 --> 13:15.962
MEN, THOUGH OTHER CHRISTIAN

13:15.962 --> 13:17.797
DENOMINATIONS ALLOW PASTORS TO

13:17.797 --> 13:19.365
MARRY.

13:19.365 --> 13:20.867
SO FAR, POPE FRANCIS IS NOT

13:20.867 --> 13:22.735
PREPARED TO CHANGE THAT.

13:22.735 --> 13:25.405
>> WE CAN'T CHANGE THE TEACHING

13:25.405 --> 13:28.007
TO SOLVE A PERSONNEL PROBLEM.

13:28.007 --> 13:33.312
THE SACRAMENTAL THEOLOGY THAT IS

13:33.312 --> 13:34.881
EMBEDDED IN THE CHURCH'S

13:34.881 --> 13:36.616
UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRIESTHOOD

13:36.616 --> 13:40.620
IS RELATED TO GENDER AND SO THAT

13:40.620 --> 13:43.022
THE PRIESTHOOD IS SOMETHING THAT

13:43.022 --> 13:45.792
WE BELIEVE IN THE PLAN OF JESUS

13:45.792 --> 13:48.528
WAS SOMETHING THAT HE SHARED

13:48.528 --> 13:50.029
WITH THE 12 APOSTLES WHO WERE

13:50.029 --> 13:51.497
MEN.

13:51.497 --> 13:52.799
>> Reporter: AT 36-YEARS-OLD,

13:52.799 --> 13:54.200
TIM SAHD IS NOT A TYPICAL

13:54.200 --> 13:55.501
SEMINARIAN.

13:55.501 --> 13:56.969
HE WORKED IN JOURNALISM AND IN

13:56.969 --> 13:58.604
HIS FAMILY'S METAL RECYCLING

13:58.604 --> 13:59.906
BUSINESS BEFORE DECIDING TO

13:59.906 --> 14:02.008
BECOME A PRIEST FOUR YEARS AGO.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.242
>> I BOUGHT A HOUSE.

14:03.242 --> 14:04.210
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE

14:04.210 --> 14:06.312
LAST KIND OF MOVE.

14:06.312 --> 14:08.948
BUT THERE WAS JUST SOMETHING

14:08.948 --> 14:11.517
INSIDE OF ME THAT, YOU KNOW, I

14:11.517 --> 14:12.685
DON'T KNOW THAT I COULD PROPERLY

14:12.685 --> 14:13.720
DESCRIBE IT.

14:13.720 --> 14:14.754
BUT I THINK ALL OF US HAVE THAT

14:14.754 --> 14:16.389
MOMENT WHERE WE REALIZE THAT

14:16.389 --> 14:17.990
EITHER SOMETHING FEELS RIGHT OR

14:17.990 --> 14:19.292
IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S JUST

14:19.292 --> 14:20.626
SOMETHING QUITE MISSING.

14:20.626 --> 14:22.462
I'VE GIVEN THINGS UP.

14:22.462 --> 14:23.296
BUT I DON'T LOOK AT IT THAT WAY

14:23.296 --> 14:24.197
AT ALL.

14:24.197 --> 14:27.300
BECAUSE THE THINGS I'VE RECEIVED

14:27.300 --> 14:29.335
ARE SO MUCH TO ME, SO MUCH

14:29.335 --> 14:30.737
GREATER THAN THE THINGS,

14:30.737 --> 14:32.472
PERHAPS, THAT I'VE GIVEN UP.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.040
>> Reporter: 40% OF SEMINARIANS

14:34.040 --> 14:35.608
HERE AT ST. CHARLES EVENTUALLY

14:35.608 --> 14:38.511
DECIDE NOT TO BECOME PRIESTS.

14:38.511 --> 14:39.912
IT'S NOT ONLY THE SACRIFICES

14:39.912 --> 14:41.280
THAT MAKE JOINING THE CLERGY A

14:41.280 --> 14:42.482
DIFFICULT DECISION.

14:42.482 --> 14:43.716
THERE IS ALSO THE CLOUD OF

14:43.716 --> 14:45.685
SEXUAL ABUSE.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.787
REVELATIONS ABOUT DECADES OF

14:47.787 --> 14:49.655
SEXUAL ABUSE BETWEEN 1950 AND

14:49.655 --> 14:52.592
2002 IMPLICATED MORE THAN 4,000

14:52.592 --> 14:54.093
AMERICAN PRIESTS.

14:54.093 --> 14:55.661
SOME PHILADELPHIA PRIESTS WENT

14:55.661 --> 14:56.729
TO PRISON.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.131
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO A PARENT WHO

14:58.131 --> 15:00.867
SAYS, I CAN'T TRUST THE CHURCH

15:00.867 --> 15:03.803
TO BRING MY SON INTO THE CLERGY

21:48.908 --> 21:51.143
TO REMIND ME TO TAKE MY INHALER.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.712
AND THE APP THAT IT'S ON MY

21:53.712 --> 21:56.148
PHONE, IT WILL TELL ME THAT IT'S

21:56.148 --> 21:57.783
A BAD AIR QUALITY DAY.

21:57.783 --> 22:00.119
AND I HAD NEVER PAID ATTENTION

22:00.119 --> 22:01.187
TO THAT IN THE PAST.

22:01.187 --> 22:03.656
AND NOW I DO.

22:05.991 --> 22:08.194
>>THIS IS PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND,

22:08.194 --> 22:09.929
SATURDAY.

22:14.934 --> 22:15.801
>> Sreenivasan: VOLKSWAGEN'S

22:15.801 --> 22:17.303
EMISSIONS TEST CHEATING SCANDAL

22:17.303 --> 22:18.437
HAS US TALKING ABOUT THE LEVEL

22:18.437 --> 22:19.972
OF POLLUTANTS COMING OUT OF

22:19.972 --> 22:21.207
CARS.

22:21.207 --> 22:22.875
CALIFORNIA'S AIR RESOURCES BOARD

22:22.875 --> 22:24.276
DECIDED FRIDAY TO REQUIRE

22:24.276 --> 22:25.778
AUTOMAKERS TO CUT CARBON

22:25.778 --> 22:27.379
EMISSIONS FROM GASOLINE AND

22:27.379 --> 22:29.481
DIESEL FUEL BY 10% OVER THE NEXT

22:29.481 --> 22:31.584
FIVE YEARS.

22:31.584 --> 22:32.985
CALIFORNIA IS ONLY THE SECOND

22:32.985 --> 22:35.087
STATE TO IMPOSE SUCH A STANDARD.

22:35.087 --> 22:36.222
JOINING US FROM LOS ANGELES TO

22:36.222 --> 22:37.823
EXPLAIN IS IAN LOVETT OF "THE

22:37.823 --> 22:38.924
NEW YORK TIMES."

22:38.924 --> 22:42.494
FIRST OF ALL, JUST EXPLAIN

22:42.494 --> 22:43.662
CARBON FUEL STANDARDS FOR

22:43.662 --> 22:44.396
SOMEONE WHO HASN'T BEEN PAYING

22:44.396 --> 22:45.965
ATTENTION.

22:45.965 --> 22:46.999
>> HI, HARI.

22:46.999 --> 22:48.634
THE RULE IS DESIGNED TO CUT

22:48.634 --> 22:50.669
EMISSIONS FROM GASOLINE AND

22:50.669 --> 22:51.837
DIESEL FUELS.

22:51.837 --> 22:53.572
AND WHAT IT MEANS IS THEY'RE

22:53.572 --> 22:55.207
GOING TO REQUIRE A 10% REDUCTION

22:55.207 --> 22:57.876
IN THE CARBON CONTENT OF THOSE

22:57.876 --> 22:59.678
FUELS BY 2020.

22:59.678 --> 23:00.746
WHICH WILL MEAN INCORPORATING

23:00.746 --> 23:03.916
MORE BIOFUELS LIKE BIODIESEL.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.884
NOW, CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS THE

23:05.884 --> 23:07.620
TOUGHEST EMISSION STANDARDS IN

23:07.620 --> 23:09.154
THE COUNTRY, BUT THIS PARTICULAR

23:09.154 --> 23:11.423
RULE HAD BEEN ON HOLD FOR LAST

23:11.423 --> 23:13.459
SELF YEARS BECAUSE OF A LAWSUIT,

23:13.459 --> 23:15.261
AND THE REAPPROVAL ON FRIDAYS

23:15.261 --> 23:16.462
MEANS THE STATE CAN KEEP MOVING

23:16.462 --> 23:18.063
FORWARD TOWARDS THE 10%

23:18.063 --> 23:20.833
REDUCTION AND START MOVING AWAY

23:20.833 --> 23:22.501
FROM PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND

23:22.501 --> 23:24.003
TOWARDS ALTERNATIVE FUELS.

23:24.003 --> 23:24.703
>> Sreenivasan: IS THERE

23:24.703 --> 23:25.604
ENOUGH OF A SUPPLY OF

23:25.604 --> 23:27.039
ALTERNATIVE FUELS FOR

23:27.039 --> 23:29.775
CALIFORNIANS.

23:29.775 --> 23:30.542
>> Reporter: THAT IS THE

23:30.542 --> 23:32.044
QUESTION, WHAT THE EFFECT WILL

23:32.044 --> 23:34.346
BE ON GAS PRICES.

23:34.346 --> 23:36.115
THE STATE IS PROJECTING THIS

23:36.115 --> 23:39.885
WILL LEAD TO A MAYBE $13 CENT

23:39.885 --> 23:42.821
PER GALLON RAISE BY 2020.

23:42.821 --> 23:43.956
I THINK THE BIG QUESTION GOING

23:43.956 --> 23:46.458
FORWARD IS IF PRICES DO START TO

23:46.458 --> 23:48.994
GO UP, HOW WILL PEOPLE REACT?

23:48.994 --> 23:51.230
SO FAR, CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN

23:51.230 --> 23:52.865
WILLING TO SUPPORT ENVIRONMENTAL

23:52.865 --> 23:55.401
LAWS, EVEN THAT HAS MEANT A

23:55.401 --> 23:57.603
SMALL HIT TO THEIR POCKETBOOKS

23:57.603 --> 23:58.904
BUT IF IT BECOMES A LARGER

23:58.904 --> 24:00.506
HIT IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.

24:00.506 --> 24:01.240
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT IAN

24:01.240 --> 24:04.009
LOVETT, THANK YOU.

24:04.009 --> 24:05.978
>> THANK YOU, HARI.

24:14.420 --> 24:15.554
>> Sreenivasan: AND FINALLY,

24:15.554 --> 24:18.457
JAPANESE CLIMBER KURIKI, IS

24:18.457 --> 24:19.858
CLOSING IN ON THE SUMMIT OF

24:19.858 --> 24:21.126
MOUNT EVERETT.

24:21.126 --> 24:23.228
HE WAS SET FOR A SOLO APPROACH

24:23.228 --> 24:26.165
TO THE PEAK, HIS FIRST ATTEMPT

24:26.165 --> 24:27.333
IN THE PAST SIX YEARS.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.868
ON A PREVIOUS TRY, HE LOST THE

24:29.868 --> 24:31.737
TIPS OF EIGHT FINGERS AND ONE

24:31.737 --> 24:33.572
THUMB TO FROSTBITE WHEN HE GOT

24:33.572 --> 24:36.141
STUCK AT 27,000 FEET IN MINUS 20

24:36.141 --> 24:37.209
DEGREE WEATHER.

24:37.209 --> 24:38.777
AND THE NEWSHOUR'S STEVEN FEE IS

24:38.777 --> 24:40.112
IN PHILADELPHIA WITH A LOOK AT

24:40.112 --> 24:43.315
WHAT'S ON THE PROGRAM TOMORROW.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.249
>> THANKS, HARI.

24:44.249 --> 24:45.351
WE'LL BE HERE IN THE CITY OF

24:45.351 --> 24:47.186
BROTHERLY LOVE FOR POPE FRANCIS'

24:47.186 --> 24:49.822
FINAL DAY IN THE UNITED STATES.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.390
PLANNERS HERE EXPECT UP TO A

24:51.390 --> 24:53.525
MILLION PEOPLE ON THE BENJAMIN

24:53.525 --> 24:55.194
FRANKLIN PARKWAY BEHIND ME FOR

24:55.194 --> 24:57.062
AN OPEN-AIR MASS BEFORE THE POPE

24:57.062 --> 24:59.965

24:59.965 --> 25:00.999

25:00.999 --> 25:02.034
