REPUBLICANS.

01:41.333 --> 01:43.267
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET ANY

01:43.267 --> 01:44.133
DEMOCRATIC VOTES FOR IT.

01:44.133 --> 01:45.733
HERE IS WHAT THEY DECIDED, WHA

01:45.733 --> 01:46.867
IS ON THE FLOOR.

01:46.867 --> 01:48.233
A CONTINUING RESOLUTION, A

01:48.233 --> 01:49.667
SPENDING BILL THAT WOULD FUN

01:49.667 --> 01:50.900
THE GOVERNMENT THROUGH DECEMBE

01:50.900 --> 01:53.433
15, THAT'S LONGER THAN THE

01:53.433 --> 01:55.667
SENATE DEMOCRATS HAD, THEY HAD

01:55.667 --> 01:56.433
NOVEMBER 15.

01:56.433 --> 01:57.600
THEN TWO OTHER THINGS THAT ARE

01:57.600 --> 01:58.100
IMPORTANT.

01:58.100 --> 01:59.667
ONE, A ONE YEAR DELAY OF OBAMA

01:59.667 --> 01:59.867
CARE

01:59.867 --> 02:01.833
THAT'S THEIR ANSWER TO HARRY

REID AND SENATE DEMOCRAT

02:03.033 --> 02:04.433
STRIPPING THAT DEFUND EFFORT W

02:04.433 --> 02:05.900
HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT.

02:05.900 --> 02:07.233
THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS A REPEAL

02:07.233 --> 02:11.333
OF A MEDICAL DEVICE TAX THAT

02:11.333 --> 02:12.533
HELPED TO FUND OBAMA CARE.

02:12.533 --> 02:13.967
IT SOUNDS LIKE A SMALL ISSUE

02:13.967 --> 02:16.333
WHY ARE REPUBLICANS PUTTING THAT

02:16.333 --> 02:16.767
IN THERE

02:16.767 --> 02:17.467
BECAUSE SENATE DEMOCRATS VOTED

02:17.467 --> 02:19.667
TO REPEAL THAT TAX, DON'T LIKE

02:19.667 --> 02:20.800
IT, THEY'RE TRYING TO PU

02:20.800 --> 02:21.967
POLITICAL PRESSURE ON DEMOCRAT

02:21.967 --> 02:23.767
NOT TO FLIP FLOP ON THE LITTLE

02:23.767 --> 02:25.033
MEDICAL DEVICE TAX

02:25.033 --> 02:28.600
IF THEY FLIP FLOP, HARRY REI

02:28.600 --> 02:29.133
HAS PROCEDURAL PROBLEMS.

02:29.133 --> 02:30.567
THEY'RE TRYING TO PUT ON

02:30.567 --> 02:31.433
POLITICAL PRESSURE

02:31.433 --> 02:33.533
THEY'LL DO ONE MORE THING, PAS

02:33.533 --> 02:35.567
A COMPANION BILL TO FUND THE

02:35.567 --> 02:37.667
PENTAGON AND TROOPS IN THE EVENT

02:37.667 --> 02:39.367
OF SHUTDOWN SO TROOPS AREN'T

02:39.367 --> 02:40.200
LEFT WITHOUT PAY

02:40.200 --> 02:41.767
>> WE HEARD FROM SENATOR HARRY

02:41.767 --> 02:43.100
REID SAY HE IS NOT DEALING WIT

02:43.100 --> 02:44.367
ANY PIECE OF LEGISLATION THA

02:44.367 --> 02:45.967
DOES ANYTHING TO OBAMA CARE.

02:51.967 --> 02:53.233
PROCEDURALLY IT IS PRETT

02:53.233 --> 02:54.133
INTERESTING, WE THINK WE KNO

02:54.133 --> 02:55.833
WHERE THIS IS PROBABLY HEADE

02:55.833 --> 02:57.467
BASED ON THE ARCANE PROCEDUR

02:57.467 --> 02:58.300
BAKED INTO THIS.

02:58.300 --> 03:00.267
THE WAY THIS IS STRUCTURED

03:00.267 --> 03:01.833
HARRY REID WILL HAVE A PRETT

03:01.833 --> 03:03.733
EASY TIME KILLING THE TW

GOES

03:26.133 --> 03:27.933
HE ONLY NEEDS 51 VOTES

03:27.933 --> 03:29.867
THE ONLY QUESTION IS WOULD H

03:36.533 --> 03:37.333
POWER TO REPUBLICANS

03:37.333 --> 03:38.867

DOES HE KILL IT, DOES HE GO TO
