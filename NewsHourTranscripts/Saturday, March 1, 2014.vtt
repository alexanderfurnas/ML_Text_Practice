AND PRO-RUSSIAN LOYALISTS HAVE

01:24.767 --> 01:26.700

01:26.700 --> 01:28.967
THE VOTE TO AUTHORIZE RUSSIA

01:28.967 --> 01:31.067
TROOPS TO UKRAINE CAME LESS THAN

01:31.067 --> 01:31.933
24 HOURS AFTER PRESIDENT OBAMA

01:31.933 --> 01:34.200
CALLED ON RUSSIA TO RESPEC

01:34.200 --> 01:35.500
UKRAINE'S SOVEREIGNTY AND WARNED

01:35.500 --> 01:37.967

WITH THE COUNCIL ON FOREIG

02:05.467 --> 02:06.867
RELATIONS.

02:06.867 --> 02:08.733
WHAT DOES THIS VOTE IN THE

02:08.733 --> 02:10.033
RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT MEAN TODAY?

02:10.033 --> 02:11.733
>> IT AUTHORIZES RUSSIA TO USE

02:11.733 --> 02:12.467
FORCE IN UKRAINE

02:12.467 --> 02:13.667
IT APPEARS IT HAPPENED AFTER THE

02:13.667 --> 02:15.667
FACT IN THE SENSE THAT OVER TH

02:15.667 --> 02:18.233
LAST 24 HOURS WE HAVE REPORTS OF

02:18.233 --> 02:21.067
TROOP MOVEMENT, OF RUSSIAN

02:21.067 --> 02:23.800
MOVEMENT FROM RUSSIA PROPER INTO

02:23.800 --> 02:24.333
CRIMEA

02:24.333 --> 02:25.833
THE RUSSIANS ARE SAYING THAT

02:25.833 --> 02:26.833
THAT'S OCCURRING UNDER THE

02:26.833 --> 02:29.000
PRETEXT OF THE TROOPS THAT ARE

02:29.000 --> 02:30.400
ALREADY THERE, AND SO THAT'S A

02:30.400 --> 02:32.600
LARGE CONTINGENT, SOME 15,000,

02:32.600 --> 02:35.533
BUT IT LOOKED PRETTY CLEAR THA

02:35.533 --> 02:37.067
THEY'RE DOING MORE THAN JUST

02:37.067 --> 02:37.600
ROTATING TROOPS.

02:37.600 --> 02:38.833
THOSE TROOPS HAVE BEEN OUT I

02:38.833 --> 02:41.067
THE FIELD, AND THE RUSSIAN

02:41.067 --> 02:43.833
PARLIAMENT HAS ALSO CALLED FOR

02:43.833 --> 02:46.200
MORE OF THE WITHDRAWAL OF TH

02:46.200 --> 02:47.167
AMBASSADOR IN THE UNITED STATE

02:47.167 --> 02:49.067
IN RESPONSE TO THE SPEECH THAT

02:49.067 --> 02:50.700
OBAMA GAVE YESTERDAY

02:50.700 --> 02:52.067
SO CLEARLY THE TEMPERATURE I

02:52.067 --> 02:53.967
RAPIDLY RISING, AND RUSSIA SEEMS

02:53.967 --> 02:56.000
TO WANT TO ESCALATE TH

02:56.000 --> 02:57.800
SITUATION, NOT TO BACK DOWN.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.467
>> WHAT ABOUT THE POSSIBLE E.U

02:59.467 --> 02:59.633
RESPONSE

02:59.633 --> 03:01.433
THEY'RE SCHEDULED TO HAVE MORE

03:01.433 --> 03:02.667
CRISIS TALKS A SECOND TIME IN

03:02.667 --> 03:04.467
COUPLE OF WEEKS.

03:04.467 --> 03:06.033
WHAT CAN THEY DO

03:06.033 --> 03:07.267
>> WELL, THEY'RE REALLY MOVING

03:07.267 --> 03:08.667
I THINK, ON TWO FRONTS

03:08.667 --> 03:11.367
ONE IS TO MOVE AS QUICKLY AS

03:11.367 --> 03:13.433
POSSIBLE ON PUTTING TOGETHER

03:13.433 --> 03:14.967
SOME KIND OF ECONOMIC PACKAG

03:14.967 --> 03:16.800
BECAUSE UKRAINE IS TEETERING O

03:16.800 --> 03:18.700
THE EDGE OF DEFAULT, AND THE

03:18.700 --> 03:21.200
UNITED STATES, THE E.U., AND THE

03:21.200 --> 03:23.200
IMF ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO COME

03:23.200 --> 03:25.133
UP WITH A PACKAGE, MAYBE AS HIGH

03:25.133 --> 03:25.933
AS $15 BILLION

03:25.933 --> 03:31.900
THAT'S WHAT THE RUSSIANS

03:31.900 --> 03:33.633
INITIALLY OFFERED TO PRESIDENT

03:33.633 --> 03:33.767
JANKOVICH.

03:33.767 --> 03:35.167
THAT'S WHAT THE PROTESTS BEGAN

03:35.167 --> 03:36.133
AND TOPPLED HIM.

03:36.133 --> 03:36.833
THE SECOND CONVERSATION, WHICH

03:36.833 --> 03:39.733
I'M GUESSING IS TAKING PLACE A

03:39.733 --> 03:42.833
WE SPEAK, IS ONE ABOUT A

03:42.833 --> 03:45.200
RESPONSE TO WHAT HAS OCCURRED.

03:45.200 --> 03:46.733
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID YESTERDAY

03:46.733 --> 03:49.267
THERE WILL BE COSTS, AND I

03:49.267 --> 03:50.433
LOOKED LIKE RUSSIA IS THROWING

03:50.433 --> 03:52.533
DOWN THE GAUNTLET, IS USIN

03:52.533 --> 03:54.167
MILITARY FORCE, WANTS TO TRY T

03:54.167 --> 03:56.433
SEPARATE CRIMEA TO STIR UP

03:56.433 --> 03:58.733
TROUBLE, AND SO THE U.S. AND THE

03:58.733 --> 04:00.500
E.U. WILL BE TALKING ABOUT WHA

04:00.500 --> 04:02.333
CAN WE DO TO SAY TO RUSSIA THA

04:02.333 --> 04:03.433
THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE

04:03.433 --> 04:05.967
>> WHAT ARE THE U.S. OPTIONS

04:05.967 --> 04:07.333
WHAT DOES PRESIDENT OBAMA HAVE

04:07.333 --> 04:09.567
>> WELL, I WOULD SAY THERE ARE

04:09.567 --> 04:13.233
THREE ARROWS IN THE QUIVER

04:13.233 --> 04:14.000
THE FIRST KIND OF RESPONSE WOULD

04:14.000 --> 04:17.400
BE DIPLOMATIC, AND THAT WOULD BE

04:17.400 --> 04:19.600
TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO PERHAP

04:19.600 --> 04:21.233
WITHDRAW AMBASSADORS FROM EUROPE

04:21.233 --> 04:22.100
AND THE UNITED STATES, THOSE

04:22.100 --> 04:23.400
THAT ARE IN MOSCOW

04:23.400 --> 04:26.033
IT COULD INVOLVE A CANCELLATIO

04:26.033 --> 04:28.967
OF THE G-8 SUMMIT, WHICH I

04:28.967 --> 04:31.600
SCHEDULED IN SOCHI IN ABOUT TW

04:31.600 --> 04:31.833
MONTHS

04:31.833 --> 04:33.733
IT COULD ALSO INVOLVE

04:33.733 --> 04:35.267
SUSPENSION OF RUSSIA MEMBERSHI

04:35.267 --> 04:37.100
IN THE G-8

04:37.100 --> 04:39.867
MOVING UP THE LADDER WOULD B

04:39.867 --> 04:41.500
SANCTIONS OF ONE SORT.

04:41.500 --> 04:43.733
ECONOMIC SANCTIONS, FREEZING

04:43.733 --> 04:46.967
ASSETS, DENYING VISAS TO RUSSIAN

04:46.967 --> 04:48.900
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE DEEMED TO

04:48.900 --> 04:50.400
BE INVOLVED IN THE TROUBLE I

04:50.400 --> 04:53.233
UKRAINE, AND, FINALLY, I'M

04:53.233 --> 04:55.033
GUESSING THAT THERE IS ALSO

04:55.033 --> 04:57.100
CONVERSATION ABOUT SOME KIND O

04:57.100 --> 04:57.867
MILITARY RESPONSE.

04:57.867 --> 05:00.333
CERTAINLY IT WILL NOT FOCUS ON A

05:00.333 --> 05:01.733
MILITARY RESPONSE IN UKRAINE

05:01.733 --> 05:03.967
BUT IT'S CONCEIVABLE THAT IF

05:03.967 --> 05:07.633
THIS SITUATION CONTINUES T

05:07.633 --> 05:09.033
ESCALATE THAT WE COULD SEE NAT

05:09.033 --> 05:12.300
DEPLOY TROOPS IN POLAND, IN TH

05:12.300 --> 05:12.433
BALTICS.

05:12.433 --> 05:14.933
THAT IS TO SAY THEY FORTIFY TH

05:14.933 --> 05:16.267
EASTERN FRONTIER

05:16.267 --> 05:17.533
>> WILL ANY OF THESE POSSIBL

05:17.533 --> 05:20.300
ACTIONS THAT YOU OUTLINE BE

05:20.300 --> 05:25.333
DETERRENT ON PUTIN

05:25.333 --> 05:26.933
>> I DON'T THINK THAT THEY WIL

05:26.933 --> 05:30.067
BE MOVING IN THE SENSE THAT WE

05:30.067 --> 05:31.633
ARE MOVING RAPIDLY FORWARD

05:31.633 --> 05:32.533
RUSSIA SEEMS TO BE DOING

05:32.533 --> 05:34.367
WHATEVER IT CAN TO STIR UP

05:34.367 --> 05:34.633
TROUBLE.

05:34.633 --> 05:36.400
ONE HUGE QUESTION THAT LOOMS O

05:36.400 --> 05:39.100
THE HORIZON IS RUSSIA GOING TO

05:39.100 --> 05:41.733
INTERFERE NOT JUST IN CRIMEA

05:41.733 --> 05:43.400
BUT IN THE EASTERN O BLOC, THE

05:43.400 --> 05:44.767
EASTERN STATES OF UKRAINE WHER

05:44.767 --> 05:46.767
YOU HAVE ABOUT 40% OF TH

05:46.767 --> 05:49.000
POPULATION BEING ETHNIC RUSSIAN.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.167
WERE THAT TO HAPPEN, IT'

05:51.167 --> 05:52.467
CONCEIVABLE THAT WE COULD SE

05:52.467 --> 05:54.933
THIS WIDEN INTO A CIVIL WA

05:54.933 --> 05:56.567
BETWEEN A EUROPE-ORIENTE

05:56.567 --> 05:59.733
WESTERN UKRAINE AND

05:59.733 --> 06:04.033
RUSSIA-ORIENTED EASTERN UKRAINE.

06:04.033 --> 06:04.833
>> THANKS SO MUCH.

06:04.833 --> 06:05.633
>> MY PLEASURE

06:05.633 --> 06:08.633
>>> IN BEIJING, CHINA, TODAY NEW

ISN'T NEW.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.233
USING HYDROPONIC GROWING SYSTEMS

17:28.233 --> 17:28.700
IS

17:28.700 --> 17:30.867
A METHOD OF FARMING USING WATE

17:53.167 --> 17:54.500
DEDICATED TO BUILDING SCIENC

17:54.500 --> 17:55.867
LABS IN URBAN SCHOOLS.

17:55.867 --> 17:57.100
>> IT'S REALLY NOT ABOUT URBAN

17:57.100 --> 18:00.533
FARMING FOR US

18:00.533 --> 18:01.767
IT'S ABOUT TALKING ABOUT

18:01.767 --> 18:02.000
SCIENCE.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.333
THAT'S BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE CAR

18:03.333 --> 18:04.067
ABOUT FOOD

18:04.067 --> 18:06.800
URBAN FARMING IS A GREAT WAY T

18:06.800 --> 18:07.467
DO IT.

ON THE ROOF OF THE SCHOO

18:12.633 --> 18:13.933
GYMNASIUM IN 2010.

18:13.933 --> 18:15.933
BECAUSE HYDROPONIC GROWING

18:15.933 --> 18:17.500
SYSTEMS ARE WATER-BASED, THE

18:17.500 --> 18:19.433
ARE MUCH LIGHTER THAN THEIR SOIL

18:19.433 --> 18:21.200
COUNTERPARTS AND EASIER TO

18:21.200 --> 18:22.267
INSTALL ON A ROOF.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.233
THERE ARE ALSO SEVERAL OTHER

18:23.233 --> 18:26.033
BENEFITS TO HYDROPONIC GROWING

18:26.033 --> 18:29.300
OVER TRADITIONAL SOIL FARMS.

18:29.300 --> 18:30.733
IT -- NUTRIENT LEVELS IN WATER

18:30.733 --> 18:32.300
CAN BE MORE EASILY CONTROLLED IN

18:32.300 --> 18:38.467
SOIL, BUT WATER IS CONSTANTL

18:38.467 --> 18:39.767
RECIRCULATED

18:39.767 --> 18:42.267
>> HOW MUCH DOES A GREENHOUS

18:42.267 --> 18:43.533

18:43.533 --> 18:47.500
>> THIS ONE COSTS $850,000

18:47.500 --> 18:47.633
YEAH

18:47.633 --> 18:49.933
SO THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT, BUT

18:49.933 --> 18:51.467
IF YOU COMPARE IT TO WHAT

18:51.467 --> 18:52.767
SCIENCE LAB COSTS, IT'S PROBABLY

18:52.767 --> 18:53.433
ABOUT THE SAME

18:53.433 --> 18:55.600
>> USE AING COMBINATION OF
