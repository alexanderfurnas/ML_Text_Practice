JUDY WOODRUFF: But first:
Researchers have been watching
for months, waiting for a huge

00:06.633 --> 00:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
iceberg to break away from
an ice shelf in Antarctica.

00:08.400 --> 00:10.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That break was confirmed today.

00:10.466 --> 00:14.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And just to give you a sense
of the size, the volume of the
iceberg is said to be twice

00:14.466 --> 00:16.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as large as Lake Erie.

00:16.466 --> 00:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Miles O'Brien has been watching
all this and digging into the
larger questions about the

00:19.900 --> 00:21.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ice shelf.

00:21.133 --> 00:22.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Here's an update to
an earlier report.

00:22.666 --> 00:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of our weekly segment
on the Leading Edge of science.

00:24.700 --> 00:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: This fast-growing
rift in the Antarctica ice
just created one of the largest

00:27.233 --> 00:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
icebergs ever recorded,
about the size of Delaware,
weighing more than one trillion

00:31.333 --> 00:32.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tons.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The event had been
anticipated for months.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Finally, some time between
Monday and today, the Larsen
Sea Ice Shelf became 12 percent

00:36.666 --> 00:38.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
smaller.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we have known about this
for quite a while, right?

00:40.433 --> 00:45.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KELLY BRUNT, University
of Maryland: We have
certainly known about
the bulk of this rift

00:47.966 --> 00:50.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for a while.

00:50.066 --> 00:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Kelly Brunt is a
glaciologist at the University
of Maryland and NASA's Goddard

00:54.100 --> 00:56.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Space Flight Center.

00:56.200 --> 01:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She used a wall of monitors
there to show me the growing
rift, fueled in part by rising

01:01.000 --> 01:03.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
air and sea temperatures.

01:03.066 --> 01:05.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If the glaciers in West
Antarctica all dropped
into the water, global
sea level would rise

01:05.866 --> 01:07.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by more than 15 feet.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brunt showed me the big
picture, a composite of images
from several satellites.

01:09.233 --> 01:11.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is how the
glacier ice flows here.

01:11.400 --> 01:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: Ice flows from
the center of the continent
out to the edges, much like

01:17.966 --> 01:20.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
syrup on the center of
your pancake flowing
towards the edges.

01:20.366 --> 01:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you can see there are
areas where it's moving pretty
slowly, and then there are areas

01:24.900 --> 01:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
where it's moving very quickly.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And those quick places
are generally in our
areas of ice shelves.

01:28.966 --> 01:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So, when we
think about ice, we think
about something static.

01:32.566 --> 01:34.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not static, is it?

01:34.400 --> 01:36.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KELLY BRUNT: Not at all.

01:36.733 --> 01:38.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Actually, it's highly dynamic.

01:38.466 --> 01:42.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You can see from this
image it looks to me a
lot like a river system.

01:42.566 --> 01:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Ice shelves
are connected to the glaciers
that sit on land, but they are

01:47.066 --> 01:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also floating, like ice
cubes in a glass of water.

01:49.100 --> 01:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: If you had a drink
with ice cubes in it, as those
ice cube melts, they don't

01:55.066 --> 01:57.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
add to the height of
the water in the glass.

01:57.200 --> 02:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So when ice shelves break down
and collapse, they do not have
a direct impact on mean sea

02:01.100 --> 02:02.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
level rise.

02:02.333 --> 02:04.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
However, they have
an indirect effect.

02:04.366 --> 02:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These ice shelves buttress
the flow of the ice upstream,
the ice that's flowing into

02:07.033 --> 02:09.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the system.

02:09.066 --> 02:11.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And when you lose that
buttressing force,
you allow the upstream
glaciers to flow faster.

02:11.300 --> 02:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So that's similar to putting
more ice cubes into the
glass and letting those melt.

02:15.833 --> 02:18.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Ice falls off the
edge of glaciers all the time.

02:18.500 --> 02:21.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It is part of a natural
process called calving.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kelly Brunt says it is important
to judge the size of the
piece that breaks off relative

02:27.333 --> 02:31.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the size of the
glacier that is behind it.

02:32.433 --> 02:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She says your fingernails
offer a handy model.

02:34.433 --> 02:36.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: If you break
your fingernail inside the
white part of your fingernail,

02:36.966 --> 02:39.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you probably don't
think much of it.

02:39.033 --> 02:43.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you break it below the
white part, you put a Band-Aid
on it, you think about it and

02:43.566 --> 02:45.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you keep an eye on it.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
If you lose your whole
fingernail, I don't
know what happens.

02:47.900 --> 02:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's pretty catastrophic.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This represents losing
the whole fingernail.

02:51.666 --> 02:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Like so many
features in Antarctica,
the Larsen Ice Shelf
is named for a famous

02:55.966 --> 02:57.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
19th century explorer.

02:57.633 --> 03:00.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it is disappearing,
section by section,
identified by letters.

03:00.900 --> 03:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Larsen A disintegrated in 1995.

03:03.400 --> 03:06.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in 2002, a series
of satellite images
captured the end of Larsen
B in dramatic fashion

03:06.033 --> 03:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over the course of six weeks.

03:08.066 --> 03:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The piece that broke off was
the size of Rhode Island.

03:12.300 --> 03:16.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: Losing this much
ice, losing ice that represents
roughly the state of Rhode

03:16.166 --> 03:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Island in a month-and-a-half,
just far exceeded
anybody's expectations
of what could happen

03:21.033 --> 03:23.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the time scale
that it could happen.

03:23.066 --> 03:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So, it was kind
of like, we have to rethink
things here a little bit.

03:26.833 --> 03:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, this is a wakeup call.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: This was
absolutely a wakeup call.

03:30.600 --> 03:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Scientists track
the ice using a half-dozen
U.S. and European satellites,

03:32.633 --> 03:34.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
including Landsat, which
gathered these images.

03:34.166 --> 03:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But some of their best data came
from a satellite called ICESat.

03:36.400 --> 03:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Launched in 2003, it
ceased operation in 2009.

03:39.133 --> 03:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It precisely measured the
glaciers using laser beams.

03:41.133 --> 03:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: This is quite
a few years of ICESat data
merged together to get a sense

03:46.600 --> 03:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in meters per year how
our ice sheet is changing.

03:49.333 --> 03:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you can see, the big picture
here is that our ice sheets
are changing where they are

03:54.200 --> 03:56.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in contact with both our warming
atmosphere and a warming ocean.

03:56.666 --> 03:59.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it's basically along
the fringe of the continent.

03:59.200 --> 04:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: When ICESat
failed, NASA started
tracking the ice using
radar and lasers on

04:05.066 --> 04:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
board low-flying aircraft.

04:07.033 --> 04:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The IceBridge program is NASA's
largest air campaign ever,
but it still could not match

04:09.100 --> 04:11.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the eye above the sky.

04:11.066 --> 04:11.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It goes without saying that you
would view these satellites,
the capability to look at

04:11.866 --> 04:13.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this, as essential?

04:13.900 --> 04:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: What we're talking
about is a calving of an iceberg
that's a size of a state.

04:16.633 --> 04:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To get that, you really need
a satellite to be able to
see all of it in one shot.

04:23.700 --> 04:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a function of scale and
repeatability to go back and
look at that area again with

04:28.900 --> 04:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the satellite that makes these
the perfect tools for looking
at the large-scale change

04:32.633 --> 04:35.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that we're seeing
in this region.

04:35.100 --> 04:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And that's
precisely what Kelly
Brunt and her colleagues
will be doing now,

04:38.700 --> 04:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
using satellite data, data
from the scant weather stations
that are on the surface there,

04:45.600 --> 04:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and additionally with buoys
which are in the water itself.

04:49.366 --> 04:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will be poring over this
data over the course of actually
years to try to make some

05:01.233 --> 05:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of definitive statement
-- and I put definitive in
quotes because it's science,

05:10.433 --> 05:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after all -- as to whether
this particular calving event
is linked to climate change

05:16.133 --> 05:18.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
- - Judy.

05:18.133 --> 05:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, is
there a definitive answer
to that at this point?

05:19.400 --> 05:22.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It sounds like you're saying no.

05:22.166 --> 05:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Not just yet.

05:24.233 --> 05:26.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's what we know.

05:26.266 --> 05:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Larsen B, the previous big
calving event, scientists say
there is a very strong pile

05:31.666 --> 05:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of evidence indicating it
is linked to climate change.

05:34.700 --> 05:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Larsen A, they have
practically no data at all.

05:39.633 --> 05:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's one of these things
that, as Kelly Brunt put it,
this is where it gets exciting

05:45.500 --> 05:47.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for scientists.

05:47.466 --> 05:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will try to determine
if it's climate change that
actually caused this to happen,

05:53.400 --> 05:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and also they will be
looking at the stability
of the ice shelf behind it.

05:58.033 --> 05:59.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Does the flow increase?

05:59.800 --> 06:04.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What about the
glacier behind the

06:18.666 --> 06:20.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ice shelf itself?

06:20.733 --> 06:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Looking at all that will give
them a lot of clues about what
this is going to mean ultimately

06:37.900 --> 06:40.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for sea level rise.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And speaking of
that, do they know the effect
this is going to have on sea

06:48.733 --> 06:52.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
levels in the area
and around the world?

06:52.333 --> 06:56.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes,
that's the big question.

06:56.066 --> 07:00.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Larsen C, even though
it's called a shelf,
it's kind of misleading.

07:00.566 --> 07:05.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was already in the water.

07:07.533 --> 07:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so like an ice cube in a
glass of water, it had already
done its bit of displacement

07:19.233 --> 07:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and already had made its
impact on sea level rise.

07:23.033 --> 07:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it had fallen off, scientists
estimate it would have
increased sea level across the

07:28.900 --> 07:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
world by three millimeters.

07:30.366 --> 07:32.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That the gives you the
idea of the size of this.

07:32.466 --> 07:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, now the situation here is
to see whether the increased
rate, if there's an increased

07:34.666 --> 07:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rate in the flow of that ice
shelf into the water, what
impact that might have on sea

07:52.900 --> 07:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
level rise in coming years.

07:54.900 --> 07:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, again, Judy, this is
long-term science, and we will
just have to watch it for years

08:04.333 --> 08:06.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to come.

08:06.700 --> 08:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, finally,
Miles, what happens
to this gigantic piece
of ice now that it's

08:13.100 --> 08:15.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
broken off?

08:15.066 --> 08:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, it
will probably not stay
intact the size of Delaware.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It will break up over time.

08:29.966 --> 08:34.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fortunately, where it is,
it's not going to be in the
way of any shipping channels.

08:39.100 --> 08:44.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So it shouldn't be a
hazard to navigation,
but that's a big part of

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what is going to happen along
with the other research.

09:14.133 --> 09:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They will be tracking to see
how this iceberg breaks up.

09:21.100 --> 09:24.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it will be a big
iceberg to start, and over
time it will get smaller.

09:43.633 --> 09:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
our iceberg man, Miles
O'Brien, thank you very much.

10:00.566 --> 10:03.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN:
You're welcome, Judy.
