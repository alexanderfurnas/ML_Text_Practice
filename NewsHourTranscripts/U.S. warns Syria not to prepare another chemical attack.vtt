JUDY WOODRUFF: The White House
today reinforced a stark warning
to the government of Syria's

00:04.600 --> 00:08.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Bashar al-Assad against
using chemical weapons.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last night, the administration
announced that the U.S. had
detected -- quote -- "potential

00:12.900 --> 00:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
preparations" by the regime to
use the banned weapons, again.

Chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret
Warner reports.

00:20.466 --> 00:25.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: President
Assad was seen today touring
a Russian air base just hours

00:26.600 --> 00:28.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
after last night's
White House statement.

00:28.833 --> 00:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It warned that the Syrian
regime would pay a heavy price
for launching another chemical

00:34.633 --> 00:36.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
attack.

00:36.700 --> 00:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the Pentagon elaborated,
saying the U.S. has seen active
preparations for chemical

00:42.066 --> 00:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weapons use at Shayrat air base
near Homs in Western Syria.

Nancy Youssef is senior
national security
correspondent at BuzzFeed.

00:50.066 --> 00:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NANCY YOUSSEF, BuzzFeed: The
Pentagon told us that they saw
evidence of planes that were

00:53.133 --> 00:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
used to conduct aerial chemical
attacks in the past being moved
around on Shayrat airfield.

01:00.100 --> 01:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We also heard reports of chatter
happening on the ground in
preparation for a possible

01:04.866 --> 01:06.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
imminent attack.

01:06.900 --> 01:10.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The number of people who knew
was so limited, and the message
from the White House was so

01:12.000 --> 01:14.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ominous, that it created
a real confusion that
we are just not used to.

01:14.166 --> 01:18.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: A chemical
weapons attack was launched
from that same base in April,

01:18.466 --> 01:21.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
killing dozens of men,
women and children.

01:21.466 --> 01:24.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Syrians denied
responsibility.

01:24.866 --> 01:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But President Trump ordered
the U.S. military to fire 59
Tomahawk missiles at the base.

01:33.933 --> 01:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump's response was a sharp
departure from his predecessor's
caution about intervening

01:39.666 --> 01:41.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Syria's civil war.

01:41.833 --> 01:46.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In 2012, President Obama
famously warned that the
use of chemical weapons
use would constitute

01:47.700 --> 01:50.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a red line, triggering
U.S. action.

01:50.366 --> 01:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But instead, after a deadly
August, 2013, attack on a
Damascus suburb, then-Secretary

01:57.400 --> 02:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of State John Kerry and Russia
worked on a deal with Assad
that aimed to rid his regime

02:02.833 --> 02:05.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of chemical weapons.

02:05.333 --> 02:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump officials say
that strategy clearly
didn't work, and it's
taking a tougher approach

02:10.033 --> 02:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to Syria and its key backers.

02:12.466 --> 02:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley
spoke at a House hearing today.

02:15.966 --> 02:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NIKKI HALEY, U.S. Ambassador to
the United Nations: I believe
that the goal is, at this

02:18.866 --> 02:23.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
point, not just to send Assad
a message, but to send Russia
and Iran a message that, if

02:25.800 --> 02:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this happens again, we
are putting you on notice.

02:29.933 --> 02:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: A spokesman
for Russian President Vladimir
Putin retorted: "Such threats to

02:36.266 --> 02:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Syria's legitimate
leaders are unacceptable."

02:38.666 --> 02:43.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Iran's foreign minister
said: "Another dangerous
U.S. escalation in Syria
on fake pretext will

02:45.766 --> 02:49.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
only serve ISIS," the
Islamic State group.

02:49.233 --> 02:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since the April 3 U.S.
missile barrage, the
U.S. has had several
confrontations with pro-Assad

02:56.233 --> 03:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forces, shooting down a
Syrian air force jet and an
armed Iranian-made drone.

03:02.166 --> 03:06.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In response, Russia has
threatened to target
coalition aircraft in
certain parts of Syria.

03:07.933 --> 03:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, it's unclear what the
broader U.S. strategy is.

03:11.233 --> 03:15.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NANCY YOUSSEF: Is the
U.S. committed to a
form of deterrence
against the regime for

03:15.566 --> 03:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
possible chemical attacks?

03:16.700 --> 03:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And, if so, in what form?

03:19.300 --> 03:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Going forward, will the
U.S. put out a statement
every time it suspects
chemical weapons attacks?

03:22.733 --> 03:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that what we are to take
away from yesterday's statement?

03:25.233 --> 03:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
