lesson for both

00:41.208 --> 00:45.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%

01:09.236 --> 01:14.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

01:26.320 --> 01:28.221 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of a massacre.

01:28.255 --> 01:37.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we have witnessed
indiscriminate slaughter,
not accidents of war, not
collateral damage,

01:37.831 --> 01:39.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

01:48.375 --> 01:53.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Syria's President Bashar

the fall of Aleppo to the birth

01:53.847 --> 01:56.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or the revelation of the Koran.

02:24.711 --> 02:29.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

guilty today
of federal hate crimes and other

02:29.750 --> 02:36.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In closing arguments, the
prosecution called
Roof a cold, calculated killer,
full of hate.

02:36.123 --> 02:40.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

02:56.276 --> 03:00.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Arctic blast also brought
snow from the

contaminated
with chemicals from an
industrial leak yesterday.

03:43.557 --> 03:48.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The warning has caused a run on
bottled water,
with long lines at grocery
stores across the

03:50.197 --> 03:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

sanctions against Iran for
another 10 years.

04:23.930 --> 04:29.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The extension became law
automatically when
President Obama declined to sign
or veto the

bill.

04:31.638 --> 04:35.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The White House says the

most of the sanctions, but it's
warning Congress

04:35.308 --> 04:39.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against doing anything else to
undo the nuclear
deal with Iran.

JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS
SECRETARY:
The president did not veto this
bill because

04:42.249 --> 04:44.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it does not undermine the deal.

04:44.084 --> 04:48.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there'’s been plenty of
rhetoric and
plenty of legislative work done
on legislation

04:48.889 --> 04:50.790 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that would blow up the deal.

04:50.824 --> 04:55.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is a message that if
the United States
Congress blows up the deal that
prevents Iran

04:55.095 --> 04:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from obtaining a nuclear weapon,
they will
have to deal with the grave
consequences that

president of the
United States, Steve, can focus
100 percent

07:40.193 --> 07:41.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on being president of the United
States.

07:41.695 --> 07:42.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's going to take a little bit
longer.

07:43.029 --> 07:44.698 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(END VIDEO CLIP)

07:44.731 --> 07:48.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, there's new
pressure
today from a group of Senate
Democrats, who

07:48.501 --> 07:53.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unveiled a bill that would
require Mr. Trump
to divest from his businesses,
and put his

07:53.840 --> 07:55.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
assets in a blind trust.

07:56.009 --> 08:01.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Here now to unpack those
possible conflicts
of interests are Marilyn Geewax.

08:01.181 --> 08:04.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She'’s senior business editor for
NPR.

08:04.451 --> 08:09.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Richard Painter, he's a
professor at the
University of Minnesota Law
School and he

08:09.155 --> 08:13.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was a White House ethics adviser
for President
George W. Bush.

08:13.560 --> 08:16.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

08:16.062 --> 08:19.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marilyn Geewax, let me start
with you, what
do we know about why this
announcement is

08:19.566 --> 08:21.434 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
being postponed?

08:21.468 --> 08:24.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARILYN GEEWAX, NPRR: We know
very little,
other than what he tweets but
one can speculate.

08:25.004 --> 08:30.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had said several weeks ago
that he would
have this press conference
today, on the 15th,

08:30.844 --> 08:32.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and on Monday, he said, never
mind.

08:32.912 --> 08:34.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'’m not really going to do that.

08:34.714 --> 08:39.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, people are speculating that
some think
he wanted to wait until after
the Electoral

08:39.252 --> 08:41.054 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
College votes.

08:41.087 --> 08:44.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Others say the business is just
so complicated
that it's going to take more
legal work to

08:44.791 --> 08:48.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
figure out how to pull him out
of it.

08:48.962 --> 08:54.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And others just say that this is
just kind
of a general smokescreen, that
you could say

08:54.701 --> 08:58.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're going to do this, you
stall for two
weeks, then he says he's going
to do it, but

08:58.772 --> 09:00.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now, he's going to stall longer.

09:00.540 --> 09:04.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And by the time he does get to
this topic,
it will be January, and we'll be
focused on

09:04.444 --> 09:06.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the inauguration and it will
seem smaller.

09:06.746 --> 09:10.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Well, Richard Painter,
as we just
reported, Mr. Trump tweeted
today.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.286 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You know, it's not complex.

09:13.319 --> 09:16.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, we just heard
Kellyanne
Conway, we've heard some of his
other advisers

09:17.023 --> 09:19.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say, well, there is more work to
be done here
to sort it all out.

09:19.959 --> 09:22.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD PAINTER, UNIVERSITY OF
MINNESOTA:
Well, it isn't that complex to
sell businesses,

09:22.829 --> 09:26.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
particularly if you have the
advice of some
of the best lawyers and
investment bankers

09:27.000 --> 09:27.934 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in New York.

09:27.967 --> 09:29.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They buy and sell businesses all
the time.

09:29.836 --> 09:32.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He could have a public offering.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He could find a private equity
firm.

09:34.207 --> 09:35.742 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sell it to a private equity
firm.

09:35.775 --> 09:37.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are a number of different
options.

09:37.644 --> 09:42.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think it's that complex,
but it does
need to be done correctly.

09:42.415 --> 09:47.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I wish he would assure us at
this point
that he is going to sell off his
business

09:47.787 --> 09:52.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interests, and in particular, he
needs to
be in compliance with the
Constitution, and

09:52.091 --> 09:57.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Emoluments Clause of the
Constitution
which prohibits payoffs from
foreign governments

09:57.964 --> 09:59.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to United States officials.

09:59.799 --> 10:02.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They simply cannot receive
payments from foreign
governments.

10:02.769 --> 10:06.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The businesses doing businesses
with foreign
governments, he can't own them.

10:06.339 --> 10:12.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: So, Marilyn Geewax, is
there agreement
among ethics experts -- and I
know, you know,

10:12.712 --> 10:16.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
professor Painter is one of them
-- is there
agreement about what Donald
Trump needs to

10:16.583 --> 10:17.550 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do?

10:17.584 --> 10:19.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GEEWAX: I think there really is
broad agreement.

10:19.719 --> 10:25.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There'’s -- I can't think of
anybody, really,
who would say, "No, it's a great
idea to keep

10:25.158 --> 10:29.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
owning hotels a couple of blocks
from the
White House and having people
feel pressured

10:29.896 --> 10:36.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to stay at your hotel when" -- I
mean, it
just -- it's pretty much second
grade stuff

10:36.469 --> 10:40.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to see that there could be all
sorts of conflicts
of interest.

10:40.707 --> 10:47.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's going to be shaping foreign
policy, and
he has businesses in something
like 20 countries.

10:47.213 --> 10:52.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He literally has some position
in hundreds
of companies over all of these
different parts

10:52.752 --> 10:54.587 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the world.

10:54.621 --> 11:00.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would be impossible to
separate out when
is someone trying to win his
favor, or curry

11:00.860 --> 11:03.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
favor by boosting his business
and when aren't
they?

11:03.863 --> 11:09.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's really pretty obvious that
you need to
have a big, very high wall -- if
you're going

11:09.068 --> 11:13.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to build a wall, that's the one
you want to
build -- between your business
and your job

11:13.239 --> 11:15.008 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as president.

11:15.041 --> 11:16.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Well, we don't know
what he's going
to do for sure, but, Richard
Painter, one

11:16.809 --> 11:20.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the things he said is that he
wants his
sons -- or suggested that he
wants his sons

11:20.246 --> 11:21.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to take over the business.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Would that provide a measure of
separation?

11:24.517 --> 11:27.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAINTER: Well, no, particularly
if he's still
going to own the businesses.

11:27.754 --> 11:31.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In order to give them to his
son, he'd have
to pay the gift tax.

11:31.157 --> 11:33.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think he likes paying
taxes.

11:33.726 --> 11:39.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if he just has his sons
manage the businesses,
that's not going to solve any of
these problems.

11:39.299 --> 11:43.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the businesses taking money
from the foreign
governments, he'’s going to be in
violation

11:43.636 --> 11:46.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the Constitution on January
20 if he owns
the businesses.

11:46.940 --> 11:52.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Is there a precedent,
Richard Painter,
for a president -- and we know
-- we don't

11:52.278 --> 11:55.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
typically have billionaires
assuming the office
of the presidency.

11:55.949 --> 12:01.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But is there any precedent --
what is the
precedent for a -- someone
coming into office

12:01.287 --> 12:04.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and figuring out some way to
keep his family
involved?

12:04.557 --> 12:07.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAINTER: Well, we'’ve had family
members
of the president involved.

12:08.027 --> 12:11.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Usually, of course, it's the
spouse.

12:11.331 --> 12:17.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And -- but the involvement is
informal, and
giving advice to the president
about how to

12:17.570 --> 12:19.505 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do his job.

12:19.539 --> 12:24.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But running a business on the
side and trying
to profit from the presidency,
that's what's

12:24.944 --> 12:26.679 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
inappropriate.

12:26.713 --> 12:29.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I do not think we have
family members
who are both attending official
meetings and

12:29.515 --> 12:31.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then on the other hand running a
business.

12:31.718 --> 12:36.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And this week, Marilyn
Geewax, we've
seen the children just yesterday
in that meeting

12:36.556 --> 12:38.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with technology executives.

12:38.891 --> 12:43.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both of his sons were there, his
daughter,
Ivanka, her husband, Jared
Kushner.

12:43.763 --> 12:50.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump has talked about
bringing Ivanka
and Jared Kushner into the
administration.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's the precedent there?

12:52.271 --> 12:55.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, everybody refers back to
John Kennedy
and his brother Bobby as
attorney general.

12:55.541 --> 12:57.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But that was back in the 1960s.

12:57.243 --> 12:59.145 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GEEWAX: Right.

12:59.178 --> 13:03.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are rules that are
supposed -- ethics
that have grown up in the
post-Watergate era,

13:03.616 --> 13:08.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since 1978, where you really
were trying to
address these kinds of problems
of nepotism

13:08.287 --> 13:11.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and conflicts of interest where
Congress did
spell it out.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's pretty clear what the will
of the Founding
Fathers was.

13:13.960 --> 13:19.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They didn't want you to take
money foreign
governments and they didn't want
people to

13:19.132 --> 13:21.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have conflicts of interest.

13:21.067 --> 13:26.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you're the president, you
should be focused
on doing only what is right for
all Americans,

13:26.072 --> 13:27.740 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not for your family business.

13:27.774 --> 13:33.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what we've seen this week is
really an
aggressive push-back to that.

13:33.079 --> 13:38.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, rather than have this
press conference
and talk about solving conflicts
of interest,

13:38.251 --> 13:40.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he had a meeting with a bunch of
tech executives.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.021 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOODRUFF: Right.

13:42.055 --> 13:45.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEEWAX: There were 25 people at
the table
and four of them were Trumps.

13:45.158 --> 13:48.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, that's pretty aggressive
on his part.

13:48.194 --> 13:49.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: That's right.

13:49.195 --> 13:52.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And his daughter, Ivanka's
husband.

13:52.165 --> 14:00.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Richard Painter, if there
is some arrangement
say where Ivanka Trump was
involved-- obviously

14:00.239 --> 14:01.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not the first lady.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That would be Mrs. Trump.

14:03.810 --> 14:09.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But if she is there in a
semiofficial role
as daughter of the president, if
Jared Kushner

14:09.315 --> 14:14.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is involved, as has been
suggested, maybe
advising on national security,
the Middle

14:14.053 --> 14:19.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
East, and they're not paid,
could an agreement
like that work?

14:19.192 --> 14:23.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAINTER: Well, I think you
probably have to
work out with Congress because
the anti-nepotism

14:23.229 --> 14:28.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
statute, which came in after the
Bobby Kennedy
appointment, is quite clear
about not allowing

14:28.735 --> 14:32.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
someone to appoint relatives to
positions
in the government.

14:32.638 --> 14:38.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don'’t think the fact that
it's not
a paid position would -- would
affect that.

14:38.111 --> 14:42.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that that he could
work something
out with Congress, maybe to --
if he wants

14:42.248 --> 14:46.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to maybe disclose his tax
returns and do some
of the other things that we care
about, I

14:46.552 --> 14:49.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would not have an objection to
Jared Kushner.

14:49.856 --> 14:53.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean -- or other family
members being given
a position.

14:53.292 --> 14:56.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're very talented people,
and in some
ways I think more talented than
some of the

14:56.195 --> 14:57.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people he'’s brought in.

14:57.196 --> 14:58.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But you have to work it out with
Congress.

14:58.965 --> 15:01.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The statute is quite clear on
nepotism.

15:01.501 --> 15:06.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And yet, the first
lady, Marilyn
Geewax, you know, typically does
play some

15:06.973 --> 15:07.940 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
role.

15:07.974 --> 15:09.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The modern first lady takes on a
clause.

15:09.375 --> 15:11.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, it was health
reform.

15:11.310 --> 15:14.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEEWAX: But think about the
roles they took
on.

15:14.580 --> 15:19.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, in Mrs. Clinton's case,
she was pushing
a health care agenda.

15:19.685 --> 15:24.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With Mrs. Obama, it was about
children and
obesity and nutrition.

15:24.157 --> 15:29.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what if, you know, if Mrs.
Obama had come
out with a new line of jewelry
and she started

15:29.929 --> 15:37.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
selling Obama-wear, and was
holding up her
new bracelets, that would have
seemed peculiar.

15:37.069 --> 15:42.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I think people would
have been very
shocked to see, you know, a
little Obama fragrance

15:42.308 --> 15:43.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or -- you know --

15:43.309 --> 15:44.777 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

15:44.811 --> 15:46.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: But we'’re not -- we
don'’t know
that it's going to happen.

15:46.078 --> 15:47.413 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
So --

15:47.446 --> 15:49.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEEWAX: But, I mean, it didn't
happen while
they were in office.

15:49.482 --> 15:55.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we do know the Trumps plan
to continue
-- it appears -- to sell all
sorts of products.

15:55.454 --> 15:56.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: We will see.

15:56.722 --> 16:00.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Marilyn Geewax, Richard Painter,
thank you
both.

16:00.426 --> 16:09.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

for Aleppo seems
to now be over.

16:17.410 --> 16:21.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Evacuations of civilians and
fighters from
the rebel-held east began today,
as the pitched

16:22.014 --> 16:23.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
four-year battle ends.

16:23.850 --> 16:26.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dan Rivers of Independent

is there.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

16:27.987 --> 16:31.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAN RIVERS, INDEPENDENT
TELEVISION NEWS: After
so many false dawns, the siege
of Aleppo is

16:31.591 --> 16:33.492 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
over.

16:33.526 --> 16:38.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But even this morning, President
Assad's artillery
couldn't resist one last go at
killing those

16:38.731 --> 16:42.468 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
still trapped.

16:42.501 --> 16:48.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Inside the rebel enclave, those
he targeted
for four and a half years
prepared to leave.

16:48.074 --> 16:53.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these pictures show that
while fighters
were among them, most appeared
to be civilians.

16:53.346 --> 17:00.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They included women, children,
the injured
and the vulnerable, all caught
up in the catastrophe

17:00.152 --> 17:02.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of this conflict.

17:03.022 --> 17:08.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The scale of the destruction
they were leaving
was laid bare, as was the enmity
with which

17:08.227 --> 17:11.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they regard those who've
besieged them.

17:11.163 --> 17:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED KID (translated):
It's true we're
leaving Aleppo.

17:13.799 --> 17:18.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But once we grow up, we're going
to come back
and liberate Aleppo, god willing
we're going

17:18.204 --> 17:22.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to come back and liberate
Aleppo, me and all
of my brothers.

17:22.074 --> 17:23.309 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
All of us.

17:23.342 --> 17:26.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RIVERS: Outside, the regime
buses were lined
up and ready.

17:26.479 --> 17:32.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A solitary vehicle carrying a
Red Crescent
flag emerged from rebel lines.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.185 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Terms agreed.

17:33.219 --> 17:36.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was time to end the
suffering.

17:36.088 --> 17:42.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The buses threaded their way
through the debris
to start the evacuation.

17:42.395 --> 17:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The call to prayer cut through
the silence
as a tense city held its breath
and hoped

17:47.433 --> 17:49.402 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for peace.

17:49.435 --> 17:52.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Then, the first sign.

17:52.438 --> 17:59.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Flashing lights, a convoy of
ambulances and
buses emerging onto Aleppo'’s
ring road.

17:59.445 --> 18:04.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The occupants of the buses came
almost face
to face with the men who'’d
sought to kill

18:04.383 --> 18:05.351 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

18:05.384 --> 18:07.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But they were allowed to leave
unhindered.

18:07.219 --> 18:14.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it didn't take long for
President Assad's
supporters to start their
celebrations.

18:14.393 --> 18:15.594 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

18:15.628 --> 18:22.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I feel very
happy.

18:22.201 --> 18:27.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I feel that this victory will
continue to
all Syria.

18:27.373 --> 18:32.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RIVERS: But after so much
bloodshed, this
shouldn't have been a day of
celebration.

SREENIVASAN: Dan Rivers joins me
from Aleppo.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can imagine, it'’s not the
easy satellite
connection.

18:38.017 --> 18:40.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, please excuse the
interference on the
line.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dan, you were there the last
month.

18:42.154 --> 18:46.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tell me the main differences
between then
and now, beyond the obvious
victory by the

18:46.125 --> 18:49.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Assad forces, especially among
members supportive
of the regime.

18:49.862 --> 18:56.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RIVERS: When we were here a
month ago, this
war was waging outside the
window I'’m standing

18:56.635 --> 18:58.404 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in front of.

18:58.437 --> 19:04.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in the intervening time,
they have lost,
day after day, chunks, districts
have fallen

19:04.910 --> 19:10.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
week after week, until they have
just been
reduced to about one square
mile.

19:10.950 --> 19:14.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the devastation across the
city is absolutely
jaw-dropping.

19:14.887 --> 19:21.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To see today, finally, the
battle coming to
an end, seeing a piece of
history and a watershed

19:21.927 --> 19:23.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in this conflict.

19:23.796 --> 19:28.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We didn't manage to speak
personally to anyone
who came out because we were
prevented from

19:28.200 --> 19:29.168 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
doing so.

19:29.201 --> 19:31.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We've spoken to people in
refugee camps.

19:31.804 --> 19:36.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many of them were terrified
coming over into
government-controlled Aleppo.

19:36.409 --> 19:40.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: We've seen pictures
of the destruction
over the last few weeks.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's left of the city?

19:42.248 --> 19:45.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What have Assad and his allies
actually won?

19:45.584 --> 19:49.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RIVERS: They've won a shell of
eye city in
the east.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The destruction is epic.

19:51.290 --> 19:53.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the only word I can use
to describe
it.

19:53.359 --> 20:00.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were taken to the old city
the other day,
and just the loss of heritage,
of this, a

20:00.533 --> 20:03.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
city that claims to be one of
the oldest in
the world.

20:03.636 --> 20:08.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can only liken it, I guess, to
something
you would see in maybe the
Second World War.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People have talked about it
being Syria's
Stalingrad.

Coming up on the "NewsHour",
what happens
when bookies bet on the wrong
presidential

20:33.966 --> 20:40.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidate; Facebook's plan to

combat global

20:40.706 --> 20:42.408 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
poverty.

20:42.441 --> 20:45.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: But first, Donald
Trump took
to Twitter this morning to
attack the Obama

20:45.411 --> 20:49.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
administration's handling of
Russia's alleged
hacking during the election.

20:49.215 --> 20:54.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wrote, quote, "If Russia, or
some other
entity, was hacking, why did the
White House

20:54.186 --> 20:56.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wait so long to act?

20:56.222 --> 20:59.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why did they only complain after
Hillary lost?"

20:59.525 --> 21:03.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, the U.S. intelligence
community said
in early October that it was
confident Russia

21:03.195 --> 21:05.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
directed the hacks of the DNC.

21:05.064 --> 21:10.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Senate Minority Leader
Harry Reid said
Russian President Vladimir Putin
was personally

21:10.202 --> 21:14.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
involved in efforts to disrupt
the election
and help Donald Trump win.

21:14.907 --> 21:17.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We look at Putin's role now with
Angela Stent.

21:17.843 --> 21:20.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She served in the State
Department during
the Clinton administration.

21:20.212 --> 21:23.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She's now a professor at
Georgetown University.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does it make sense that Vladimir
Putin would
have a role?

21:25.818 --> 21:27.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ANGELA STENT, GEORGETOWN
UNIVERSITY: I think
we have to go back to 2011.

21:27.987 --> 21:33.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the fall of 2011, there were
mass demonstrations
in Moscow, protesting falsified
elections

21:33.726 --> 21:37.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and protesting Vladimir Putin's
announcement
that he was coming back to the
Kremlin.

21:37.897 --> 21:42.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He directly accused Hillary
Clinton at that
point of paying the
demonstrators to go on

21:42.434 --> 21:44.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the streets in Moscow.

21:44.470 --> 21:48.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he, apparently, and his
colleague in addition
the Kremlin, believe there was
U.S. interference

21:48.207 --> 21:54.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 2011 in the election, and,
therefore, it's
fair game to interfere in the
U.S. election

21:54.813 --> 21:56.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because that's, you know, what
can big countries
do.

21:57.016 --> 22:00.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Can something like
this -- it's
a big government, like all
governments are

22:00.085 --> 22:02.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- can something like this
happen without
his knowledge or approval?

22:02.821 --> 22:06.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STENT: I think he must have
known on some
level that this was happening.

22:06.192 --> 22:10.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, hackers couldn't just
have done this
freelance without at least
having a sense

22:10.296 --> 22:12.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that this was permitted.

22:12.331 --> 22:15.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether he personally directed
it, I think
that's much more difficult to
say.

22:15.701 --> 22:16.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I haven't seen the evidence.

22:16.902 --> 22:18.137 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
None of us have.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We'’ve had contradictory
statements from
our own officials.

22:20.639 --> 22:23.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think we'd have to know
more about the
personal direction.

22:23.976 --> 22:27.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, clearly, there was an
environment that
encouraged this to happen.

22:27.546 --> 22:30.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Well, what about
the assessment
by the intelligence community
that this was

22:30.216 --> 22:32.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an effort to help Trump win?

22:32.051 --> 22:36.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Was it, as you said, perhaps
revenge against
Hillary Clinton, or was it that
other element,

22:36.622 --> 22:38.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
too, to actually help Donald
Trump?

22:38.390 --> 22:42.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STENT: Well, clearly on the
campaign trail,
Donald Trump consistently
praised Vladimir

22:42.828 --> 22:43.929 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Putin.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was only world leader that he
consistently
praised.

22:45.864 --> 22:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said we need to do a deal
with Russia.

22:47.666 --> 22:50.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We shouldn'’t have such bad
relations with
Russia.

22:50.302 --> 22:55.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whereas Hillary Clinton took a
pretty tough
line, as she had since leaving
secretary of

22:55.507 --> 22:57.076 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
state.

22:57.109 --> 23:00.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think it's credible to
believe the Russians
wanted Donald Trump to win.

23:00.512 --> 23:05.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'’m not sure they expected him
to win, but
I think they saw an opportunity
there.

23:05.951 --> 23:11.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, really, to help muddy the
waters here
and to have Americans
questioning what was

23:11.790 --> 23:12.958 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
really going on.

23:12.992 --> 23:15.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: What could the U.S.
do in response?

23:15.261 --> 23:17.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STENT: It's very difficult to
respond in kind.

23:17.429 --> 23:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, we may be retaliating in
ways that
we don'’t know.

23:21.066 --> 23:24.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It would be very hard to
prosecute the hackers
themselves.

23:24.436 --> 23:29.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to do what they did, which
is to then
hack into people's e-mails, and
then release

23:29.341 --> 23:32.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
information that might help
another candidate
in an election.

23:32.511 --> 23:37.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, Vladimir Putin is going
to run for
president in 2018, but it's not
going to be

23:37.283 --> 23:38.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a competitive election.

23:38.417 --> 23:41.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we can't -- we couldn't
respond in kind
anyway.

23:41.053 --> 23:46.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, I think, you know, that
-- there's
the possibility of sanctions
that's talked

23:46.258 --> 23:47.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about in the Congress.

23:47.293 --> 23:49.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'’m not sure that that would do
any good.

23:49.161 --> 23:52.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't think a Trump
administration would
want those sanctions.

23:52.531 --> 23:57.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I actually think one of the
things that
we should do, once the next
administration

23:57.069 --> 24:01.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is in office, is to try and work
out with
the Russians, as we have with
the Chinese,

24:01.373 --> 24:07.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at least some kind of a cyber
agreement, some
rules of the game, which --
which we don't

24:07.313 --> 24:09.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have now with the Russians.

24:09.148 --> 24:11.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'’m not saying this would
prevent this from
happening again, but I think we
need to at

24:12.017 --> 24:14.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
least try and work on out rules
of the game
with them.

24:14.687 --> 24:17.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: I was going to say,
do these
kind of agreements hold?

24:17.256 --> 24:20.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STENT: Well, with the Chinese,
there are different
views on this.

24:20.526 --> 24:23.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, some aspect of it,
apparently, have
worked.

24:24.029 --> 24:25.564 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Others haven't.

24:25.597 --> 24:28.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's really the best one can do
because we're
in a very shadowy world there.

24:28.834 --> 24:34.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it's very hard to know
exactly who
did the hacking and then, you
know, who directed

24:34.039 --> 24:35.007 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

24:35.040 --> 24:36.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As I said, it's very difficult
to prosecute.

24:36.909 --> 24:40.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SREENIVASAN: Before the
administration leaves
-- I mean, that's a very small
window of time.

24:40.813 --> 24:44.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If President Obama, with his
existing authority,
wanted to launch any sort of
counter-offensive.

24:44.983 --> 24:50.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, what's that conversation
like on January
20 -- "By the way, here's this
operation I'’ve

24:50.356 --> 24:52.124 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
begun, here are the keys"?

24:52.157 --> 24:55.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STENT: I mean, that's possible,
but, again,
we have an incoming
administration that has

24:55.361 --> 25:00.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vowed to improve relations with
Russia, and
it's very -- one wonders whether
they would

25:00.532 --> 25:02.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
really continue with it.

25:02.334 --> 25:06.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, we have a president-elect
who questioned
what the intelligence -- our
intelligence

25:06.472 --> 25:08.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
services have said about this.

25:08.140 --> 25:11.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think it would be very
difficult to
do it even if we started
something now.

25:11.777 --> 25:16.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, obviously, that's
what the Russians
have been figuring would happen,
too.

25:16.148 --> 25:17.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SREENIVASAN: All right.

25:17.149 --> 25:26.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Angela Stent, thanks so much.

of Donald Trump

25:35.534 --> 25:36.702 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as president.

25:36.735 --> 25:39.538 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
His victory was a shock to many.

25:39.571 --> 25:44.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pollsters are asking if they
need to rethink
their methods for surveying the

25:44.109 --> 25:48.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

them as well.

The race is over.

26:01.460 --> 26:04.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The long shot won.

26:04.630 --> 26:10.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet pundits, pollsters and
punters in
the prediction markets had all
been so sure.

26:10.669 --> 26:14.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

26:27.686 --> 26:30.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Dr. Wang, you
tweeted recently
that you were so sure of the

26:39.465 --> 26:42.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

Here it goes.

26:45.337 --> 26:49.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: On the prediction
markets, they actually
bet money on the outcome.

26:49.842 --> 26:56.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the largest, Paddy Power,
an Irish
bookie, paid out a million
dollars to people

26:56.081 --> 27:00.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who bet on Clinton 20 days
before the election.

PADDY PWER, ONLINE BOOKMAKER:

women's anatomy,

27:11.363 --> 27:12.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or boasting about that.

27:12.831 --> 27:15.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, and then we just thought
that has to
be it.

27:15.767 --> 27:18.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We took an absolute conkers on
it to be fair.

27:18.203 --> 27:20.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were left with our pants
around our ankles
at the end of it.

27:20.739 --> 27:24.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: An absolute conkers,
pants around
the ankles.

27:25.010 --> 27:28.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On the other hand: a jackpot of
PR.

27:28.647 --> 27:32.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the U.S., we have two betting
markets,
only legal because they provide
results for

27:32.885 --> 27:37.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
academic research and limit bets
to modest
amounts.

the office party
of one of them, Predictit in
Washington, D.C.,

27:43.161 --> 27:47.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the consensus among traders:
Clinton at 80
percent.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everything's

RAY FAIR, YALE UNIVERSITY: This
is the website
that I put all the results on.

28:01.980 --> 28:08.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: Economist Ray Fair first
forecast
the Democrats would lose in
November of 2014!

28:08.620 --> 28:14.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FAIR: The prediction I made two
years ago
was that the Republicans had a
huge head start

28:14.259 --> 28:16.562 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and were favored by quite a bit.

28:16.595 --> 28:19.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: His model is based on
past history,
period.

28:19.831 --> 28:27.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FAIR: So, there's no polls,
there's no surveys,
this is all just fundamental
economic events

28:27.239 --> 28:29.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that you're talking about.

28:29.274 --> 28:33.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: Fundamental events, and
to an economist,
there's nothing more fundamental
than the

28:33.812 --> 28:35.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rate of economic growth.

28:35.514 --> 28:39.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FAIR: A good economy helps the
incumbent party,
a bad economy doesn't.

28:39.685 --> 28:45.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What the opposition party should
do if the
economy is poor is to keep
hammering the economy.

28:45.223 --> 28:51.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: Fair's model considers
just a few
factors: if an incumbent is up
for re- election,

28:51.263 --> 28:54.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
voters tend to give the
president a second
term.

28:54.433 --> 28:57.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After eight years, voters tend
to be itching
for a change.

28:57.936 --> 29:03.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But most important: the state of
the economy
in the four years before an
election.

29:03.375 --> 29:09.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FAIR: In the 15 quarters of the
second Obama
administration, only two
quarters had strong

29:09.114 --> 29:12.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
growth, growth bigger than 4
percent at an
annual rate.

29:12.818 --> 29:17.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's very low historically and
the growth
rate of this year, which counts
a lot for

29:17.956 --> 29:23.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the equation, was only 1.7
percent at an annual
rate in the first three quarters
of this year.

29:23.695 --> 29:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: By the end, Fair's model
predicted
that the Democrat would get only
44 percent

29:28.734 --> 29:30.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the two-party vote.

29:30.936 --> 29:35.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since Clinton beat Trump by 2
percent, and
wound up with 51 percent of the
two-party

29:35.440 --> 29:40.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
total, he thinks Clinton
actually did much
better than she should have,
given the economy,

29:40.946 --> 29:42.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and his model did much worse.

29:43.015 --> 29:48.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FAIR: Had the Republicans
nominated some mainstream
person, they probably, most
people would think,

29:48.520 --> 29:50.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they probably would have done
much better
than they did.

29:50.822 --> 29:54.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: But Fair did get the
winner right,
unlike so many of the pros.

29:54.826 --> 29:58.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why did the prediction markets
do so badly?

29:58.096 --> 30:02.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FAIR: I think they overestimated
the polls
and underestimated the
fundamentals about

30:02.968 --> 30:04.670 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the economy.

30:04.703 --> 30:08.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: So pretty humbling for
those of us
who follow the prediction
markets, no?

30:08.840 --> 30:14.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUSTIN WOLFERS, ECONOMIST: It
was a humbling
for a lot of us in a lot of
different ways,

30:14.279 --> 30:15.947 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
yes.

30:15.981 --> 30:19.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: Economist Justin Wolfers
studies the
prediction markets, and swears
by them.

30:19.785 --> 30:25.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Neither the polls nor the
markets were really
so far off, he told me by Skype
from Michigan.

30:25.190 --> 30:30.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOLFERS: Remember the Chicago
Cubs were two
games behind in the World Series
and betting

30:30.862 --> 30:33.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
markets said that there was only
a 30 percent
to win the World Series.

30:33.999 --> 30:41.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As history now records it, they
went on and
won the World Series.

30:41.873 --> 30:44.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, betting markets pretty
much said the
same thing about Donald Trump.

30:44.910 --> 30:50.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we were surprised, but we
should have
been no more surprised than we
were when the

30:50.348 --> 30:52.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Cubs won the World Series.

30:52.117 --> 30:57.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: "The New York Times"
Upshot was another
prediction site on which many
relied.

30:57.556 --> 31:08.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It expressed Clinton's odds of
losing in terms
of an NFL kicker missing an easy
field goal.

31:08.800 --> 31:13.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I first began to think that
Donald Trump
had a real chance was when "The
New York Times"

31:13.638 --> 31:20.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Upshot made that field goal
analogy, and my
favorite kicker missed field
goals from a

31:20.846 --> 31:26.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shorter distance than the odds
were of Donald
Trump winning.

31:26.118 --> 31:29.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOLFERS: One of the things that
we learn here,
and this is a lesson for both
the media and

31:29.988 --> 31:34.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for social scientists, is how
difficult it
is to communicate clearly about
probabilities.

31:34.526 --> 31:39.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: David Rothschild tends
the website
PredictWise, which tracks the
prediction markets

31:39.965 --> 31:42.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and makes forecasts of its own,
as on election
night.

31:42.167 --> 31:46.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ROTHSCHILD, PREDICTWISE
FOUNDER: Right
now, we have the presidency at
about 89 percent

31:47.005 --> 31:48.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for Hillary Clinton.

31:48.807 --> 31:55.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: So, every day, I went to
your site
and I was certain that Donald
Trump was going

31:55.881 --> 32:02.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to lose and I told everybody who
asked me,
you misled me.

32:02.521 --> 32:10.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROTHSCHILD: Look, the website
PredictWise
had a bunch of different data up
there, and

32:10.262 --> 32:19.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was important to take the
best available
historical data-based approach
and that really

32:19.538 --> 32:25.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the prediction market data
and that's what
we led with the top line numbers
for, because

32:25.277 --> 32:27.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that is what we know has worked
historically.

32:27.779 --> 32:32.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: But Rothschild also had
a model based
on the economic fundamentals.

32:32.450 --> 32:38.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROTHSCHILD: It showed the
Republican candidate
getting 282 electoral votes for
a narrow Electoral

32:38.290 --> 32:40.025 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
College victory.

32:40.058 --> 32:45.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'’m not going to sit here and
tell you I
was right because I like
everyone else who

32:45.330 --> 32:49.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looked at the idiosyncratic
information coming
out from the election and said
look, "This

32:49.634 --> 32:52.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
is a year in which the
fundamentals were going
to be off."

32:52.537 --> 32:55.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FAIR: And that's why I didn't
want to talk
to people like you.

32:55.307 --> 32:57.742 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLMAN: One last time, Professor
Fair:

32:57.776 --> 33:02.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FAIR: Because it was kind of
embarrassing
to come in and say Trump looks
like he's going

33:02.647 --> 33:06.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to win and this and that when I
-- that's
what the equation said.

33:06.618 --> 33:07.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLMAN: Were you surprised by
the outcome?

33:07.886 --> 33:09.187 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
FAIR: Yes.

33:09.221 --> 33:10.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: So you didn't have the
courage of
your own conviction.

33:10.789 --> 33:13.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FAIR: I didn't have the courage
of the equation's
prediction, OK?

33:13.792 --> 33:19.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: And so, even professor
fair didn't
heed the simple punch line of
his model, of

33:19.364 --> 33:22.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this story, and perhaps of this
election.

33:22.801 --> 33:26.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
FAIR: "It's the economy,
stupid," would be
the very simple answer to that.

33:26.938 --> 33:32.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: Oh by the way, the
prediction markets
like Paddy Power are now giving
odds on Donald

33:32.177 --> 33:33.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump's re-election.

33:33.945 --> 33:35.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PADDY POWER, PADDY POWER OWNER:
Four to one
odds to be returned next time so
that means

33:35.780 --> 33:40.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's got like a 20 percent
chance of retaining
the presidency next time around.

33:40.252 --> 33:44.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When Obama was elected for the
first time,
it would have been more like a
50 percent

33:45.023 --> 33:48.360 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
chance of him getting reelected.

33:48.393 --> 33:51.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we're still underestimating
the man.

33:51.196 --> 33:53.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: Unless, I suppose, the
economy tanks
in the interim.

33:53.598 --> 33:58.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In New York, for the "PBS
NewsHour", this
is economics correspondent Paul
Solman, who

33:58.270 --> 34:04.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lost $200 to the producer of
this story, it
went to charity, and a bottle of
very good

34:04.276 --> 34:09.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sherry I still owe someone by
following the
prediction markets.

34:09.948 --> 34:13.084 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(END VIDEOTAPE)

34:13.118 --> 34:23.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN, PBS NEWSHOUR
ANCHOR: It
was a stunning finding, even in
a digital

34:23.161 --> 34:26.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
age where stories of all kind go
viral.

34:26.364 --> 34:31.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During the last three months of
the presidential
campaign, fake or false news
headlines actually

34:31.069 --> 34:34.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
generated more engagement on
Facebook than
true ones.

34:34.773 --> 34:38.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Facebook and other social media
platforms
were criticized for not doing
enough to flag

34:38.843 --> 34:40.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or dispute these posts.

34:40.779 --> 34:45.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Facebook launched several
new tools
to flag and dispute what it
calls the "worst

34:45.850 --> 34:48.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the worst" when it comes to
clear lies.

34:48.086 --> 34:52.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those tools are essentially
embedded in your
individual feed.

34:52.090 --> 34:55.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here's a bit of a video the
company posted
about how it will work.

34:55.660 --> 34:57.395 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

34:57.429 --> 34:59.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FACEBOOK VIDEO NARRATOR: You may
see an alert
before you share some links that
have been

34:59.297 --> 35:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
disputed by third-party fact
checkers.

35:02.133 --> 35:05.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can then cancel or continue
with the post.

35:05.570 --> 35:10.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you suspect a news story is
fake, you can
report it.

35:11.009 --> 35:15.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It just takes a few taps.

35:15.480 --> 35:19.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Your report helps us track and
prevent fake
news from spreading.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

35:20.986 --> 35:25.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Let's learn more
about this effort
to detect and slow the spread of
fake news,

35:25.557 --> 35:27.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
part of our occasional series on
the subject.

35:27.926 --> 35:32.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Will Oremus has been writing
about this extensively
for "Slate" and working on that
site's own

35:32.530 --> 35:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
new tool for identifying false
stories.

35:34.899 --> 35:37.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, Will, let's talk a little
bit about
what Facebook announce today.

35:37.535 --> 35:39.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How is it going to work?

35:39.204 --> 35:42.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILL OREMUS, SLATE: So,
Facebook's approach
to fake news has several
components.

35:42.507 --> 35:45.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One thing it's going to try to
do is make
it easier for users to report it
when they

35:45.443 --> 35:47.645 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
see fake news in their feeds.

35:47.679 --> 35:51.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The next thing they're going to
do is they're
going to take that information
about stories

35:51.449 --> 35:55.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are being reported as fake,
and they're
going to use some software, run
some algorithms

35:55.954 --> 36:00.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and create a dashboard of
stories that might
be fake and give access to that
dashboard

36:00.859 --> 36:03.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to third-party checking
organizations.

36:03.294 --> 36:06.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, these are like Snopes or
PolitiFact, Factcheck.org.

36:06.698 --> 36:11.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those fact checkers are going to
have their
human editors evaluate some of
the most viral

36:11.770 --> 36:15.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the stories that have been
flagged as fake,
and if they determine it is in
fact a fake

36:15.673 --> 36:18.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
news story, Facebook is going to
treat it
differently.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's going to show it to fewer
people in its
feeds.

36:20.612 --> 36:24.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's going to make it go less
viral and it'’s
also going to give people a
warning before

36:24.883 --> 36:28.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they try to share that story,
saying this
story has been disputed.

36:28.787 --> 36:29.788 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It will still let you share it.

36:29.821 --> 36:32.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It'’s not censoring or filtering
out anything.

36:32.357 --> 36:36.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it is downgrading it in the
ranking algorithm
and it is letting people know
that this has

36:36.494 --> 36:37.729 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been disputed.

36:37.762 --> 36:39.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: So, Facebook is not
the arbiter
of the truth.

36:39.531 --> 36:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are third parties checking
this for
them, right?

36:41.800 --> 36:45.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OREMUS: Yes, and Facebook has
been incredibly
reluctant to become the arbiter
of what's

36:45.503 --> 36:47.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
true for good reason.

36:47.305 --> 36:51.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Facebook, the value of its
business, depends
on appealing to people on both
sides, all

36:51.676 --> 36:52.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
across the political spectrum.

36:53.011 --> 36:54.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it doesn't want to be a
media company.

36:54.779 --> 36:56.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It has said this many times.

36:56.114 --> 36:58.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What it is doing here is shrewd,
I think.

36:58.049 --> 37:03.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It is delegating the
responsibility to respected,
non-profit, third-party
organizations whose

37:03.354 --> 37:05.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whole job is to figure out
what's true and
what's not.

37:05.490 --> 37:07.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: You have been
covering this space
for a while.

37:07.392 --> 37:12.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You want to draw a distinction
between what'’s
fake news and what are just
outright lies

37:12.764 --> 37:13.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and conspiracies.

37:13.765 --> 37:14.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There is a distinction.

37:14.999 --> 37:18.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OREMUS: Yes, the term "fake
news" is relatively
news.

37:18.103 --> 37:21.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A few years ago if somebody
said, "fake news,"
you wouldn't know necessarily
what they are

37:21.106 --> 37:24.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talking about, maybe they were
talking about
a satire site like "The Onion
"or "The Daily

37:24.809 --> 37:26.578 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Show."

37:26.611 --> 37:31.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It came in to currency in recent
months because
of the rise of a particular type
of thing,

37:31.916 --> 37:34.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which is a story that'’s
basically made up.

37:34.752 --> 37:41.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was very popular during the
election season
for people to-- for hoaxsters to
make up stories

37:41.392 --> 37:43.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that played to people's
political biases.

37:43.528 --> 37:47.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, something like, you know,
Hillary Clinton
is about to be arrested by the
New York Police

37:47.866 --> 37:49.601 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Department for email crimes.

37:49.634 --> 37:50.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SREENIVASAN: Yes.

37:50.635 --> 37:51.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OREMUS: They would just make
that up.

37:51.636 --> 37:52.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They would publish it.

37:52.637 --> 37:54.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it would get shared widely
on Facebook.

37:54.272 --> 37:57.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Since then, the term has become
applied -- it
has become a political football.

37:57.208 --> 38:00.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And people call -- you hear
people on the
right calling the "New York
Times" fake news,

38:00.845 --> 38:03.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people on the left saying
Breitbart is fake
news.

38:03.348 --> 38:07.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But originally, it was actual
hoaxes that
were made up out of whole cloth.

38:07.352 --> 38:10.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Now, people have
been trying
to fix the fake news problem.

38:10.555 --> 38:14.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a recent hack-a-thon,
and some Princeton
students came up with what they
thought was

38:14.592 --> 38:15.727 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a fix.

38:15.760 --> 38:17.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Your folks at "Slate" had
actually worked
on a tool.

38:17.295 --> 38:21.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You guys just launched this, not
coincidentally
on Monday.

38:21.099 --> 38:22.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's take a look at how this
works.

38:22.800 --> 38:25.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We'’re going to put this up on
the screen
here.

38:25.103 --> 38:29.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if I come across a fake news
story in
my feed, and there's this big
red banner saying,

38:29.941 --> 38:31.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"This news story is fake.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's how we know.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Share the proof."

38:33.144 --> 38:34.112 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
How do you know?

38:34.145 --> 38:35.113 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Identify by this as fake.

38:35.146 --> 38:36.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is the tool.

38:36.147 --> 38:37.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OREMUS: Yes, that'’s right.

38:37.949 --> 38:40.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what we wanted to do was not
just flag
stories as fake when they appear
in your Facebook

38:40.251 --> 38:42.020 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
feed.

38:42.053 --> 38:44.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We actually wanted to give users
the power
to do something about it,
because -- I mean,

38:44.389 --> 38:46.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's so frustrating, right?

38:46.624 --> 38:51.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You try to be a good consumer of
the media,
you try to evaluate what's true
and what's

38:51.429 --> 38:54.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
credible, but then you see
friends and relatives
sharing this stuff.

38:54.265 --> 38:59.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what we do is we actually
provide a link
to a reputable debunking of that
particular

38:59.537 --> 39:01.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
story that will appear
automatically.

39:01.773 --> 39:05.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we prompt you to share
that link
with the person who posted the
fake news so

39:05.677 --> 39:09.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they and all of their
followers can see
that that story is fake or they
can go to

39:09.881 --> 39:11.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the debunking site and judge of
the evidence
for themselves.

39:11.683 --> 39:15.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Now, there's a tool
you can actually
add to your browser.

39:15.553 --> 39:19.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's kind of an extension, a
Chrome extension
and a button that works there.

39:19.457 --> 39:21.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We can look at other examples of
stories as
well.

39:21.993 --> 39:23.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Who is the arbiter of truth in
your system?

39:23.962 --> 39:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Who decided that this story was
false, even
though it looks just like an ABC
news site?

39:28.499 --> 39:31.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OREMUS: Yes, I mean, that's a
good question,
and this is really the trickiest
question

39:31.536 --> 39:32.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on this whole thing.

39:32.604 --> 39:34.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is going to be an issue for
Facebook,
too.

39:34.539 --> 39:38.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, if one of these fact
check organizations
says this story has some parts
that are true,

39:38.710 --> 39:40.178 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
some parts that are false.

39:40.211 --> 39:42.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that a fake news story?

39:42.046 --> 39:45.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what we've done and in
fact it seems
what Facebook has done as well
is to try to

39:45.216 --> 39:47.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
set a really high bar for what
counts as fake.

39:47.518 --> 39:48.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not just a story that might
be misleading.

39:49.020 --> 39:50.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SREENIVASAN: Yes.

39:50.121 --> 39:51.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OREMUS: Or has a couple of
factual errors
in it.

39:52.023 --> 39:57.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a story intentionally
designed to mislead
people and it's just -- you
know, it'’s a

39:57.095 --> 39:58.730 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
hoax, basically.

39:58.763 --> 40:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we have human editors who are
going to
be reviewing the posts that are
flagged by

40:01.866 --> 40:06.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our users as potentially fake
and they're
going to be looking for, again,
a reputable

40:06.237 --> 40:09.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
third-party site that has used
evidence to
debunk that.

40:09.407 --> 40:12.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're not going to be, you know,
doing the
debunking ourselves.

40:12.143 --> 40:15.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Can technology
solve this problem?

40:15.747 --> 40:21.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a recent Pew study
saying 14 percent
of people out there shared a
fake news story,

40:21.753 --> 40:23.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
even after they knew it was
fake.

40:23.688 --> 40:24.656 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
OREMUS: Yes.

40:24.689 --> 40:26.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No, technology can't solve the
whole problem.

40:26.591 --> 40:29.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think technology can be a part
of the solution.

40:29.594 --> 40:32.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's because it's not just
a technological
problem or just a human problem.

40:32.964 --> 40:37.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there are human issues at
work here in
why fake news is shared.

40:37.435 --> 40:38.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's confirmation bias.

40:38.636 --> 40:40.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's the desire for something
to be true.

40:40.905 --> 40:42.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, you want something to be
true.

40:42.140 --> 40:43.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SREENIVASAN: Yes.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OREMUS: What's your incentive to
go and check
it out.

40:45.109 --> 40:48.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But there is also a
technological component,
which is that Facebook in
particular has had

40:48.479 --> 40:53.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this leveling effect on the
media where a
story from abcnews.com, which is
a big, reputable

40:53.851 --> 40:59.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
news site, looks just the same
in your Facebook
feed as a story from
abcnews.com.co, which

40:59.891 --> 41:02.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is a hoax site designed to trick
people.

41:02.727 --> 41:06.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, Facebook has created the
conditions
for this fake news to thrive.

41:06.597 --> 41:11.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why I think, you
know, technology,
whether it's Facebook or a tool
like ours,

41:11.035 --> 41:12.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
technology can be part of the
solution.

41:12.670 --> 41:14.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it has to be human, too.

41:14.405 --> 41:18.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SREENIVASAN: That and a
wonderfully informed
citizenry and who are media
literate.

41:18.209 --> 41:22.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Will Oremus from "Slate" --
thanks so much.

41:22.814 --> 41:26.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OREMUS: Thanks for having me.

JUDY WOODRUFF, PBS NEWSHOUR
ANCHOR: With recreational
marijuana now legal in eight
states, a serious

41:36.527 --> 41:40.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health and safety question about
the potency
of the psychoactive drug in
cannabis, known

41:40.331 --> 41:42.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as THC, are emerging.

41:42.467 --> 41:48.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Colorado, some marijuana
products contain
90 percent pure THC, with little
research

41:48.840 --> 41:52.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
documenting the physical and
mental effects
on consumers.

41:52.710 --> 41:57.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week, the state's health
department announced
more than $2 million in grants
to study the

impacts on driving and cognitive
functioning.

42:01.285 --> 42:06.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As John Ferrugia of Rocky
Mountain PBS in
Denver reports, there are
concerns that the

42:06.290 --> 42:08.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
effects on some users could be
deadly.

something
new.

42:11.362 --> 42:15.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN FERRUGIA, ROCKY MOUNTAIN
PBS: In December
2015, Marc Bullard felt on top
of the world.

42:15.500 --> 42:20.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had landed a good job in
Denver after graduating
magna cum laude from Southern
Methodist University.

42:20.772 --> 42:22.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARC BULLARD: It'’s been a good
year.

42:22.673 --> 42:25.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FERRUGIA: He made video diaries
to keep his
family and friends updated on
his life, looking

42:25.843 --> 42:26.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
forward to the New Year.

42:27.011 --> 42:28.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARC BULLARD: It'’s time to start
planning
projects.

42:28.746 --> 42:34.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FERRUGIA: But just four months
later, in April
2016, Marc Bullard took his own
life.

42:34.352 --> 42:38.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His written diary shows severe
depression
seems to have taken a quick hold
on him.

MIKE BULLARD, MARC BULLARD'’S
FATHER: You
know, December, he's fine, he
comes home for

42:40.525 --> 42:42.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Christmas holiday.

42:42.293 --> 42:44.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FERRUGIA: And Mike and Ginny
Bullard (ph)
say he spent time with family
and friends

42:44.962 --> 42:46.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and showed no sign of being
down.

42:46.764 --> 42:53.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE BULLARD: And what we saw in
the in the
diary later was by January the
16th, I guess,

42:53.237 --> 42:55.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he's talking about suicide.

42:55.039 --> 42:59.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FERRUGIA: It was only after his
death that
his parents began reading his
written diaries.

42:59.110 --> 43:00.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When did you first see the first
entry about
dabbing?

43:00.678 --> 43:04.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE BULLARD: That was in the
March the 5th.

43:04.882 --> 43:09.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's where he talks about
you know,
I think I'’ve been dabbing too
much.

43:09.554 --> 43:13.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FERRUGIA: Dabbing, Mike and
Ginny had never
heard of it.

43:13.124 --> 43:18.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the uninitiated, dabbing is
a way to smoke
a potent form of highly
concentrated THC,

43:18.830 --> 43:21.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the active ingredient in
marijuana.

43:21.132 --> 43:24.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's known as wax, shatter, and
honey.

43:24.836 --> 43:26.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It gives the rush of an instant
high.

43:26.838 --> 43:32.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And in Colorado, where
recreational marijuana
is legal, there are no limits on
THC concentration

43:32.243 --> 43:33.945 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
levels in a dab.

43:33.978 --> 43:37.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dabbing was becoming part of the
subculture
looking for an ever increasing
THC high.

43:37.949 --> 43:41.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GINNY BULLARD, MARC BULLARD'’S
MOTHER: Yes,
we heard that marijuana was
legal but we're

43:41.252 --> 43:44.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thinking about people smoking
cigarettes.

43:45.022 --> 43:51.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a very potent marijuana
concentrate.

43:51.062 --> 43:57.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And some people have told us
that the THC
levels are 80 to 90 percent.

43:57.335 --> 44:02.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had no idea that this was
something that
was legal in Colorado.

44:02.240 --> 44:06.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FERRUGIA: Not only is high
potency THC legal
in Colorado, there has been an
ever increasing

44:06.978 --> 44:09.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
effort to extract THC in its
purest form.

44:09.780 --> 44:13.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RALPH MORGAN, CEO, ORGANA LABS:
The sophistication
in labs like this is so high,
that we can

44:14.018 --> 44:21.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
achieve near perfect purity, 98
percent, 99
percent THC or CBD or any
cannabinoid that

44:21.859 --> 44:26.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're isolating and extracting
to the crystalline
form.

44:26.163 --> 44:31.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FERRUGIA: Ralph Morgan is the
CEO of Organa
Labs, a company that extracts
THC from marijuana

44:31.669 --> 44:34.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for use in a smoking device.

44:34.338 --> 44:38.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His solution used by consumers
is almost 90
percent pure THC.

44:38.242 --> 44:41.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MORGAN: The industry is chasing
purity for
the benefits of that.

44:41.979 --> 44:50.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those benefits are a product
that's repeatable,
that's safe, and has an effect
that's consistent.

44:50.555 --> 44:52.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
With purity comes potency.

44:52.557 --> 44:57.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FERRUGIA: While Morgan and
others in the industry
provide an ever purer product,
and high potency,

44:57.929 --> 45:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it is not their job to worry
about how much
consumers use, or how they use
it, nor is

45:02.733 --> 45:05.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it their responsibility under
Colorado law.

45:05.536 --> 45:09.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even so, the industry knows that
adverse reactions
are bad for business.

45:09.473 --> 45:14.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MORGAN: Cannabis is very safe
but it's not
foolproof.

45:14.445 --> 45:19.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And no one is going to -- no one
is going
to defend not exercising
moderation.

45:19.350 --> 45:26.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And anything in life can fog
your judgment
or can be detrimental if it's
not done in

45:26.057 --> 45:27.892 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
moderation.

45:27.925 --> 45:30.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FERRUGIA: Ginny and Mike point
to Marc Bullard's
own words in his diary
indicating that he

45:30.861 --> 45:32.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was suffering from a dabbing
addiction.

45:32.663 --> 45:40.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GINNY BULLARD: "I found out I
was dabbing
too much which I already knew
and had cut

45:40.871 --> 45:50.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back in February, but apparently
if you overdo
it, you can get almost like
poison and experience

45:50.114 --> 45:51.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some negative effects."

45:51.649 --> 45:54.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FERRUGIA: People have said well
you know you
can't get addicted to marijuana.

45:54.285 --> 45:55.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARI FRANSON, UNIVERSITY OF
COLORADO SCHOOL
OF PHARMACY: Oh, you can.

45:55.486 --> 45:57.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Oh, definitely, you can.

45:57.421 --> 46:00.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FERRUGIA: Dr. Kari Franson is
associate dean
at the University of Colorado
School of Pharmacy

46:00.858 --> 46:05.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and has been studying cannabis
for years,
including human studies in the
Netherlands

46:05.596 --> 46:08.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where marijuana consumption was
allowed long
before Colorado.

46:08.933 --> 46:15.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANSON: It's because marijuana
stimulates
dopamine in this part of our
brain that we

46:15.072 --> 46:16.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
call the reward center.

46:17.008 --> 46:20.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FERRUGIA: In the case of 23-
year-old Marc
Bullard, his death certificate
lists a contributing

46:20.645 --> 46:23.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
factor to "use of concentrated
marijuana products".

46:23.981 --> 46:28.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the autopsy report showed
high levels
of active THC in his body.

46:28.653 --> 46:33.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But even Marc's parents realize
there is no
way to know if it was THC that
caused his

46:33.190 --> 46:34.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
slide into despair.

46:34.392 --> 46:38.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRANSON: Low doses of THC, we
know what happens.

46:38.462 --> 46:43.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These super high concentrations
of THC, we
don't know what happens because
we have not

46:43.267 --> 46:44.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
been studying it.

46:44.902 --> 46:49.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when they smoke that,
they're getting
in the 600 to 800 milligrams of
THC.

46:49.340 --> 46:53.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FERRUGIA: That's compared to a
limit of 10
milligrams in each serving of an
edible in

46:53.678 --> 46:58.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Colorado, or maybe 25 milligrams
of THC in
a typical marijuana cigarette.

46:58.983 --> 47:02.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it'’s not just mental health
that is
of concern.

47:02.887 --> 47:07.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brandon Cullip was 17, had only
had his driving
permit for a week, and his
friends in the

47:07.291 --> 47:10.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
car told him he was too high to
drive, but
that didn't stop him.

47:10.928 --> 47:15.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Cullip pleaded guilty to
vehicular homicide,
and reckless driving in the
death of 16-year

47:15.132 --> 47:16.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
old Chad Britton.

47:16.600 --> 47:19.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cullip is serving a two-year
sentence in youth
corrections.

47:19.570 --> 47:24.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police say he had been dabbing
high concentrate
THC before getting behind the
wheel.

47:24.575 --> 47:30.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chad Britton is one of 36 people
who died
in 2014 in automobile accidents
that the Colorado

47:30.347 --> 47:35.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Department of Transportation
attributed to
fatalities where THC was the
only substance

47:35.319 --> 47:37.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
inhibiting the driver.

47:37.088 --> 47:41.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
2014 is the year marijuana was
legalized for
recreational use.

47:41.492 --> 47:46.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is compared to 107 people
who died that
year in alcohol- only crashes.

47:46.063 --> 47:50.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The percentage of marijuana-only
fatalities
is small but has been edging up
since 2013.

47:50.901 --> 47:58.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANSON: Dabbing has become very
popular,
very quickly, without any kind
of understanding

47:58.909 --> 48:04.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how much is actually getting
into the brain
and what are the effects of a
typical user.

48:04.315 --> 48:06.083 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

48:06.117 --> 48:06.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LARRY WOLK, COLORADO DEPARTMENT
OF HEALTH
AND ENVIRONMENT: The credible
research that

48:06.917 --> 48:10.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
exists was all done on THC
potency.

48:10.254 --> 48:14.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's very low compared to what
we see being
made available through products
today.

48:14.992 --> 48:19.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FERRUGIA: Dr. Larry Wolk is
director of the
Colorado Department of Public
Health and Environment.

48:19.563 --> 48:23.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His agency is tasked with
ensuring marijuana
products are safe for
consumption.

48:23.801 --> 48:29.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wolk says the many delivery
systems of high-potency
cannabis products complicate its
study.

48:29.140 --> 48:32.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOLKS: You can smoke it, you can
eat it, you
can dab it, you can do whatever.

48:32.943 --> 48:37.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we don't know what all of
those different
forms do with regard to
absorption and the

48:37.948 --> 48:39.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
effect it has on people's
health.

48:39.850 --> 48:44.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE BULLARD: We didn't know
about the concentrated
marijuana products and the
different levels

48:44.855 --> 48:46.524 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the THC.

48:46.557 --> 48:51.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everybody thinks it's innocent,
you know,
just kind of relax people, it'’s
going to

48:51.662 --> 48:54.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
make him mellow, it'’s not going
to do any
danger to him.

48:54.198 --> 49:00.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GINNY BULLARD: After reading
through these
and seeing the significant
changes in his

49:00.471 --> 49:07.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
patterns, this is the only thing
that we feel
that it points to, is the
dabbing.

49:07.378 --> 49:13.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FERRUGIA: But voters here, and
in other states,
have approved recreational
marijuana, despite

49:13.217 --> 49:15.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
any potential harmful effects.

49:15.352 --> 49:20.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In southern Colorado, a center
of production
and sale of cannabis, voters
rejected a measure

49:20.090 --> 49:21.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that would have shut down
operations.

49:21.859 --> 49:26.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The message: legal marijuana is
here to stay
in Colorado and across the
country.

49:26.831 --> 49:31.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only question now is whether
states might
tighten regulation for the ever
increasing

49:31.335 --> 49:32.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
number of consumers.

49:33.003 --> 49:38.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

SREENIVASAN: Now to another in
our "Brief

we hear from

49:50.654 --> 49:52.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interesting people about their
passions.

49:52.790 --> 49:57.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, entrepreneur Jacqueline
Novogratz,
founder and CEO of Acumen, a
non-profit venture

49:57.962 --> 50:02.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
capital fund, talks about using
the tools
of business to address global
poverty.

50:02.233 --> 50:04.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

50:04.134 --> 50:07.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACQUELINE NOVOGRATZ, FOUNDER
AND CEO OF ACUMEN:
When I was six years old, my
first grade nun,

50:07.705 --> 50:12.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sister Mary Theophane, beat it
into my head
to whom much is given much is
expected.

50:12.676 --> 50:14.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so, I always wanted to
change the world.

50:14.578 --> 50:20.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I moved to Rwanda to help start
the first
micro finance bank and soon
thereafter realized

50:20.651 --> 50:23.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that most people don't want
saving.

50:23.587 --> 50:29.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most people want choice and
opportunity, which
is another way of saying
dignity.

50:29.827 --> 50:40.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a funny way, I became an
accidental banker
and ended up in Latin America
during the financial

50:40.304 --> 50:42.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
debt crisis of the early 1980s.

50:42.206 --> 50:45.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there I saw that I love the
tools of business.

50:45.075 --> 50:50.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem was that low-income
people who
were so industrious had no
access to the banks

50:50.881 --> 50:55.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that's why I went into
international development
and saw that on the other side,
there was

50:55.219 --> 51:00.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a great humanitarian ethos, but
it lacked
the efficiency, the
effectiveness of the markets.

51:01.025 --> 51:05.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We often say the market is the
best listening
device that we have.

51:05.129 --> 51:11.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if I give you a gift, you're
unlikely
to tell me what you don't like
about it.

51:11.802 --> 51:18.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if I try to tell you a solar
light, you're
going to tell me exactly what
you think.

51:19.009 --> 51:22.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We created an organization with
this idea
that you could change the way
the world tackles

51:22.680 --> 51:27.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
poverty by using something we
call "patient
capital."

51:27.184 --> 51:33.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We took philanthropy and rather
than give
it away, we would invest it in
intrepid entrepreneurs

51:33.190 --> 51:39.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that were going where both
markets and government
aid had failed the poor, basic
services like

51:39.063 --> 51:44.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
health care, education,
agriculture, energy,
workforce development.

51:44.368 --> 51:49.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What entrepreneurs and others
we've invested
in have in common is what we
call moral imagination.

51:49.807 --> 51:54.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Moral imagination starts with
putting yourself
in another person's shoes and
seeing the world

51:54.144 --> 51:55.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
through their perspective.

51:55.946 --> 51:57.715 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it's more than empathy.

51:57.748 --> 52:03.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the ability to envision a
world and build
institutions in which all people
matter.

52:03.854 --> 52:09.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, often, we look at poverty in
terms of
how much a person makes, rather
than understand

52:09.693 --> 52:13.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their contribution as a human
being.

52:13.263 --> 52:19.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we see companies enable
people to have
access to clean drinking water
or agricultural

52:19.737 --> 52:25.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inputs that enable them to make
a little more
income, one of the first things
they do is

52:25.442 --> 52:28.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
turn around and help somebody
else.

52:28.245 --> 52:32.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's seeing that there is no one
above you
or below you.

52:32.950 --> 52:39.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And really that's the world that
we need on
see right now when we are so
divided, and

52:39.289 --> 52:43.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

become united.
