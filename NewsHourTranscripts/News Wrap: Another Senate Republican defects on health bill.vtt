care bill has suffered
another critical defection,

00:04.866 --> 00:06.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the fifth so far.

00:06.900 --> 00:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nevada Republican Dean Heller
announced in Las Vegas today
that he can't support the

00:10.266 --> 00:11.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bill in its current form.

00:11.866 --> 00:13.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

DEAN HELLER (R), Nevada:
Well, it's going to be very
difficult to get me to a yes.

00:15.300 --> 00:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have a lot of work to do.

00:16.800 --> 00:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But you have to protect
Medicaid expansion states.

00:20.066 --> 00:21.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what I want.

00:21.600 --> 00:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Make sure that we're taken care
of here in the state of Nevada.

00:24.433 --> 00:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's going to be a very
difficult lift, because I can
see the other side is going

00:27.133 --> 00:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to have problems with that.

00:29.200 --> 00:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

Senate Republicans oppose the
measure over its subsidies.

00:32.833 --> 00:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But with Democrats united in
opposition, GOP leaders can't
afford to lose more than two

00:37.833 --> 00:40.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of their own and
still pass the bill.

their conversations when he

00:58.000 --> 00:59.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
see."

00:59.700 --> 01:02.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%

intention of doing that.

drag him or run him over.

01:19.400 --> 01:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

mistrial today, Dubose's family

will make sure that people who

01:28.200 --> 01:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are feeling a variety of
emotions, and, in my opinion,
justifiably so, have a right to

01:34.066 --> 01:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
express themselves peacefully.

01:35.633 --> 01:39.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

it held for more than a year.

01:50.200 --> 01:53.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%

to us as well."

accusing the Persian Gulf
kingdom of supporting

02:10.333 --> 02:12.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

affected, and repairs
could take several weeks.

02:30.833 --> 02:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

flames' rapid spread.

soon after the test started.

02:53.133 --> 02:58.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
