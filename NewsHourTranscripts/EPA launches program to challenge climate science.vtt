00:19.766 --> 00:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM WASHINGTON TO DISCUSS IT.

00:21.066 --> 00:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, EXPLAIN, HOW IS THIS PROCESS

00:22.533 --> 00:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO WORK?

00:23.733 --> 00:25.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR IS

00:25.066 --> 00:26.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ESSENTIALLY THAT ADMINISTRATOR

00:26.400 --> 00:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRUITT WANTS TO RECRUIT

00:27.900 --> 00:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCIENTISTS TO WORK ON THIS RED

00:30.366 --> 00:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TEAM, BLUE TEAM TO SORT OF LOOK

00:33.466 --> 00:35.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT ANY POTENTIAL VULNERABILITY

00:35.766 --> 00:38.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

REPORTS.

00:39.833 --> 00:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE RED TEAM WOULD DO THAT,

00:41.033 --> 00:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BLUE TEAM WOULD BE THE TEAM

00:42.100 --> 00:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRODUCING AND DEFENDING THE

FLIES IN THE FACE OF

00:46.700 --> 00:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEER-REVIEWED SCIENTIFIC

00:48.833 --> 00:50.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOURNALS AND HOW THEY ACTUALLY

00:50.266 --> 00:51.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUT SCIENCE FORWARD.

00:51.966 --> 00:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT DOES, AND THAT'S

00:53.200 --> 00:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABSOLUTELY WHAT YOU'VE HEARD

00:54.933 --> 00:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY IN

00:56.233 --> 00:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESPONSE TO THIS, THEY'RE SAYING

00:57.600 --> 00:58.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS EXACTLY HOW SCIENCE IS

00:58.866 --> 01:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MADE, SO BEFORE WE PUBLISH

01:00.366 --> 01:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYTHING ON CLIMATE CHANGE OR

01:01.600 --> 01:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANY OTHER MATTER WE'VE HAD IT

01:02.833 --> 01:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REVIEWED BY OTHER SCIENTISTS WHO

01:04.900 --> 01:06.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE LOOKED TO SEE THAT WE'VE

01:06.066 --> 01:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONE EVERYTHING CORRECTLY AND

01:07.200 --> 01:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WE'VE COME TO THE CORRECT

01:08.233 --> 01:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCLUSIONS.

01:09.766 --> 01:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ABOUT THE

01:11.133 --> 01:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACT THAT THE OVERWHELMING

01:12.800 --> 01:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAJORITY OF CLIMATE SCIENTISTS

01:14.833 --> 01:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY THAT THIS IS REALLY NOT UP

01:15.900 --> 01:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR DISPUTE?

01:17.533 --> 01:19.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IF YOU WANTED TO DO THIS RED

01:19.266 --> 01:20.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TEAM BLUE TEAM, WOULD IT BE RED

01:20.833 --> 01:23.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TEAM THREE AND BLUE TEAM 97?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WE DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT

01:24.400 --> 01:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT THE SPECIFICS WOULD LOOK

01:26.233 --> 01:27.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE, IT'S SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE

01:27.966 --> 01:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO ARE DISSENTERS WHO DO NOT

01:29.400 --> 01:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGREE WITH THE VAST MAJORITY WHO

01:30.833 --> 01:32.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF CLIMATE SCIENTISTS WHO SAY

01:32.100 --> 01:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT CLIMATE CHANGES HAPPENING

01:33.833 --> 01:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HUMANS ARE A CAUSE, A MAIN

01:35.366 --> 01:36.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAUSE, AND THAT ACTION NEEDS TO

01:36.966 --> 01:38.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE TAKEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO

01:38.466 --> 01:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRY TO STALL CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:40.666 --> 01:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: AND HOW DID YOU

01:41.733 --> 01:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIND OUT THIS INFORMATION ON

01:42.766 --> 01:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRIDAY?

01:44.033 --> 01:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I ACTUALLY WAS AT AN EVENT

01:45.200 --> 01:46.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE THE PRESIDENT WAS SPEAKING

01:46.100 --> 01:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THE ENERGY DEPARTMENT

01:47.333 --> 01:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEADQUARTERS AND HAD A CHAT WITH

01:48.666 --> 01:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOB MURRAY, WHO'S THE C.E.O.

01:50.166 --> 01:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF MURRAY ENERGY, ONE OF THE

01:51.533 --> 01:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIGGEST COAL COMPANIES IN THE

01:53.033 --> 01:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S.

01:54.200 --> 01:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HE MENTIONED TO ME THAT HE

01:55.533 --> 01:56.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAD HAD A MEETING WITH SCOTT

01:56.866 --> 01:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRUITT THE SAME MORNING AT A

01:57.533 --> 01:59.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COAL LOBBY BOARD MEETING AND

01:59.366 --> 02:01.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO HIM ABOUT

02:01.166 --> 02:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS ISSUE AND WHAT HE PLANNED

02:02.600 --> 02:04.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO DO AND ALSO WHETHER HE PLANS

02:04.166 --> 02:06.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO CHALLENGE A LEGAL FINDING

02:06.200 --> 02:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS THE BASIS FOR U.S.

02:08.033 --> 02:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREENHOUSE GAS REGULATIONS.

02:10.133 --> 02:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: PUT THIS IN

02:11.500 --> 02:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERSPECTIVE ON THE OTHER STEPS

02:13.266 --> 02:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT SCOTT PRUITT TAKEN WHEN IT

02:14.566 --> 02:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMES TO CLIMATE SCIENCE.

02:16.433 --> 02:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO, FOR THE BUDGET PROPOSAL

02:18.133 --> 02:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE HAS CUT PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING

02:19.633 --> 02:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELATED TO CLIMATE SCIENCE THAT

02:21.200 --> 02:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS AGENCY DOES RIGHT NOW.

02:23.133 --> 02:24.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER CONGRESS

02:24.966 --> 02:26.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS GOING TO APPROVE THE NUMBERS

02:26.966 --> 02:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HE AND THE PRESIDENT ARE

02:28.466 --> 02:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOKING AT.

02:30.133 --> 02:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT ESSENTIALLY HE'S NIXED

02:32.533 --> 02:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYTHING THAT WORK ON CLIMATE

02:34.366 --> 02:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCIENCE WITHIN THE E.P.A.,

02:35.933 --> 02:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE'S TAKEN EVERYTHING DOWN FROM

02:37.100 --> 02:38.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WEBSITE THAT HE CAN.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THAT PART IS NOT A SURPRISE.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE'S ALREADY EXPRESSED THAT EVEN

02:41.366 --> 02:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT

02:42.866 --> 02:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARBON DIOXIDE IS A MAIN CAUSE

02:44.133 --> 02:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF CLIMATE CHANGE.
