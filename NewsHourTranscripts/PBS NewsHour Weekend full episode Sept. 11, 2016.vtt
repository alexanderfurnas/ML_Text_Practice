STEIN.

20:42.067 --> 20:44.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I SUSPECT THIS IS BECAUSE THESE

20:44.100 --> 20:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE TWO HISTORICALLY UNPOPULAR

20:47.000 --> 20:51.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOMINEES.

20:51.867 --> 20:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OTHER INTERESTING THING IS

20:54.800 --> 20:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU'D UNDERSTAND WHY JILL STEIN

20:56.933 --> 20:58.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD BE TAKING AWAY VOTES FROM

20:58.800 --> 21:00.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HILLARY CLINTON, SHE'S ON THE

LEFT, AND GARY JOHNSON WOULD BE

21:02.200 --> 21:03.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DRAWING MORE FROM THE RIGHT BUT

21:03.867 --> 21:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF YOU MATCH THESE NUMBERS UP HE

21:07.100 --> 21:09.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEMS TO BE MARGINALLY

21:09.667 --> 21:10.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HURTING HER MORE.

21:10.967 --> 21:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAIN, I CAN'T MATCH THESE

21:12.533 --> 21:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

INTO THE DEBATES.

21:25.700 --> 21:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
