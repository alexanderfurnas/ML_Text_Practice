up with a really
incredible health care

passed and without
objection the motion

03:22.600 --> 03:25.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to reconsider is laid
upon the table 20

03:25.233 --> 03:27.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republicans and every
Democrat voted no

03:27.666 --> 03:30.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Democrat who said
support of the bill

03:30.033 --> 03:31.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would cost Republicans
their seats

03:31.700 --> 03:36.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
responded with taunts
of hey hey goodbye

it was the
culmination of days of

tension and hours of
heated debate House

Speaker Paul Ryan who
just six weeks ago

03:45.133 --> 03:47.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was forced to pull
an earlier version of

03:47.533 --> 03:50.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the bill made an
emotional plea a lot of

03:50.866 --> 03:53.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
us have been waiting
seven years to cast

03:53.833 --> 03:57.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this vote are we going
to meet this test

03:57.200 --> 04:00.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are we going to be
men and women of our

04:00.266 --> 04:03.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
word are we going
to keep the promises

04:03.500 --> 04:07.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that we made or are
we going to falter

04:07.100 --> 04:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
no Democrats summoned emotion to

04:10.733 --> 04:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
insisting the vote was rushed

04:12.633 --> 04:15.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
short-sighted and
will hurt millions of

04:15.000 --> 04:17.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

Trump care good for our veterans

04:22.566 --> 04:26.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is there any caring
and Trump care at

04:26.066 --> 04:30.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all just 24 hours
earlier a vote much

04:30.233 --> 04:32.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
less passage was
uncertain in the end

04:32.700 --> 04:34.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
enough conservatives
and a few moderate

04:34.533 --> 04:36.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to God on board to
put the bill over the

04:36.266 --> 04:38.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
top how did Republicans
get those votes

04:38.400 --> 04:41.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
two changes first
a rescue amendment

04:41.633 --> 04:43.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from New Jersey
Republican Tom McArthur

04:43.633 --> 04:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it allows states to waive out of

04:45.733 --> 04:47.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
essential benefits
like hospital care

04:47.633 --> 04:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
spending caps and requirements

04:50.033 --> 04:51.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
surrounding
pre-existing conditions

04:51.733 --> 04:53.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
states can only
drop those things if

04:53.866 --> 04:55.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they show it would
improve the market

04:55.800 --> 04:58.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that brought some
conservative votes but

04:58.133 --> 05:00.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
raised other concerns
about people with

05:00.533 --> 05:02.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pre-existing
conditions the answer

05:02.633 --> 05:04.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
another amendment
from michigan's fred

05:04.900 --> 05:07.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
upton to add eight
billion dollars to a

05:07.466 --> 05:09.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one hundred and
fifteen billion dollar

05:09.333 --> 05:11.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pot of money states
can use to help the

05:11.933 --> 05:14.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
highest risk patients
democrats today

05:14.533 --> 05:16.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
called that amount
a pittance it is a

05:16.933 --> 05:20.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lie it is a lie
and let's be honest

05:20.066 --> 05:22.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about it this does
not cover people with

05:22.233 --> 05:25.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pre-existing conditions
and to come on

05:25.233 --> 05:27.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the floor and say it
does to try to fool

05:27.166 --> 05:29.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people well you may
get away with it in

05:29.166 --> 05:30.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the short term you
may get a headline

05:30.800 --> 05:32.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but I'll tell you
people will figure out

05:32.433 --> 05:35.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
soon enough Republicans
counter charging

05:35.033 --> 05:36.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their opponents
were ill-informed I

05:36.900 --> 05:38.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
believe probably the
reason they won't

05:38.166 --> 05:39.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
vote for it is they
don't understand it

05:39.533 --> 05:40.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because pre-existing
conditions are

05:40.933 --> 05:43.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
covered if you have
coverage now nothing

05:43.100 --> 05:44.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in our bill no matter
what would come

05:44.533 --> 05:46.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from the state or
anyone else would lose

05:46.266 --> 05:47.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the pre-existing
conditions there's

05:47.733 --> 05:49.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
multiple but I guess
it's just easier to

05:49.700 --> 05:51.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
talk you're talking
point the bill would

05:51.733 --> 05:53.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have sweeping other
effects repealing

05:53.700 --> 05:56.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Obamacare taxes and
adding tax credits

05:56.166 --> 05:58.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of a few thousand
dollars based on age

05:58.433 --> 06:00.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and income but the

11:14.800 --> 11:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
should not affect those with

11:16.000 --> 11:18.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pre-existing conditions
because if their

11:18.133 --> 11:19.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
premiums get too
high they've created

11:19.633 --> 11:21.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what's called high-risk
pools they say

11:21.666 --> 11:24.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that will help them
but I spent a lot of

11:24.033 --> 11:25.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
time talking to
Republicans about this

11:25.400 --> 11:27.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
today they do not
guarantee that your

11:27.933 --> 11:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
premium won't go up if you have

11:29.233 --> 11:30.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pre-existing
conditions insurers can

11:30.966 --> 11:33.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
raise those premiums
the question is

11:33.233 --> 11:35.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will states actually
opt in to do this

11:35.633 --> 11:38.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and also important
hurry it's easy to

11:38.433 --> 11:39.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
get these waivers
under this particular

11:39.966 --> 11:43.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
version because if
the state applies for

11:43.400 --> 11:45.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it if the government
does nothing it

11:45.066 --> 11:47.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
happens the government
has to actually

11:47.500 --> 11:49.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
block the waiver so
a lot of this seems

11:49.400 --> 11:51.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to depend on a
state-by-state basis on

11:51.100 --> 11:53.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who decides to continue
well absolutely

11:53.200 --> 11:54.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you know this is one
of the things that

11:54.633 --> 11:55.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Republicans
said they don't like

11:55.933 --> 11:57.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that health care
is being you know

11:57.733 --> 11:59.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
basically governed
from the federal

11:59.233 --> 12:00.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
government they want
to turn it back to

12:00.833 --> 12:02.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the states now we
should say that states

12:02.400 --> 12:04.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
already have a lot
of power in the

12:04.700 --> 12:06.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
insurance market
they do they still

12:06.933 --> 12:09.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
regulate individual
insurance they still

12:09.000 --> 12:11.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
regulate insurance
for small businesses

12:11.633 --> 12:14.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
into businesses that
operate in multiple

12:14.633 --> 12:16.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
states are regulated
by the federal

12:16.266 --> 12:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
government but that wasn't the

12:17.533 --> 12:18.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Affordable Care Act
that's been the case

12:18.833 --> 12:21.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one of the things
that the Republicans

12:21.033 --> 12:23.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have said is are one
of our methods to

12:23.166 --> 12:24.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
deal with this is creating these

12:24.533 --> 12:26.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
high-risk pools let's
talk a little bit

12:26.366 --> 12:28.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about that how
would they work well

12:28.266 --> 12:31.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
basically the 35
states used to have

12:31.033 --> 12:32.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
these high-risk pools
and these are for

12:32.366 --> 12:34.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people who have very expensive

12:34.266 --> 12:37.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
conditions within an
ongoing normally at

12:37.433 --> 12:40.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an ongoing problem
and they basically

12:40.566 --> 12:42.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
get shunted off into
a different pool

12:42.700 --> 12:43.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's why they're
called high-risk

12:43.800 --> 12:44.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pools and

12:44.766 --> 12:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the reason for that is that the

12:46.400 --> 12:48.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
healthier people
in the regular pool

12:48.900 --> 12:50.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would then have lower
premiums because

12:50.333 --> 12:51.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they're not paying
for those expensive

12:51.700 --> 12:53.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people does that
mean that the sicker

12:53.000 --> 12:54.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people have higher
premiums that's

12:54.266 --> 12:55.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
exactly correct the
sicker people have

12:55.933 --> 12:57.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
could get insurance
but they had higher

12:57.833 --> 13:00.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
premiums sometimes
they had they had

13:00.433 --> 13:02.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pre-existing condition
exclusion so you

13:02.333 --> 13:03.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
couldn't get coverage
for the very thing

13:03.966 --> 13:05.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that got you into
the high-risk pool

13:05.500 --> 13:07.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sometimes for up to
a year and also a

13:07.966 --> 13:09.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lot of the more
underfunded so they

13:09.933 --> 13:11.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would close to do
entrance there was a

13:11.800 --> 13:13.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pool in Florida
that was closed for

13:13.633 --> 13:14.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
decades

13:14.800 --> 13:15.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Lisa and that's where
this money comes

13:15.966 --> 13:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in that Republicans added to the

13:17.333 --> 13:19.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
last-minute billion
dollars that could

13:19.733 --> 13:21.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
go to these high-risk
pools to try and

13:21.500 --> 13:24.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
help stabilize those
premiums but we

13:24.033 --> 13:26.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have no idea if
that's enough money

13:26.100 --> 13:28.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there is not a CBO
score on this bill we

13:28.766 --> 13:30.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
don't know there's
not a CBO score for

13:30.166 --> 13:31.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
how much is needed
in that kind of

13:31.666 --> 13:34.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
national potential
high-risk pool it's a

13:34.466 --> 13:35.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
huge question mark
there are many people

13:35.866 --> 13:37.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who say eight billion
dollars is not

13:37.300 --> 13:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to cut it we've tried to

13:38.933 --> 13:40.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
supplement these
high-risk pools in the

13:40.866 --> 13:42.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
past few years and
it's come up short

13:42.333 --> 13:44.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there was a federal
high-risk pool as in

13:44.333 --> 13:45.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the transition to
the affordable care

13:45.700 --> 13:48.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
act and it closed
I think more than a

13:48.033 --> 13:49.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
year early because
it ran out of money

13:49.800 --> 13:51.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
okay let's talk a
little bit about the

13:51.100 --> 13:52.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
essential health
benefits that's also

13:52.566 --> 13:54.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
something that's
been too discussed on

13:54.400 --> 13:56.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
something that could
really strain the

13:56.900 --> 13:58.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
average household of
the average family

13:58.566 --> 14:00.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
first to set the
table what are some of

14:00.366 --> 14:01.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the essential health
benefits that have

14:01.566 --> 14:02.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been guaranteed
under the Affordable

14:02.766 --> 14:04.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Care Act that are
under threat now sort

14:04.233 --> 14:06.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of an unseen skeleton
of American health

14:06.133 --> 14:07.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
care we're talking
about things like

14:07.566 --> 14:09.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hospital care being
able to go to a

14:09.300 --> 14:12.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hospital emergency
care the ER maternity

14:12.266 --> 14:14.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
care preventive
care that could be

14:14.733 --> 14:17.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
anything from cancer
screenings to right

14:17.500 --> 14:19.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
now contraception
depending on how the

14:19.266 --> 14:21.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
health health agency
goes forward it is

14:21.966 --> 14:24.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it also prescription
drugs ten basics

14:24.700 --> 14:27.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that the Congress
under Obama care said

14:27.733 --> 14:29.800 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
must be in every
plan now the way

14:29.800 --> 14:31.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republicans in the
House want it they

14:31.500 --> 14:32.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
want States to be
able to waive out of

14:32.966 --> 14:34.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
those essential
benefits now you're

14:34.333 --> 14:36.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
creating a market
state-by-state basis

14:36.233 --> 14:37.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
saying I'm going to
have an essential

14:37.833 --> 14:39.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
health package that's
different from my

14:39.366 --> 14:41.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
neighboring state
right so this is one

14:41.433 --> 14:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the things that Donald Trump

14:42.933 --> 14:45.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
confidently said
today that we're going

14:45.100 --> 14:46.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to drive down premiums
we're going to

14:46.533 --> 14:50.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
drive down these costs
is it likely that

14:50.766 --> 14:53.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
states will start
to offer up these

14:53.666 --> 14:55.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
different packages
for employers from

14:55.200 --> 14:56.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
other places

14:56.400 --> 14:58.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
well actually already
States get to pick

14:58.466 --> 15:00.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which you know kind
of there to call to

15:00.566 --> 15:02.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
benchmark plan it
does have to have

15:02.366 --> 15:03.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
those benefits but
states can decide on

15:03.933 --> 15:05.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a state-by-state
basis what the plan

15:05.800 --> 15:07.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
should be modeled as
what this is saying

15:07.400 --> 15:09.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is that it would
give insurers the

15:09.333 --> 15:10.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ability to just
jettison some of those

15:10.800 --> 15:12.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
benefits now they
probably wouldn't

15:12.200 --> 15:14.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
jettison hospital
care and doctor care

15:14.133 --> 15:15.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but they might you
know say we're not

15:15.433 --> 15:17.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to cover
maternity care we're not

15:17.233 --> 15:19.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to cover mental
health care we're

15:19.133 --> 15:21.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
only going to cover
generic prescription

15:21.000 --> 15:22.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
drugs and not
brand-name prescription

15:22.533 --> 15:24.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
drugs so then probably
premiums would go

15:24.766 --> 15:26.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
down but people who
needed that coverage

15:26.633 --> 15:28.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wouldn't have it
any more what people

15:28.133 --> 15:29.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would be making that
choice Republicans

15:29.833 --> 15:31.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
argue they say you
could choose to have

15:31.466 --> 15:32.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a bare-bones

15:32.666 --> 15:34.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
plan instead of a
Cadillac that's right

15:34.466 --> 15:36.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one of the biggest
numbers in this 880

15:36.400 --> 15:38.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
billion dollars in
cuts to Medicaid how

15:38.766 --> 15:40.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
does that go forward
this is really sort

15:40.266 --> 15:42.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of that has been
hidden in the debate

15:42.033 --> 15:44.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this is a tremendous
change to Medicaid

15:44.333 --> 15:45.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for the first time
since Medicaid was

15:45.700 --> 15:48.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
created in 1965 there
would no longer be

15:48.266 --> 15:50.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
open-ended federal
funding and we're not

15:50.333 --> 15:51.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just talking about the Medicaid

15:51.700 --> 15:53.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
expansion that was
in the Affordable

15:53.600 --> 15:55.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Care Act that would
be phased down we're

15:55.533 --> 15:57.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
talking about the
basic Medicaid program

15:57.566 --> 15:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that pays for maternity care and

15:59.866 --> 16:01.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
childbirth for almost
half the children

16:01.833 --> 16:03.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
born in the United
States and the

16:03.333 --> 16:05.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
majority of nursing
home care so that's

16:05.433 --> 16:06.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
where the the
Congressional Budget

16:06.900 --> 16:08.733 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Office suggested
that much of the

16:08.733 --> 16:10.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
declining coverage
would come from were

16:10.533 --> 16:13.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
states losing money
for Medicaid when

16:13.000 --> 16:14.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you look at the
politics of this as

16:14.333 --> 16:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there are senators and there are

16:15.633 --> 16:17.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
governors who are
not in favor this

16:17.166 --> 16:18.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's right and I
think we're going to

16:18.700 --> 16:20.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pay a lot more
attention to send it now

16:20.100 --> 16:21.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they have a real
problem in the Senate

16:21.566 --> 16:23.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and in fact you talk
to some senators

16:23.333 --> 16:24.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have been around a
long time including

16:24.766 --> 16:26.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the chairman of the
Health Committee

16:26.400 --> 16:27.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that helped committee
as it's called

16:27.733 --> 16:30.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Alexander his office
and sent me an

16:30.366 --> 16:32.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
email tonight he says
that the Senate is

16:32.466 --> 16:34.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to write its
own bill they're

16:34.166 --> 16:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to start and go their own

16:35.566 --> 16:37.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
direction Medicaid
is a big problem and

16:37.866 --> 16:39.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
states with some of
the highest Medicaid

16:39.633 --> 16:41.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rates are also states
with Republican

16:41.266 --> 16:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
senators they are taking it very

16:43.533 --> 16:44.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
seriously

16:44.466 --> 16:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
also hari today nine of those

16:46.533 --> 16:48.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republicans who
voted no on this bill

16:48.633 --> 16:51.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
had districts where
Hillary Clinton won

16:51.166 --> 16:52.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the presidential
election so there are

16:52.733 --> 16:55.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
real issues for 2018
here and one of the

16:55.233 --> 16:56.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
things that we're
also hearing today is

16:56.400 --> 16:57.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that this could
affect people who are

16:57.700 --> 17:00.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not in need of the
Affordable Care Act

17:00.300 --> 17:02.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or a government
plan people who have

17:02.266 --> 17:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
private insurance through their

17:03.500 --> 17:04.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
employers which
is the bulk of the

17:04.766 --> 17:06.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
population that's
right and you know

17:06.333 --> 17:08.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this is a very
good example of how

17:08.466 --> 17:11.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
complicated this all
is these things are

17:11.133 --> 17:12.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tied to each other when

17:12.366 --> 17:13.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you pull one piece
of it out you could

17:13.700 --> 17:15.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
inadvertently touch
another piece this

17:15.833 --> 17:17.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is an example the
Wall Street Journal

17:17.366 --> 17:19.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this morning reported
that that people

17:19.333 --> 17:22.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who have now insurers
or our employers

17:22.266 --> 17:23.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are required not to
offer coverage that

17:23.800 --> 17:26.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has lifetime limits
that say if once you

17:26.166 --> 17:28.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have a million
dollars in claims you

17:28.200 --> 17:29.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can't do it anymore
you can't cover

17:29.800 --> 17:31.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
anymore it's tied
to those essential

17:31.733 --> 17:32.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
health benefits so
if the essential

17:32.966 --> 17:35.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
health benefits go
away then once again

17:35.133 --> 17:37.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
employer coverage
could have lifetime

17:37.333 --> 17:39.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
limits all right

there are at least three major

18:03.400 --> 18:05.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
investigations
underway into what role

18:05.800 --> 18:07.800 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Russia played in
the presidential

18:07.800 --> 18:09.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
election and whether
the Trump campaign

18:09.700 --> 18:12.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
colluded in that
process today two of

bodies looking into
Russia's role in the

I can hear in the

18:38.400 --> 18:39.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
background there
are some protesters

18:39.800 --> 18:42.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there I take it
protesting the the gops

18:42.533 --> 18:44.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
passage of their
health law we'll talk

18:44.733 --> 18:46.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about that in a minute
but before we get

18:46.066 --> 18:47.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to that I'd like to
talk a little bit

18:47.733 --> 18:49.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about this hearing
today you heard from

18:49.533 --> 18:51.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the head of the NSA
the head of the FBI

18:51.900 --> 18:53.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I know this was a confidential

18:53.466 --> 18:55.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
closed-door hearing
can you share a

18:55.233 --> 18:57.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
little bit of us with
us about what you

18:57.166 --> 19:00.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
heard today certainly
well I can't go

19:00.300 --> 19:01.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
into the contents I
can't tell you the

19:01.766 --> 19:05.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
three areas of focus
for us and that is

19:05.333 --> 19:07.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we have this very
public assessment by

19:07.233 --> 19:09.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Intelligence
Committee community

19:09.100 --> 19:11.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rather that the
Russians intervened they

19:11.733 --> 19:13.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
did so to hurt Secretary
Clinton to help

19:13.600 --> 19:15.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Donald Trump and we
are investigating to

19:15.966 --> 19:18.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
make sure that the
conclusions reached

19:18.066 --> 19:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in that report are an accurate

19:20.100 --> 19:22.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reflection of the
raw intelligence we

19:22.366 --> 19:24.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
also want to look
at the US government

19:24.600 --> 19:27.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
response did the FBI
for example bring

19:27.733 --> 19:29.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the necessary urgency
to the task when

19:29.966 --> 19:32.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it discovered the
Russians were into

19:32.066 --> 19:33.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
computers at the
Democratic National

19:33.366 --> 19:36.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Committee and elsewhere
and then finally

19:36.633 --> 19:39.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in a probably most
public interest we

19:39.300 --> 19:41.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
continue to investigate
the issue of

19:41.366 --> 19:43.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whether there were
US persons particular

19:43.933 --> 19:45.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
those involved in
the Trump campaign

19:45.366 --> 19:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that were somehow colluding or

19:47.200 --> 19:49.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
coordinating with
this Russian hacking

19:49.800 --> 19:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into our democracy yesterday FBI

19:54.000 --> 19:56.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
director Comey
testified before the

19:56.233 --> 19:58.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Senate and he gave
a very impassioned

19:58.733 --> 20:01.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
testimony arguing
that his investigation

20:01.433 --> 20:03.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
both of Hillary
Clinton's email server

20:03.900 --> 20:07.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and of the Russia
investigation was

20:07.633 --> 20:10.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
absolutely fair and
he argues he would

20:10.233 --> 20:11.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do it exactly

20:11.500 --> 20:12.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the same way again
are you confident

20:12.833 --> 20:14.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from what you heard
yesterday and what

20:14.800 --> 20:17.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you heard today that
that director Comey

20:17.766 --> 20:20.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is the right man for
this investigation

20:20.500 --> 20:23.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
well I have serious
questions about the

20:23.166 --> 20:26.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
directors testimony
yesterday I disagree

20:26.033 --> 20:27.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
strongly with the
conclusions and the

20:27.733 --> 20:29.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
argument that he
was making I don't

20:29.966 --> 20:32.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think it was at all
a choice between

20:32.166 --> 20:34.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
speaking or concealing
and the fact the

20:34.733 --> 20:37.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
director used such
a loaded term like

20:37.133 --> 20:39.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
conceal I think really
demonstrated the

20:39.866 --> 20:41.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
weakness frankly of
that argument the

20:41.966 --> 20:43.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
real choice was
whether he would abide

20:43.566 --> 20:45.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by the Department
of Justice policy of

20:45.733 --> 20:48.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not discussing
pending matters right

20:48.333 --> 20:49.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
before an election
he violated that

20:49.866 --> 20:52.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
policy and he also
treated the Clinton

20:52.800 --> 20:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
investigation and the Trump

20:54.100 --> 20:57.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
investigation in very
different ways and

20:57.466 --> 20:59.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't think his
argument that one

20:59.633 --> 21:01.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
investigation was
in the early stage

21:01.266 --> 21:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that he disclosed the Clinton

21:02.933 --> 21:04.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
investigation only
three months after

21:04.600 --> 21:06.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
had begun and somehow
it was different

21:06.733 --> 21:08.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for the Trump
investigation holds up

21:08.266 --> 21:09.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
after all

21:09.466 --> 21:11.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in October the Trump
investigation by

21:11.933 --> 21:14.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his own accounting
had also been going

21:14.100 --> 21:16.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on for three months
so I don't agree

21:16.433 --> 21:18.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with what he said
yesterday at the same

21:18.300 --> 21:21.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
time in terms of going
forward I have to

21:21.033 --> 21:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hope that he will do a thorough

21:22.500 --> 21:25.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
investigation of
these allegations

21:25.100 --> 21:27.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
concerning the Trump
campaign we for our

21:27.733 --> 21:29.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
part are determined
to follow the facts

21:29.633 --> 21:31.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wherever they lead
and we're going to

21:31.366 --> 21:33.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have to expect
him to do the same

21:33.533 --> 21:35.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
congressman a few
months ago you said

21:35.933 --> 21:38.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that there was more
than that there was

21:38.000 --> 21:39.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a good bit of evidence
that there had

21:39.800 --> 21:41.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been collusion by
the Trump campaign

21:41.666 --> 21:43.433 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
later you seemed
to indicate that

21:43.433 --> 21:45.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
perhaps that wasn't
as clear is there

21:45.966 --> 21:47.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
anything more you
can tell us today

21:47.333 --> 21:49.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about the evidence
that does or doesn't

21:49.100 --> 21:51.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
exist about collusion
between the Trump

21:51.266 --> 21:54.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
campaign and the
Russians well what I

21:54.133 --> 21:55.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have said is that I
think the evidence

21:55.800 --> 21:59.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of coordination
reclusion is not purely

21:59.000 --> 22:01.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
circumstantial
unfortunately I'm not

22:01.266 --> 22:03.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
able to go into the
particulars of the

22:03.366 --> 22:05.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
evidence but I
thought it fair to

22:05.400 --> 22:08.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
characterize at
least initially where

22:08.033 --> 22:09.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we're starting out
in the investigation

22:09.800 --> 22:13.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I do think that the
FBI was justified an

22:13.066 --> 22:15.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
opening investigation
last year I think

22:15.033 --> 22:17.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's not something
when it involves a

22:17.300 --> 22:19.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
major presidential
campaign that they do

22:19.200 --> 22:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
willy-nilly and I think they're

22:21.166 --> 22:22.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
justified in continuing that in

22:22.866 --> 22:24.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sedation but
unfortunately I can't go

22:24.800 --> 22:27.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
into the particular
x' let's turn to

22:27.166 --> 22:29.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
obviously that big
ruckus that we hear

22:29.533 --> 22:30.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
behind you

22:30.933 --> 22:32.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a huge piece of news
today that the GOP

22:32.833 --> 22:35.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was successful in
passing their piece of

22:35.966 --> 22:38.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
healthcare legislation
what was your I

22:38.033 --> 22:39.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
know you voted against
it what was your

22:39.266 --> 22:40.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reaction to what happened today

22:40.866 --> 22:43.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
well my pedometer
reaction is it's a sad

22:43.933 --> 22:46.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
day I think for this
institution when we

22:46.100 --> 22:48.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would vote and
effectively cut off

22:48.733 --> 22:50.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
millions of people
from access to health

22:50.766 --> 22:52.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
care and when you
have the kind of

22:52.666 --> 22:55.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
massive cuts to
Medicaid that are in

22:55.033 --> 22:56.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this bill when
you're essentially

22:56.966 --> 22:58.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
telling states they
can do away with

22:58.633 --> 23:00.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
protections for people who have

23:00.566 --> 23:02.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pre-existing health
conditions you're

23:02.833 --> 23:05.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
voting for legislation
that you know or

23:05.166 --> 23:07.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
should know will mean
that millions will

23:07.633 --> 23:09.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lose their access
to health care we

23:09.833 --> 23:11.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ought to be sad about
it I don't think

23:11.400 --> 23:13.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Republicans should
be celebrating at

23:13.100 --> 23:15.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the White House about
it and I will say

23:15.666 --> 23:17.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this too it's not
that this is some

23:17.966 --> 23:20.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
abstract desire to
cut people off from

23:20.233 --> 23:23.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
health care the real
motivating force

23:23.200 --> 23:25.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
behind my GOP
colleagues and the vote

23:25.800 --> 23:28.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
today is they want
to take the money out

23:28.066 --> 23:30.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the health care
system and they want

23:30.466 --> 23:32.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to give it out in
the form of a tax cut

23:32.533 --> 23:34.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that will benefit
predominantly wealthy

23:34.466 --> 23:37.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people that's the
tragedy of what we did

23:37.033 --> 23:39.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
today and I don't
think it's going to

23:39.233 --> 23:41.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pass muster in the
Senate I think that

23:41.466 --> 23:43.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
celebration will be
short-lived and for

23:43.166 --> 23:44.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
good reason

23:44.400 --> 23:46.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lastly congressman
the president seemed

23:46.600 --> 23:47.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to indicate today
at the White House

23:47.866 --> 23:50.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that Obamacare was
dead do you believe

23:50.600 --> 23:51.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that's true

23:51.833 --> 23:53.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
no I don't believe
that at all and what

23:53.833 --> 23:55.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we have seen throughout
the country is

23:55.466 --> 23:57.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
states that have
wanted to make it

23:57.433 --> 23:59.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
successful like my
own home state of

23:59.100 --> 24:01.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
California have and
millions more people

24:01.533 --> 24:03.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are now covered by insurance the

24:03.766 --> 24:05.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
marketplaces work
reasonably well not

24:05.966 --> 24:08.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
perfect and we can
still improve it but

24:08.433 --> 24:09.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in other states where
they wanted it to

24:09.866 --> 24:12.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
fail willed it to
fail try to deter

24:12.733 --> 24:14.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people from enrolling
they have largely

24:14.400 --> 24:17.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
succeeded in doing
that the president

24:17.366 --> 24:19.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for his part is also
determined to try

24:19.600 --> 24:21.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to bring down the
affordable care act

24:21.233 --> 24:23.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's why they have
cut off outreach to

24:23.900 --> 24:26.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
young people they
want only older sicker

24:26.433 --> 24:29.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people to enroll and
to raise costs so

24:29.066 --> 24:31.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they can make the
case for a repeal it's

24:31.433 --> 24:34.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a cynical strategy I
think at the end of

24:34.366 --> 24:36.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the day the Republicans
won't be able

24:36.300 --> 24:38.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to do this on their
own and shouldn't

24:38.233 --> 24:40.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and I hope it'll get
us to a place where

24:40.600 --> 24:43.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we can work together
on a bipartisan

24:43.033 --> 24:46.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
basis to improve the
existing system and

24:46.200 --> 24:48.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not do away with
in favor of cutting

24:48.133 --> 24:50.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
millions of people
off from health care

24:50.000 --> 24:51.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all right representative

spectacular take from

Norman Lear

25:19.866 --> 25:22.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

room that's unmarked
and usually closed

25:41.700 --> 25:44.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so the Parker closet
is a resource area

25:44.300 --> 25:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for students that are struggling

[Music]

26:29.933 --> 26:32.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for decades thereafter
a job at the

26:32.566 --> 26:34.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
plant was a ticket
to the middle class

26:34.133 --> 26:36.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Dave Vaughn went to
the plant straight

26:36.433 --> 26:39.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from high school
retired after 35 years

26:39.166 --> 26:43.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
when I hired in
ins 1967 there were

26:43.100 --> 26:46.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
approximately 7,200
people that worked

26:46.300 --> 26:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there it was like a small city

26:48.200 --> 26:52.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it was security it
was good benefits

26:52.500 --> 26:55.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I had a vested pension
even by the time

26:55.333 --> 26:57.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the last Chevy
Tahoe rolled off the

26:57.333 --> 26:59.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
assembly line there
were still 1,200

26:59.966 --> 27:03.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
workers making $28
an hour all laid off

27:03.866 --> 27:06.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
along with thousands
of others at local

27:06.366 --> 27:09.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GM suppliers I knew
a lot of the people

27:09.433 --> 27:14.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
down there families
friends neighbors

27:14.133 --> 27:16.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's a lot of
people in one little

27:16.833 --> 27:19.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
city of Janesville
the one son and

27:19.533 --> 27:21.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
daughter-in-law both
lost their jobs at

27:21.666 --> 27:24.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
leer which made seats
for GM vehicles I

27:24.566 --> 27:27.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was shocked and
then I guess I was

27:27.333 --> 27:30.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
scared what's next
all of a sudden we're

27:30.300 --> 27:32.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
both unemployed
financially what are we

27:32.533 --> 27:35.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to do Mike
Vaughn's wife Barb felt

27:35.233 --> 27:37.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the same even though
the job had taken

27:37.266 --> 27:40.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
quite a toll on her
I was working with

27:40.033 --> 27:43.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bolts about that big
around in that long

27:43.066 --> 27:46.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
um torquing them
into the seat I had

27:46.566 --> 27:49.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
surgery on my shoulder
and then I ended

27:49.400 --> 27:52.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
up with a surgery
on my wrist so some

27:52.666 --> 27:53.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
relief for barb

27:53.900 --> 27:56.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
none at all for Mike
at the time I was

27:56.833 --> 28:00.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Labour leader
for almost 900 people

28:00.200 --> 28:04.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and ultimately I
had to be a part of

28:04.500 --> 28:06.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
giving the news
that the plant is

28:06.966 --> 28:09.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
closing what was the
process line they

28:09.400 --> 28:12.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
were angry they
were upset they were

28:12.066 --> 28:14.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hurt and they were
scared it was shortly

28:14.900 --> 28:16.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
after this the dairy
Eastman started

28:16.866 --> 28:18.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
slipping day-to-day
essentialist of

28:18.666 --> 28:20.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
formerly middle
class students now

28:20.900 --> 28:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
struggling stressed and often

28:23.133 --> 28:26.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
embarrassed some of
the kids were wow I

28:26.000 --> 28:28.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can't believe this
all is in here and

28:28.400 --> 28:31.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
someone would be
very open to taking

28:31.500 --> 28:35.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
things others would
be like nope we're

28:35.000 --> 28:38.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
okay about 250 kids
made use of the

28:38.600 --> 28:41.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
closet including two
brothers who asked

28:41.200 --> 28:42.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for soap

28:42.466 --> 28:44.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and shampoo after
their mother's day

28:44.200 --> 28:45.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
care business went bust

28:45.666 --> 28:48.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
well when the plant
closed the parents

28:48.066 --> 28:50.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
were home they
didn't need a daycare

28:50.400 --> 28:52.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
anymore and so
Carey's daycare center

28:52.933 --> 28:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
kind of washed up and I remember

28:54.966 --> 28:57.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
realizing this was
going to be a huge

28:57.233 --> 29:00.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ripple effect for
Jamesville in all the

29:00.366 --> 29:03.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
region lost some 9,000 jobs ami

29:03.233 --> 29:05.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Goldstein's book
janesville an american

29:05.600 --> 29:08.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
story is about what
came next this is a

29:08.600 --> 29:10.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
story of what choices
people made when

29:10.933 --> 29:13.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there were no good
choices left because

29:13.033 --> 29:15.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it was impossible
to keep your income

29:15.000 --> 29:17.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and stay working here
some people chose

29:17.633 --> 29:20.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to stay here and
make less money and

29:20.800 --> 29:24.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
some of the gmos
chose to work farther

29:24.200 --> 29:26.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
away and keep up the
standard of living

29:26.200 --> 29:30.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
thus the term GM
gypsies workers who

29:30.066 --> 29:32.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
accepted a transfer
to other GM plants

29:32.300 --> 29:35.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hundreds of miles
away good morning

29:35.433 --> 29:40.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
transferees how many
all this first move

29:41.300 --> 29:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you've ever made there will be

29:43.933 --> 29:47.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
difficulties I'm
living experience of it

29:47.500 --> 29:49.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I've got one failed
marriage behind me

29:49.900 --> 29:52.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Indiana was the
closest place you could

29:52.066 --> 29:54.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
work in Lordstown
Ohio so these families

29:54.666 --> 29:57.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
were very split up
into this day some of

29:57.066 --> 29:58.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the families are
still split up with

29:58.466 --> 30:00.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
workers coming home
depending on how far

30:00.733 --> 30:02.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
away they are once
a week once a month

30:02.900 --> 30:05.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but other workers
took the path so often

30:05.833 --> 30:08.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pushed and D
industrializing America

30:08.033 --> 30:10.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
these last few decades
stay in town and

30:10.800 --> 30:14.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
go back to school
for retraining in

30:21.700 --> 30:24.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Vaughn strained to
reinvent themselves

30:24.000 --> 30:26.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it was obviously
scary it was something

30:26.400 --> 30:30.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that was unchartered
and unknown Mike

30:30.100 --> 30:32.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stuck it out and
finished an associate's

30:32.433 --> 30:34.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
degree in human
resource management

30:34.133 --> 30:37.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because I had been
unemployed and I took

30:37.666 --> 30:39.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the first job that
was offered to me

30:39.400 --> 30:42.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
which was a second shift

30:42.033 --> 30:44.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Human Resources

pay it was a lot less
pay yep a lot less

30:50.466 --> 30:53.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

out of high school

30:55.033 --> 30:56.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we got her diploma and then a

criminal-justice
associate's degree and

30:59.066 --> 31:01.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

31:01.900 --> 31:04.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
describe how focused
she was I couldn't

31:04.466 --> 31:07.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have anything less
than a 4.0 she

31:07.833 --> 31:09.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
couldn't she was a
perfectionist she had

31:09.766 --> 31:10.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to have straight A's

31:10.966 --> 31:15.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I received an a-minus
and it just threw

31:15.433 --> 31:20.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
me for a loop she
was angry she was

31:20.233 --> 31:21.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
angry I thought
something really bad

31:21.766 --> 31:23.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
might have happened
and she got an

31:23.133 --> 31:25.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a-minus and I was
thinking that's not

31:25.133 --> 31:28.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bad that's pretty
good you know the

31:28.000 --> 31:30.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Vaughn's are success
stories Mike has

31:30.566 --> 31:32.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
worked his way back
up to the salary he

31:32.433 --> 31:35.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
earned it Lear both
have found new work

31:35.066 --> 31:37.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they like locally
but they turn out to

31:37.866 --> 31:40.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be stunning exceptions
fully two-thirds

31:40.600 --> 31:43.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of those who went to
Blackhawk Technical

31:43.033 --> 31:45.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
College never
finished this was a

31:45.466 --> 31:47.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
heartbreaking thing
that I heard over

31:47.233 --> 31:48.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and over from some
of the people who

31:48.533 --> 31:50.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
work at the college
that people started

31:50.800 --> 31:54.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a course but they
needed to grab any job

31:54.366 --> 31:55.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they could because
they just didn't have

31:55.666 --> 31:57.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the money but even
more heartbreaking

31:57.933 --> 32:01.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the minority who did
get a degree fared

32:01.233 --> 32:04.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
worse than those who
did not the people

32:04.566 --> 32:07.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who we trained ended
up less likely to

32:07.300 --> 32:10.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have steady work they
have bigger drops

32:10.233 --> 32:12.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in their wages
than the people who

32:12.366 --> 32:14.266 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
hadn't gone back
to school so the

32:14.266 --> 32:16.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
question is why you
know it's possible

32:16.500 --> 32:19.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that those few jobs
that were round in

32:19.900 --> 32:21.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the community were
absorbed by the

32:21.966 --> 32:24.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people who didn't be
trained so that if

32:24.166 --> 32:26.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you were retraining
you were you were

32:26.800 --> 32:29.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stepping out of
line exactly another

32:29.200 --> 32:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
possibility is that if you were

32:31.566 --> 32:33.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
successful at retraining
and you managed

32:33.966 --> 32:36.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to shift into a new
line of work it's

32:36.466 --> 32:38.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
very likely that
you were starting at

32:38.166 --> 32:40.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the bottom of the
ladder but whatever

32:40.200 --> 32:43.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the reasons job
retraining one of the

32:43.200 --> 32:45.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
precious few economic
policies pretty

32:45.333 --> 32:48.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
much everyone lodz
simply fizzled I've

32:48.733 --> 32:50.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
seen a lot of people that are

32:50.666 --> 32:53.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
potentially still
struggling or not

32:53.333 --> 32:55.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
where they may have
wanted to been as a

32:55.133 --> 32:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
result of the
restraining if there's no

32:58.333 --> 33:00.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
jobs available after
retraining now what

33:00.733 --> 33:04.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do you do in the
years since the plant

33:04.000 --> 33:06.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
left there's been a
big push to attract

33:06.133 --> 33:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
new businesses to Janesville

33:08.233 --> 33:10.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
even Janesville
native Paul Ryan has

33:10.300 --> 33:12.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
courted potential
employers to the area

33:12.500 --> 33:15.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so will the town
come back there are

33:15.233 --> 33:17.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
some jobs that have
come back there

33:17.766 --> 33:19.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
aren't the kind of
job that used to be

33:19.133 --> 33:21.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
here I mean the
unemployment rate here

33:21.366 --> 33:24.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in early 2009 rocketed
up to more than

33:24.233 --> 33:28.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
13% it's now down
to just under five

33:28.633 --> 33:31.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
percent so if you
look just at that

33:31.066 --> 33:33.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
number you can say
this community has

33:33.900 --> 33:35.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
really come back
rebounded just as

33:35.666 --> 33:37.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
America just as
America has but if you

33:37.866 --> 33:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
look at other things it's a more

33:40.433 --> 33:43.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
complicated picture
manufacturing jobs

33:43.100 --> 33:46.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have not come back
and in terms of real

33:46.000 --> 33:48.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wages factoring
inflation to account

33:48.033 --> 33:51.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this area is running
behind where it was

33:51.700 --> 33:56.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in 2008 so people
are working again but

33:56.000 --> 33:57.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they're not working
making the kind of

33:57.900 --> 34:00.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
money they were before
which may explain

34:00.133 --> 34:02.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
why dairy Eastman

tonight we turn our

focus in neighboring
Uganda which has an

34:46.300 --> 34:49.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
open door to refugees
but with hundreds

34:49.033 --> 34:51.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

pouring across the

this young refugee

tensions between the
local communities

37:24.600 --> 37:27.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the refugees yes
we have seen some

such hostility is

37:48.066 --> 37:49.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
relatively new in
a country whose

37:49.800 --> 37:52.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
official policy has
been to integrate

like any other African

37:55.133 --> 37:57.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
village rather than
a refugee camp and

37:57.166 --> 37:58.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that's the point

37:58.400 --> 38:01.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Uganda's open-door
policy insists that

38:01.400 --> 38:03.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
refugees be placed
in settlements and

38:03.433 --> 38:06.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not camps
acknowledging that most

38:06.200 --> 38:08.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
families will stay
for some time they're

38:08.700 --> 38:10.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
given a small plot
of land that they can

38:10.500 --> 38:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
start to cultivate build a small

they're free to seek

we do not think
we should shut out

Ugandan government

38:29.400 --> 38:32.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he says his country
was itself once an

38:32.000 --> 38:34.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
exporter of refugees
when it was wracked

38:34.233 --> 38:37.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for years by war
Uganda will continue to

38:37.333 --> 38:39.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
provide what it
can he says but the

38:39.366 --> 38:41.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
anger expressed
by some Ugandan is

38:41.566 --> 38:44.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
understandable they
feel disadvantaged

38:44.300 --> 38:47.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and they have expressed
that they feel

38:47.800 --> 38:49.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that their inability
to get sufficient

38:49.533 --> 38:52.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
drugs their inability
to Toto to have

38:52.266 --> 38:54.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
enough food is the
because of the influx

38:54.933 --> 38:56.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of refugees

38:56.166 --> 38:58.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
actually you'll feel
agitated but were

38:58.100 --> 39:01.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
being Trento to to
work on that at the

39:01.633 --> 39:03.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
settlements food is
still available to

39:03.500 --> 39:04.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the newest arrivals

39:04.700 --> 39:06.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but rations have
been cut in half for

39:06.766 --> 39:08.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people who've been
here for several

39:08.200 --> 39:12.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
weeks water must be
trucked in at huge

39:12.466 --> 39:15.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
expense the onslaught
has been so abrupt

39:15.266 --> 39:17.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there hasn't been
time to survey land

39:17.266 --> 39:20.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and drill wells
for clean water the

39:20.300 --> 39:22.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rationing of food
was apparent when we

39:22.033 --> 39:24.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
talked with James
Ken he and his family

39:24.800 --> 39:27.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of seven walked for
three weeks to reach

39:27.233 --> 39:30.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the safety of Uganda
they now live in

39:30.500 --> 39:33.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this tent constructed
of tarps five of

39:33.200 --> 39:36.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
us alone he's grateful
for the welcome

39:36.300 --> 39:37.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he's received but
says there isn't

39:37.966 --> 39:40.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
enough food to go
around you run out

39:40.933 --> 39:44.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sometimes I run
computer even now as you

39:44.633 --> 39:46.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have seen there's
nothing on fire

39:46.300 --> 39:49.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there's nothing
cooking today yeah so

39:49.233 --> 39:52.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what will the children
need today then I

39:52.833 --> 39:55.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
had to come and see
some other solution

39:55.933 --> 39:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wagon borrow from the neighbors

39:59.433 --> 40:02.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
apparently the
neighbors did help with

40:02.033 --> 40:04.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this maize flour
for the next family

the UN estimates
it will cost 840

40:19.200 --> 40:22.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
severe shortfall we
are only 40 percent

40:22.333 --> 40:25.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of what we need we
appreciate all the

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
support we have
received from our donors

40:27.000 --> 40:29.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so far but we appeal
to all the donors

40:29.833 --> 40:32.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that they need to
increase their pledges

40:32.333 --> 40:35.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to us and to other
actors so that we

40:35.733 --> 40:39.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
address especially
the life-saving needs

40:39.100 --> 40:44.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for the refugees or
in de settlements

40:45.300 --> 40:47.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the government and
UN officials say

40:47.233 --> 40:49.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
things are approaching
a breaking point

40:49.333 --> 40:51.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the strain is definite
no doubt about

40:51.433 --> 40:52.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that

40:52.400 --> 40:53.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and that's why we try to engage

40:53.500 --> 40:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
everybody in and out of Uganda

40:56.600 --> 40:58.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
international
community they refused

40:58.500 --> 41:00.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cannot be this was
beautiful Uganda Iran

41:00.633 --> 41:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's a global responsibility

41:02.233 --> 41:04.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
responsibility
ultimately of course the

41:04.733 --> 41:06.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Ugandan government
and the refugees say

41:06.766 --> 41:08.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the solution is
for conditions to

41:08.566 --> 41:11.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stabilize in South
Sudan so refugees can

41:11.900 --> 41:14.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
return that certainly
the hope of James

41:14.400 --> 41:16.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can so you could
live here for a long

41:16.466 --> 41:19.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
time forever unless

come back do you

come back to South

Sudan well we did
not what he does know

41:25.900 --> 41:29.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

years ago when peace

arrived only to flee
again just weeks

43:03.600 --> 43:05.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
weekend features the
release of one of

43:05.533 --> 43:07.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the bigger sequels
of the year guardians

43:07.966 --> 43:11.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the galaxy vol 2
the first movie was

43:11.533 --> 43:13.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
something of a
surprise in grossing

43:13.766 --> 43:15.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
nearly eight hundred
million dollars

43:15.600 --> 43:20.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
worldwide a mix
of special-effects

43:21.766 --> 43:23.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
action and comedy
and based on a comic

43:23.333 --> 43:24.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
book producers say
they're looking to

43:24.966 --> 43:27.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
tap into mass appeal
once again I think

43:27.900 --> 43:29.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
audiences are going
to love first off

43:29.933 --> 43:31.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
many of the things
they love from the

43:31.300 --> 43:33.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
first movie the
humor the action the

43:33.666 --> 43:35.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
scope the characters
what are we even

43:35.433 --> 43:37.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
talking about this
for I think the key

43:37.566 --> 43:40.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to keeping these
movies fresh is being

43:40.066 --> 43:42.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
able to give the
audience a new story

43:42.200 --> 43:45.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that nobody expects
yet totally in line

43:45.233 --> 43:47.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
totally with what
audiences responded to

43:47.700 --> 43:49.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from before work
she's stupid raccoon

the new guardians is

43:52.700 --> 43:55.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
expected to make a
lot of money far more

43:55.333 --> 43:57.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
than the 200 million
dollars spent on it

43:57.766 --> 44:00.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but not all of the
blockbusters will

44:00.533 --> 44:02.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
many compete within
days of each other

44:02.966 --> 44:05.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sometimes even on
the same opening

44:05.100 --> 44:07.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
weekend yet the studios
are dependent on

44:07.933 --> 44:10.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the summer season
it accounts for more

44:10.033 --> 44:12.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
than four and a half
billion dollars in

44:12.300 --> 44:17.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
box office sales
worldwide this year

44:18.433 --> 44:20.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we'll see at least
15 sequels reboots or

44:20.466 --> 44:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
spin-offs between May and August

44:23.566 --> 44:26.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
including the
much-anticipated Wonder

44:26.233 --> 44:29.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Woman many of the
films come from older

44:29.100 --> 44:31.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
franchises that
includes spider-man

44:31.666 --> 44:33.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Planet of the Apes

44:33.066 --> 44:35.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you had another sequel
to the Pirates of

44:35.133 --> 44:37.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Caribbean series
which began 13

44:37.666 --> 44:41.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
years ago this is
weaved well they also

44:41.033 --> 44:42.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
find a human vegetation
this far from

44:42.966 --> 44:45.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Earth and there's
one more follow-up to

44:45.100 --> 44:47.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the aliens franchise
the first movie in

44:47.833 --> 44:51.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that series opened
in 1979 an early

44:51.766 --> 44:53.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
start to summer
the film industry's

44:53.766 --> 44:56.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
blockbuster strategy
and a few of the

44:56.066 --> 44:57.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
movies themselves
we talk about it now

44:57.733 --> 45:00.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with two film critics

Alonso guardians of

45:06.366 --> 45:09.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the galaxy vol 2 I
didn't realize it was

45:09.866 --> 45:12.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
summer yet but
apparently it is for the

45:12.066 --> 45:14.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
studio's well you
know I think the the

45:14.500 --> 45:16.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
studios are all making
summer movies all

45:16.833 --> 45:18.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
year round now it's
kind of like being

45:18.766 --> 45:19.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Hallmark Channel

45:19.900 --> 45:21.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they make 27 new
Christmas movies a year

45:21.866 --> 45:23.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so they have to start
showing them the

45:23.033 --> 45:25.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
weekend before
Halloween if all the

45:25.200 --> 45:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
studio's make are giant colorful

45:27.400 --> 45:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
explosion filled movies for mass

45:29.366 --> 45:31.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
audiences then all
year has to become

45:31.433 --> 45:34.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
summer so and some
are all year-round

45:34.466 --> 45:37.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
why has the season
expanded and how much

45:37.033 --> 45:39.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is this blockbuster
model running

45:39.300 --> 45:42.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hollywood well the
blockbuster model is

45:42.700 --> 45:45.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
definitely the
dominant business model

45:45.033 --> 45:48.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
although you know
other alternative

45:48.300 --> 45:50.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
business models have
emerged as sort of

45:50.733 --> 45:52.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a counterweight
like the Oscar award

45:52.633 --> 45:54.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
season business model
but definitely the

45:54.400 --> 45:57.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
blockbuster tentpole
model is huge it

45:57.366 --> 45:58.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sort of started out
as a strategy to

45:58.966 --> 46:01.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
attract teenagers
especially teenage

46:01.900 --> 46:04.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
boys to the theaters
now it's really a

46:04.433 --> 46:06.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
way to get foreign
audiences I mean the

46:06.366 --> 46:09.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
foreign foreign
revenues and markets

46:09.600 --> 46:12.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
emerging markets are
hugely important so

46:12.000 --> 46:14.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
these sorts of movies
travel very well

46:14.333 --> 46:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
because they don't they're not

46:15.700 --> 46:17.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
necessarily as
dependent on subtitling

46:17.766 --> 46:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and cultural
understandings and sort of

46:21.933 --> 46:24.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cultural translation
and in terms of

46:24.633 --> 46:26.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
just the expansion
of the year I mean

46:26.433 --> 46:29.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
since everybody
was so desperately

46:29.600 --> 46:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
focused on the summer to kind of

46:31.700 --> 46:34.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
capitalize on vacation
and people being

46:34.533 --> 46:37.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
out of school and
repeat business

46:37.866 --> 46:40.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they've discovered
that they can go

46:40.433 --> 46:42.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
where the other ones
aren't and maybe

46:42.200 --> 46:44.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
make a buck and I
think Disney has

46:44.000 --> 46:45.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
really proven this
out with their

46:45.800 --> 46:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
strategy of bringing out their

46:47.433 --> 46:50.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
live-action
adaptations of animated

46:50.600 --> 46:53.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
classics like
Cinderella and just this

46:53.033 --> 46:54.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
year Beauty and
the Beast and when

46:54.433 --> 46:56.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they've kind of
taken over that March

46:56.433 --> 46:58.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
slot and and really
done quite well with

46:58.700 --> 47:01.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it so Alonso I mean
what do you make of

47:01.366 --> 47:03.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this blockbuster
model because you look

47:03.333 --> 47:07.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at $100 100 million
dollar films 200

47:07.133 --> 47:09.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
million dollar films
they clearly can't

47:09.600 --> 47:11.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and don't make it
there's always flops

47:11.866 --> 47:14.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
how does it work well
you know the idea

47:14.733 --> 47:16.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is that audiences
want to see something

47:16.566 --> 47:17.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they're familiar with
they want you know

47:17.833 --> 47:19.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
intellectual
properties they've seen

47:19.166 --> 47:20.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
before whether it's
a sequel or a remake

47:20.933 --> 47:22.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or an adaptation of
a Saturday morning

47:22.766 --> 47:24.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cartoon and a lot
of those movies do

47:24.933 --> 47:26.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
make money but it
doesn't always work we

47:26.900 --> 47:28.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
had some big flop
sequels last summer

47:28.900 --> 47:31.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the the Independence
Day sequel for one

47:31.233 --> 47:35.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was a big red ink
Spiller but they would

47:35.066 --> 47:36.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
much rather spend
a lot of money on

47:36.866 --> 47:38.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
something they think
is familiar than to

47:38.733 --> 47:40.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gamble on something
completely unknown

47:40.733 --> 47:42.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so let me ask both
of you an you can

47:42.900 --> 47:44.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
start which of
which movies are you

47:44.700 --> 47:47.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
looking forward to
either because you

47:47.000 --> 47:48.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hope they're going
to be good or because

47:48.600 --> 47:50.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it tells you something
about the movie

47:50.633 --> 47:52.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
business itself that
you're that you're

47:52.166 --> 47:54.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
watching so carefully
well I mean I'm

47:54.766 --> 47:57.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
very curious about
Wonder Woman I mean I

47:57.666 --> 47:59.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was one of those many
critics last year

47:59.700 --> 48:01.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that were very
disappointed with Batman

48:01.633 --> 48:04.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
vs Superman and
Suicide Squad I haven't

48:04.233 --> 48:06.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been I haven't been
over the moon about

48:06.700 --> 48:09.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the way Warner Brothers
has handled the

48:09.333 --> 48:12.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DC franchise and
especially the Superman

48:12.133 --> 48:14.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
storylines so I'm
really looking forward

48:14.433 --> 48:16.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to Wonder Woman in
terms of another big

48:16.366 --> 48:18.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
movie my very curious
about Christopher

48:18.600 --> 48:21.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Nolan's Dunkirk
he's done this huge

48:21.066 --> 48:22.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
spectacle about
the evacuation of

48:22.800 --> 48:25.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Dunkirk it's always
interesting to see

48:25.533 --> 48:27.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what Christopher
Nolan is up to because

48:27.200 --> 48:29.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he's a real cinematic
purist and so I

48:29.066 --> 48:31.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think putting him
together with history

48:31.400 --> 48:33.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and spectacle should yield some

48:33.766 --> 48:36.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
interesting results
Alonso start with

48:36.100 --> 48:38.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the big movies first
these blockbuster

48:38.466 --> 48:39.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
types what are you
looking forward to

48:39.833 --> 48:42.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
well in the same way
that Anne and I are

48:42.400 --> 48:43.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
both looking forward
to a Wonder Woman

48:43.700 --> 48:45.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because of the you
know having a new

48:45.933 --> 48:47.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
director in the
chair patty Jenkins

48:47.466 --> 48:49.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
instead of Zack
Snyder or some of the

48:49.233 --> 48:50.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
other one

48:50.366 --> 48:52.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
brothers guys
spider-man homecoming

48:52.533 --> 48:55.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
seize that property
going back into the

48:55.466 --> 48:57.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Disney Marvel family
and so hopefully

48:57.533 --> 48:59.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they'll do a better
job with it than the

48:59.166 --> 49:01.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
last few versions
of that hero we got

49:01.100 --> 49:03.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm also looking
forward to a couple of

49:03.333 --> 49:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
films that premiered at South by

49:04.600 --> 49:05.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Southwest this year
they've been getting

49:05.766 --> 49:07.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a lot of really
positive buzz the rain

49:07.433 --> 49:09.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
atomic blonde which
is an action film

49:09.433 --> 49:11.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
starring Charlize
Theron coming off of

49:11.000 --> 49:14.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mad Max fury road
and another driving

49:14.933 --> 49:18.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
movie Edgar Wright's
baby driver which

49:18.300 --> 49:20.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
got amazing reviews
and people are

49:20.233 --> 49:21.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
really talking a lot
about that one so

49:21.533 --> 49:22.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm hoping that's
going to be something

49:22.800 --> 49:24.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that really adds a
little pep to the

49:24.033 --> 49:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
summer for those of us who want

49:25.866 --> 49:29.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
something less what
can I say loud or

49:29.000 --> 49:30.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
something a little
smaller perhaps

49:30.900 --> 49:34.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
allistic yes what
what might you what

49:34.533 --> 49:36.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
should we look forward
to you know there

49:36.566 --> 49:38.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are some wonderful
smaller movies and

49:38.433 --> 49:40.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's another kind
of counter to the

49:40.033 --> 49:41.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
blockbuster strategy
is that summer is a

49:41.933 --> 49:43.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
great time for counter
programming and

49:43.833 --> 49:46.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
last year we saw
wonderful small movies

49:46.100 --> 49:48.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
like love and
friendship and Captain

49:48.400 --> 49:50.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Fantastic and hell
or high water and I

49:50.633 --> 49:53.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
feel like this summer
another hit from

49:53.266 --> 49:54.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sundance

49:54.500 --> 49:56.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
called the big six
which is just a

49:56.300 --> 49:59.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
charming fact-based
romantic comedy

49:59.500 --> 50:02.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
based on the true
love life of Kumail

50:02.733 --> 50:06.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Nanjiani the Pakistani
American comic

50:06.800 --> 50:10.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's just a really
effecting funny sweet

50:10.366 --> 50:13.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
very sincere very
effecting a little

50:13.033 --> 50:14.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
movie that I think
has potential to

50:14.933 --> 50:16.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
really become a
super hit this summer

50:16.533 --> 50:18.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Alonso you want to
give us one a smaller

50:18.866 --> 50:21.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
run smaller pick
yeah I've got high

50:21.100 --> 50:23.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hopes for Sofia
Coppola the beguil'd

50:23.166 --> 50:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's based on a novel that was

50:25.033 --> 50:26.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
previously turned
into a Clint Eastwood

50:26.300 --> 50:28.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
movie by Don Siegel
back in the 70s but

50:28.300 --> 50:30.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I suspect it under
coppola skies it's

50:30.966 --> 50:33.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to become
more of a film about

50:33.066 --> 50:35.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sort of women in
containment which has

50:35.600 --> 50:37.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been a favorite
theme of hers and it

50:37.533 --> 50:39.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stars Nicole Kidman
Colin Farrell and

50:39.433 --> 50:42.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Kirsten Dunst and so
I'm expecting a lot

50:42.333 --> 50:45.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
okay the all-year-round
summer movie
