SAUDI ARABIA ACTUALLY STARTED   

12:40.056 --> 12:41.482
IN 2010.                        
SAUDI ARABIA ACTUALLY STARTED   
FIGHTING THE HOUTHIS AS WELL SO 

12:41.484 --> 12:43.807

FIGHTING THE HOUTHIS AS WELL SO 
IT'S EASY TO SEE THIS AS SOWDY  

12:43.809 --> 12:45.831
FIGHTING THE HOUTHIS AS WELL SO 
IT'S EASY TO SEE THIS AS SOWDY  
AND IRAN IN SOME SORT OF PROXY

12:47.095 --> 12:48.787
AND IRAN IN SOME SORT OF PROXY  
WAR IN YEMEN.                   
I THINK WHAT'S ACTUALLY MORE    

12:48.789 --> 12:49.982
WAR IN YEMEN.                   
I THINK WHAT'S ACTUALLY MORE    
ACCURATE IS THE HOUTHIS, LIKE   

12:49.984 --> 12:51.509
I THINK WHAT'S ACTUALLY MORE    
ACCURATE IS THE HOUTHIS, LIKE   
MOST GROUPS WITHIN YEMEN, WILL  

12:51.511 --> 12:53.633
ACCURATE IS THE HOUTHIS, LIKE   
MOST GROUPS WITHIN YEMEN, WILL  
OPEN THEIR HANDS AND TAKE MONEY

FROM ANYONE.                    
SO THE HOUTHIS CERTAINLY GET    

12:55.959 --> 12:57.584
FROM ANYONE.                    
SO THE HOUTHIS CERTAINLY GET    
SUPPORT FROM IRAN, BUT THAT     

12:57.586 --> 12:59.012
SO THE HOUTHIS CERTAINLY GET    
SUPPORT FROM IRAN, BUT THAT     
SUPPORT DOESN'T NECESSARILY     

12:59.014 --> 13:00.008
SUPPORT FROM IRAN, BUT THAT     
SUPPORT DOESN'T NECESSARILY     
CHANGE THEIR MEANS.             

13:00.010 --> 13:01.534
SUPPORT DOESN'T NECESSARILY     
CHANGE THEIR MEANS.             
THEY JUST TAKE THE MONEY AND DO 

13:01.536 --> 13:03.361
CHANGE THEIR MEANS.             
THEY JUST TAKE THE MONEY AND DO 
WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEY WERE
