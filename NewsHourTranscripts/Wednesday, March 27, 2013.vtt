IN FACT, SHE FOLLOWED UP BY
READING SPECIFICALLY FROM THE

13:12.516 --> 13:16.654

THAT THE WHOLE STATUTE WAS BASED
ON THAT, THEN IT SHOULD STRIKE

REACH FURTHER IN MANY CASES,
RIGHT?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

40:47.179 --> 40:48.914
RIGHT?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
SO THE-- AS SOON AS WE FOUND

40:48.916 --> 40:50.650
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
SO THE-- AS SOON AS WE FOUND
THIS OUT, WE THOUGHT, WELL, WHY

40:50.652 --> 40:52.788
SO THE-- AS SOON AS WE FOUND
THIS OUT, WE THOUGHT, WELL, WHY
ARE THEY NOT APPLYING?

40:52.790 --> 40:54.190
THIS OUT, WE THOUGHT, WELL, WHY
ARE THEY NOT APPLYING?
IF THESE STUDENTS COULD GET IN,

40:54.192 --> 40:55.025
ARE THEY NOT APPLYING?
IF THESE STUDENTS COULD GET IN,
WHAT IS THE EXPLANATION FOR WHY

40:55.027 --> 40:56.027
IF THESE STUDENTS COULD GET IN,
WHAT IS THE EXPLANATION FOR WHY
THEY'RE NOT APPLYING?

40:56.029 --> 40:58.365
WHAT IS THE EXPLANATION FOR WHY
THEY'RE NOT APPLYING?
WE TRIED TO ELIMINATE SOME

40:58.367 --> 40:58.799
THEY'RE NOT APPLYING?
WE TRIED TO ELIMINATE SOME
EXPLANATIONS.

40:58.801 --> 41:00.201
WE TRIED TO ELIMINATE SOME
EXPLANATIONS.
AND THE FIRST ONE WE LOOKED AT

41:00.203 --> 41:02.872
EXPLANATIONS.
AND THE FIRST ONE WE LOOKED AT
WAS, WELL, ARE THEY NOT ABLE TO

41:02.874 --> 41:04.509
AND THE FIRST ONE WE LOOKED AT
WAS, WELL, ARE THEY NOT ABLE TO
AFFORD THESE VERY SELECTIVE

41:04.511 --> 41:05.545
WAS, WELL, ARE THEY NOT ABLE TO
AFFORD THESE VERY SELECTIVE
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES?

41:05.547 --> 41:08.049
AFFORD THESE VERY SELECTIVE
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES?
BUT INTEREST WILL ENOUGH, FOR

41:08.051 --> 41:08.884
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES?
BUT INTEREST WILL ENOUGH, FOR
HIGH-ACHIEVING STUDENTS, THE

41:08.886 --> 41:10.220
BUT INTEREST WILL ENOUGH, FOR
HIGH-ACHIEVING STUDENTS, THE
MORE SELECTIVE THE UNIVERSITY

41:10.222 --> 41:12.257
HIGH-ACHIEVING STUDENTS, THE
MORE SELECTIVE THE UNIVERSITY
THEY ATTEND, THE LESS THEY WILL

41:12.259 --> 41:12.658
MORE SELECTIVE THE UNIVERSITY
THEY ATTEND, THE LESS THEY WILL
PAY.

41:12.660 --> 41:13.860
THEY ATTEND, THE LESS THEY WILL
PAY.
SO THESE STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY

41:13.862 --> 41:16.331
PAY.
SO THESE STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY
OFTEN PAYING MORE TO ATTEND A

41:16.333 --> 41:18.435
SO THESE STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY
OFTEN PAYING MORE TO ATTEND A
COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR A

41:18.437 --> 41:19.470

SO THAT'S REALLY NOT THE

41:23.947 --> 41:24.346
HARVARD, YALE, OR PRINCETON.
SO THAT'S REALLY NOT THE
EXPLANATION.

41:24.348 --> 41:25.782
SO THAT'S REALLY NOT THE
EXPLANATION.

41:40.210 --> 41:41.344
STUDENTS KNOW?
>> WE THINK-- WE HYPOTHESIZE THE
REASON THE STUDENTS DON'T KNOW

41:41.346 --> 41:46.019
>> WE THINK-- WE HYPOTHESIZE THE
REASON THE STUDENTS DON'T KNOW
IS THAT THE LOW-INCOME,

41:46.021 --> 41:46.954
