JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, to our
"NewsHour" Shares, something
that caught our eye that

00:03.666 --> 00:06.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we thought might be of
interest to you, too.

00:06.666 --> 00:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Boston's inner city often sees
a spike in violence during
the summer, when many students

00:11.433 --> 00:13.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are out of school
and on the streets.

00:13.633 --> 00:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But as Tina Martin from PBS
station WGBH reports, one mother
is trying to change that trend

00:20.066 --> 00:22.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by exposing young
people to the outdoors.

00:22.333 --> 00:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Amid trees,
chirping birds and rugged rocks,
it wasn't always easy to do,

00:31.066 --> 00:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but Judith Foster smiles
as she leads her group on a
three-mile walk through the Blue

00:35.633 --> 00:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hills Reservation in Milton.

00:37.633 --> 00:39.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The walks are part
of her HERO group.

00:39.466 --> 00:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDITH FOSTER, HERO: Healing,
empathy, redemption, oasis.

00:41.800 --> 00:46.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Foster started
the walks as a way to
heal from her own tragedy.

00:46.066 --> 00:51.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDITH FOSTER: About 8:00 in
the morning or so, I got home
from work, and that was the

00:53.133 --> 00:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
news I got home to, that
my son had been murdered.

00:56.100 --> 01:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Four years ago,
Judith's youngest child, Paul,
a senior at a college in North

01:03.166 --> 01:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Carolina, was shot and killed
at a nightclub, just few weeks
before he was set to graduate

01:07.466 --> 01:09.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with a degree in
computer science.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Paul's murder is still
under investigation.

01:11.866 --> 01:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But during her time of loss and
grief, Judith says she found
solace in walking the Blue

01:16.733 --> 01:18.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Hills.

01:18.800 --> 01:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDITH FOSTER: He had a love
of nature, and I thought by
being doing this, being close

01:21.533 --> 01:23.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to nature, I would
be close to him.

01:23.733 --> 01:26.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TINA MARTIN: So, every
Saturday, she invites
people to walk with her.

01:26.800 --> 01:30.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BAKARI JOHNSON, Walker: We
have to do something to break
the cycle, break the mold.

01:30.700 --> 01:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nobody would think is
something that would be
fun at the end of the day.

01:33.500 --> 01:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You think nature walk, you are
thinking, oh, come on, this
is some tree hugger stuff.

01:36.233 --> 01:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, at the end of the
day, anybody can do it
and anybody can enjoy it.

01:39.133 --> 01:43.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TINA MARTIN:
Twenty-five-year-old Bakari
Johnson uses the walks to
get away from the noise

01:43.166 --> 01:44.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the city.

01:44.733 --> 01:46.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He hopes to keep walking
all summer to stay
away from trouble.

01:46.933 --> 01:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BAKARI JOHNSON: It is a worry,
but, personally, I feel like
I have been not just lucky so

01:53.033 --> 01:55.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
far.

01:55.033 --> 01:56.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I feel like part of the reason
I'm still here is because
I have also been smart.

01:56.666 --> 01:58.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDITH FOSTER: And
don't be afraid to touch
the trees, the leaves.

01:58.633 --> 02:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PASTOR MARK SCOTT, Co-Chair,
Boston Youth Violence Reduction
Task Force: It's really

02:00.433 --> 02:02.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
simple, right?

02:02.966 --> 02:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we're doing is
taking a walk in nature,
which is a tremendous
resource that is available

02:07.133 --> 02:08.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to us.

02:08.133 --> 02:10.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're doing it with friends.

02:10.166 --> 02:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Pastor Mark Scott,
co-chair of the Boston Youth
Violence Reduction Task Force,

02:12.966 --> 02:17.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hopes, as it gets hotter and
violence spikes, young people
will choose to take a few steps

02:18.700 --> 02:20.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to keep the peace.

02:20.800 --> 02:23.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PASTOR MARK SCOTT:
We're constantly being
hit and bombarded by
this kind of violence,

02:23.766 --> 02:26.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and we have to react
to it every time.

02:26.266 --> 02:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there are things that we
can do, traditions that we can
create, like coming out on 12:00

02:31.033 --> 02:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
noon a Saturday to take a
walk in the woods that are
right next to your city.

02:35.333 --> 02:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: The HERO group
gets bigger as the weeks go by.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The walks are free
and open to anyone.

02:41.500 --> 02:43.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Judith believes her
son Paul would approve.

02:43.633 --> 02:45.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDITH FOSTER: He's smiling.

02:45.066 --> 02:47.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's loving it.

02:47.100 --> 02:51.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I find strength in knowing
that I'm doing something
that he loved to do.

02:51.100 --> 02:55.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm Tina Martin
in Milton, Massachusetts.
