JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other major story: One headline
in London said it all, "Mayhem,"

00:07.133 --> 00:10.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the morning after a ballot
box drubbing for British Prime
Minister Theresa May and her

00:11.300 --> 00:12.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Conservative Party.

00:12.533 --> 00:15.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Special correspondent
Malcolm Brabant reports.

00:15.100 --> 00:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: It was a
painful reckoning for a prime
minister whose election gamble

00:20.966 --> 00:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
failed in a stunning fashion.

00:22.900 --> 00:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But after meeting with
the queen, Theresa May
insisted she will carry on.

00:26.066 --> 00:30.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
THERESA MAY, British
Prime Minister: I will
now form a government,
a government that can

00:30.533 --> 00:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
provide certainty and lead
Britain forward at this
critical time for our country.

00:37.700 --> 00:41.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: May had
hoped the snap election
would boost Conservative
dominance in Parliament,

00:43.333 --> 00:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and give her a stronger hand
in negotiating Britain's
exit with the European Union.

00:46.400 --> 00:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Instead, the Tories lost 13
seats in the House of Commons.

00:50.533 --> 00:54.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The opposition Labor
Party, led by Jeremy
Corbyn, gained 32 seats.

00:54.333 --> 00:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THERESA MAY: I had wanted to
achieve a larger majority, but
that wasn't the result that

00:59.966 --> 01:02.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we secured.

01:02.166 --> 01:05.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, as I reflect on the
results, I will reflect
on what we need to do
in the future to take

01:08.233 --> 01:10.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the party forward.

01:10.233 --> 01:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: At Westminster,
a demonstrator wearing a May
mask laid flowers on a mock

01:13.633 --> 01:17.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
grave, amid rising calls for
the prime minister to resign.

01:17.866 --> 01:20.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Labor leader Corbyn
led the charge.

01:20.333 --> 01:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEREMY CORBYN, Leader, Labor
Party: It was her campaign,
it was her decision to call

01:23.933 --> 01:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the election, it was her name
out there, and she was saying
she was doing it to bring about

01:28.933 --> 01:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
strong and stable government.

01:30.933 --> 01:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, this morning, it doesn't
look like a strong government,
it doesn't look like a

01:34.200 --> 01:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stable government, it doesn't
look like a government that
has any program whatsoever.

01:37.533 --> 01:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Corbyn's
success came in part from
cooperating with the grassroots

01:41.466 --> 01:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaign normalization
momentum, which took advice
from Bernie Sanders' volunteers.

01:47.600 --> 01:49.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Adam Klug is a
national organizer.

01:49.666 --> 01:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADAM KLUG, National Organizer:
You build up relationships
with people on the doorstep.

01:50.933 --> 01:52.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You listen to them.

01:52.966 --> 01:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You communicate your ideas
effectively and help train
people on persuading people of

01:57.100 --> 01:59.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
why Labor's policies made sense.

01:59.266 --> 02:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But May's
opponents aren't the only
ones questioning her role.

02:02.533 --> 02:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Anna Soubry is a Conservative
member of Parliament.

02:04.733 --> 02:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNA SOUBRY, Parliament Member:
This is a very bad moment
for the Conservative Party

02:08.766 --> 02:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and we need to take stock,
and our leader needs
to take stock as well.

02:12.600 --> 02:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Will
Conservatives go as far as
removing May from power?

02:17.033 --> 02:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Anand Menon, a professor at
King's College London, says it
depends on several key factors.

02:21.633 --> 02:25.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANAND MENON, King's College
London: Firstly, the
availability of someone
else who can command

02:25.066 --> 02:30.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
support in the party, secondly,
the scale of opposition in the
party to her, and, thirdly,

02:32.133 --> 02:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether or not the members of
the parliamentary party think
it's better to try and get rid

02:34.600 --> 02:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of her now or have a
period of calm where
things can bed themselves
in after the election,

02:40.766 --> 02:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
before maybe trying to do a
leadership election next year.

02:42.733 --> 02:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: May has
been criticized for running
a lackluster campaign.

02:46.300 --> 02:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was marked by a proposal
to force elderly people to pay
more for their care and her

02:51.233 --> 02:54.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
decision to skip a
televised debate.

02:54.966 --> 02:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then came the terror attacks
in Manchester and London, which
refocused the race on security,

03:01.166 --> 03:03.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and May's role in
cutting police ranks.

03:03.300 --> 03:05.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And there's Brexit.

03:05.266 --> 03:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.K.'s withdrawal talks
with the E.U. are due to
begin in just 10 days.

03:08.500 --> 03:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN SPRINGFORD, Center for
European Reform: This was
certainly a rejection of Theresa

03:11.466 --> 03:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
May's very tough Brexit strategy
where she was going to cleave
a lot of the links between

03:16.433 --> 03:18.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the U.K. and the E.U.

03:18.466 --> 03:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: John Springford
is director of research at the
Center for European Reform.

03:21.800 --> 03:26.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN SPRINGFORD: There's
only about 18 months
left to negotiate the
Brexit deal, and if,

03:28.633 --> 03:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say, we have another three
or four months while the
government is formed or we have

03:33.066 --> 03:36.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
fresh elections, then
there's much less time.

03:36.166 --> 03:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the E.U. then has an
awful lot of power towards the
end of the negotiating process.

03:40.533 --> 03:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: For now,
May needs a coalition
partner to form a governing
majority in Parliament,

03:45.400 --> 03:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
most likely Northern Ireland's
Democratic Unionist Party.

03:48.233 --> 03:53.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The group is pro-Brexit,
but well to the right
on social issues.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's broad agreement
across the political
spectrum that Theresa
May is living on borrowed

03:58.500 --> 04:00.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

04:00.633 --> 04:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Labor Party believes that
her coalition of convenience
with Northern Ireland's DUP

04:03.833 --> 04:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is unsustainable and that
there will be a new general
election in the not-too-distant

04:09.300 --> 04:11.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
future.

04:11.300 --> 04:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mrs. May wants to remain in
office for the next five years,
but most analysts agree that

04:14.566 --> 04:19.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Conservative establishment
will terminate her premiership
when the time is right and

04:19.200 --> 04:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they will select another
candidate to lead them into the
next general election -- Judy.

04:24.033 --> 04:27.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Malcolm
Brabant, in London.
