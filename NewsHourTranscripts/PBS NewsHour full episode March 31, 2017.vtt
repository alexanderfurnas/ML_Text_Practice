JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.205 --> 00:07.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.074 --> 00:10.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight, we
take a deep
dive into the many questions
about connections

00:11.011 --> 00:17.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between Russian officials and
the Trump campaign,
as investigations move forward
and new revelations

00:17.684 --> 00:19.486 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
surface.

00:19.519 --> 00:24.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, we visit the Midwest to
find out what
Trump supporters in Michigan are
saying about

00:24.391 --> 00:25.826 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his first two months in office.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THERESA JOHNS, Trump Supporter:
What he has
said is the truth.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I don't think that he has
reason to lie.

00:30.631 --> 00:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What does he have to gain by
lying?

00:33.100 --> 00:34.868 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Nothing.

00:34.902 --> 00:39.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead, in
the final part
of our series exploring new PTSD
research:

00:39.640 --> 00:44.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how explosions from battle may
have a direct
link to the causes of PTSD.

00:44.211 --> 00:45.913 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

00:45.946 --> 00:46.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL PERL, Uniformed Services
University
of the Health Sciences: When the
explosion

00:46.947 --> 00:50.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
goes off, it forms what's called
a blast wave.

00:50.517 --> 00:56.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so here you have a high --
high-pressure
pulse blasting through this
delicate instrument

00:56.657 --> 00:57.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
called the brain.

00:57.658 --> 00:59.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.

00:59.459 --> 01:03.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks
are here to
analyze the week's news.

01:03.630 --> 01:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:05.966 --> 01:10.270 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:10.304 --> 01:23.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The request for
legal immunity
from President Trump's former
national security

01:23.283 --> 01:26.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
adviser drew sharply different
responses today.

01:26.887 --> 01:31.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michael Flynn said he will
cooperate with
congressional Russia probes, but
only if he's

01:31.758 --> 01:34.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spared from the possibility of
prosecution.

01:34.928 --> 01:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump tweeted Flynn should
ask for immunity
because -- quote -- "This is a
witch-hunt

01:40.434 --> 01:42.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by the media and Democrats."

01:42.736 --> 01:47.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But Adam Schiff, the top
Democrat on the House
Intelligence Committee, said
it's too early

01:47.674 --> 01:49.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to consider such a deal.

01:49.309 --> 01:54.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will take a closer look at
the investigations
right after the news summary.

01:54.381 --> 01:59.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump moved to reshape
American
trade policy today, signing a
pair of executive

01:59.419 --> 02:00.387 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
orders.

02:00.420 --> 02:03.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One initiates a review of U.S.
trade deficits.

02:03.323 --> 02:07.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other looks to increase the
collection
of duties on imports.

02:07.194 --> 02:11.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump said the orders --
quote -- "set
the stage for a great revival of
American

02:11.732 --> 02:13.967 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
manufacturing."

02:14.001 --> 02:19.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson
today warned
NATO allies to boost their
defense spending

02:19.039 --> 02:21.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
within the next two months.

02:21.074 --> 02:25.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During Tillerson's first meeting
with his
alliance counterparts in
Brussels, he said

02:25.545 --> 02:30.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Washington is contributing a --
quote -- "disproportionate
share" to defense.

02:30.817 --> 02:36.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Germany's foreign minister,
Sigmar Gabriel,
balked at the call, saying that
NATO's spending

02:36.590 --> 02:40.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
targets are neither -- quote --
"reachable
nor desirable."

02:40.961 --> 02:46.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's word that the European
Union may be
open to talks later this year on
its future

02:46.133 --> 02:48.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
relationship with Britain.

02:48.168 --> 02:52.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But draft guidelines issued
today say that
the British -- quote --
"disentanglement"

02:52.773 --> 02:55.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from the bloc must be settled
first.

02:55.842 --> 03:01.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa
May wanted
talks on a future trade deal
with the E.U.

03:01.548 --> 03:03.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to start quickly.

03:03.483 --> 03:08.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But in Malta today, the
president of the European
council, Donald Tusk, said that
won't happen.

03:08.889 --> 03:13.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TUSK, European Council
President: Once,
and only once we have achieved
sufficient

03:13.493 --> 03:20.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
progress on the withdrawal can
we discuss
the framework for our future
relationship.

03:20.801 --> 03:27.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Starting parallel talks on all
issues at the
same time, as suggested by some
in the U.K.,

03:27.607 --> 03:29.376 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
will not happen.

03:29.409 --> 03:34.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile,
Scotland's first
minister has formally requested
a second popular

03:34.748 --> 03:40.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
referendum on its independence
from the U.K.
Britain's government has said
that it will

03:40.053 --> 03:41.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
deny the request.

03:41.788 --> 03:47.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Venezuela, violence erupted
today amid
the country's deepening
political crisis.

03:47.260 --> 03:52.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It followed the Supreme Court's
move to dissolve
the country's opposition-led
congress, a move

03:52.599 --> 03:54.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
widely condemned as a power
grab.

03:54.968 --> 04:00.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the capital, Caracas, scores
of students
squared off against police in
riot gear, who

04:00.607 --> 04:03.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
retaliated with batons and
buckshot.

04:03.276 --> 04:06.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A number of people were
arrested.

04:06.346 --> 04:12.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Pakistan, a suicide car bomb
near a Shiite
mosque today killed at least 24
people.

04:12.519 --> 04:17.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It happened in a key northwest
town near the
country's border with
Afghanistan.

04:17.224 --> 04:20.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The powerful explosion damaged
vehicles and
nearby shops.

04:20.927 --> 04:23.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
More than 100 people were
wounded.

04:23.563 --> 04:27.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A breakaway Taliban faction
claimed responsibility.

04:27.767 --> 04:32.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trump administration imposed
a new round
of sanctions on North Korea
today.

04:32.606 --> 04:37.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They targeted 11 North Korean
individuals
and one company that helped to
finance or

04:37.944 --> 04:40.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
develop weapons of mass
destruction.

04:40.113 --> 04:45.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Treasury Department said the
people were
working as agents of the North
Korean regime

04:45.652 --> 04:49.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Russia, China, Vietnam, and
Cuba.

04:49.723 --> 04:55.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, traffic
was snarled
for miles in Atlanta today,
after a fire brought

04:55.395 --> 04:60.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
caused the collapse of part of
heavily traveled
Interstate 85.

05:00.033 --> 05:04.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officials are still trying to
determine how
yesterday's fire started.

05:04.271 --> 05:08.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Authorities closed the section
before it collapsed,
and there were no injuries.

05:08.875 --> 05:15.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But commuters in this densely
populated area
will likely have to find new
routes for months.

05:15.782 --> 05:18.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Wall Street, stocks ended the
month on
a down note.

05:18.518 --> 05:24.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 65 points
to close at 20663.

05:24.524 --> 05:28.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell more than two,
and the S&amp;P
500 slipped five.

05:29.029 --> 05:33.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the week, both the Dow and
the S&amp;P 500
gained a fraction of a percent.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose more than a
percent.

05:36.203 --> 05:42.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The private company SpaceX made
history last
night by successfully launching
and retrieving

05:42.676 --> 05:45.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
its first recycled rocket.

05:45.078 --> 05:50.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rocket boosters normally drop
into the Atlantic
Ocean after liftoff and are not
retrieved.

05:50.350 --> 05:55.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was the Falcon 9 booster's
second trip
into orbit, launching from Cape
Canaveral,

05:55.789 --> 05:57.457 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Florida.

05:57.490 --> 06:02.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It landed on the bullseye of an
ocean platform
and it could be used a third
time.

06:02.729 --> 06:08.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a rare photo of Harriet
Tubman has been
acquired at auction by the
Library of Congress

06:08.969 --> 06:14.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the Smithsonian's National
Museum of African
American History and Culture.

06:14.774 --> 06:17.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It shows a younger seated
Tubman.

06:17.944 --> 06:22.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most photos of the Underground
Railroad hero
were taken later in her life.

06:22.616 --> 06:28.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was part of an album that
sold for more
than $160,000.

06:28.188 --> 06:33.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what do we
know and don't know about
Russia's influence

06:33.260 --> 06:39.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the 2016 election?; the
potential human
toll of the U.S. loosening
restrictions on

06:39.933 --> 06:46.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
military airstrikes; Trump
supporters grade
the president on his first
months in office;

06:46.506 --> 06:52.345 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and much more.

06:52.379 --> 07:02.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It seems every
day, sometimes
every hour, there are new
developments in

07:02.088 --> 07:07.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the inquiry into connections
between President
Trump, his associates and
Russia.

07:07.494 --> 07:09.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's hard to keep it all
straight.

07:09.129 --> 07:12.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, because it's important,
we're going to
give it a try.

07:12.198 --> 07:16.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here to talk through what we
know, and what
we don't, are correspondents
John Yang and

07:16.936 --> 07:18.571 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Lisa Desjardins.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And thank you both for being
here to do this.

07:20.507 --> 07:22.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa, I'm going to start with
you.

07:22.208 --> 07:24.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Remind us, where did all this
come from?

07:24.611 --> 07:27.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What was the origin of Russia's
interest in
our elections?

07:28.014 --> 07:29.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Let's start
with 2011.

07:29.949 --> 07:34.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's when Hillary Clinton, the
then secretary
of state, spoke out criticizing
Russian elections.

07:35.021 --> 07:40.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vladimir Putin, president of
Russia, then
reacted, saying that she was
interfering and

07:40.694 --> 07:45.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she was helping protesters, and
she was trying
to have an impact on the Russian
election.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then we can flash forward to
last summer.

07:47.500 --> 07:52.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's when the FBI became aware
of hacking
into the Democratic National
Committee, then

07:52.238 --> 07:54.107 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to October.

07:54.140 --> 07:57.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then we have a conclusion from
the director
of national intelligence that
Russian officials

07:57.110 --> 08:00.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were in fact trying to interfere
with our
election.

08:00.914 --> 08:05.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then just this month, we
heard from FBI
Director Comey about their
investigation,

08:05.452 --> 08:07.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
making this rare public
statement:

08:07.420 --> 08:13.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY, FBI Director: The
FBI, as part
of our counterintelligence
mission, is investigating

08:13.660 --> 08:19.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Russian government's efforts
to interfere
in the 2016 presidential
election.

08:19.499 --> 08:24.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that includes investigating
the nature
of any links between individuals
associated

08:24.938 --> 08:27.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the Trump campaign and the
Russian government.

08:27.674 --> 08:31.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: A very rare
statement in
the middle of an investigation.

08:31.311 --> 08:36.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bottom line, Judy, we know that
our intelligence
on the U.S. side has concluded
that Russia

08:36.049 --> 08:38.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tried to interfere with the
election.

08:38.084 --> 08:43.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that includes now they're
investigating
things like trying to send fake
news to particular

08:43.656 --> 08:46.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
states like Michigan and
Pennsylvania.

08:46.126 --> 08:50.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The biggest question now seems
to be, was
the Trump -- were any Trump
associates, any

08:50.797 --> 08:54.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Trump campaign officials
involved, did they
know about this, did they
collude with Russia

08:54.601 --> 08:56.369 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at all?

08:56.403 --> 09:01.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, John, what
is known about
any links, any connections
between Trump,

09:01.307 --> 09:03.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump's campaign and Russian
officials?

09:03.109 --> 09:04.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It is a spider web,
Judy.

09:04.978 --> 09:09.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have got campaign officials
who either
had or have business relations
with Russia

09:09.482 --> 09:13.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like former campaign chairman
Paul Manafort,
adviser Carter Page.

09:13.820 --> 09:18.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You had others in the campaign
who were in
contact with the Russian
ambassador to the

09:18.391 --> 09:23.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States either during the
campaign or
during the transition, adviser
J.D. Gordon,

09:23.463 --> 09:28.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his son-in-law, Jared Kushner,
former National
Security Adviser Michael Flynn,
and Attorney

09:28.601 --> 09:32.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
General Jeff Sessions, Sessions,
of course,
who's recused himself from this
investigation

09:33.006 --> 09:34.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
because of that contact.

09:34.841 --> 09:40.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then there's Roger Stone,
who somehow
got advanced word about these
hacked Hillary

09:40.180 --> 09:46.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton e-mails, e-mails that
the -- our United
States intelligence says came
from the Russian

09:46.820 --> 09:48.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
intelligence, was hacked by the
Russian intelligence.

09:48.621 --> 09:51.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now, could this all be a
coincidence?

09:51.124 --> 09:55.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sure, but a lot of these people
have been
less than forthcoming about
these contacts.

09:55.562 --> 10:01.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, just last month, Judy,
you asked Carter
Page whether he had met any
Russian official

10:01.234 --> 10:02.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
during the campaign.

10:02.235 --> 10:03.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Did you have any
meetings?

10:04.003 --> 10:05.939 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'll ask again.

10:05.972 --> 10:10.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Did you have any meetings last
year with Russian
officials in Russia, outside
Russia, anywhere?

10:10.176 --> 10:13.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARTER PAGE, Former Trump
Campaign Foreign
Policy Adviser: I had no
meetings, no meetings.

10:13.313 --> 10:16.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, of course,
eventually, he
acknowledged that wasn't true.

10:16.916 --> 10:19.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He met the ambassador at the
Republican Convention.

10:19.052 --> 10:22.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And he said that
after he had
told me just the opposite.

10:22.288 --> 10:27.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Lisa, what about financial
connections
between the president, people
around him and

10:27.961 --> 10:29.863 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Russia?

10:29.896 --> 10:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The president
was, for so
much of his life, the CEO of the
Trump Organization.

10:33.833 --> 10:37.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, let's look at the business
side of the
Trump Organization here to
Russia.

10:37.570 --> 10:41.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House stresses that
there are few
direct connections.

10:41.841 --> 10:45.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One, the president has sold some
real estate
to a few Russians.

10:45.378 --> 10:49.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, two, probably the
connection most people
know about is that Mr. Trump
hosted the Miss

10:49.516 --> 10:51.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Universe Pageant in Moscow.

10:51.584 --> 10:54.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That was in 2013.

10:54.153 --> 10:58.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there's more to it than
that, some more
indirect kind of connections.

10:58.424 --> 11:05.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that among the other
business ties,
Donald J. Trump Jr. said in 2008
that, of

11:05.565 --> 11:09.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their businesses all across the
board, that
Russians were pouring in money.

11:09.802 --> 11:13.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He thought that the Russians
were among their
most important clients at that
time.

11:13.072 --> 11:15.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, Russia was emerging as an
important economy
then.

11:15.742 --> 11:17.510 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, make of that what you will.

11:17.544 --> 11:22.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, second, the Trumps have
looked into real
estate deals in Russia going
back to 1987.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump visited Russia in
1996.

11:24.417 --> 11:30.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then on that 2013 trip, he
also looked
for potential sites for a Trump
Hotel in Moscow.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That never came to bear.

11:32.091 --> 11:35.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Finally, last summer, it's a
story people
paid attention to that adds to
the confusion

11:36.029 --> 11:37.830 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

11:37.864 --> 11:42.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know there are reports from
CNN and others
that investigators looked into a
Russian bank

11:42.569 --> 11:46.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
repeatedly trying to contact
servers in Trump
Organization.

11:46.306 --> 11:50.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Trump Organization says they
didn't know
anything about that.

11:50.076 --> 11:53.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's not clear if that was
for business
reasons or what was going on
there.

11:53.813 --> 11:58.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a one-way connection, but
many of them
from a Russian bank to the Trump
Organization.

11:58.952 --> 12:01.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One final connection, Judy,
family businesses?

12:01.821 --> 12:04.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Kushners also have a family
business,
Kushner Properties.

12:04.490 --> 12:06.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's the
son-in-law.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's Jared
Kushner, the
son-in-law, that we have heard
about from

12:08.561 --> 12:10.430 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
John.

12:10.463 --> 12:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he -- Jared Kushner, in
addition to meeting
with the Russian ambassador,
also in December

12:13.733 --> 12:18.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
met with the head of a Russian
bank which
is under sanctions right now.

12:18.204 --> 12:22.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House says that was a
diplomatic
meeting, but the Russian bank
says it was

12:22.342 --> 12:23.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for business reasons.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it's something to look at.

12:25.144 --> 12:26.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, John, the
other -- one
of the other names you
mentioned, of course,

12:26.980 --> 12:29.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Michael Flynn, so much attention
around him.

12:29.449 --> 12:32.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was briefly the president's
national security
adviser.

12:32.785 --> 12:34.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Then he stepped down.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's known about his role in
all this?

12:36.322 --> 12:39.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, right now, he
of course has
asked -- or told the Senate
Intelligence Committee

12:39.826 --> 12:42.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that he's willing to testify if
he gets immunity.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The committee rejected that
request for now.

12:45.898 --> 12:52.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said it's too early, that
they generally
like to find out what they can
without immunity

12:52.505 --> 12:53.539 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
first.

12:53.573 --> 12:57.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was a surrogate and an
adviser in the campaign.

12:57.310 --> 13:02.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He became well-known for both
attacking Hillary
Clinton in the campaign and
advocating closer

13:02.649 --> 13:04.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ties with Russia.

13:04.083 --> 13:09.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as you say, he was very
briefly the national
security adviser.

13:09.188 --> 13:14.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had to resign after it turned
out he had
misled White House officials
about some of

13:14.093 --> 13:17.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his contacts with the Russian
ambassador during
the transition.

13:18.031 --> 13:23.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, his attorney says he
certainly has quite
a story to tell.

13:23.736 --> 13:27.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's not quite clear what
that story is
or who it's about.

13:27.240 --> 13:31.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This morning, the president
tweeted that he
thought that Flynn should get
immunity and

13:31.344 --> 13:33.112 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
should testify.

13:33.146 --> 13:37.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This afternoon at the White
House briefing,
Sean Spicer was asked if the
president had

13:37.383 --> 13:39.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anything to fear from that
testimony.

13:39.619 --> 13:41.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sean Spicer had a one-word
answer: "Nope."

13:41.988 --> 13:44.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, well,
so much to
follow.

13:44.791 --> 13:46.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Where does this go from here,
though, Lisa?

13:46.125 --> 13:47.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: All right,
let's look forward
a little bit.

13:47.994 --> 13:52.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We know there are three
investigations under
way right now that we know.

13:52.098 --> 13:56.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is FBI investigation, the
House Intelligence
investigation and the Senate
Intelligence

13:56.903 --> 13:58.137 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investigation.

13:58.171 --> 14:01.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We expect all of those to take
months, maybe
many months.

14:01.340 --> 14:05.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that brings us, I think, to
our final
name of this look at the who's
who in this

14:05.645 --> 14:07.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Russia situation.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's Devin Nunes.

14:09.182 --> 14:13.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The congressman from California
chairs the
House Intelligence Committee and
their Russian

14:13.119 --> 14:14.887 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investigation.

14:14.921 --> 14:18.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the past two weeks, he said
he was made
aware of intelligence from a
source that he's

14:18.057 --> 14:26.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
not naming that U.S. spy
agencies somehow
caught surveillance of some
Trump associates

14:26.499 --> 14:30.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and some Trump White House
officials potentially
inadvertently.

14:30.770 --> 14:34.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He took that information and
talked -- spoke
to the president about it, but
didn't share

14:34.574 --> 14:36.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that with his own Intelligence
Committee.

14:36.809 --> 14:40.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is raising questions,
especially from
Democrats, who are calling for
him to recuse

14:40.113 --> 14:41.547 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
himself.

14:41.581 --> 14:42.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But he said it
didn't have
to do with Russia, right?

14:42.582 --> 14:43.549 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.618 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's right.

14:45.651 --> 14:50.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But because he's chairing this
Russia investigation,
the question is, is he too close
to the president,

14:50.056 --> 14:51.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who's he watching out for the
most?

14:51.924 --> 14:54.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats say he has a conflict
of interests.

14:54.794 --> 14:58.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, Mr. Nunes said
to me and to
other reporters that, no, he
feels like he

14:58.998 --> 15:00.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
can chair this investigation.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And now, of course,
this has embroiled
the White House in the
suspicions that the

15:04.036 --> 15:08.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
administration was the source of
this information
for Congressman Nunes.

15:08.608 --> 15:12.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This afternoon, Adam Schiff, the
top Democrat
on the Intelligence Committee,
went to the

15:12.245 --> 15:16.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House to look at documents
that the
White House says they have
uncovered that

15:16.849 --> 15:20.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
relates to this coincidental or
incidental
surveillance.

15:21.020 --> 15:25.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not clear yet whether or
not this is
the same material that Chairman
Nunes was

15:25.792 --> 15:27.126 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
shown.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And, again, the
material
might not be about Russia.

15:28.461 --> 15:31.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a question of the man
leading the Russia
investigation.

15:31.264 --> 15:35.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There are so many
strands in
this story to follow.

15:35.701 --> 15:37.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The two of you are on the case.

15:37.970 --> 15:39.172 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We thank you.

15:39.205 --> 15:41.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I feel like we have brought
our audience
up to date.

15:42.008 --> 15:43.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

15:43.142 --> 15:54.120 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins, John Yang,
thank you.

15:54.153 --> 16:02.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
During the presidential
campaign, candidate
Trump promised to give the U.S.
military more

16:02.562 --> 16:05.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
freedom to attack terrorist
targets around
the world.

16:05.932 --> 16:10.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yesterday, it was announced that
President
Trump made good on that promise.

16:10.269 --> 16:12.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has the story.

16:12.104 --> 16:16.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Among the
countries where
the U.S. is fighting terrorism
are Iraq, Yemen

16:16.442 --> 16:18.211 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Somalia.

16:18.244 --> 16:22.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now the president has approved
the Pentagon's
plan to beef up its targeting of
Al-Shabaab

16:22.548 --> 16:27.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Somalia, giving the military
greater latitude
to decide when and where to
strike.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more on all of this, we turn
to Sarah
Sewall.

16:29.589 --> 16:33.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She served as undersecretary of
state for
civilian security, democracy and
human rights

16:33.960 --> 16:35.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
during the Obama administration.

16:35.595 --> 16:39.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's written extensively about
military operations
and civilian casualties.

16:39.265 --> 16:41.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's now at Johns Hopkins
University.

16:41.367 --> 16:46.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ms. Sewall, I want to first ask
-- just walk
us through what the changes are
that the Pentagon

16:46.138 --> 16:48.040 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
just announced.

16:48.074 --> 16:49.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH SEWALL, Former State
Department Official:
Well, essentially, President
Obama had created

16:49.909 --> 16:54.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two categories for thinking
about the use
of force in the context of the
war on terror.

16:54.647 --> 16:59.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One was more like targeted
killing with more
restricted types of targets that
you could

16:59.285 --> 17:04.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
both choose and were forced to
identify, and
it controlled the effects of
those uses of

17:05.024 --> 17:06.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
force more closely.

17:06.759 --> 17:11.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other is more like what
Americans would
understand as war, general
hostilities.

17:11.330 --> 17:16.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what has happened is, the
president -- the
current president has now moved,
according

17:17.003 --> 17:21.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to reports, moved the Somalia
engagement of
U.S. forces from the category of
more targeted

17:21.841 --> 17:24.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
uses of force to that of general
hostilities.

17:24.110 --> 17:30.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It says that
the new rules
says it's OK to kill civilians
if necessary

17:30.516 --> 17:31.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and proportionate.

17:31.517 --> 17:32.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What does that mean?

17:32.885 --> 17:35.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the past, it used to be if
they were threatening
Americans.

17:35.788 --> 17:36.989 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That doesn't seem the case now.

17:37.023 --> 17:38.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SARAH SEWALL: Sure.

17:38.257 --> 17:41.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what I mean by the kinds
of targets
that are chosen.

17:41.294 --> 17:46.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The former category required
that only those
who were a direct threat to
Americans could

17:47.033 --> 17:48.801 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be targeted.

17:48.834 --> 17:52.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now they can be targeted if
they're members
of an organization that's an
associated force

17:52.305 --> 17:54.106 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with the perpetrators of 9/11.

17:54.140 --> 18:00.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has huge impacts for civilian
casualties,
because the former standard of
using the use

18:00.913 --> 18:06.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of targeting according to a near
certainty
of not killing civilians has now
been relaxed.

18:06.118 --> 18:11.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, of course, the laws of war
still apply,
so uses of force still have to
be proportional

18:11.924 --> 18:13.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and they still have to be
discriminate.

18:13.793 --> 18:17.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The military
has complained
for quite some time, even
through the Obama

18:17.596 --> 18:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration, that there was
too much red
tape between when they actually
found the

18:20.466 --> 18:24.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
target and the amount of hoops
that they had
to jump through to try to take
action on it.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SARAH SEWALL: That's right,
Hari.

18:26.572 --> 18:30.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it is fair to say that
the U.S. military,
like most militaries, will
always seek greater

18:30.943 --> 18:33.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
latitude for the use of force.

18:33.212 --> 18:38.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the role of civilian
authorities to make
sure that America's broader
strategic interests

18:38.951 --> 18:42.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are balanced against tactical
possibilities
for gain.

18:42.121 --> 18:48.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And here is where I think
President Obama's
decision to make sure that the
uses of force

18:48.828 --> 18:53.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't have blowback, either by
virtue of
killing civilians unnecessarily,
or by feeding

18:53.332 --> 18:59.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into the ISIS narrative that the
U.S. was
seeking to fight a war against
Islam, or by

18:59.705 --> 19:05.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allowing a slippery slope for
the use of military
force, which is, I think, a
legitimate concern

19:05.211 --> 19:10.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we should be asking about
in the context
of moving toward general
hostilities for engagement

19:10.416 --> 19:12.118 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Somalia.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The U.S.
military is also
going to say, listen, we go out
of our way

19:13.853 --> 19:18.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than anybody else to try to
minimize
civilian casualties, so what's
the harm in

19:18.324 --> 19:21.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
giving them a little bit more
leeway if they
are going to follow the same
protocols?

19:21.293 --> 19:23.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH SEWALL: Well, they are not
going to
follow the same protocols.

19:23.729 --> 19:25.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The protocols are very
different, Hari.

19:25.564 --> 19:29.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, yes, the U.S. military is
better than
almost anyone else at avoiding
civilian harm.

19:29.902 --> 19:36.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we need to only look at the
use of airstrikes
in Mosul in Iraq to see that
there are huge

19:36.175 --> 19:41.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
potentials for backlash that
come when you
relax those protocols.

19:41.247 --> 19:45.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we can do extremely well, we
have done
extremely well at different
periods in our

19:45.317 --> 19:46.485 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
history.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know how to be discriminating
in the use
of airpower.

19:48.621 --> 19:53.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And part of what President
Obama's original
intent was to keep those
standards high as

19:54.026 --> 19:55.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
much as possible.

19:55.528 --> 19:58.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we should be asking tough
questions when
the standards are relaxed.

19:58.297 --> 20:03.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Does the use
of or the ability
to use more force make our
troops any safer?

20:03.469 --> 20:10.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH SEWALL: Well, I did a
study in Afghanistan
in 2010, and there was no
correlation between

20:10.576 --> 20:15.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the kinds of standards that
protected civilians
and the protection that our
forces enjoyed.

20:15.781 --> 20:19.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What changed was the way we went
about pursuing
our objectives.

20:19.185 --> 20:20.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Sometimes, we took more time.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sometimes, we took an indirect
route.

20:22.521 --> 20:26.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the U.S. military can do a
phenomenal
job at avoiding civilian harm.

20:26.859 --> 20:31.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it does require civilian
leadership to
emphasize that as a matter of a
priority.

20:31.597 --> 20:38.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Sarah Sewall
with Johns Hopkins, thanks so
much.

20:38.737 --> 20:43.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SARAH SEWALL: Thank you.

20:43.843 --> 20:47.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

20:47.313 --> 20:51.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Mark Shields
and David Brooks analyze the
week's news;

20:51.884 --> 20:59.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the search for what triggers
PTSD; and a doctor's
take on why affirmative action
could be hurting

20:59.258 --> 21:02.161 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Asian Americans.

21:02.194 --> 21:07.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: The fallout from last
week's failed
Republican effort to repeal the
Obama health

21:07.066 --> 21:12.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care is still being felt across
the political
landscape nationally.

21:12.505 --> 21:17.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump's approval
rating now hovers
around 40 percent in tracking
polls.

21:17.476 --> 21:22.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Michigan, a state he won,
Trump supporters
whom William Brangham spoke to
offered their

21:22.815 --> 21:26.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
own assessments of the
president's first two
months in office.

21:26.819 --> 21:33.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Sixty-four-year-old Randall
Shelton is a self-described
independent and

21:33.092 --> 21:34.894 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
angry white man.

21:34.927 --> 21:39.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For him, Trump's election wasn't
a surprise,
even though Trump wasn't
Shelton's first choice.

21:39.932 --> 21:43.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDALL SHELTON, Trump Voter:
Well, I wish
there had been other candidates,
but I chose

21:43.068 --> 21:48.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the one that I believe was going
to do the
right thing.

21:48.107 --> 21:52.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought he was going to do and
I still believe
he's going to do the right
thing.

21:52.545 --> 21:57.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Shelton lives
in Allen Park,
a blue-collar suburb of Detroit.

21:57.149 --> 22:01.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Twelve years ago, he got hurt
working at the
local General Motors plant, and
he's been

22:01.487 --> 22:04.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on disability and off work ever
since.

22:04.490 --> 22:10.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He thinks Democrats and
Republicans are blocking
the very things Trump was
elected to do, like

22:10.162 --> 22:12.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bringing back jobs and fixing
immigration.

22:12.565 --> 22:17.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Shelton says the president
is also partly
to blame for some of his early
failures.

22:17.203 --> 22:20.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDALL SHELTON: It seems like,
once he got
in there, all he wants to do is
play golf

22:20.973 --> 22:22.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and take vacations and tweet.

22:22.775 --> 22:28.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he'd shut up and just do what
he said he's
going to do and stay off the
Twitter, and

22:28.981 --> 22:33.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
take care of business in
Washington, he would
probably be a whole lot better
off.

22:33.185 --> 22:39.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Thirty miles
away in Novi,
Michigan, we found a small,
ardent group of

22:39.491 --> 22:42.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supporters who remain totally
committed to
the president.

22:42.161 --> 22:44.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DON EBBEN, Trump Supporter: I
have been completely
blown away, completely
surprised.

22:44.997 --> 22:46.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In a good way?

22:46.198 --> 22:47.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON EBBEN: In a good way.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: I still find him a little
bit of abrasive.

22:48.234 --> 22:49.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But I'm willing to forgive it.

22:49.868 --> 22:52.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm willing to look past it,
because he's
the president of the United
States.

22:52.238 --> 22:55.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's leading the direction from
whence we
have come.

22:55.074 --> 22:56.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's important to me.

22:56.909 --> 22:59.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MESHAWN MADDOCK, Trump
Supporter: We were
Trump before Trump was Trump
here in Michigan.

22:59.612 --> 23:02.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Meshawn
Maddock helped organize
this gathering.

23:02.781 --> 23:05.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She ran a Facebook group called
Michigan Women
For Trump.

23:05.751 --> 23:09.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MESHAWN MADDOCK: It was when he
talked about
getting rid of the people within
our own party

23:09.788 --> 23:11.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that are the problem.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.826 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That was what motivated me.

23:13.859 --> 23:17.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Maddock likes
that Trump
is disrupting what she sees as a
broken political

23:17.730 --> 23:22.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
system and that he's using
social media in
a way that no president has ever
done before.

23:22.901 --> 23:26.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MESHAWN MADDOCK: I don't believe
anybody is
monitoring him on Twitter.

23:26.672 --> 23:28.007 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's all him.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what I love about is that
there is no
middle man anymore.

23:30.909 --> 23:37.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think he's completely
changing how the
media is going to work and serve
the people.

23:37.783 --> 23:39.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's not necessarily a bad
thing.

23:39.518 --> 23:43.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Theresa Johns
originally
wanted Ted Cruz, but later came
around to

23:43.289 --> 23:46.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Trump camp, even though a
recent Quinnipiac
poll.

23:46.458 --> 23:51.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Showed that six in 10 Americans
say the president
is dishonest, Johns is not one
of them.

23:51.463 --> 23:56.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THERESA JOHNS, Trump Supporter:
Trump has
never, ever said anything that
has not come

23:56.201 --> 23:57.169 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to pass.

23:57.202 --> 23:58.304 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's not.

23:58.337 --> 24:01.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's always said -- what he has
said is the
truth.

24:01.140 --> 24:02.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I don't think that he has
reason to lie.

24:02.675 --> 24:05.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What does he have to gain by
lying?

24:05.044 --> 24:06.779 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Nothing.

24:06.812 --> 24:10.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We also asked
about the
various allegations surrounding
Russia, that

24:10.616 --> 24:14.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia seems to have tried to
undermine Hillary
Clinton's campaign and that
members of the

24:14.987 --> 24:17.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump campaign may have close
ties to Russia.

24:17.923 --> 24:19.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Does that bother you at all?

24:19.391 --> 24:21.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MESHAWN MADDOCK: I hate to say
it but it doesn't
bother me.

24:21.393 --> 24:23.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't want to focus on Russia.

24:23.095 --> 24:25.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just think it's smoke and
mirrors.

24:25.964 --> 24:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So you don't
think there's
any of these allegations?

24:27.933 --> 24:29.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MESHAWN MADDOCK: I don't think
there's anything
to it.

24:30.002 --> 24:33.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's just they -- they
are going to
try to do anything they can to
try to bring

24:33.339 --> 24:35.140 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this man down.

24:35.174 --> 24:38.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Few expected
President Trump
to win here in Michigan, but it
was the last

24:38.811 --> 24:43.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state he visited on the campaign
trail and
one of the first he came back to
after he

24:43.749 --> 24:45.651 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was elected.

24:45.684 --> 24:49.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Thank you to the incredible
people of Michigan.

24:49.855 --> 24:55.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDA BRANDIS, Trump Supporter:
This is the
type of guy that is crude and
he's loud and

24:55.561 --> 24:57.763 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he is not politically correct.

24:57.796 --> 24:59.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But he says everything we think.

24:59.698 --> 25:04.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In Commerce,
Michigan, Linda
Brandis, who's an active member
of the state's

25:04.103 --> 25:07.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tea Party, remains thankful the
president
won.

25:07.473 --> 25:12.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she also just reached out
directly to
him about some growing concerns
she has.

25:12.077 --> 25:14.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LINDA BRANDIS: I sent him an
e-mail last night.

25:14.213 --> 25:15.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What did it
say?

25:15.781 --> 25:21.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDA BRANDIS: It said, I voted
for you because
I'm concerned about health care.

25:21.620 --> 25:25.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I wanted to remind him that
it was the
grassroots that put him in the
White House,

25:25.391 --> 25:28.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and it can be the grassroots
that takes him
out of the White House.

25:28.660 --> 25:32.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Brandis was
disappointed
that Trump didn't push initially
for a full

25:32.464 --> 25:38.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
repeal of Obamacare, and then,
when the Republican-led
Congress couldn't pass their
bill, the president

25:38.303 --> 25:40.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just seemed to move onto other
priorities.

25:40.239 --> 25:45.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDA BRANDIS: In his mind, he
really thought,
oh, I can go in and I'm just
going to fix

25:45.377 --> 25:46.345 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

25:46.378 --> 25:50.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's not that easy a problem
to fix.

25:50.516 --> 25:56.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't appreciate the
childish attitude
of, it's my way or the highway.

25:56.889 --> 26:02.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Guy Gordon
hosts the afternoon
talk show on WJR in Detroit.

26:02.761 --> 26:09.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
His show follows Rush
Limbaugh's.

26:09.134 --> 26:14.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were there the afternoon the
Republican
health care bill collapsed, and
the phones

26:14.106 --> 26:16.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lit up with callers, like Beth
from Macomb
County.

26:16.708 --> 26:18.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: I'm disgusted with the
conservative
Republicans.

26:18.510 --> 26:20.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They need to get their heads out
of their
you-know-where.

26:21.013 --> 26:26.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GUY GORDON, Radio Talk Show
Host: There is
a heartland here in America that
feels overlooked,

26:26.218 --> 26:29.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
disrespected, mocked for their
beliefs.

26:29.488 --> 26:31.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have also seen their jobs
leave.

26:31.690 --> 26:34.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's no greater window
into that than
Macomb County.

26:34.893 --> 26:38.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Macomb County
is famous
in political circles, because,
for decades,

26:38.797 --> 26:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this area voted overwhelmingly
for Democrats.

26:41.400 --> 26:46.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then in the 1980s, Ronald
Reagan campaigned
here and he turned those
Democratic voters

26:46.472 --> 26:48.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the Republican side.

26:48.073 --> 26:50.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This area became known as the
home of the
Reagan Democrats.

26:51.009 --> 26:54.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK BRANDENBURG (R), Michigan
State Senator:
You are right now, at this
moment, sitting

26:54.079 --> 26:57.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the birthplace of the Reagan
Democrats.

26:57.549 --> 27:01.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: State Senator
Jack Brandenburg
says he was the first elected
official in

27:01.887 --> 27:04.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Michigan to formally endorse
Donald Trump.

27:04.690 --> 27:09.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he believes that following
Reagan's path
through Macomb County, which had
gone to President

27:09.895 --> 27:16.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama in both 2008 and 2012, was
key to Trump's
success.

27:16.368 --> 27:21.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump won Macomb County by more
than 48,000
votes, but carried the entire
state by less

27:21.807 --> 27:23.575 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than 12,000.

27:23.609 --> 27:26.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK BRANDENBURG: If you do the
math, Macomb
County put him over the top in
Michigan and

27:26.912 --> 27:29.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quite possibly gave him the
presidency.

27:29.047 --> 27:33.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Closer to
downtown Detroit,
the lingering scars of the
area's economic

27:33.118 --> 27:34.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
crisis are everywhere.

27:34.920 --> 27:37.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORON BENTLEY, Trump Supporter:
Just about
everybody in this neighborhood
has basically

27:37.089 --> 27:41.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voted Democrat, but I tell
people all the
time, what has 50-plus years of
Democratic

27:41.126 --> 27:44.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
policies done for our
communities?

27:44.329 --> 27:48.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Fewer than 5
percent of
voters in Detroit picked
President Trump,

27:48.567 --> 27:53.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but Coron Bentley, who works for
Ford Motor
Company, supported him.

27:53.105 --> 27:57.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says he gets a lot of grief
from friends
and family for being a black
Republican, but

27:57.843 --> 28:02.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's glad to have voted for the
president,
and he says it's already paying
off.

28:02.180 --> 28:06.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORON BENTLEY: There was talk of
them building
a brand-new $700 million plant
in Mexico,

28:06.818 --> 28:10.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but, instead, they decided to
invest that
money in the plant that I work
at.

28:10.355 --> 28:14.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Herbert Hoover once said of
all people,
prosperity is right around the
corner.

28:14.960 --> 28:19.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Bentley says
that optimism
stems from Ford's recent
decision to reinvest

28:19.998 --> 28:23.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more than a billion dollars into
three Michigan
plants.

28:24.002 --> 28:27.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump applauded the
announcement
on Twitter earlier this week,
saying car company

28:27.873 --> 28:30.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
jobs are coming back to the U.S.

28:30.242 --> 28:36.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, Ford said much of the
plan had been
in the works long before the
election.

28:36.114 --> 28:40.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in Allen Park, Randall
Shelton wants
the president to refocus on
cracking down

28:40.519 --> 28:44.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on illegal immigration and to
start acting
a little more presidential.

28:44.456 --> 28:47.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDALL SHELTON: So, you're
supposed to be
the president of the United
States.

28:47.559 --> 28:50.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Act like the president of the
United States.

28:50.862 --> 28:57.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Don't act like some braggart,
some spoiled
little rich kid, which you are,
and start

28:57.269 --> 28:59.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doing what you're supposed to be
doing.

28:59.371 --> 29:03.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Shelton says,
in the end,
he's still glad he voted for the
president

29:03.742 --> 29:07.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and hopes he will start turning
things around
in the weeks and months ahead.

29:07.346 --> 29:13.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham
in Detroit.

29:13.885 --> 29:22.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that brings
us to the analysis
of Shields and Brooks.

29:22.861 --> 29:27.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and
New York Times columnist David
Brooks.

29:27.633 --> 29:31.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gentlemen, great report from
William Brangham
from Michigan.

29:31.703 --> 29:34.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David, a lot of these voters,
they still like
Donald Trump.

29:34.673 --> 29:37.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been a rough two months,
but they're
looking past that.

29:37.309 --> 29:40.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, he's got
still 80 percent
approval rating among
Republicans.

29:41.013 --> 29:44.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's the bind that a lot
of Republicans
in the House and the Senate
face, which is

29:44.883 --> 29:48.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, if they cross Donald
Trump, that they
face some immediate heat back at
home.

29:48.787 --> 29:52.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not sure he can go out and
defeat them
in two years, as he's threatened
to do.

29:52.991 --> 29:56.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he's a popular guy still in
Republican
circles, but 35 percent, 40
percent approval

29:56.662 --> 29:57.629 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nationally.

29:57.663 --> 29:58.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What did you make
of that?

29:58.930 --> 30:01.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think it was a
terrific piece
by William.

30:01.199 --> 30:07.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think, Judy, we have to
understand,
having missed that story last
November myself,

30:07.873 --> 30:09.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that Donald Trump...

30:09.074 --> 30:10.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Most of us did.

30:10.342 --> 30:12.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Donald Trump felt
the pain of
these people.

30:12.844 --> 30:14.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's what he communicated to
them.

30:14.546 --> 30:16.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He acknowledged their existence.

30:16.515 --> 30:21.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He acknowledged what they had
been through,
and that, while the great -- big
numbers in

30:21.386 --> 30:26.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the country were great, the
stock market,
the unemployment, that these
were people who

30:26.558 --> 30:30.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
felt themselves and experienced
being left
behind.

30:30.128 --> 30:31.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he said, I would stand up
for you.

30:31.963 --> 30:35.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think they are still
giving him very
much the benefit of the doubt.

30:35.200 --> 30:37.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Imagine how
popular he would
be if he actually had some
policies to help

30:37.869 --> 30:39.638 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those people.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Right, as opposed
to a health
care policy which would have
taken 24 million

30:41.840 --> 30:43.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people off health care.

30:43.608 --> 30:46.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, David, we
heard one of
the women who voted for him in
Michigan say

30:46.945 --> 30:52.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she just thought this Russia
story, all the
tentacles of it, she said it
doesn't really

30:52.584 --> 30:53.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
add up to anything for her.

30:54.019 --> 30:57.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, yet, this week, it just
didn't seem to
stop.

30:57.389 --> 31:03.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have got two sides of the
Congress, both
houses of Congress, going after
it, the FBI.

31:03.528 --> 31:06.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now we learn more about what was
going on
inside the White House.

31:06.431 --> 31:07.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How damaging is this?

31:07.866 --> 31:09.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How much of a problem is it for
the president?

31:09.568 --> 31:11.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I really don't
know.

31:11.103 --> 31:14.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have a tendency to get a
little overhyped
to some of the Trump scandals.

31:14.406 --> 31:18.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We go to outrage level 11 at
every moment.

31:18.276 --> 31:21.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the Russia -- the
case is still
out how serious it is, whether
there's actual

31:21.947 --> 31:25.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ties between Russia and the
Trump campaign,
which I think is the core of it,
where Paul

31:25.884 --> 31:29.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Manafort came from, whether
there was any
money laundering, and things
like that.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is a lot we don't know.

31:31.656 --> 31:33.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm trying to not prejudge
it.

31:33.425 --> 31:37.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What we do know is, there's high
levels of
incompetence.

31:37.295 --> 31:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have a president who
tweeted this wiretapping
tweet which was completely
wrong.

31:41.867 --> 31:43.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's incompetence.

31:43.769 --> 31:48.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have this young man in the
National Security
Agency whose his boss tried to
get rid of,

31:48.373 --> 31:53.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump was preserved by Steve
Bannon, who was
involved in giving information
to Nunes, Chairman

31:53.278 --> 31:54.379 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Nunes.

31:54.412 --> 31:58.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have Nunes himself, who is
behaving incompetently.

31:58.183 --> 31:59.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Forget he's too close to the
Trump campaign.

31:59.684 --> 32:02.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is a way to conduct an
investigation.

32:02.187 --> 32:04.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's not to cancel hearings
willy-nilly.

32:04.723 --> 32:07.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not to go brief the guy
you're supposed
to be investigating.

32:07.225 --> 32:11.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not to create a civil war
within your
own committee.

32:11.196 --> 32:16.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we have just levels and
levels and
levels of just incompetence, of
people who

32:16.701 --> 32:18.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do not know how to play this
game.

32:18.470 --> 32:21.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when that happens, you never
know what's
going to happen next.

32:21.473 --> 32:25.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I don't know if it's a
scandal in the
class of Watergate scandal, but
it's not inspiring

32:25.477 --> 32:27.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to see what we have been seeing.

32:27.312 --> 32:30.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark, whether
it's incompetence
or something more than that, how
much is it

32:30.582 --> 32:31.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hurting the president?

32:31.683 --> 32:34.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It's hurting the
president,
Judy.

32:34.152 --> 32:35.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Everything in politics is a
poll.

32:35.987 --> 32:41.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you want the ultimate poll,
forget Gallup,
forget NBC, Wall Street Journal
or anything

32:41.660 --> 32:43.028 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
else.

32:43.061 --> 32:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Monday, April 3, the baseball
season begins
in Washington, D.C.

32:47.866 --> 32:53.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Donald Trump, former
baseball player,
proudly proclaiming his athletic
ability,

32:53.438 --> 32:54.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will not be there.

32:54.506 --> 32:56.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why will he not be there?

32:56.041 --> 32:57.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Because he would be booed.

32:57.342 --> 33:00.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He would be booed loudly, he
would be booed
long.

33:00.245 --> 33:04.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it would be would be seen
all over the
world, and it would be seen time
and time

33:04.649 --> 33:05.617 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
again.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, that's what it's done.

33:07.419 --> 33:08.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what it's doing.

33:08.486 --> 33:11.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's what his presidency --
David's right.

33:11.223 --> 33:18.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a White House that
prizes loyalty
above ability, imagination,
experience, judgment.

33:18.563 --> 33:24.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, what do they do to the
one loyal supporter,
acolyte, apologist they have in
the entire

33:24.903 --> 33:32.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Congress and part of the
Intelligence Committees,
Devin Nunes, inspector Nunes of
California?

33:32.510 --> 33:37.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They bring him down to the White
House under
the cover of darkness on a
secret mission,

33:37.515 --> 33:41.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
show him these documents that he
discovers.

33:41.553 --> 33:46.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then he goes and reveals
them to the president
of the United States, even
though these documents

33:46.992 --> 33:51.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are shown to him by people who
work in the
White House for the president of
the United

33:51.463 --> 33:53.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
States, including one of his
former employees.

33:53.531 --> 34:00.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They take his loyalty, turn him
into an absolute
butt of jokes.

34:00.105 --> 34:01.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's defenseless.

34:01.339 --> 34:03.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's unflinchingly loyal.

34:03.208 --> 34:04.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he's incompetent.

34:04.976 --> 34:11.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what they set out to do was
to slow down
the investigation, which
suggests there is

34:11.416 --> 34:13.218 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
something there.

34:13.251 --> 34:17.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what they have done is
highlight, spotlight
and given a new energy and new
urgency to

34:18.023 --> 34:19.824 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

34:19.858 --> 34:25.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The testimony of FBI agent Clint
Watts before
the Senate Intelligence
Committee on Thursday

34:25.664 --> 34:27.532 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was compelling.

34:27.565 --> 34:33.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was compelling about the
efforts and the
sabotaging by Russia of the
American democratic

34:33.138 --> 34:34.839 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
process.

34:34.873 --> 34:38.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anybody, Democrat, Republican,
should listen
to that and say, this is serious
stuff.

34:38.076 --> 34:44.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And this is --
so, whether
there is more there on Russia or
not, David,

34:44.382 --> 34:46.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this is one that's going to go
on.

34:46.117 --> 34:48.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think one of you mentioned
health care.

34:48.086 --> 34:53.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we talked last week, we had
just learned
that the Republicans had pulled
the bill,

34:53.191 --> 34:55.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
David, in the House of
Representatives.

34:55.360 --> 35:00.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, this week, you have the
president criticizing
the conservative Freedom Caucus
members, naming

35:00.765 --> 35:06.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them, calling them out, singling
them out
by name, going after them and
the Democrats.

35:06.071 --> 35:12.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this a tactic, a strategy
that's likely
to cause them to bring back the
attempt to

35:12.444 --> 35:16.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
repeal Obamacare successfully
and get that
done?

35:16.147 --> 35:18.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, first of
all, I highly
think it's unlikely they are
going to bring

35:19.017 --> 35:20.785 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it back.

35:20.819 --> 35:22.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The core problem, which was that
the Freedom
Caucus and the moderates wanted
a completely

35:22.954 --> 35:24.889 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opposite bill, that problem is
still there.

35:24.923 --> 35:26.324 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a structural problem.

35:26.358 --> 35:29.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Republican Party does not
have a consensus
position on health care.

35:29.327 --> 35:32.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The decision to send these
tweets and to threaten
people like Mark Sanford and
other members

35:32.931 --> 35:36.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the Freedom Caucus was
amateur hour, another
kindergarten mistake.

35:36.701 --> 35:38.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First of all, he's not going to
do it.

35:38.336 --> 35:41.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's not going to run people
against somebody
in two years.

35:41.106 --> 35:43.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Second, if he did, it would be
highly unlikely
to be successful.

35:43.842 --> 35:47.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even Franklin Roosevelt, at the
head of his
popularity, he once tried to run
against a

35:47.479 --> 35:52.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
local person and lost all the
way across the
board, because people like their
-- they like

35:52.784 --> 35:54.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their local member.

35:54.285 --> 35:57.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, meanwhile, the Freedom
Caucus guys
are loving this today.

35:57.422 --> 36:01.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are the little guy standing
up to -- the
little guy representing their
district.

36:01.793 --> 36:03.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then their manhood has been
called into
question.

36:04.029 --> 36:05.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, they can't back down now.

36:05.397 --> 36:07.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I found it completely
counterproductive.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark?

36:09.434 --> 36:18.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy, an old
friend of ours,
Les Francis from California,
said today, since

36:18.309 --> 36:25.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the collapse and the failure of
the Republicans
to -- that promised for four
consecutive elections

36:25.650 --> 36:31.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to repeal and replace Obamacare
as their first
act, and total abject failure,
that the Republicans

36:31.990 --> 36:37.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look more like the Donner Party
than they
do like the national governing
party.

36:37.095 --> 36:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For those who don't remember the
19th century,
the Donner Party were settlers
who got caught

36:41.199 --> 36:46.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Sierra Madres at winter
and ended up
practicing cannibalism to
survive.

36:46.805 --> 36:51.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is really -- it's been
a circular
firing squad ever since.

36:51.476 --> 36:54.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump is attacking the
Freedom Caucus.

36:54.179 --> 36:58.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Paul Ryan is attacking the
Freedom Caucus
and suggesting that the worst
thing that could

36:58.883 --> 37:03.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happen was for the president to
work with
Democrats to solve a national
problem.

37:03.488 --> 37:07.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have never had a speaker of
the House in
the history of the country say
that before.

37:07.525 --> 37:10.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To work for -- to solve a
national problem,
we won't work in a bipartisan
way.

37:10.795 --> 37:11.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: About the
opposition.

37:11.830 --> 37:13.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Ryan has been
crippled by this.

37:13.998 --> 37:15.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Really?

37:15.066 --> 37:17.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: He has had
editorial upon editorial.

37:17.268 --> 37:24.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His approval rating has fallen
from 35 percent
to 21 percent.

37:24.476 --> 37:27.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he's getting battered on all
sides.

37:27.078 --> 37:31.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, Paul Ryan -- I know
David has great
respect and admiration for him
-- but he is

37:31.549 --> 37:34.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like a -- philosophically, he's
like a hammer.

37:34.953 --> 37:38.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And for the hammer, every
problem is a nail.

37:38.723 --> 37:44.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for Paul Ryan, his solution
is invariably
cutting taxes on the wealthiest
Americans.

37:44.295 --> 37:49.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's tried to sell this tax
-- this health
care bill as a tax cut of a
trillion dollars

37:49.400 --> 37:51.069 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
time and again in interviews.

37:51.102 --> 37:54.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it knocked 24 million people
off of health
care.

37:54.806 --> 38:02.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Donald Trump, who had been
the tribune
of these people, stood by,
uncuriously, uninterested,

38:02.914 --> 38:04.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and watched it happen.

38:04.315 --> 38:05.617 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And now he's blaming Paul Ryan.

38:05.650 --> 38:07.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you want to
come to his
defense, briefly?

38:07.519 --> 38:08.653 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

38:08.686 --> 38:10.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, no, I want
to blame Trump
more.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.023 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

38:12.056 --> 38:15.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: No, I think the --
well, Paul
Ryan, I respect a lot of his
policies, but

38:15.493 --> 38:19.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do think he's a bit locked in
the 1980s
intellectually.

38:19.464 --> 38:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the problem, the core
problem here is
still with Donald Trump.

38:22.367 --> 38:24.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He doesn't have a theory of what
Trumpism
is.

38:24.402 --> 38:30.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he doesn't have a strategy
for converting
his populist campaign into some
sort of legislative

38:30.141 --> 38:31.876 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
agenda.

38:31.910 --> 38:35.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You could pick a right-wing
agenda and get
people all on the right and push
through a

38:35.513 --> 38:37.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pretty Republican agenda.

38:37.182 --> 38:40.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or you could pick a populist
center-left,
and not worry about the Freedom
Caucus.

38:40.985 --> 38:45.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he's managed to offend the
right, the
center and the left.

38:45.323 --> 38:49.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so how many people -- how do
you get to
50 percent of that?

38:49.494 --> 38:51.329 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And you don't.

38:51.362 --> 38:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so he -- I assume that, if
he -- he will
sometimes figure out and say,
OK, I have got

38:55.767 --> 38:57.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be this kind of president or
that kind
of president.

38:57.802 --> 38:59.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, right now, he's no kind of
president.

39:00.004 --> 39:00.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's no -- it's not
center-right.

39:00.972 --> 39:01.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not center-left.

39:01.973 --> 39:03.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not far-right.

39:03.241 --> 39:04.876 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's just chaos.

39:04.909 --> 39:08.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, somehow, he's got to
figure out, OK,
I have an actual strategy.

39:09.013 --> 39:10.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He doesn't have one right now.

39:10.848 --> 39:15.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, as he's
criticizing the
Democrats on health care, Mark,
he's counting

39:15.453 --> 39:19.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on at least some Democrats to
support his
Supreme Court nominee, Neil
Gorsuch.

39:19.924 --> 39:23.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two of them have come forward
this week and
said -- but there are others who
you would

39:23.962 --> 39:27.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think the White House would be
counting on
who are saying they're not going
to vote for

39:27.165 --> 39:28.199 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

39:28.233 --> 39:30.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What does that nomination look
like right
now?

39:30.068 --> 39:34.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: What it looks like
now is that
-- I think Clarence Thomas is
the only sitting

39:34.806 --> 39:38.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
judge who was confirmed by fewer
than 60 votes.

39:38.343 --> 39:40.144 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He got 52.

39:40.178 --> 39:45.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Neil Gorsuch will not reach
the 60 level.

39:45.316 --> 39:54.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this will be, I think, a
dramatic moment,
when the -- they're going to
impose, the Republican

39:54.759 --> 39:57.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
majority will impose the nuclear
deterrent,
the nuclear solution.

39:57.562 --> 39:59.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The so-called
nuclear rule
change.

39:59.097 --> 40:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: A majority -- a
majority to
confirm a Supreme Court justice.

40:02.233 --> 40:07.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The question is, do they do it
on this one,
on Gorsuch, or on the next one?

40:07.805 --> 40:12.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, no, I think that Democrats
-- Donald
Trump has done one thing.

40:12.343 --> 40:16.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He may not have energized
Republicans, but
he has certainly energized
Democrats and the

40:16.281 --> 40:18.049 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Democratic base.

40:18.082 --> 40:23.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's a sense of outrage,
a continuing
outrage over the fact that a
mild-mannered,

40:24.022 --> 40:30.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
widely admired person of high
character and
principle, Merrick Garland, the
same things

40:30.094 --> 40:34.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they say about Neil Gorsuch, his
supporters
never even got a moment of a
hearing, never

40:34.666 --> 40:38.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had the decency to -- many, meet
to with him.

40:38.102 --> 40:42.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there is a sense of vengeance
and anger
over that still brewing.

40:42.740 --> 40:44.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: It's pure
vengeance.

40:44.309 --> 40:45.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's an eye for an eye.

40:45.310 --> 40:46.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's two wrongs make -- trying
to make a right.

40:46.711 --> 40:48.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But two wrongs do not make a
right.

40:48.579 --> 40:50.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Neil Gorsuch, it doesn't look
like he will
get 60.

40:50.782 --> 40:54.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that has nothing to do with
Neil Gorsuch,
who is completely qualified and
almost a model

40:54.919 --> 40:56.688 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
nominee.

40:56.721 --> 40:58.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the fact the Democrats are
doing this,
maybe they can say, OK, well,
Republicans

40:58.790 --> 40:59.757 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
did it to us.

40:59.791 --> 41:00.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's fair is fair.

41:00.892 --> 41:02.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it's wrong in both cases.

41:02.727 --> 41:06.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Democratic arguments
against Gorsuch
are pathetic.

41:06.164 --> 41:11.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their substance of which -- the
core argument
is that he's the sort of judge a
Republican

41:11.369 --> 41:12.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
candidate nominates for justice.

41:12.770 --> 41:14.372 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Well, of course.

41:14.405 --> 41:16.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's -- a Republican won the
White House,
so that's what you're going to
get.

41:16.341 --> 41:21.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is no question about
his character,
about the mainstream nature of
his jurisprudence,

41:21.112 --> 41:22.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about his intelligence, about
his qualifications.

41:23.014 --> 41:24.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's no question about any of
that.

41:24.982 --> 41:31.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so to blow up the nuclear
option over
Gorsuch seems to be pointless
partisanship,

41:31.389 --> 41:33.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which will have longstanding
damage to the
country.

41:33.358 --> 41:37.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have the 60 votes, so it
forces people
to think about being bipartisan.

41:37.362 --> 41:39.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

41:39.130 --> 41:40.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Once we get rid of
that, you
never have to worry about it
again, if you're

41:40.798 --> 41:41.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the majority.

41:41.799 --> 41:43.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It makes it a
more partisan...

41:43.701 --> 41:47.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: You do admit that
he has not
been forthcoming in -- on the
question of

41:47.872 --> 41:50.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dark money, I mean, he has been
totally...

41:50.408 --> 41:52.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: We will get to
that next week.

41:52.243 --> 41:53.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We are going to
get to that
next week.

41:53.811 --> 41:54.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, OK, but I'm
just not going
to let it pass like that, Judy.

41:54.779 --> 41:55.780 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:55.813 --> 41:57.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you're
allowed to say that.

41:57.715 --> 41:58.983 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And so are you.

41:59.016 --> 42:06.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
David Brooks, Mark Shields,
thank you both.

42:06.958 --> 42:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tonight, we
conclude our series
War on the Brain.

42:15.867 --> 42:20.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Soledad
O'Brien reports
on the efforts of researchers to
find the

42:20.571 --> 42:23.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cause of post-traumatic stress
disorder.

42:23.741 --> 42:32.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACOB FADLEY, U.S. Army Veteran:
Having PTSD
is -- it's like being in a room
where you

42:32.784 --> 42:35.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have no control and everything's
going wrong.

42:35.686 --> 42:40.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's a lot of anxiety.

42:40.191 --> 42:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a feeling of dread and
hopelessness.

42:48.666 --> 42:49.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Triggers are, for me, when I'm
in traffic.

42:49.700 --> 42:55.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's a lot of stuff going on.

42:55.173 --> 43:02.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Jacob Fadley
served 12 years
and four tours in Iraq and
Afghanistan.

43:02.814 --> 43:05.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was a combat photographer in
the Army.

43:05.683 --> 43:09.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He spent time close to
heart-thumping blasts.

43:09.654 --> 43:13.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yet he came home without a
scratch -- on the
outside.

43:13.825 --> 43:15.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Did you think you had
post-traumatic stress?

43:15.793 --> 43:23.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACOB FADLEY: I think, -- no, I
knew I had
PTSD, but I never wanted to say
that, because,

43:23.935 --> 43:26.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when you say it, then you have
to deal with
it.

43:26.737 --> 43:28.506 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

43:28.539 --> 43:33.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL PERL, Uniformed Services
University
of the Health Sciences: She's
cutting very,

43:33.744 --> 43:39.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very thin ribbon of sections of
this portion
of the brain, the specimen.

43:39.183 --> 43:41.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She will put it in the water
bath.

43:41.085 --> 43:42.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it will spread out.

43:42.553 --> 43:43.821 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Look at that.

43:43.855 --> 43:45.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Wow.

43:45.623 --> 43:50.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dr. Daniel Perl has a clue as to
what's going
on inside the heads of veterans
like Jacob

43:50.361 --> 43:52.063 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Fadley.

43:52.096 --> 43:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is a neuropathologist at the
Uniformed
Services University of the
Health Sciences,

43:56.133 --> 43:58.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an entity of the Department of
Defense.

43:58.436 --> 44:01.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He is studying how blast
exposure impacts
the brain.

44:01.639 --> 44:03.407 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

44:03.441 --> 44:05.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL PERL: Now, this is from
an individual
who had been in an automobile
accident.

44:05.243 --> 44:10.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: He is studying
the brains
of people who suffered traumatic
brain injuries,

44:10.281 --> 44:15.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
one group, civilians who
suffered impacts
to the head, another, soldiers
exposed to

44:15.353 --> 44:16.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
blast shockwaves.

44:16.354 --> 44:18.022 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

44:18.055 --> 44:20.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL PERL: Now let me show you
the same
procedure in roughly the same
area of the

44:20.791 --> 44:22.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
brain, same stain.

44:22.293 --> 44:24.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Oh, wow.

44:24.228 --> 44:25.696 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

44:25.730 --> 44:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL PERL: This is somebody
who'd been exposed
to an IED, to blasts.

44:28.966 --> 44:32.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: And is this --
a person clearly
has blast exposure.

44:32.737 --> 44:35.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do they also have post-traumatic
stress disorder?

44:35.206 --> 44:36.173 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

44:36.207 --> 44:38.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL PERL: Yes.

44:38.042 --> 44:39.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of the cases that we looked
at had been
diagnosed with post-traumatic
stress disorder.

44:40.011 --> 44:44.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: While there's
growing evidence
of a link between traumatic
brain injuries

44:44.148 --> 44:50.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and post-traumatic stress
disorder, a connection
between PTSD and blast waves has
remained

44:50.054 --> 44:51.022 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
elusive.

44:51.055 --> 44:52.790 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

44:52.823 --> 44:57.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL PERL: When the explosion
goes off,
it forms what's called a blast
wave, which

44:57.261 --> 45:03.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a high-pressure pulse that
expands out
from the blast in all directions
at the speed

45:03.434 --> 45:05.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of sound, approximately.

45:05.369 --> 45:11.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so here you have a high --
high-pressure
pulse blasting through this
delicate instrument

45:11.275 --> 45:12.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
called the brain.

45:12.476 --> 45:14.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: What does a
concussive blast
feel like?

45:14.412 --> 45:18.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACOB FADLEY: It's just like a
an entire force
is being pushed through you,
something powerful,

45:18.783 --> 45:19.750 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
too.

45:19.784 --> 45:21.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You know it's powerful.

45:21.485 --> 45:25.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You freeze, that your body just
kind of stops
and goes, what -- what is going
on?

45:25.122 --> 45:28.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And kind of, for me, it felt
like it was rebooting
itself.

45:28.192 --> 45:33.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Dr. Perl
believes this brown
scarring is a breakthrough
discovery, possible

45:33.397 --> 45:37.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
evidence that blast exposure may
contribute
to PTSD.

45:37.068 --> 45:38.703 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

45:38.736 --> 45:43.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL PERL: I have been looking
at brain
slides for over 40 years, and I
had never

45:43.708 --> 45:45.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
seen this pattern before.

45:45.276 --> 45:50.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We thought, this must be
something very unique
and special to blast exposure.

45:50.281 --> 45:56.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: When you look
at this picture,
do you say this matches
someone's reporting

45:56.454 --> 45:58.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the impact of post-traumatic
stress disorder?

45:58.889 --> 45:59.857 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

45:59.890 --> 46:00.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL PERL: Sure.

46:00.891 --> 46:04.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's widespread damage
throughout the cortex.

46:04.362 --> 46:10.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's our belief that, in
these areas with
the scarring, function is
compromised.

46:10.601 --> 46:17.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Fadley left the
military
in 2014, after his fourth
deployment.

46:17.308 --> 46:18.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: What's another visual
component?

46:18.976 --> 46:20.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JACOB FADLEY: Rhythm.

46:20.378 --> 46:21.345 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Rhythm.

46:21.379 --> 46:22.580 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Rhythm.

46:22.613 --> 46:24.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Thirty-three
and eligible
for the G.I.

46:24.749 --> 46:31.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bill, he thought studying film
at USC would
put his life back on track, but
just one month

46:31.088 --> 46:32.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into his first semester:

46:32.390 --> 46:34.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACOB FADLEY: I didn't see the
train signal.

46:34.558 --> 46:35.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I didn't see that at all.

46:35.826 --> 46:39.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I made a left turn exactly as
the train was
coming.

46:39.530 --> 46:43.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I could feel blood pouring out
of me.

46:43.067 --> 46:44.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I knew I was dying.

46:44.802 --> 46:48.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: L.A. news media
reported
on his brush with death.

46:48.572 --> 46:52.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REPORTER: It's hard to believe,
but the man
driving the silver Hyundai with
Arizona plates

46:52.643 --> 46:55.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
survived the crash that caused
this Metro
rail train to derail.

46:55.980 --> 47:02.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Fadley had
driven, accidentally,
into the path of an oncoming
commuter train.

47:02.720 --> 47:04.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
To this day, he avoids this
intersection.

47:04.221 --> 47:06.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JACOB FADLEY: It's not
comfortable.

47:06.390 --> 47:11.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes, it's -- yes, it's -- it's
OK.

47:11.228 --> 47:14.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, there's no reason to be
upset with
this.

47:14.131 --> 47:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm not -- I'm not upset.

47:16.000 --> 47:19.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm just anxious.

47:19.704 --> 47:27.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: It was finally
enough for
him to seek treatment for PTSD.

47:27.678 --> 47:34.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That sawdusty, brown pattern
that exists across
the brain in the slides that you
showed me,

47:34.785 --> 47:36.420 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an MRI doesn't pick that up?

47:36.454 --> 47:37.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A CAT scan doesn't pick that up?

47:37.855 --> 47:38.823 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

47:38.856 --> 47:39.990 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
DANIEL PERL: No.

47:40.024 --> 47:40.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: You can't see
that in a living
person?

47:40.991 --> 47:42.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACOB FADLEY: It's not that it
isn't there.

47:42.293 --> 47:44.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It just doesn't have the
resolution to see
it.

47:44.762 --> 47:46.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to need to use other
means.

47:46.230 --> 47:49.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to have to develop
other approaches.

47:49.100 --> 47:53.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Dr. Perl's
research is just
in its infancy.

47:53.637 --> 47:58.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If confirmed, it would be
evidence that PTSD,
a psychological disorder, might
partly be

47:58.976 --> 48:01.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the result of physical harm.

48:01.178 --> 48:05.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That could change the way we
diagnose and
treat the disorder.

48:05.516 --> 48:09.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you think you will ever be
able to not
only identify it, but come up
with some kind

48:09.053 --> 48:11.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a solution when you start
working in living
beings?

48:11.689 --> 48:15.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACOB FADLEY: Well, that's,
that's the ultimate
objective.

48:15.092 --> 48:17.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need to be able to find a
therapy for this.

48:17.561 --> 48:20.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need to be able to find a way
to prevent
it.

48:20.097 --> 48:25.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: The Veterans
Administration
uses the diagnosis of the
American Psychiatric

48:25.503 --> 48:27.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Association for PTSD.

48:27.638 --> 48:32.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They call it a mental disorder,
to be treated
by drugs or therapy.

48:32.543 --> 48:34.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They don't consider it a
physical injury.

48:34.478 --> 48:36.313 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

48:36.347 --> 48:38.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAROLD KUDLER, Chief Consultant
for Mental
Health Services, Department of
Veterans Affairs:

48:38.149 --> 48:40.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A series of problems that happen
after you
have lived through an
overwhelming life event.

48:40.251 --> 48:45.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problems involve things
intruding on you,
memories, images, nightmares,
flashbacks,

48:45.890 --> 48:48.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where you feel like you're
reliving that event.

48:48.159 --> 48:53.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: The VA's chief
mental health
consultant is Dr. Harold Kudler.

48:53.464 --> 48:55.099 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

48:55.132 --> 48:57.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAROLD KUDLER: I think, no
matter what we
find in the brain, in the blood,
on EEGs,

48:57.067 --> 49:01.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're still going to have to
have these conversations
with people and talk about what
trauma means

49:01.539 --> 49:03.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to people as part of their
recovery.

49:03.774 --> 49:08.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Fadley's film
school thesis
is called "Into the Trenches"
and focuses

49:08.312 --> 49:09.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on his struggles.

49:09.280 --> 49:11.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Depression on a scale of
one to 10?

49:11.549 --> 49:12.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JACOB FADLEY: Three.

49:12.716 --> 49:16.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Anxiety on a scale of one
to 10?

49:16.187 --> 49:17.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JACOB FADLEY: Seven.

49:18.022 --> 49:21.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Feeling emotionally numb
or being unable
to have loving feelings for
those close to

49:21.458 --> 49:22.426 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you?

49:22.459 --> 49:24.295 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JACOB FADLEY: Quite a bit.

49:24.328 --> 49:27.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Fadley hopes
research will
one day give him the comfort of
knowing what's

49:27.932 --> 49:29.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going wrong inside his head.

49:30.000 --> 49:33.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACOB FADLEY: It makes you feel
like you're
not crazy.

49:33.237 --> 49:36.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can point to something to
someone else
and say, do you see this?

49:36.740 --> 49:38.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This thing did it.

49:38.309 --> 49:42.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm
Soledad O'Brien in Los Angeles.

49:42.746 --> 49:48.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There is more
reporting on
PTSD, including four profiles of
military

49:48.853 --> 49:51.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
veterans working through the
disorder.

49:51.188 --> 50:02.499 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's at PBS.org/"NewsHour."

50:02.533 --> 50:07.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Finally tonight, doctor and
author Andrew
Lam offers his Humble Opinion of
how affirmative

50:07.872 --> 50:10.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
action in college admissions
should evolve.

50:10.674 --> 50:12.176 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

50:12.209 --> 50:14.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW LAM, Author: There are
lots of stereotypes
about Asian Americans.

50:15.012 --> 50:16.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I probably fit some of them.

50:16.347 --> 50:17.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I did well in school.

50:17.381 --> 50:18.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I played a couple instruments.

50:18.749 --> 50:20.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I went to Yale and became a
doctor.

50:20.784 --> 50:23.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I now volunteer to interview
Yale applicants
each year.

50:23.988 --> 50:28.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My ties to the college are
strong, especially
since my dad also went there in
the 1960s.

50:28.959 --> 50:32.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the time, there were only
about 10 Asians
in his class.

50:32.129 --> 50:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Asians make up about a
fifth of the
students on campus.

50:35.933 --> 50:40.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, there are now so many
Asians at elite
colleges that many Asians fear
affirmative

50:40.604 --> 50:44.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
action makes colleges hold them
to a higher
standard.

50:44.475 --> 50:47.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Asian students straight out ask
me if being
Asian will hurt their chances,
or if it's

50:48.012 --> 50:51.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
better to mark their race as
other, instead
of Asian.

50:51.682 --> 50:53.217 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Seriously?

50:53.250 --> 50:57.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have reached the point where
kids are afraid
to admit their own ethnicity?

50:57.087 --> 50:58.289 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's true.

50:58.322 --> 51:01.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, sadly, it appears their
concerns are
not unfounded.

51:01.592 --> 51:06.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One study showed Asians had to
score higher
on the SAT than all other
ethnicities to get

51:06.463 --> 51:08.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into top colleges.

51:08.365 --> 51:12.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a recent lawsuit, Harvard was
accused of
using race quotas and
maintaining a cap on

51:12.937 --> 51:14.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Asian enrollment for decades.

51:14.972 --> 51:18.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To me, the worst part of this
isn't that some
kid who looks like my son won't
get into the

51:19.009 --> 51:20.611 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Ivy League.

51:20.644 --> 51:25.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's that truly disadvantaged
Asians get lumped
in with model minority Asians.

51:25.816 --> 51:30.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are economically
disadvantaged students
from Laotian, Cambodian and
Hmong communities.

51:30.688 --> 51:35.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are Pakistani and South
Asian students
whose parents scrape by working
100-hour weeks.

51:35.859 --> 51:39.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Affirmative action has the
potential to hurt
these individuals most of all.

51:39.730 --> 51:41.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But let's be fair.

51:41.165 --> 51:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Colleges' intentions are good.

51:43.033 --> 51:47.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They use affirmative action to
craft diverse
classes because we all benefit
from exposure

51:47.104 --> 51:49.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to people of different races and
backgrounds.

51:49.373 --> 51:50.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I strongly agree with this.

51:50.908 --> 51:53.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Would I have preferred to go to
a Yale that
was predominantly Asian?

51:53.978 --> 51:54.945 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Absolutely not.

51:54.979 --> 51:56.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I support affirmative
action.

51:56.747 --> 51:59.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I also know we could do it
better.

51:59.950 --> 52:04.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We should assist students based
on socioeconomic
disadvantage, no matter their
race.

52:04.388 --> 52:07.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are rural white kids who
deserve special
preference, but aren't getting
it.

52:07.891 --> 52:11.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are affluent minority
students who may
not need that help to succeed.

52:11.862 --> 52:15.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Doing this wouldn't make sense
if it reduced
racial diversity.

52:15.366 --> 52:17.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But it doesn't have to.

52:17.167 --> 52:21.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A detailed study of colleges
that switched
to socioeconomic factors showed
the majority

52:21.372 --> 52:25.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had stable or increased black
and Hispanic
enrollment.

52:25.042 --> 52:29.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One student I interviewed worked
at a fast-food
restaurant to help support her
family.

52:29.513 --> 52:33.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another had to care for two
younger siblings,
an obligation that prevented him
from doing

52:33.384 --> 52:34.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
extracurricular activities.

52:34.685 --> 52:38.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I could tell you their races,
but should it
matter?

52:38.555 --> 52:42.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can't judge someone's
accomplishments
until you appreciate the
obstacles overcome

52:42.259 --> 52:44.061 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to achieve them.

52:44.094 --> 52:47.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if this could be a better
way of doing
affirmative action, rather than
simply looking

52:47.398 --> 52:51.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at someone's skin color or a box
they check,
maybe we should give it a try.

52:51.402 --> 52:54.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dr. Andrew Lam.

52:54.104 --> 52:55.839 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And an update before we go.

52:55.873 --> 53:00.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are reports tonight that
terrorists
are developing a bomb small
enough to fit

53:00.377 --> 53:02.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a computer laptop.

53:02.146 --> 53:07.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. intelligence officials told
multiple
news outlets that the device
could get past

53:07.184 --> 53:08.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
airport scanners.

53:09.019 --> 53:13.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier this month, the Homeland
Security
Department banned devices larger
than a cell

53:13.424 --> 53:18.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
phone on certain incoming
flights from international
airports.

53:18.128 --> 53:19.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:19.530 --> 53:20.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:20.531 --> 53:21.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Have a great weekend.

53:21.732 --> 53:35.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you, and good night.

53:35.212 --> 53:38.582 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
