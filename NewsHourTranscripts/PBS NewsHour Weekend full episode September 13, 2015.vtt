00:21.167 --> 00:22.633
I WANT TO GO THIS 100 METERS.

00:22.633 --> 00:25.167
THEY DON'T LET ME.

00:25.167 --> 00:26.200
>> Sreenivasan: WHY LIVING IN A

00:26.200 --> 00:27.200
SMALLER CITY IS COSTING YOU MORE

00:27.200 --> 00:28.733
TO FLY.

00:28.733 --> 00:31.133
AND THE RISE OF SNEAKER CULTURE.

00:31.133 --> 00:32.733

00:58.833 --> 01:00.533
FLOW OF MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES

01:00.533 --> 01:01.900
INTO EUROPE, GERMANY IS NOW

01:01.900 --> 01:03.767
LIMITING ITS WELCOME OF

01:03.767 --> 01:05.000
ARRIVALS.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.800
TODAY, GERMANY BLOCKED MIGRANT-

01:06.800 --> 01:07.767
PACKED TRAINS COMING FROM

01:07.767 --> 01:09.267
AUSTRIA AND ANNOUNCED NEW BORDER

01:09.267 --> 01:10.200
CHECKS.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.333
THE MOVE CAME AFTER GERMANY HAD

01:11.333 --> 01:13.533
ACCEPTED 16,000 REFUGEES THIS

01:13.533 --> 01:14.700
WEEKEND.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.833
8,500 MIGRANTS CROSSED FROM

01:16.833 --> 01:18.433
EUROPE'S BUSIEST ARRIVAL POINT,

01:18.433 --> 01:19.833

01:19.833 --> 01:21.567
MACEDONIA, A ONE-DAY RECORD

ACCORDING TO THE UNITED NATIONS.

01:23.467 --> 01:25.900
BUT 28 MIGRANTS DIED TRYING TO

01:25.900 --> 01:27.833
REACH GREECE TODAY, DROWNING

01:27.833 --> 01:29.367
WHEN THEIR WOODEN BOAT CARRYING

01:29.367 --> 01:31.300
130 PEOPLE CAPSIZED IN THE

01:31.300 --> 01:33.000
AEGEAN SEA.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.267
MORE THAN 2,700 PEOPLE HAVE DIED

01:35.267 --> 01:37.000
THIS YEAR DURING SEA CROSSINGS,

01:37.000 --> 01:39.667

01:39.667 --> 01:40.767
REFUGEES SEEKING ASYLUM-- HAVE

01:40.767 --> 01:42.600
MADE IT.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.200
OVER THE PAST WEEK, OUR PBS

01:44.200 --> 01:45.233
NEWSHOUR TEAM OF WILLIAM

BRANGHAM, JON GERBERG, AND

01:46.833 --> 01:48.533
SASKIA DE MELKER HAS BEEN IN

01:48.533 --> 01:49.633
EUROPE COVERING THE MASSIVE

01:49.633 --> 01:51.067
MIGRATION OF REFUGEES FROM THE

01:51.067 --> 01:52.333
MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA, AND

01:52.333 --> 01:53.600
AFGHANISTAN.

01:53.600 --> 01:54.633
THE NEW ARRIVALS STRUGGLE TO

01:54.633 --> 01:55.833
MAKE THEIR WAY FROM SOUTHERN AND

01:55.833 --> 01:57.200
EASTERN EUROPE-- GREECE,

01:57.200 --> 02:00.400
MACEDONIA, SERBIA, AND HUNGARY--

02:00.400 --> 02:02.767
TO WEALTHIER, MORE WELCOMING

02:02.767 --> 02:04.700
COUNTRIES IN THE NORTH AND WEST,

02:04.700 --> 02:06.000
LIKE AUSTRIA, GERMANY, AND

02:06.000 --> 02:07.633
SWEDEN.

02:07.633 --> 02:08.967
TONIGHT, OUR TEAM FILES THIS

02:08.967 --> 02:10.133
REPORT ABOUT THEIR JOURNEY AND

02:10.133 --> 02:11.267
THE PEOPLE THEY MET.

02:11.267 --> 02:11.933
IT IS PRESENTED BY WILLIAM

02:11.933 --> 02:13.700
BRANGHAM.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.767
>> SITS RIGHT ON THE BORDER WITH

02:15.767 --> 02:17.000
SERBIA.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.567
HERE, ONE WEEK AGO, WE WADE INTO

02:18.567 --> 02:20.033
THE RIVER OF REFUGEES FLOWING

02:20.033 --> 02:21.500
FROM THE MIDDLE EAST TO WESTERN

02:21.500 --> 02:22.800
EUROPE.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.200
WE MEET OUR SHARE OF IRAQIS,

02:24.200 --> 02:26.267
AFGHANS, NORTH AFRICANS BUT MOST

02:26.267 --> 02:28.433
OF THE PEOPLE HERE ARE SYRIAN,

02:28.433 --> 02:31.733
FLEEING THEIR NATION'S FOUR-AND-

02:31.733 --> 02:34.300
A-HALF-YEAR-OLD CIVIL WAR.

02:34.300 --> 02:35.367
PEOPLE LIKE THE HALABI FAMILY,

02:35.367 --> 02:40.633
SAID, HIS WIFE, TWO YOUNG SONS

02:40.633 --> 02:41.333
AND 14-YEAR-OLD MARIA.

02:41.333 --> 02:42.200
>> WE ARE SO-- EVERYONE IS

02:42.200 --> 02:43.433
TRAVELING THIS WAY.

02:43.433 --> 02:44.533
SO WE DECIDED TO TRAVEL JUST

02:44.533 --> 02:50.767
LIKE THEM.

02:50.767 --> 02:51.833
WE'VE BEEN TRAVELING LIKE TWO

02:51.833 --> 02:52.933
WEEKS AGO.

02:52.933 --> 02:56.700
TURKEY, GREECE, MACEDONIA,

02:56.700 --> 02:58.700
SERBIA AND THEN WE'RE HERE.

02:58.700 --> 02:59.733
>> HUNGARY MORE SO THAN

02:59.733 --> 03:01.067
ALMOST ANY OTHER EUROPEAN

03:01.067 --> 03:02.000
NATION IS DOING EVERYTHING

03:02.000 --> 03:03.533
IT CAN TO SLOW THE ARRIVAL

03:03.533 --> 03:04.733
OF THESE REFUGEES.

03:04.733 --> 03:05.967
BUT THE GOVERNMENT JUST

03:05.967 --> 03:08.767
CAN'T BUILD FENCES FAST

03:08.767 --> 03:09.967
ENOUGH.

03:09.967 --> 03:11.700
THE POLICE SEEM OVERWHELMED

03:11.700 --> 03:13.167
BY THE TASK AT HAND.

03:13.167 --> 03:14.567
THE CAMPS THEY BUILD QUICKLY

03:14.567 --> 03:16.333
FILL TO CAPACITY, SO THIS

03:16.333 --> 03:17.167
MUDDY FIELD IS WHERE

03:17.167 --> 03:18.533
EVERYONE ELSE GETS PUT.

03:18.533 --> 03:19.567
THE RESULTS HERE ARE

03:19.567 --> 03:20.567
CHANGING CONSTANTLY.

03:20.567 --> 03:22.167
ONE DAY REFUGEES CAN CROSS

03:22.167 --> 03:23.467
THE PATH BETWEEN THE FIELDS

03:23.467 --> 03:25.233
AND ANOTHER DAY THEY CAN'T.

03:25.233 --> 03:29.567
>> I JUST COME, I WANT TO GO

03:29.567 --> 03:31.133
THIS 100 METER.

03:31.133 --> 03:32.033
THEY DON'T LET ME.

03:32.033 --> 03:33.133
>> WE HOPE TO FOLLOW THE

03:33.133 --> 03:34.967
ROUTING MY GRANTS TAKE FROM

03:34.967 --> 03:36.400
HERE TO POINTS NORTH TO THE

03:36.400 --> 03:37.600
NATIONS WHO WELCOME THEIR

03:37.600 --> 03:39.533
ARRIVAL BUT IT IS CONFUSING.

03:39.533 --> 03:41.933
THE HALABI FAMILY TRIES HARD

03:41.933 --> 03:43.700
TO FOLLOW THE RULES WAITING

03:43.700 --> 03:44.700
PATIENTLY, DOING WHAT POLICE

03:44.700 --> 03:45.933
ASK, CLEANING UP THE TRASH

03:45.933 --> 03:46.833
WHEN THEY CAN.

03:46.833 --> 03:48.300
BUT SAID IS FRUSTRATED.

03:48.300 --> 03:50.767
>> WE DO RESPECT THE LAW.

03:50.767 --> 03:54.333
AND WE HOPE THAT THEY

03:54.333 --> 03:56.933
UNDERSTAND THIS.

03:56.933 --> 03:58.133
IF THERE IS A PROCEDURE,

03:58.133 --> 03:59.733
EVERYONE WILL FOLLOW THE

03:59.733 --> 04:01.433
PROCEDURE.

04:01.433 --> 04:02.467
BUT OPPORTUNITY, NOTHING IS

04:02.467 --> 04:03.133
CLEAR FOR US.

04:03.133 --> 04:04.233
>> THEY PACK UP AND WAIT IN

04:04.233 --> 04:05.767
LINE FOR HOURS FOR BUSES TO

04:05.767 --> 04:07.133
TAKE THEM FARTHER NORTH BUT

04:07.133 --> 04:08.067
NOT NECESSARILY WHERE THEY

04:08.067 --> 04:09.733
WANT TO GO.

04:09.733 --> 04:11.267
THEY'LL LIKELY END UP STUCK

04:11.267 --> 04:12.733
IN HUNGARIAN PROCESSING

04:12.733 --> 04:13.333
CENTERS WHOSE CONDITIONS

04:13.333 --> 04:14.700
HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED BY HUMAN

04:14.700 --> 04:15.933
RIGHTS WATCH AS QUOTE

04:15.933 --> 04:16.333
ABYSMAL.

04:16.333 --> 04:18.033
BUT THE BUSES DON'T COME SO

04:18.033 --> 04:19.700
IT WILL BE ANOTHER NIGHT

04:19.700 --> 04:20.533
SLEEPING ON THE GROUND.

04:20.533 --> 04:22.033
EITHER WAY, THEIR GOAL OF

04:22.033 --> 04:23.533
GETTING TO SWEDEN WHICH THEY

04:23.533 --> 04:24.767
HAVE HEARD HAVE GREAT

04:24.767 --> 04:26.033
SCHOOLS FOR THEIR KIDS IS

04:26.033 --> 04:27.967
PUT OFF FOR ANOTHER DAY AT

04:27.967 --> 04:30.767
LEAST.

04:30.767 --> 04:32.400
OTHERS GROW IMPATIENT AT THE

04:32.400 --> 04:34.133
CONDITIONS AND BEING HELD BY

04:34.133 --> 04:35.167
POLICE AND THEY CHOOSE TO

04:35.167 --> 04:36.133
BREAK THROUGH POLICE LINES

04:36.133 --> 04:38.833
TO SET OFF ON FOOT, HOPING

04:38.833 --> 04:40.033
FOR STRENGTH AND SAFETY IN

04:40.033 --> 04:40.500
NUMBERS.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.700
AFTER THEIR BREAKOUT, THE

04:42.700 --> 04:44.167
KAD O, R FAMILY HIDES IN A

04:44.167 --> 04:45.333
FIELD WAITING FOR NIGHT FALL

04:45.333 --> 04:46.933
TO MAKE A MORE DISCREET

04:46.933 --> 04:47.700
ESCAPE.

04:47.700 --> 04:48.767
IN TWO MORE DAYS THEY WILL

04:48.767 --> 04:50.467
MAKE IT INTO AUSTRIA SENDING

04:50.467 --> 04:52.133
US PHOTOS OF THEM IN A

04:52.133 --> 04:53.233
REFUGEE CENTER RUN BY THE

04:53.233 --> 04:54.333
RED CROSS.

04:54.333 --> 04:56.100
NEXT WE LEAVE HUNGARY'S

04:56.100 --> 04:57.333
SOUTHERN BORDER AND DRIVE

04:57.333 --> 04:58.700
NORTH TOWARDS THE CAPITOL,

04:58.700 --> 05:00.367
BUDAPEST, THE MAIN TRANSIT

05:00.367 --> 05:01.467
POINT FOR REFUGEES.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.233
IT IS A 110 MILE TREK BUT

05:03.233 --> 05:04.267
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY WE FIND

05:04.267 --> 05:06.800
THOSE IN THE AS LUCKY AS THE

05:06.800 --> 05:08.067
KADOR FAMILY THIS IS AN

05:08.067 --> 05:08.933
AFGHAN FAMILY WE WERE

05:08.933 --> 05:09.767
TALKING TO ON THE SIDE OF

05:09.767 --> 05:11.000
THE ROAD HEADED IN THIS

05:11.000 --> 05:11.800
DIRECTION.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.600
BUT THE POLICE CAME BY,

05:13.600 --> 05:14.967
STOPPED THEM AND TOLD THEM

05:14.967 --> 05:16.300
NOW THEY CAN'T GO TO THE

05:16.300 --> 05:17.233
TRAIN STATION AS THEY

05:17.233 --> 05:17.567
WANTED.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.267
THEY HAVE TO BE TAKEN TO A

05:19.267 --> 05:20.700
CAMP, FROM WHAT WE HAVE BEEN

05:20.700 --> 05:21.833
TOLD, SOME OF THESE CAMPS

05:21.833 --> 05:23.100
MEAN THAT YOU CAN BE STUCK

05:23.100 --> 05:23.700
FOR WEEKS.

05:23.700 --> 05:24.767
SO THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE

05:24.767 --> 05:26.333
HEADED TO A TRAIN STATION,

05:26.333 --> 05:27.567
EVENTUALLY ON THE WAY TO

05:27.567 --> 05:28.267
GERMANY.

05:28.267 --> 05:29.367
NOW IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT IS

05:29.367 --> 05:30.467
GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THEM.

05:30.467 --> 05:31.700
>> FURTHER ALONG THE HIGHWAY

05:31.700 --> 05:33.100
TO BUDAPEST WE SPOT TWO

05:33.100 --> 05:35.133
YOUNG AFGHAN MEN SEEKING

05:35.133 --> 05:36.400
SHELTER UNDERNEATH AN

05:36.400 --> 05:36.933
OVERPASS.

05:36.933 --> 05:38.500
TRAVELING OUT IN THE OPEN IN

05:38.500 --> 05:39.533
HUNGARY WITHOUT A PROPER

05:39.533 --> 05:41.133
VISA OR I.D. USUALLY ENDS

05:41.133 --> 05:42.433
THIS WAY.

05:42.433 --> 05:43.700
>> THESE MEN, DO YOU KNOW

05:43.700 --> 05:44.900
WHERE THEY WILL BE TAKEN?

05:44.900 --> 05:50.300
>> THE POLICE STATION.

05:50.300 --> 05:52.167
>> AFTER THAT THE IMMIGRANT

05:52.167 --> 05:53.433
CAMP.

05:53.433 --> 05:54.700
>> TO AN IMMIGRANT CAMP

05:54.700 --> 05:56.233
IN-- IN BUDAPEST?

05:56.233 --> 05:58.000
IN AUSTRIA.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.767
>> SORRY, BUT I-- CAN'T GIVE

06:01.767 --> 06:02.333
YOU --

06:02.333 --> 06:03.867
>> WE HAVE HEARD SMUGGLERS

06:03.867 --> 06:05.700
MAKE A FORTUNE TRYING THESE

06:05.700 --> 06:07.167
ROADS PICKING UP REFUGEES

06:07.167 --> 06:08.700
AND GAS STATION AND

06:08.700 --> 06:09.967
RESTAURANTS, CHARGING

06:09.967 --> 06:10.933
EXORBITANT RATES AND

06:10.933 --> 06:12.167
PROMISING SAFE PASSAGE.

06:12.167 --> 06:13.800
ON THE HIGHWAY WE PASS BUSES

06:13.800 --> 06:15.400
WITH REFUGEES SHUTTLING THEM

06:15.400 --> 06:16.833
TO THEIR NEXT TEMPORARY

06:16.833 --> 06:17.500
STOP.

06:17.500 --> 06:18.700
I'M AT THE CENTRAL TRAIN

06:18.700 --> 06:21.433
STATION IN BUDAPEST HUNGARY.

06:21.433 --> 06:22.133
MOST OF THE REFUGEES HAVE

06:22.133 --> 06:23.733
BEEN BUSED OR SENT ON TRAINS

06:23.733 --> 06:25.167
FROM ELSEWHERE IN SOUTHERN

06:25.167 --> 06:26.700
100 GARY AND THEY HAVE BEEN

06:26.700 --> 06:27.600
WAITING TO TAKE THE NEXT

06:27.600 --> 06:28.567
TRAIN TO VIENNA AND FURTHER

06:28.567 --> 06:29.433
NORTH.

06:29.433 --> 06:30.167
>> HOW LONG YOU HAVE BEEN

06:30.167 --> 06:30.933
WAITING HERE?

06:30.933 --> 06:36.500
>> I HAVE FROM THIS MORNING,.

06:36.500 --> 06:37.467
>> EVERYONE PENNED IN CLOSE.

06:37.467 --> 06:38.800
A VOLUNTEER SHOUTS

06:38.800 --> 06:40.067
INSTRUCTIONS IN ARABIC TO

06:40.067 --> 06:41.533
MOVE THIS WAY OR THAT, SIT

06:41.533 --> 06:42.433
DOWN OR STAND UP.

06:42.433 --> 06:44.000
BUT NO ONE SEEMS TO PAY HER

06:44.000 --> 06:45.267
MUCH ATTENTION.

06:45.267 --> 06:46.967
HUNGARIANS GET MOVED TO THE

06:46.967 --> 06:47.900
FRONT OF THE LINE.

06:47.900 --> 06:49.333
THEY GET THEIR OWN CARRIAGES

06:49.333 --> 06:51.867
SEPARATE FROM THE MIGRANTS

06:51.867 --> 06:53.067
ONCE THE TRAINS FINALLY

06:53.067 --> 06:53.467
COME.

06:53.467 --> 06:54.900
BECAUSE OF OVERCROWDING

06:54.900 --> 06:55.833
AUSTRIA STOPPED RUNNING

06:55.833 --> 06:57.367
TRAINS INTO HUNGARY, SO TO

06:57.367 --> 06:58.300
MAKE IT TO THE BOARDER THERE

06:58.300 --> 06:59.633
IS ANOTHER TRANSFER AN A TWO

06:59.633 --> 07:00.933
MILE WALK TO THE CHECK

07:00.933 --> 07:01.600
POINT.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.133
A FEW DAYS EARLIER THIS

07:03.133 --> 07:04.700
BOER CROSSING WAS BARRON.

07:04.700 --> 07:06.733
ON THIS NIGHT IT'S A SEA OF

07:06.733 --> 07:07.567
CONFUSION.

07:07.567 --> 07:08.700
REFUGEES COME UP TO US TO

07:08.700 --> 07:10.167
ASK, IS THIS AUSTRIA.

07:10.167 --> 07:11.700
WHERE WILL THE NEXT BUS TAKE

07:11.700 --> 07:12.033
US.

07:12.033 --> 07:14.400
WE ARE AS CONFUSED AS THEY

07:14.400 --> 07:16.867
ARE.

07:16.867 --> 07:18.167
THEY SHOUT INSTRUCTIONS IN

07:18.167 --> 07:19.167
LANGUAGES MOST OF THE

07:19.167 --> 07:21.800
REFUGEES DON'T SPEAK.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.700
HAMID IS FROM ALEPPO, A CITY

07:23.700 --> 07:26.200
A FAULTED FROM ALL SIDES, BY

07:26.200 --> 07:28.000
REBELS, BY ISIS, BY THE

07:28.000 --> 07:29.167
ASSAD REGIME.

07:29.167 --> 07:31.367
HE FLED WITH HIS WIFE, TWO

07:31.367 --> 07:32.333
KIDS, BROTHER-IN-LAW AND

07:32.333 --> 07:32.933
BEST FRIEND.

07:32.933 --> 07:34.100
AFTER WHAT THEY LIVED

07:34.100 --> 07:35.367
THROUGH THE CHAOS HERE IS

07:35.367 --> 07:36.900
TAKING IN STRIDE.

07:36.900 --> 07:39.100
>> WHAT WE CAN DO.

07:39.100 --> 07:40.467
WE LEARN SO MANY THINGS ON

07:40.467 --> 07:45.733
THIS JOURNEY.

07:45.733 --> 07:48.867
HERE, MORE SAFETY THAN WHEN

07:48.867 --> 07:53.233
WE BEFORE.

07:53.233 --> 07:54.433
>> THEY LIKE MANY OF THE

07:54.433 --> 07:55.467
REFUGEES WE MEET STILL

07:55.467 --> 07:57.167
RETAIN THEIR HOSPITALITY AND

07:57.167 --> 07:59.000
WARMTH OFFERING US FOOD AND

07:59.000 --> 08:00.700
A SPOT ON THEIR BLANKET ON

08:00.700 --> 08:01.933
THE CONCRETE FLOOR WHERE

08:01.933 --> 08:06.833
THEY WILL END UP SLEEPING

08:06.833 --> 08:10.700
TONIGHT.

08:10.700 --> 08:13.033
>> THE MARKET, EVERYTHING --

08:13.033 --> 08:14.267
>> WHAT DID YOU HOPE FOR

08:14.267 --> 08:15.967
WHEN YOU GO TO GERMANY?

08:15.967 --> 08:17.167
>> REALLY, I JUST WANT A SAFE

08:17.167 --> 08:18.167
PLACE TO STAY.

08:18.167 --> 08:19.367
>> THE NEXT AFTERNOON WE ARE

08:19.367 --> 08:22.100
IN VIENNA IN THE EXHAUSTED

08:22.100 --> 08:23.367
FAMILY FINALLY MAKES IT HERE

08:23.367 --> 08:25.233
BY BUS.

08:25.233 --> 08:26.133
HAMID BROTHER WHO IS ALREADY

08:26.133 --> 08:27.867
LIVING IN MUNICH, GERMANY

08:27.867 --> 08:29.200
HAS COME TO MEAT THEM.

08:29.200 --> 08:29.967
THANKS TO A KIND POLICE

08:29.967 --> 08:31.167
OFFICER, THEY'LL BE

08:31.167 --> 08:32.267
PERMITTED TO DRIVE A WHICH

08:32.267 --> 08:34.300
WITH HIM ACROSS THE AUSTRIAN

08:34.300 --> 08:36.067
BORDER AND ON INTO GERMANY.

08:36.067 --> 08:37.333
EVEN ON THIS UNCERTAIN ROAD,

08:37.333 --> 08:41.067
THERE ARE TURNS OF GOOD LUCK.

08:41.067 --> 08:43.333
>> RUSSIA IS

08:43.333 --> 08:44.400
>> Sreenivasan: RUSSIA IS

08:44.400 --> 08:45.300
CONTINUING TO BACK THE EMBATTLED

08:45.300 --> 08:45.933
REGIME OF SYRIAN PRESIDENT

08:46.833 --> 08:47.733
RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER SERGEI

08:47.733 --> 08:48.800
LAVROV SAID TODAY RUSSIA IS

08:48.800 --> 08:49.533
SENDING MORE WEAPONS TO THE

08:49.533 --> 08:50.333
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT AND ADVISERS

08:50.333 --> 08:51.233
TO TRAIN HIS ARMY SOLDIERS HOW

08:51.233 --> 08:52.200
TO USE THEM.

08:52.200 --> 08:53.533
RUSSIA HAS REMAINED AN ALLY OF

08:53.533 --> 08:54.333
PRESIDENT ASSAD DURING THE

08:54.333 --> 08:55.000
COUNTRY'S CIVIL WAR.

08:55.000 --> 08:55.933
THE U.S. OPPOSES ASSAD AND HAS

08:55.933 --> 09:00.500
WARNED RUSSIA THAT ARMING HIM

09:00.500 --> 09:02.867
WILL ONLY ESCALATE THE WAR AND

09:02.867 --> 09:05.333
INCREASE LOSS OF LIFE.

09:05.333 --> 09:06.867
IN THE WEST AFRICAN NATION OF

09:06.867 --> 09:08.300
CAMEROON, THE ISLAMIC MILITANT

PEOPLE IN A TOWN NEAR CAMEROON'S

09:14.733 --> 09:15.800
BORDER WITH NIGERIA, THE SECOND

09:15.800 --> 09:16.700
BOMBING NEAR A CHURCH KILLED

09:16.700 --> 09:18.067
FOUR.

09:18.067 --> 09:19.567
CAMEROON HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY

09:19.567 --> 09:21.167
ATTACKED BY BOKO HARAM, WHICH IS

09:21.167 --> 09:23.067
BASED IN NIGERIA, AND HAS

09:23.067 --> 09:24.433
CONTRIBUTED TROOPS TO A FIVE-

09:24.433 --> 09:25.500
NATION COALITION FIGHTING THE

09:25.500 --> 09:27.967
TERROR GROUP.

09:27.967 --> 09:29.133
A FAST-MOVING WILDFIRE IN

09:29.133 --> 09:30.267
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS FORCED

09:30.267 --> 09:31.200
THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS TO

09:31.200 --> 09:33.567
EVACUATE THEIR HOMES.

09:33.567 --> 09:35.600
THE FIRE HAS GROWN FROM 10,000

09:35.600 --> 09:37.700
TO 40,000 ACRES SINCE IT BEGAN

09:37.700 --> 09:38.767
YESTERDAY AND HAS CAUSED HEAVY

09:38.767 --> 09:39.767
DAMAGE IN AND AROUND MIDDLETOWN,

09:39.767 --> 09:41.300
CALIFORNIA.

09:41.300 --> 09:43.467
THE FIRE, IN LAKE AND NAPA

09:43.467 --> 09:45.000
COUNTIES, 100 MILES NORTH OF SAN

09:45.000 --> 09:46.300

09:46.300 --> 09:47.133
OF HOMES, BUSINESSES, AND A

09:47.133 --> 09:49.267
SCHOOL.

09:49.267 --> 09:50.367
MORE THAN A THOUSAND

09:50.367 --> 09:51.867
FIREFIGHTERS ARE FIGHTING THAT

09:51.867 --> 09:53.167
BLAZE, AND HUNDREDS OF

09:54.233 --> 09:57.467
RESIDENTS FLEE TO SHELTERS.

09:57.467 --> 09:59.800
>> AS WE CAME DOWN IT WAS JUST

09:59.800 --> 10:01.900
FIRE EVERYWHERE AND ALL THE

10:01.900 --> 10:04.633
HOUSES, NEIGHBOR HOUSES,

10:04.633 --> 10:05.700
FRIEND'S HOUSE, EVERYBODY'S

10:05.700 --> 10:06.633
HOUSES ARE BURNING UP.

10:06.633 --> 10:08.867
IT'S AWFUL.

10:08.867 --> 10:10.900
BUT WE'RE HERE AND WE ARE SAFE.

10:10.900 --> 10:13.000
>> EVERYTHING BEHIND THE GAS

10:13.000 --> 10:14.367
STATION IS GONE, SCHOOL IS GONE,

10:14.367 --> 10:17.233
STORE'S GONE, AND A LOT OF

10:17.233 --> 10:18.967
PEOPLE HAVE DOGS STUCK UP THERE,

10:18.967 --> 10:20.733
AND THEY WON'T LET THEM GO GET

10:20.733 --> 10:22.767
THEM, SO JUST KIND OF WAITING.

10:22.767 --> 10:23.933
>> Sreenivasan: A LARGER

10:23.933 --> 10:25.300
WILDFIRE THAT BROKE OUT

10:25.300 --> 10:26.633
WEDNESDAY 70 MILES SOUTHEAST OF

10:26.633 --> 10:27.933
SACRAMENTO HAS BURNED MORE THAN

10:27.933 --> 10:29.533
80 HOMES TO THE GROUND.

10:29.533 --> 10:31.767
THERE ARE 13 ACTIVE WILDFIRES IN

10:31.767 --> 10:42.000
THE DROUGHT-RIDDEN STATE.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.233
IF AND WHEN THE FEDERAL RESERVE

10:44.233 --> 10:45.900
BANK RAISES INTEREST RATES, AS

10:45.900 --> 10:47.767
IT IS WIDELY EXPECTED TO DO

10:47.767 --> 10:49.467
POSSIBLY THIS WEEK, IT WOULD BE

10:49.467 --> 10:50.500
THE FED'S FIRST RATE HIKE SINCE

10:50.500 --> 10:51.367
BEFORE THE 2008 FINANCIAL

10:51.367 --> 10:52.967
CRISIS.

10:52.967 --> 10:54.467
THE COST OF YOUR HOME MORTGAGE

10:54.467 --> 10:55.333
AND BORROWING MONEY FOR JUST

10:55.333 --> 10:56.433
ABOUT ANYTHING WILL LIKELY GO

10:56.433 --> 10:57.867
UP.

10:57.867 --> 10:59.300
THERE WILL BE DEEP CONSEQUENCES

10:59.300 --> 11:01.133
FOR CORPORATIONS TOO."

11:01.133 --> 11:02.100
FINANCIAL TIMES" REPORTER ERIC

11:02.100 --> 11:03.000
PLATT JOINS ME NOW FOR SOME

11:03.000 --> 11:06.400
INSIGHT.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.600
HOW DID COMPANIES TAKE

11:07.600 --> 11:09.967
ADVANTAGE OF THESE NEAR 0

11:09.967 --> 11:11.100
PERCENT INTEREST RATES, CHEAP

11:11.100 --> 11:13.000
MONEY OVER THE PAST SIX, SEVEN

11:13.000 --> 11:14.067
EIGHT YEARS?

11:14.067 --> 11:15.300
>> OVER THE PAST THREE YEAR

11:15.300 --> 11:16.833
AS WE'VE SEEN MORE THAN A

11:16.833 --> 11:18.100
TRILLION DOLLARS OF ISSUANCE

11:18.100 --> 11:20.033
EACH YEAR AND IT ACCELERATED

11:20.033 --> 11:21.167
EACH YEAR AS THEY TRY TO

11:21.167 --> 11:22.267
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CHEAP

11:22.267 --> 11:24.200
BORROWING COSTS, TO FUND

11:24.200 --> 11:25.400
BUYBACKS AN PURCHASE OTHER

11:25.400 --> 11:26.933
COMPANIES IN A RECORD WAVE

11:26.933 --> 11:29.133
OF MERGERS AN ACQUISITIONS.

11:29.133 --> 11:30.333
>> SO THIS IS HOW THEY ARE

11:30.333 --> 11:31.333
ABLE TO GIVE SOME OF THOSE

11:31.333 --> 11:32.933
STOCK DIVIDENDS OR TO

11:32.933 --> 11:33.567
INVESTORS.

11:33.567 --> 11:34.467
>> EXACTLY.

11:34.467 --> 11:35.700
INSTEAD OF USING CASH THAT

11:35.700 --> 11:38.800
THEY HAVE, THEY CAN TAP DEBT

11:38.800 --> 11:40.733
MARKETS NEARLY UNLIMITEDLY.

11:40.733 --> 11:42.100
WE'VE SEEN APPLE DOING IT.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.733
THEY HAVE CASH OVERSEAS BUT

11:43.733 --> 11:45.000
THEY RADIO RATHER NOT TAKE A

11:45.000 --> 11:45.933
TAX HIT ON.

11:45.933 --> 11:46.967
INSTEAD THEY ISSUE BONDS

11:46.967 --> 11:48.400
HERE TO PAY BACK DIVIDENDS

11:48.400 --> 11:50.267
TO SHAREHOLDERS OR BUY BACK

11:50.267 --> 11:50.733
SHARES.

11:50.733 --> 11:52.133
>> SO APP SELL A BIG

11:52.133 --> 11:52.867
SUCCESSFUL COMPANY.

11:52.867 --> 11:53.700
I GET THAT.

11:53.700 --> 11:55.100
BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE

11:55.100 --> 11:56.533
RATES START TO CREEP UP

11:56.533 --> 11:57.700
LITTLE BY LITTLE AND THE

11:57.700 --> 11:59.767
COST OF BORROWING GETS MORE

11:59.767 --> 12:00.833
EXPENSIVE.

12:00.833 --> 12:01.533
>> SO THE COMPANIES YOU

12:01.533 --> 12:03.333
WOULD BE LOOKING AT WOULD BE

12:03.333 --> 12:04.433
ANYTHING IN SPECULATIVE

12:04.433 --> 12:05.700
GRADE, PARTICULARLY THE

12:05.700 --> 12:06.933
ENERGY CENTER WHICH HAS BEEN

12:06.933 --> 12:08.700
HIT BY THE DROP IN COMMODITY

12:08.700 --> 12:09.267
PRICES.

12:09.267 --> 12:10.600
ALSO COMPANIES LIKE AMERICAN

12:10.600 --> 12:11.933
APPAREL IS STRUGGLING UNDER

12:11.933 --> 12:13.900
A DEBT LOAD, COMPANIES LIKE

12:13.900 --> 12:16.100
SEARS AND J.C. PENNEY WHICH

12:16.100 --> 12:17.567
STRUGGLED WITH THE RISE OF

12:17.567 --> 12:18.033
AMAZON.

12:18.033 --> 12:19.000
ANYONE THAT BORROWED HEAVILY

12:19.000 --> 12:20.367
OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS TO

12:20.367 --> 12:21.300
FINANCE THEIR OPERATIONS OR

12:21.300 --> 12:22.300
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO TURN

12:22.300 --> 12:23.167
AROUND THEIR OPERATION WAS

12:23.167 --> 12:25.367
BE A THREAT.

12:25.367 --> 12:26.567
>> Sreenivasan: SO THOSE

12:26.567 --> 12:27.800
COMPANIES WE COULD SEE THEM

12:27.800 --> 12:29.067
START TO DEFAULT ON SOME

12:29.067 --> 12:30.467
THEIR LOANS BECAUSE IT'S NOT

12:30.467 --> 12:31.367
SO CHEAP ANY MORE?

12:31.367 --> 12:32.567
>> THAT WON'T BE THE MAIN

12:32.567 --> 12:32.900
CONCERN.

12:32.900 --> 12:35.000
IT WOULD BE IF ENERGY PRICES

12:35.000 --> 12:36.200
CONTINUE TO STAY DOWN HERE.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.800
HOWEVER, THE ISSUE IS IF

12:37.800 --> 12:38.900
THEY WERE ABLE TO FINANCE

12:38.900 --> 12:40.000
THEIR OPERATIONS OVER THE

12:40.000 --> 12:41.700
PAST YEARS WITH DEBT

12:41.700 --> 12:42.700
ISSUANCE AND NOW THEY COME

12:42.700 --> 12:44.600
TO THE MARKET IN 2016 OR

12:44.600 --> 12:45.933
2017 AND INVESTORS AREN'T

12:45.933 --> 12:46.367
INTERESTED.

12:46.367 --> 12:47.700
THEY MIGHT NOT BE INTERESTED

12:47.700 --> 12:49.433
IN PAYING 6% OR 7% INTEREST

12:49.433 --> 12:51.033
RATES IF THEY CAN GET ACCESS

12:51.033 --> 12:51.733
AT ALL.

12:51.733 --> 12:53.400
>> WHAT HAPPENS ON A

12:53.400 --> 12:54.367
CONSUMER FRONT, WHAT IS THE

12:54.367 --> 12:56.300
RIPPLE EFFECT IF THERE IS

12:56.300 --> 12:58.400
THIS CONTRACTION IN

12:58.400 --> 12:59.433
LIQUIDITY FOR COMPANIES?

12:59.433 --> 13:00.700
>> SO THAT'S WHAT THE

13:00.700 --> 13:01.833
FEDERAL RESERVE HAS BEEN

13:01.833 --> 13:02.433
LOOKING AT.

13:02.433 --> 13:03.933
THEY HAVE BEEN HOPING THAT

13:03.933 --> 13:04.867
ROBUST JOBS GROWTH WOULD

13:04.867 --> 13:06.567
TAKE AWAY ANY KIND OF

13:06.567 --> 13:07.400
DEFAULT YOU WOULD SEE.

13:07.400 --> 13:09.033
SO IF THESE COMPANIES DO

13:09.033 --> 13:10.800
FAIL, I WOULD HOPE THESE JOB

13:10.800 --> 13:12.133
WAS BE MADE UP ELSEWHERE,

13:12.133 --> 13:13.000
THEY COULD GO TO THE

13:13.000 --> 13:14.133
HEALTH-CARE SECTOR,

13:14.133 --> 13:15.033
EDUCATION WHICH HAS BEEN

13:15.033 --> 13:16.700
ADDING JOBS AT A FAST CLIP.

13:16.700 --> 13:18.267
THAT SAID, THEIR CONCERN IS

13:18.267 --> 13:19.367
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE DIPS A

13:19.367 --> 13:20.033
LITTLE BIT.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.733
IF YOU SEE BIG COMPANIES GO

13:21.733 --> 13:23.700
UNDER, IN THE ENERGY SECTOR,

13:23.700 --> 13:24.967
IF SUDDENLY CONSUMERS DON'T

13:24.967 --> 13:26.400
WANT TO-- THEY SPEND A

13:26.400 --> 13:27.700
LITTLE LESS SO THEY PULL OUT

GOING INTO THIS WEEK, THE

13:31.700 --> 13:33.267

13:33.267 --> 13:34.900

13:34.900 --> 13:35.467
WHAT?

13:35.467 --> 13:37.333

13:37.333 --> 13:38.433

13:39.300 --> 13:39.900
BET NOW.

13:39.900 --> 13:43.100
THEY SAY THE FED RANTS

13:43.100 --> 13:44.400
TO-- THEY SAY THE FEDERAL

13:44.400 --> 13:46.000
RESERVES WANTS TO GET AHEAD,

13:46.000 --> 13:47.867
SO IF WE SEE ECONOMIC GROWTH

13:47.867 --> 13:48.967
SLOW THEY COULD LOWER RATES

13:48.967 --> 13:50.833
TO SPUR BORROWING COSTS BUT

13:50.833 --> 13:51.767
TRADERS DON'T THINK THEY

13:51.767 --> 13:52.200
WILL.

13:52.200 --> 13:53.367

FEWER FLIGHTS IN THE U.S. AS

14:28.967 --> 14:30.500
STABLE, INCREASING AROUND ONE

14:30.500 --> 14:31.967
PERCENT ON AVERAGE FROM 2007 TO

14:31.967 --> 14:33.967

NUMBER OF PASSENGER SEATS

14:42.233 --> 14:42.800
AVAILABLE BY 1.6%.

WHY IS THIS DISPARITY

HAPPENING?

15:01.967 --> 15:03.500
PAST SEVEN YEARS OR SO

15:03.500 --> 15:05.200
THERE'S BEEN DRAMATIC

15:05.200 --> 15:06.433
TRANSFOR PASSION IN THE U.S.

15:06.433 --> 15:07.533
AIRLINE, THERE WAS A

15:07.533 --> 15:08.733
BANKRUPTCY WITH AMERICAN

15:08.733 --> 15:10.333
AIRLINES, FOUR BIG MERGERS

15:10.333 --> 15:11.300
COMBINED EIGHT INTO FOUR.

15:11.300 --> 15:12.467
AND VOLATILE FUEL PRICES

15:12.467 --> 15:14.267
HAVE CAUSED A SHIFT IN

15:14.267 --> 15:15.400
STRATEGY THAT REALLY HAVE

15:15.400 --> 15:16.300
CAUSED AIRLINES TO LOOK MORE

15:16.300 --> 15:17.333
AT PROFITS RATHER THAN

15:17.333 --> 15:18.400
CHASING MARKET SHARE.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.133
AS A RESULT, WHAT WE'VE SEEN

15:20.133 --> 15:22.067
IS THEY ARE PULLING SERVICE

15:22.067 --> 15:23.833
AT SOME OF THESE SMALL TORE

15:23.833 --> 15:25.300
MIDSIZE CITIES AND

15:25.300 --> 15:26.700
CONSOLIDATING THEIR

15:32.167 --> 15:33.100
ADDED FLIGHTS TO PLACES

15:33.100 --> 15:34.267
WHERE THE ECONOMY IS DOING

15:34.267 --> 15:35.233
BETTER WHERE PEOPLE CAN

15:35.233 --> 15:36.833
AFFORD TO FLY AND LA CROSSE,

15:36.833 --> 15:37.900
WISCONSIN PROBABLY DOESN'T

WASHINGTON DOES.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.133

15:44.133 --> 15:47.067

15:47.067 --> 15:48.000

15:48.000 --> 15:49.033
THIS THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY

15:49.033 --> 15:50.833
FOR MANY YEARS WAS FOCUSED

15:50.833 --> 15:51.900
ON MARKET SHARE.

15:51.900 --> 15:52.900
IT MEANT A LOT OF

15:52.900 --> 15:53.600
COMPETITION AND A LOT OF

15:53.600 --> 15:55.033
FLIGHTS IN THE SMALLER TO

15:55.033 --> 15:56.133
MIDSIZED CITIES BUT THE NEW

15:56.133 --> 15:57.600
REALITY IS AIRLINES ARE

15:57.600 --> 15:58.933
REALLY CUTTING BACK SOME OF

15:58.933 --> 16:00.300
THESE SMALLER PLANES AND

16:00.300 --> 16:01.333
SMALLER ROUTES.

16:01.333 --> 16:03.533
AND AS A RESULT, FLIERS ARE

16:03.533 --> 16:05.333
HAVING TO OFTENTIMES CONNECT

16:05.333 --> 16:06.933
AT SOME OF THESE MEGAHUBS IF

16:06.933 --> 16:08.367
THEY ARE LIVING IN ONE OF

16:08.367 --> 16:09.700
THE MIDSIZE CITIES OR DRIVER

16:09.700 --> 16:13.433
AN HOUR TO BIGGER AIRPORTS.

16:13.433 --> 16:14.567
>> DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE

16:14.567 --> 16:15.800
PRICES ARE GETTING LOWER OR

16:15.800 --> 16:16.233
HIGHER.

16:16.233 --> 16:17.700
>> PRICES ARE LARGELY STABLE

16:17.700 --> 16:19.200
AT SOME OF THE MEGAHUBS SO

16:19.200 --> 16:20.500
IF YOU ARE LIVING IN ONE OF

16:20.500 --> 16:22.367
THESE CITIES, IT'S GOOD NEWS

16:22.367 --> 16:23.933
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF

16:23.933 --> 16:25.167
OPTIONS AND PRICES ARE

16:25.167 --> 16:25.833
MAINLY STABLE.

16:25.833 --> 16:27.033
BUT AIR LANES ARE CUTTING

16:27.033 --> 16:29.133
BACK AT SOME OF THE SMALLER

16:29.133 --> 16:30.767
TO MIDSIZED CITIES AND AS A

16:30.767 --> 16:32.100
RESULT PRICES ARE GOING UP.

16:32.100 --> 16:34.067
WE HAVE TO SAY AS WELL,

16:34.067 --> 16:34.867
AIRFARE DON'T TELL THE WHOLE

OVER THIS PERIOD OF TIME

16:36.400 --> 16:38.967

16:40.067 --> 16:41.600
AIRLINE INDUSTRY, THERE HAS

16:41.600 --> 16:42.967
ALSO BEEN A BIG MOVE TO

16:42.967 --> 16:44.133
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF FEES

16:44.133 --> 16:45.500
ON PASSENGERS FOR THINGS

16:45.500 --> 16:47.133
LIKE CHECKED BAGGAGE AND

16:47.133 --> 16:48.100
CHANGE FEES.

16:48.100 --> 16:49.700
AND AS A RESULT, THE AVERAGE

16:49.700 --> 16:51.700
ROUND TRIP DOMESTIC PRICES

16:51.700 --> 16:52.867
HAVE SOARED NOT JUST FROM

DO ANYTHING ELSE INCLUDING

17:14.900 --> 17:16.100
TO GET YOUR BOARDING PASS

17:16.100 --> 17:18.133
FROM A HUMAN TO GET A CUP OF

START TO WALK ALONG THAT TRACK,

23:27.167 --> 23:28.367
WE START TO SEE PATHS.

SO THIS EQUIPMENT HELPS US
