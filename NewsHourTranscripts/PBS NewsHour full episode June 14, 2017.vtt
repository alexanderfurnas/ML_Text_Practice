didn't realize was a gunshot.

00:12.600 --> 00:14.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I just heard a loud pop.

00:14.766 --> 00:18.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What
we're learning about a
gunman who opened fire
on members of Congress

00:18.933 --> 00:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
during an early morning baseball
practice, shooting the third
highest ranking Republican

00:25.700 --> 00:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the House of
Representatives, Steve
Scalise, and several others.

00:28.133 --> 00:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then: A massive fire at a
London apartment tower leaves at
least a dozen dead, as rescuers

00:35.233 --> 00:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
search for people trapped
inside the 24-story tower.

00:39.400 --> 00:43.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And is there such a
thing as clean coal?

coal industry alive.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID GREESON, Vice President
of Development, NRG: We're just
now reaching the point where

00:53.733 --> 00:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this technology is mature enough
to be considered for rollout
to the broad coal-fired fleet

01:00.866 --> 01:02.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the United States

leading Republican in
the U.S. House lies
critically wounded tonight.

01:23.333 --> 01:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

along with a police officer,
a congressional staffer,

01:29.200 --> 01:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and a lobbyist, has died.

01:31.366 --> 01:35.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They came together in a
fusillade of bullets and
bloodshed early today,
just outside Washington.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

(GUNFIRE)

01:41.566 --> 01:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: For at least
five minutes, gunshots crackled
across the Northern Virginia

01:47.433 --> 01:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
baseball field where
Republican members of
Congress were practicing.

01:49.533 --> 01:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cell phone video shared with the
"NewsHour" captured a harrowing
scene of a gunfight between

01:55.433 --> 01:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the attacker and Capitol Police.

01:56.233 --> 01:57.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Hey.

01:57.233 --> 01:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that guy OK out there?

01:59.700 --> 02:02.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Has that guy been shot?

02:02.100 --> 02:03.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is he OK?

02:03.100 --> 02:05.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is anybody talking to him?

02:05.166 --> 02:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The man who
shot the video, Noah Nathan,
had been out walking his dogs.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NOAH NATHAN, Eyewitness: I saw
the congressional players, and,
you know, they're a regular

02:09.633 --> 02:11.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
here practicing in the morning.

02:11.900 --> 02:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then I heard -- I
thought it was fireworks.

02:14.366 --> 02:17.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then I heard another
one and realized, OK,
maybe that's not fireworks.

02:17.166 --> 02:19.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's gunfire.

02:19.233 --> 02:20.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then people started
scattering, and then
there was more shots
and you could hear them

02:20.766 --> 02:23.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
skimming off the gravel
and hitting the fence.

02:23.700 --> 02:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it was a helpless feeling.

02:24.700 --> 02:26.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I couldn't do anything.

02:26.733 --> 02:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As lawmakers
jumped over fences, seeking
cover, House Majority Whip

02:30.133 --> 02:33.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Steve Scalise was
shot in the hip.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Alabama Congressman
Mo Brooks saw it all.

02:34.733 --> 02:36.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:36.866 --> 02:38.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MO BROOKS (R), Alabama: It's
the feeling of helplessness,
when you have got a baseball

02:38.966 --> 02:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bat and a guy's got a rifle.

02:42.066 --> 02:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you see your friends,
Steve Scalise in particular,
lying on the ground, dragging

02:49.033 --> 02:51.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
himself from the infield dirt
to the outfield grass, and
there was nothing we could do to

02:51.366 --> 02:53.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
help him.

02:53.333 --> 02:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Georgia
Congressman Barry Loudermilk
says it wasn't a random attack.

02:55.633 --> 02:57.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:57.166 --> 02:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARRY LOUDERMILK (R), Georgia:
There were civilians out there.

02:59.166 --> 03:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were people walking their
dogs, laying on the ground
screaming and crying, but he

03:00.100 --> 03:01.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wasn't targeting them.

03:01.033 --> 03:03.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He was shooting at us.

03:03.066 --> 03:05.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Joe Barton
of Texas had taken his
young sons to the practice.

03:05.233 --> 03:07.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:07.366 --> 03:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOE BARTON (R), Texas: We got
some of us were in the dugout,
some of us were on the ground.

03:08.166 --> 03:10.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was behind the dugout.

03:10.600 --> 03:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My son Jack got under an SUV.

03:14.533 --> 03:17.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he was very brave.

03:17.333 --> 03:20.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
My other son Brad was
in the batting cage and
he also was very brave.

03:20.533 --> 03:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In the video,
you can hear people shouting
for police to shoot the gunman.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Shoot him!

03:25.033 --> 03:26.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS:
Again, Mo Brooks:

03:26.100 --> 03:28.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:28.166 --> 03:31.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MO BROOKS: The bravery that
they displayed, taking on a
guy with the rifle while they

03:31.266 --> 03:36.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have pistols, shooting from
long distance, and if they
had not been successful, then

03:38.266 --> 03:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the tragedy here would have
undoubtedly been much greater,
because those of us who were

03:40.733 --> 03:43.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the first base dugout,
we'd of had no chance.

03:43.166 --> 03:46.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS:
First-responders were on
the scene in minutes.

03:46.033 --> 03:49.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some victims were airlifted
to hospitals by helicopter.

03:49.166 --> 03:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Scalise underwent surgery and
was in critical condition.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The suspected shooter was
also taken to the hospital,
where he died of his wounds.

03:56.900 --> 04:01.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police identified him as
66-year-old James Hodgkinson
of Belleville, Illinois.

04:01.366 --> 04:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIMOTHY SLATER, FBI: Law
enforcement has reason to
believe that the shooter
has been in Alexandria,

04:07.566 --> 04:12.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Virginia, area since
March of this year.

04:12.166 --> 04:17.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The FBI has issued again
a seeking information
poster that is located
on our Web site asking

04:18.733 --> 04:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the public to come forward with
information on the shooter.

04:23.133 --> 04:28.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Florida
Congressman Ron DeSantis
believes he talked with
Hodgkinson just before

04:28.733 --> 04:29.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the shooting.

04:29.266 --> 04:31.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

04:31.333 --> 04:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RON DESANTIS (R), Florida: An
unidentified individual walked
up to the car, asked Congressman

04:33.400 --> 04:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Duncan, who was in the front
passenger seat, whether they
were Republicans or Democrats

04:37.400 --> 04:38.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the field.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was a little bit abrasive.

04:40.466 --> 04:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was something that kind of
struck me as odd, not odd to
the extent I thought he was

04:42.566 --> 04:44.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to go shoot people.

04:44.566 --> 04:48.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Already,
a picture has begun to
emerge of Hodgkinson.

04:48.566 --> 04:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A Facebook page of the same
name is filled with anti-Trump
posts, and Hodgkinson apparently

04:53.433 --> 04:56.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
volunteered for Bernie
Sanders' presidential campaign.

04:56.166 --> 04:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Vermont senator today
condemned the shooting
on the Senate floor.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:01.533 --> 05:04.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BERNIE SANDERS (I),
Vermont: I am sickened
by this despicable act.

05:04.900 --> 05:09.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And let me be as
clear as I can be.

05:11.300 --> 05:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Violence of any kind is
unacceptable in our society.

05:15.500 --> 05:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I condemn this action in
the strongest possible terms.

05:19.566 --> 05:24.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: There is a
contrast between the location
of this shooting, a neighborhood

05:24.533 --> 05:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that is known for putting up
signs of welcome and opposing
hate, and this act of violence

05:28.500 --> 05:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that some say may symbolize
rising anger in America.

05:32.433 --> 05:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the scene, Virginia Governor
Terry McAuliffe specifically
pointed to politics.

TERRY MCAULIFFE (D), Virginia:
What you saw in the last
presidential campaign, there's

05:40.566 --> 05:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just a lot of dug-in hard
feelings out there that
exist in this country today.

05:46.566 --> 05:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do think our country
has become way too divided
between red and blue.

05:50.633 --> 05:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: President
Trump echoed the cry for unity
at the White House hours after

05:54.200 --> 05:56.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the shooting.

05:56.300 --> 05:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: We may have our
differences, but we do well

05:59.133 --> 06:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in times like these to remember
that everyone who serves in
our nation's capital is here

06:06.666 --> 06:10.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because, above all,
they love our country.

06:10.900 --> 06:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The House
canceled votes for the day,
but shaken lawmakers, Democrats

06:15.600 --> 06:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Republicans alike,
gathered on the House floor
in a show of solidarity.

06:20.600 --> 06:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House: We are united.

06:23.433 --> 06:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are united in our shock,
we are united in our anguish.

06:27.433 --> 06:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
An attack on one of us is
an attack on all of us.

06:33.066 --> 06:34.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

NANCY PELOSI (D-CA),
House Minority Leader:
We cannot let that be a
victory for the assailant

06:39.700 --> 06:41.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or anyone who would
think that way.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, tomorrow, we will
go out on the field.

06:43.700 --> 06:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will root for our team.

06:45.300 --> 06:48.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We want everyone to do
his or her very best.

06:48.700 --> 06:53.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will use this occasion
as one that brings us together
and not separates us further.

06:55.400 --> 06:58.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

Congressman Scalise and one
other staffer who was shot
are in critical condition.

07:02.266 --> 07:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The others injured
today, we're told, are in
good or fair condition.

07:05.833 --> 07:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, also, about that baseball
game, it is scheduled to be,
as planned, tomorrow night.

07:11.566 --> 07:13.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are not canceling.

07:13.600 --> 07:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Judy, they're adding
another charity cause,
the Fallen Officers Fund.

07:17.100 --> 07:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Lisa, are
there changes in security as
a result of what happened?

07:23.600 --> 07:25.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: I
think the answer to
that, Judy, is not yet.

07:25.133 --> 07:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here, of course, the Capitol
is a highly secure building.

07:27.700 --> 07:28.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's no changes here.

07:28.933 --> 07:31.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
No one said there
need to be changes.

07:31.466 --> 07:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is a real
question about these
events where many members
of Congress gather in one

07:34.133 --> 07:36.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
place.

07:36.133 --> 07:39.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congressman Scalise's security
detail was there today, as
well as one other Capitol

07:39.533 --> 07:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
police officer because so
many congressmen were present.

07:42.900 --> 07:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're wondering if there
need to be more of a police
presence when there are not just

07:49.500 --> 07:51.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
leaders, but any members
of Congress gathered
in one place like that.

07:51.400 --> 07:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Lisa,
you're at that Capitol Building
every day, practically.

07:56.033 --> 07:57.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How are people
dealing with this?

07:57.833 --> 08:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think the
mood today, Judy, is sober.

08:01.133 --> 08:06.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not highly emotional, but
it's one where they are taking
very serious stock of where

08:06.100 --> 08:10.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we are as a nation and where
people are in terms of how
they look at their leaders and

08:10.600 --> 08:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
how they look at violence.

08:12.666 --> 08:16.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there's also a lot of
questions today about whether
political rhetoric has, indeed,

08:18.966 --> 08:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gone too far, and whether the
divides that affect the votes
on the House and Senate floor

08:24.833 --> 08:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are reverberating back and
forth with public divides now
rising into anger and violence.

08:30.066 --> 08:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa
Desjardins, who covers the
Capitol every day for us.

08:32.566 --> 08:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lisa, you have been on this
story all day from the moment
you heard about it this morning.

08:36.800 --> 08:37.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

08:37.833 --> 08:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: My pleasure.

08:39.900 --> 08:43.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we are now
joined by the managers of the
two congressional baseball

08:43.866 --> 08:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
teams that were practicing this
morning in different places.

08:46.833 --> 08:51.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are Republican
Representative Joe Barton
of Texas, who, as you
just saw, was at this

08:51.766 --> 08:56.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
morning's Republican baseball
practice, and Democratic
Representative Michael Doyle of

08:57.366 --> 08:58.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Pennsylvania.

08:58.600 --> 09:01.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Gentlemen, welcome
to the program.

09:01.233 --> 09:02.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Congressman Barton,
to you first.

09:02.700 --> 09:04.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First of all, we're so glad
that you are all right.

09:04.766 --> 09:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We saw that you were
there with your two sons.

09:06.833 --> 09:07.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How are you doing?

09:07.833 --> 09:08.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

09:08.833 --> 09:11.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOE BARTON: We're doing fine.

09:11.833 --> 09:14.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Everybody was looking
out for my two sons.

09:14.533 --> 09:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And thank gosh -- God that the
Capitol Police were there and
immediately returning fire,

09:21.533 --> 09:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which diverted the gunman
from attacking the members
who were on the field.

09:25.300 --> 09:29.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Did you
feel there was anything
more that could have
been done this morning?

09:29.633 --> 09:30.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

09:30.633 --> 09:31.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOE BARTON: Not really.

09:31.933 --> 09:34.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, we practice
in a public park.

09:34.733 --> 09:35.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's a dog park.

09:35.966 --> 09:37.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's a YMCA by
the baseball field.

09:37.966 --> 09:40.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There are joggers.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are -- it's just, you
know, most mornings, there are
people out doing their exercise

09:46.100 --> 09:48.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and walking their dogs.

09:48.866 --> 09:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't make any attempt
to restrict people from
watching the practice.

09:55.900 --> 09:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This individual who did the
shooting, some of the members
think they saw him yesterday,

10:01.366 --> 10:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, while I thought he had
just driven in, apparently, he
had been in the area for some

10:06.733 --> 10:09.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

10:09.300 --> 10:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I don't -- I don't
know how you can function
in an open democracy,
especially in the House

10:14.666 --> 10:19.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of Representatives,
with 435 members, and
not have public access.

10:21.100 --> 10:25.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, again, this game has been
played for about over 100 years.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's never been
anything like this before.

10:28.966 --> 10:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman
Doyle, where were you
when you heard this?

10:34.000 --> 10:34.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And what did you think?

10:34.900 --> 10:36.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

10:36.766 --> 10:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE DOYLE (D), Pennsylvania:
So, we were in the
middle of our practice.

10:38.833 --> 10:42.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were having batting practice,
and I was standing behind home
plate, you know, instructing

10:43.933 --> 10:45.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our batters.

10:45.566 --> 10:49.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I got a text message
from one of my staff
saying, are you OK?

10:51.166 --> 10:53.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I was puzzled by
the -- by the text.

10:53.233 --> 10:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then I saw right below it
a news clip saying, shooter
at congressional baseball

11:00.366 --> 11:03.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
practice, and realized at that
moment that it had to be over
at the Republican practice.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I called my team off the
field, because we didn't have
much information at the time,

11:12.733 --> 11:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get them over in the dugout,
and let them all know what
happened and what I was hearing.

11:18.466 --> 11:22.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there was sort of a --
I call it a stunned silence
with most of the players.

11:23.933 --> 11:27.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We just couldn't
believe something like
this was happening.

11:27.033 --> 11:29.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And there wasn't much we
could do where we were.

11:29.900 --> 11:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we basically just huddled up
and started saying some prayers
for our Republican colleagues

11:36.366 --> 11:38.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that they'd be safe and that
nobody would be hurt badly.

11:38.900 --> 11:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, after that, you know, the
reports started to flood into
our phones and we just, you

11:45.066 --> 11:47.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
know, were reading them
like everyone else.

11:47.066 --> 11:51.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman
Barton, and, again, we know that
you both were practicing for

11:53.133 --> 11:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this congressional game, annual
congressional game that's
taking place tomorrow night.

11:55.766 --> 11:57.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You're going ahead with it.

11:57.933 --> 12:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is the -- I just asked Lisa
Desjardins this question, our
reporter at the Capitol, and

12:04.866 --> 12:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she said this is -- the reaction
there has been sober, that
people are -- to some extent,

12:09.966 --> 12:12.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
members may be rethinking
whether things have
gotten too partisan.

12:12.066 --> 12:13.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you think?

12:13.066 --> 12:15.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

12:15.133 --> 12:19.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOE BARTON: Well, the reaction
here has been very supportive
of the Republicans on the

12:19.533 --> 12:21.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
team.

12:21.500 --> 12:25.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congressman Doyle and his
Democratic players have
reached out to us personally.

12:27.433 --> 12:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The speaker and Mrs.
Pelosi, the minority leader,
have talked directly.

12:32.866 --> 12:36.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everybody is supportive because,
we are -- we have an R or an
D by our name, but our title

12:44.200 --> 12:49.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
- - our title is United
States representative.

12:50.666 --> 12:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm very proud to be
a member of the Congress.

12:56.966 --> 13:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm proud to serve with
people like Mike Doyle.

13:00.333 --> 13:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you know, we feel very
blessed that we're here
to have this interview.

13:07.333 --> 13:11.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Had the shooter not been
attacked by the Capitol
Hill Police, who risked
their lives -- and

13:13.966 --> 13:18.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two of them got shot -- had he
gotten inside the fence of the
field and gotten to the first

13:20.700 --> 13:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
base dugout, there were 20,
15 members, and five or six
staffers in that dugout huddled

13:29.033 --> 13:30.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
down.

13:30.733 --> 13:33.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's actually a lowered,
below-the-field dugout.

13:33.400 --> 13:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there would have been
no place for them to run.

13:36.533 --> 13:38.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, it could have
been much worse.

13:38.933 --> 13:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman
Doyle, I can see the pain
in both of your faces.

13:45.833 --> 13:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this a time for coming
together in some way and for
rethinking, as we said, some of

13:52.733 --> 13:53.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the partisanship?

13:53.733 --> 13:55.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

13:55.300 --> 13:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE DOYLE: I think all of us
are reflecting on that today.

13:59.233 --> 14:03.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joe and I have been associated
with this game for quite a
while, and we have been friends

14:03.566 --> 14:05.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for a long time.

14:05.766 --> 14:10.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His son Jack is like one of
my nephews, always comes up
and asks me how I'm doing.

14:12.700 --> 14:16.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I always tries to get
intelligence from Jack on what
his dad is up to, and Jack never

14:17.566 --> 14:18.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gives him up.

14:18.500 --> 14:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So he's a good kid that way.

14:19.833 --> 14:20.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

14:20.833 --> 14:22.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

14:22.933 --> 14:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE DOYLE: But I got to tell
you, there was a real feeling
of helplessness on our part

14:26.433 --> 14:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as we stood there in the
dugout reading the reports
that were coming in.

14:30.900 --> 14:33.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We know -- we know
all these guys.

14:33.666 --> 14:35.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're our friends.

14:35.833 --> 14:40.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We may have differences
politically, but they're
our friends, and we care
about them very much.

14:42.566 --> 14:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think all of us are
reflecting on how each one of us
individually can set an example

14:49.466 --> 14:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the country, too, because
when people see their leaders
being uncivil towards one

14:54.133 --> 14:59.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
another, then you start to
see the public being uncivil
towards one another and towards

14:59.066 --> 15:00.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their leaders.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think that's
got to change.

15:02.433 --> 15:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So maybe it starts with
us, and maybe this will
change some attitudes here.

15:08.966 --> 15:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman
Barton, I hear and I see the
affection between the two of

15:11.300 --> 15:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you, and I am seeing and hearing
you say it exists with others.

15:16.233 --> 15:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think it's fair to
say, it doesn't always come
across in the news coverage.

JOE BARTON: Well, politics in
Washington is a contact sport.

15:25.033 --> 15:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it shouldn't be a
personal animosity sport.

15:28.466 --> 15:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And with Mike and I and a lot
of other members, it's not.

15:32.866 --> 15:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I do want to apologize for
getting emotional a minute ago.

15:35.233 --> 15:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, Tom Hanks was the
manager of a women's baseball
team, and, in that movie, he has

15:42.233 --> 15:44.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the famous line, there's
no crying in baseball.

15:44.833 --> 15:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, there's certainly no
-- shouldn't be any crying
in congressional baseball.

15:49.200 --> 15:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I do apologize for my
emotional outburst a minute ago.

15:55.066 --> 15:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: No -- no...

15:55.766 --> 15:56.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

15:58.833 --> 16:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE DOYLE: I would say
there's lots of members of
Congress that get along.

16:00.766 --> 16:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We tend to not be
the ones the media is
interested in interviewing.

16:03.333 --> 16:07.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Oftentimes, the media's
interested in interviewing
the two that are throwing
the swords at each

16:07.833 --> 16:09.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
other.

16:09.866 --> 16:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, maybe the news media,
too, can reflect a little bit
on that and show some of the

16:15.000 --> 16:16.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
positive things that
take place down here.

16:17.533 --> 16:18.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOE BARTON: That's true.

16:18.966 --> 16:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's
something for us to reflect on.

16:20.466 --> 16:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, we so appreciate the two
of you being together right now.

16:22.433 --> 16:25.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And no apology needed,
Congressman Barton.

16:25.233 --> 16:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's entirely understandable
why you would be emotional
at a time like this.

16:30.833 --> 16:32.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We thank you.

16:32.066 --> 16:33.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're thankful that
you are all right.

16:33.600 --> 16:36.066 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We thank you for
talking with us.

16:36.066 --> 16:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Congressman Doyle, thank you.

16:37.133 --> 16:38.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We thank you both.

MIKE DOYLE: Thank you.

16:41.100 --> 16:44.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now to
the day's other major story.

16:44.466 --> 16:49.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is in London, where a
fast-moving fire engulfed a
high-rise apartment building.

16:50.866 --> 16:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It killed at least 12
people and injured scores.

16:53.133 --> 16:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have a report from Dan
Rivers of Independent Television
News, and with a warning: Some

16:57.600 --> 17:00.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the images and sounds
may be disturbing.

17:00.100 --> 17:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN RIVERS: With horrifying
ferocity, the fire consumed
Grenfell Tower in minutes, a

17:11.200 --> 17:16.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
24-floor inferno from which
there was no escape for some.

17:16.166 --> 17:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trapped by smoke and flames,
residents signaled their plight
from on high as the building

17:22.100 --> 17:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
disintegrated around them.

17:30.666 --> 17:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On this mobile phone footage,
the cries for help are chilling.

17:36.633 --> 17:39.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Help!

17:39.700 --> 17:41.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Help!

17:41.800 --> 17:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: We saw people looking out
of the windows, screaming help,
screaming, help, help, flashing

17:48.300 --> 17:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their lights and everything.

17:49.733 --> 17:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And now all those windows,
people are gone, literally gone.

17:53.566 --> 17:56.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: I saw one person
trying to jump out.

17:56.133 --> 17:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One actually jumped out,
and obviously what happened.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's just a nightmare.

18:01.733 --> 18:06.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN RIVERS: The streets around
Grenfell Tower were soon full
of those who escaped its flames,

18:08.533 --> 18:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
children among those suffering
from the acrid fumes.

18:15.533 --> 18:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An exhausted little girl
is cradled as the shock
and bewilderment sink in.

18:24.400 --> 18:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Many here have lost everything.

18:26.633 --> 18:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some are still unsure what's
happened to neighbors,
friends, loved ones.

18:31.366 --> 18:35.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, above them,
the fire raged on.

18:35.233 --> 18:40.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
As the sky lightened,
the flames continued
to devour the building.

18:43.166 --> 18:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was the view from the
SOUTH BANK, the plume of
smoke visible for 20 miles.

18:49.700 --> 18:52.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
With daylight, stories
of extraordinary escape
started to emerge.

18:52.366 --> 18:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAMIRA LAMRANI, Witness: A
lady appeared at the window,
gesturing, body language, from

18:54.866 --> 18:57.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
what she was saying, I'm
about to throw my baby,
please catch the baby.

18:57.333 --> 19:02.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the baby, I think,
was wrapped in some sort
of bed sheet, blanket.

19:03.200 --> 19:07.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And she threw the baby.

19:07.333 --> 19:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As the baby came down -- and
this was about approximately
from the ninth or 10th floor

19:09.400 --> 19:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - a member of the public,
a gentleman ran forward and
miraculously grabbed the baby.

19:15.566 --> 19:18.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, like I said, above you,
from the left, from the right,
mostly kids, it was harrowing,

19:21.466 --> 19:24.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
torturing screams
for help, young kids.

19:24.133 --> 19:29.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think also, where
the fire was now spread,
people were reaching out
from the front window,

19:31.066 --> 19:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trying to grasp a bit of
fresh air, trying to breathe
in like they were struggling.

19:36.433 --> 19:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there were, at one point,
one window about four or five
heads all squeezing their heads

19:39.500 --> 19:40.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
through.

19:40.700 --> 19:42.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was honestly
like a horror movie.

19:42.866 --> 19:46.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAN RIVERS: Some had
knotted sheets together
in an attempt to escape.

19:46.900 --> 19:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But even this left them
several floors short of safety.

19:50.233 --> 19:52.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN: People were
jumping off buildings.

19:52.033 --> 19:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People were screaming, saying,
help me, help me, help me.

19:54.966 --> 19:59.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAN RIVERS: The cause
of the fire is unknown,
but one resident claims
it spread from her

19:59.566 --> 20:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
neighbor's flat, possibly
a faulty appliance.

20:01.933 --> 20:05.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: The fire started from
the kitchen, but I don't know
exactly -- from which problem,

20:05.366 --> 20:06.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

20:06.833 --> 20:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it was from the kitchen,
because the flat door was open.

20:13.166 --> 20:15.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAN RIVERS: It's already
clear the death toll
will be significant.

20:15.866 --> 20:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Up to 600 people lived in
Grenfell House in 120 flats.

20:19.700 --> 20:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For those who were on the
very upper floors, the
odds of survival seem slim.

20:28.300 --> 20:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those fighting the fire
confirmed today how challenging
it's been to extinguish.

20:33.133 --> 20:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: This was an unprecedented
fire in terms of scale,
speed, and spread.

20:40.100 --> 20:43.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And just to reiterate that
point, the incident continues
to be a challenging incident for

20:43.600 --> 20:45.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

20:45.633 --> 20:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN RIVERS: There is speculation
a gap behind a recently added
external cladding may have

20:51.033 --> 20:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
created a chimney effect,
allowing the flames to spread.

20:56.700 --> 20:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some had to wait all
night before they escaped.

20:58.933 --> 21:03.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This man was still
calling for help six hours
after the fire started.

21:03.266 --> 21:08.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At times, he disappeared
into clouds of smoke,
but, incredibly, he did
finally make it out,

21:11.433 --> 21:15.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one of 65 rescued from
Grenfell Tower today.

21:15.666 --> 21:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, while most of the
flames have been put out, the
charred shell of the tower block

21:21.400 --> 21:23.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
continues to smolder.

21:23.433 --> 21:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It may be days before the
final death toll is known, and
much longer before the cause

21:29.233 --> 21:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of this tragedy is pinpointed.

21:31.333 --> 21:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Prime Minister
Theresa May promised a full
investigation, and the British

21:38.266 --> 21:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government ordered safety
checks at other high-rises
undergoing renovations.

21:43.833 --> 21:46.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the day's other news:
Leaders of the Senate
Intelligence Committee
held their first meeting

21:46.133 --> 21:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Robert Mueller, the special
counsel investigating Russian
meddling in the 2016 election.

21:52.733 --> 21:57.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That followed 24 hours
of speculation about
Mueller's future.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Last night, White
House spokeswoman Sarah
Huckabee Sanders told
reporters: "While the

22:01.733 --> 22:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president has the right
to fire Mueller, he has
no intention of doing so."

22:08.600 --> 22:11.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The New York Times reported that
Mr. Trump began contemplating
his dismissal shortly

22:12.633 --> 22:14.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after he was appointed.

22:14.700 --> 22:19.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. Senate overwhelmingly
approved new sanctions on
Russia today over its election

22:19.833 --> 22:21.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hacking.

22:21.866 --> 22:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The penalties target those
involving human rights
abuses and cyber-crime.

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The bill also blocks the
president from removing
sanctions without
congressional approval.

22:32.033 --> 22:35.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ahead of the vote, Secretary
of State Rex Tillerson warned
a House panel against limiting

22:36.033 --> 22:38.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the president's options.

22:38.033 --> 22:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary
of State: I would urge Congress
to ensure any legislation

22:40.966 --> 22:45.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
allows the president to have the
flexibility to adjust sanctions
to meet the needs of what

22:47.166 --> 22:50.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is always an evolving
diplomatic situation.

22:50.133 --> 22:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Essentially, we would ask for
the flexibility to turn the heat
up when we need to, but also

22:56.800 --> 22:59.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to ensure that we have
the ability to maintain
a constructive dialogue.

22:59.933 --> 23:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The amendment
is part of a broader bill
dealing with sanctions on Iran.

23:06.466 --> 23:08.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
If it clears the Senate,
the measure still
needs House approval.

23:08.733 --> 23:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump has now handed
off authority over troop levels
in Afghanistan to Secretary

23:14.900 --> 23:17.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Defense James Mattis.

23:17.433 --> 23:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mattis confirmed it today,
but said it doesn't mean
an immediate increase
in U.S. deployments.

23:23.700 --> 23:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, the U.N.
secretary-general, Antonio
Guterres, visited Kabul today.

23:29.766 --> 23:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said there was -- quote
-- "no military solution" for
that country's long-running

23:33.800 --> 23:36.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
war.

23:36.366 --> 23:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, a
gunman in San Francisco
shot three people to
death at a UPS warehouse,

23:41.033 --> 23:42.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
before turning the
gun on himself.

23:42.800 --> 23:47.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Police say the man was
a UPS employee armed
with an assault pistol.

23:47.000 --> 23:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Heavily armed officers searched
the sprawling complex after
the shooting started, as dozens

23:53.200 --> 23:55.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of employees poured
out of the building.

23:55.700 --> 23:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Five people were charged
with involuntary manslaughter
today in connection with the

23:59.966 --> 24:03.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lead-contaminated water
crisis in Flint, Michigan.

24:03.933 --> 24:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The case involves the
death of an elderly
man from Legionnaires'
disease allegedly brought

24:08.933 --> 24:10.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on by the tainted water.

24:10.966 --> 24:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those charged today include Nick
Lyon, a Michigan state health
and human services director.

24:17.433 --> 24:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He could get up to 15 years
in prison if he's convicted.

24:21.633 --> 24:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Federal Reserve Board has
raised a key short-term interest
rate again, meaning that

24:26.633 --> 24:30.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rates for credit cards and
similar debt are going up.

24:30.166 --> 24:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The quarter-point hike is
the third in six months.

24:33.433 --> 24:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Washington today, Fed
Chair Janet Yellen suggested
it's a vote of confidence.

24:37.900 --> 24:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANET YELLEN, Federal Reserve
Chair: The economy is doing
well, is showing resilience.

24:45.266 --> 24:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a very strong labor
market, an unemployment
rate that's declined
to levels we have not

24:50.400 --> 24:52.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
seen since 2001.

24:52.566 --> 24:56.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Fed
also announced plans to
gradually start scaling
back its bond holdings.

24:58.500 --> 25:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That could cause long-term
interest rates to rise.

25:02.100 --> 25:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nearly 200 Democratic lawmakers
are suing President Trump
over foreign money ties to

25:08.033 --> 25:10.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his business empire.

25:10.133 --> 25:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say that he never divested
from his far-flung interests, so
he is violating, they say, the

25:15.766 --> 25:18.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Constitution's
Emoluments Clause.

25:18.366 --> 25:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It restricts gifts and
benefits from foreign leaders.

25:21.700 --> 25:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The attorneys general from
Maryland and the District of
Columbia filed a similar suit

25:26.366 --> 25:28.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this week.

25:28.400 --> 25:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Wall Street today, the Dow
Jones industrial average gained
46 points to close at 21374.

25:35.000 --> 25:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 25 points,
and the S&amp;P 500 slipped two.

25:41.833 --> 25:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a French pilot successfully
crossed the English Channel
in a flying car today.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The machine was part dune
buggy and part paraglider.

25:50.133 --> 25:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It took off from an abandoned
runway near Calais, France,
and took just under an hour

25:54.766 --> 25:56.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to make the crossing.

25:56.766 --> 26:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The pilot and car landed
safely near Dover, a
journey of about 36 miles.

26:03.300 --> 26:05.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now you have seen it.

26:05.366 --> 26:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
how the defense secretary's new
authority could change troop

26:09.500 --> 26:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
levels in Afghanistan; the
latest technology that aims to
capture carbon emissions from

26:16.166 --> 26:20.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
coal; we will hear from
the nation's newest poet
laureate; and much more.

26:31.700 --> 26:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Trump administration, as
you heard, is taking steps to
increasing America's military

26:36.333 --> 26:41.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
presence in Afghanistan,
after years of reducing
U.S. forces there.

26:42.200 --> 26:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the story.

26:44.133 --> 26:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Since taking
office, the Trump administration
has been conducting a

26:46.533 --> 26:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
review of America's
16-year war in Afghanistan.

26:50.633 --> 26:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The current U.S. commander
there, General John Nicholson,
has recommended sending 3,000

26:54.966 --> 26:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to 5,000 more troops to augment
the 10,000 Americans and
3,000 allied forces that are

27:00.766 --> 27:03.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
already in the country.

27:03.366 --> 27:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Defense Secretary
James Mattis announced
that the president had now
given him the authority

27:07.233 --> 27:09.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to decide appropriate
troop levels.

27:09.633 --> 27:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more on all of this, we
turn to retired Lieutenant
General Douglas Lute.

27:13.533 --> 27:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He served on the National
Security Council staffs in both
the George W. Bush and Barack

27:17.800 --> 27:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama administrations, where
he focused on Afghanistan,
Iraq, and South Asia.

27:22.233 --> 27:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the past four years, he
served as U.S. ambassador to
NATO, and he's now a senior

27:26.800 --> 27:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fellow at Harvard University.

27:28.800 --> 27:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to the "NewsHour."

27:29.800 --> 27:30.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

27:30.800 --> 27:32.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

27:32.766 --> 27:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOUGLAS LUTE (RET.),
Former U.S. Ambassador
to NATO: Good to be here.

27:34.733 --> 27:36.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, let's talk
first off about this decision
by the president to hand

27:36.766 --> 27:40.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
General -- or Secretary
of Defense James Mattis
the decision-making
for troop levels.

27:40.866 --> 27:41.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How unusual is that?

27:41.633 --> 27:42.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

27:42.633 --> 27:44.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

27:44.633 --> 27:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOUGLAS LUTE: Well, it is
unusual, but I think we should
first appreciate that we should

27:46.633 --> 27:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have confidence in the entire
Pentagon chain of command,
starting with Secretary Mattis,

27:53.500 --> 27:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but all the way down through
Central Command, and then
ultimately to General Nicholson,

27:56.033 --> 27:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mick Nicholson, who you
mentioned, who is our
commander, four-star
commander in Afghanistan.

27:59.166 --> 28:03.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, this is a very experienced
team, responsible individuals.

28:03.233 --> 28:06.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're going to take this,
this new authority seriously.

28:06.100 --> 28:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I also think there is a logic.

28:09.100 --> 28:12.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There is a rationale to
providing the Pentagon
some flexibility.

28:12.833 --> 28:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It gives them more agility to
fit the number of troops to
the task in Afghanistan, and

28:18.933 --> 28:20.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that all makes sense.

28:20.966 --> 28:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It does, however, raise one
concern, and that's the concern
that strategy is made up of a

28:26.200 --> 28:28.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lot more than just
the Pentagon piece.

28:28.833 --> 28:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I would be concerned,
or I would be interested in
hearing how the administration

28:33.400 --> 28:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intends to make sure that the
other pieces, the political side
of the equation, the diplomatic

28:40.733 --> 28:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
equation, the economic
assistance equation,
the intelligence
community's role, how all

28:43.100 --> 28:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these various pieces are fit
together in a coherent hole.

28:45.533 --> 28:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Well, you
raise a very good question,
because, traditionally, we think

28:48.400 --> 28:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a strategy being set from
the top, from the president,
with advice from all of the

28:52.700 --> 28:55.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
relevant agencies below.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you think this does
to the decision-making process
for a country like Afghanistan?

28:58.933 --> 28:59.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

28:59.933 --> 29:01.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

29:01.433 --> 29:03.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DOUGLAS LUTE: Well, I think
it's too soon to tell.

29:03.466 --> 29:05.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The traditional role is that
the National Security Council
would have this oversight

29:05.900 --> 29:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
role, this coordinating role,
to make sure that the strategy
stays aligned over time

29:10.266 --> 29:14.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and that all the pieces
relate to one another
in a coherent way.

29:14.800 --> 29:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not clear whether this
move to give additional
authorities, additional
autonomy to the Pentagon

29:21.833 --> 29:25.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is just the opening step, or
whether there will still be a
role for the NSC, the National

29:25.366 --> 29:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Security Council, led
by H.R. McMaster, to
oversee the whole process.

29:29.366 --> 29:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, we have
said Mattis and Nicholson
both believe that more U.S.

29:35.466 --> 29:36.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
troops to Afghanistan
is a good idea.

29:36.933 --> 29:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you share that belief?

29:37.933 --> 29:38.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

29:38.933 --> 29:41.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOUGLAS LUTE: Well, I think a
few more -- a few thousand or
even 10,000 more U.S. troops...

29:43.833 --> 29:45.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Ten thousand more?

29:45.100 --> 29:46.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

29:46.100 --> 29:48.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

29:48.166 --> 29:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOUGLAS LUTE: I'm saying that
I think that, hypothetically,
an increase on that scale,

29:50.400 --> 29:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
let's say, for example, a
doubling of U.S. troops -- there
are some 8,500 there now -- can

29:56.533 --> 29:59.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
help sustain the current
security stalemate.

29:59.933 --> 30:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I don't believe that
troops alone will actually
be decisive in the end.

30:05.800 --> 30:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Troops alone can't win this war.

30:07.433 --> 30:10.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Troops alone will not
remove the stalemate.

30:10.866 --> 30:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The stalemate fundamentally
rests on the political
side of the equation.

30:14.733 --> 30:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, alongside any
military surge, any --
the addition of any number
of U.S. troops, I will

30:21.800 --> 30:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be very interested to hear the
administration's ambitions in
terms of how they're going to

30:25.533 --> 30:27.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
deal with the politics.

30:27.633 --> 30:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Well, explain
what the challenges are there
for the politics in Afghanistan.

30:29.566 --> 30:30.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

30:30.566 --> 30:32.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

30:32.466 --> 30:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOUGLAS LUTE: Well, I look
at this as a three-part
equation on the political side.

30:34.500 --> 30:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, first of all, inside the
Afghan government itself, here
you have zero-sum politics among

30:40.366 --> 30:42.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the different national players.

30:42.166 --> 30:44.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have a high
level of corruption.

30:44.033 --> 30:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have the patronage network.

30:46.500 --> 30:51.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have a long period
of time where you have
actually had stalemate
from the central government

30:52.500 --> 30:55.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
itself.

30:55.033 --> 30:58.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Second, you have stalemate
between Afghanistan
and its neighboring
states, most prominently

30:58.466 --> 31:00.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Pakistan, but not just Pakistan.

31:00.566 --> 31:05.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We only have to look at the map
and see the geographic equation
here, which includes Iran

31:06.966 --> 31:10.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the west, Central Asia,
and Russia to the north, and
beyond, to the northeast China,

31:14.366 --> 31:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and further to the east, India.

31:15.900 --> 31:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So this is a very complex
regional diplomatic equation.

31:20.366 --> 31:24.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All those players I have just
mention have some impact on
what happens inside Afghanistan.

31:24.633 --> 31:29.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then, ultimately,
to bring this war to a
conclusion, a political
end, which the military

31:31.566 --> 31:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
equation should be in support
of, it involves politics between
the Afghan government and

31:36.300 --> 31:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Taliban, the opponent.

31:38.800 --> 31:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so on all three of
these fronts, inside
Kabul, in the region, and
between the government

31:42.500 --> 31:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the insurgents, there's a
real need for a political surge.

31:45.800 --> 31:49.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Among those
neighbors, Pakistan obviously
looms very large in Afghanistan,

31:49.966 --> 31:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and provide a consistent safe
haven for the Taliban that are
waging this massive insurgency

31:54.866 --> 31:56.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the country.

31:56.366 --> 32:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How can the U.S. get Pakistan
to help us in that fight?

DOUGLAS LUTE: Well, first of
all, I think you have to place
our requirements, our demands

32:05.900 --> 32:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Pakistan in this part of
the arena, that is, their
support for the Taliban, in the

32:12.300 --> 32:14.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
context of our other
interests in Pakistan.

32:14.966 --> 32:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we actually have several
interests in Pakistan which
I think surpass our interest

32:21.100 --> 32:22.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in dealing with
the Afghan Taliban.

32:22.600 --> 32:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I would label Pakistan's
internal stability itself.

32:26.766 --> 32:31.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Here you have more than
180 million Pakistanis
in a country where you
have not just the Afghan

32:33.733 --> 32:38.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Taliban, but the Pakistani
Taliban, remnants of al-Qaida,
and other regional terrorist

32:39.933 --> 32:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
groups, all of which threaten
the stability of the state.

32:41.166 --> 32:42.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: A
nuclear-powered state.

GEN.

32:45.933 --> 32:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOUGLAS LUTE: And a state
which has the fastest
growing, the fastest
expanding nuclear arsenal

32:47.633 --> 32:49.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the world.

32:49.700 --> 32:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that very dangerous cocktail
of terrorists, extremists, and
nuclear weapons is actually

32:55.933 --> 33:00.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
probably more of a
vital national interest
to us than Pakistan's
support for the Afghan

33:01.433 --> 33:03.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Taliban.

33:03.433 --> 33:06.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there's a large array
of complex interests
here which are at play.

33:06.066 --> 33:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Even if the
administration articulates a
strategy, do you think that

33:09.433 --> 33:11.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this administration can
execute that strategy?

33:14.866 --> 33:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOUGLAS LUTE: Well, I
think, right now, they're
working with a handicap.

33:16.933 --> 33:20.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is, while the National
Security Council itself, those
who set strategy and overwatch

33:22.866 --> 33:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the strategy, is largely
in place, the implementers
of the strategy are
largely not in place,

33:28.066 --> 33:31.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because they have a
large number of vacancies
among those officials who
are yet to be nominated

33:31.166 --> 33:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and confirmed by the
Senate, especially in
the Defense Department
and the State Department.

33:34.933 --> 33:39.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Former

DOUGLAS LUTE: Thank you.

33:48.400 --> 33:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The future
of coal is very much at the
center of debate right now when

33:54.600 --> 33:57.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it comes to the politics
and business of energy.

33:57.800 --> 34:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whatever you may think about
those questions, the U.S.
still uses a lot of coal.

34:02.766 --> 34:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
About 30 percent of our
energy, of our electricity
is generated by it.

34:07.233 --> 34:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For some, the Holy Grail is
new technology that captures
some of coal's worst problems

34:12.966 --> 34:15.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with greenhouse gases.

34:15.266 --> 34:18.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Miles O'Brien reports
on the largest facility
trying to do so.

34:18.966 --> 34:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of our weekly
series on the Leading Edge
of science and technology.

34:23.133 --> 34:28.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: At the
W.A. Parish power plant
southwest of Houston,
they are piling up coal,

34:30.133 --> 34:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
getting ready for another
long, hot, aggressively
air-conditioned summer.

34:36.733 --> 34:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the largest fossil fuel
power plants in the country,
Parish can generate about

34:39.566 --> 34:44.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
one-fifth of the city's
electricity using coal-
and gas-fired turbines.

34:46.233 --> 34:50.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it is leading the
nation down a promising,
yet problematic path.

34:50.933 --> 34:55.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Here, they are trying
to make clean coal more
than a political slogan.

34:57.366 --> 35:01.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mauricio Gutierrez is CEO
of NRG, owner of the plant.

35:03.466 --> 35:04.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAURICIO GUTIERREZ, President
and CEO, NRG: We built the
world's largest carbon capture

35:04.766 --> 35:08.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
system on an existing
coal-fired power plant.

35:08.866 --> 35:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is the first commercial
scale facility of this
kind in the United States.

35:12.633 --> 35:17.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: They are
capturing and storing
carbon dioxide, the
greenhouse gas that is

35:18.800 --> 35:21.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the main driver
of global warming.

35:21.033 --> 35:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is prompting some
unexpected support from members
of the Trump administration.

35:25.733 --> 35:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Listen to Energy Secretary
Rick Perry at the ceremonial
opening in April.

35:29.566 --> 35:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICK PERRY, U.S. Secretary of
Energy: I think the solutions
to many of the challenges that

35:33.200 --> 35:38.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we have in the world today
are displayed behind me.

35:40.166 --> 35:43.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The same Rick
Perry who wrote a book calling
climate scientists members

35:43.066 --> 35:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a secular carbon cult who
manipulate data and climate
science a contrived, phony mess,

35:50.300 --> 35:52.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
but not here.

35:52.366 --> 35:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICK PERRY: It shows we don't
have to pit the environment
on one side weighing and the

35:57.433 --> 36:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
economy on the other side.

36:00.200 --> 36:04.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We can and we will be
good stewards of both.

36:04.733 --> 36:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The steward of
this project for NRG is David
Greeson, the vice president

36:10.600 --> 36:12.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of development.

36:12.600 --> 36:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID GREESON, Vice President
of Development, NRG: We're
interested in doing more carbon

36:14.566 --> 36:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
capture as a part of our overall
sustainable energy future
plan, and so we're going to

36:20.533 --> 36:22.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
see how this one works.

36:22.633 --> 36:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: They call the
billion-dollar carbon capture
and storage system Petra Nova.

36:28.600 --> 36:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NRG built it in partnership
with the Japanese oil company
JX Nippon using a $190 million

36:34.833 --> 36:39.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
grant from the Department
of Energy doled out during
the Obama administration.

36:39.033 --> 36:44.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVID GREESON: So we're
capturing about 200
tons of CO2 per hour.

36:45.933 --> 36:50.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On an annual basis, that's
about 1.6 million tons per year.

36:50.333 --> 36:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the equivalent of 350,000
cars being taken off the road.

36:54.666 --> 36:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: While it may
be the world's largest carbon
capture facility, it is still

36:59.166 --> 37:04.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only removing about 10 percent
of the CO2 created by the
four coal-fired generators

37:04.933 --> 37:06.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

37:06.133 --> 37:08.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The only obstacle to
capturing more is money.

37:08.766 --> 37:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID GREESON: We're just now
reaching the point where this
technology is mature enough

37:13.133 --> 37:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be considered for rollout
to the broad coal-fired fleet
in the United States and

37:20.300 --> 37:21.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
around the world.

37:21.466 --> 37:23.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN:
Here's how it works.

37:23.566 --> 37:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Flue gas, with carbon dioxide
in it, flows through a duct to
the carbon capture facility.

37:30.166 --> 37:34.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
One vessel contains
amine, an ammonia-based
chemical in liquid form.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It naturally binds
with carbon dioxide.

37:37.866 --> 37:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With the carbon now in solution,
the liquid goes to another
vessel, where it is heated

37:42.566 --> 37:44.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

37:44.566 --> 37:48.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As that happens, the
process is reversed and
the CO2 pops out as a gas.

37:50.566 --> 37:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is captured, and, after
it is compressed, ready
for underground storage.

37:54.233 --> 37:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL WEBBER®MD-B,
University of Texas at Austin:
I think Petra Nova is a shining

37:56.700 --> 38:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
example of what technology
offers, and so, as an engineer,
I'm very enthusiastic about

38:00.966 --> 38:01.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

38:01.966 --> 38:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think it's very exciting.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Michael Webber
is deputy director of the Energy
Institute at the University

38:06.633 --> 38:08.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Texas at Austin.

38:08.466 --> 38:12.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He says the energy
sector is watching this
project very closely.

38:12.766 --> 38:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL WEBBER: We're getting a
lot of scrutiny because people
want to know if carbon capture

38:16.633 --> 38:18.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and sequestration will work.

38:18.700 --> 38:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there are examples around
the nation, around the world
where it hasn't really quite

38:21.133 --> 38:23.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
come together the
way people want.

38:23.166 --> 38:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's really expensive and hard
to do, so you wouldn't do it
unless you had to, or it's

38:26.233 --> 38:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in your economic favor to do so.

38:28.166 --> 38:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And a
coincidence of geography
has made that possible here.

38:32.333 --> 38:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The CO2 from the Petra Nova
facility is sent 80 miles to
the southwest, to the West Ranch

38:38.700 --> 38:40.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
oil field.

38:40.233 --> 38:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here, the gas is as good as
gold, black gold, Texas tea.

38:44.733 --> 38:48.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JILL FISK, Senior Vice
President, Hilcorp: That
was the hope, if you
marry up a partnership

38:48.733 --> 38:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between a CO2 emitter where
they can capture the CO2 and
reduce their CO2 emissions, but

38:55.166 --> 38:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then that CO2 can be used
to increase oil production.

39:00.633 --> 39:02.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's really a win-win.

39:02.700 --> 39:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Jill Fisk is
a senior vice president for
Hilcorp, the current operator

39:05.733 --> 39:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of this oil field, which
first opened in the 1930s.

39:10.000 --> 39:14.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
At its peak in the
'70s, it produced 50,000
barrels of oil a day.

39:14.700 --> 39:18.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Today, it's down to less
than 300 barrels a day.

39:18.400 --> 39:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Normally, it would be time
to cap the wells here.

39:21.800 --> 39:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, instead, they're drilling
new ones, getting ready to pump
a lot more oil by injecting

39:27.666 --> 39:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
carbon dioxide deep underground.

39:30.333 --> 39:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Liquid CO2 has been used to
liberate the most stubborn
oil for about 40 years.

39:37.366 --> 39:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JILL FISK: Essentially, what's
happening is the oil is stuck
to rock, if you can imagine

39:40.833 --> 39:42.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

39:42.866 --> 39:46.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The CO2 is injected,
it dissolves into that
oil that's stuck to the
rock, loosens up the

39:48.800 --> 39:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
oil, lightens it up, which --
so it can then flow toward a
producer and produce additional

39:52.566 --> 39:54.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
oil.

39:54.633 --> 39:57.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At West Ranch, we're expecting
to recover an additional 60
million barrels of oil that

39:57.766 --> 40:01.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would otherwise be left in the
ground and be unrecoverable
without a project of this

40:01.800 --> 40:03.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
type.

40:03.833 --> 40:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Right now,
with oil prices so low, Petra
Nova is breaking even, but,

40:07.733 --> 40:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the next decade, they
expect to make a tidy profit
capturing and burying carbon

40:12.466 --> 40:14.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
dioxide.

40:14.500 --> 40:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But doesn't this just transfer
greenhouse gas emissions
from a power plant smokestack

40:19.133 --> 40:21.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to automobile tailpipes?

40:21.233 --> 40:25.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JILL FISK: So, I think that
demand for oil is either going
to be met by foreign oil that

40:27.500 --> 40:31.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the United States has
to purchase or by our
own production that
we're able to supply.

40:31.033 --> 40:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So this project is breathing
new life into a field in the
U.S. to help supply that demand

40:36.533 --> 40:38.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for oil.

40:38.600 --> 40:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But how
can we be certain buried
CO2 will stay underground?

40:44.566 --> 40:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Scientists from the University
of Texas are running tests at
22 monitoring wells at West

40:48.366 --> 40:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ranch, getting baseline data
so they will know later if
the injected CO2 triggers some

40:55.366 --> 40:59.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unintended consequences, like
earthquakes or the release
of deep dwelling salt water,

41:00.666 --> 41:02.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
minerals, or chemicals.

41:02.900 --> 41:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At this test site in Austin,
they are finding new ways
to monitor the buried CO2.

41:07.733 --> 41:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUE HOVORKA, University of Texas
at Austin: You ready to start?

41:10.266 --> 41:13.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: They pump
the gas into groundwater
to simulate leaks.

41:13.700 --> 41:16.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They use a sensor
that measures light.

41:16.666 --> 41:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is coated with a polymer that
thins when it reacts with CO2.

41:21.333 --> 41:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If there's any trouble,
the sensor detects more
light, and an alarm is
transmitted automatically.

41:27.833 --> 41:30.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Geologist Sue Hovorka
leads this effort.

41:30.166 --> 41:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUE HOVORKA: We need to get
good enough to provide value
to the atmosphere, and we need

41:34.166 --> 41:36.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to avoid unacceptable
consequences.

41:36.433 --> 41:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Hovorka analyzes
deep rock core samples stored
in a cavernous warehouse

41:42.800 --> 41:45.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at the Bureau of Economic
Geology in Austin.

41:45.766 --> 41:50.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She says there are ample places
to bury carbon dioxide produced
by all types of fossil fuel

41:52.000 --> 41:54.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
power plants, not
just coal burners.

41:54.333 --> 41:58.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That would be a
monumental step toward
addressing climate change.

41:58.066 --> 42:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUE HOVORKA: If consumers want
to use coal and want to reduce
the carbon from that, the

42:02.733 --> 42:04.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
system to do that
is ready to go.

42:04.300 --> 42:06.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They have to pay for it.

42:06.266 --> 42:08.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not outrageous.

42:08.233 --> 42:10.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's totally possible,
but it's not free.

42:10.366 --> 42:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Up until now,
clean coal has been nothing
more than a marketing myth.

42:17.066 --> 42:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It could become a reality at
no small cost, but at a small
fraction of the toll if the

42:21.833 --> 42:25.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
industry does nothing
to stop global warming.

42:25.033 --> 42:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In Richmond, Texas, I'm Miles
O'Brien for the "PBS NewsHour."

42:28.033 --> 42:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And as Miles
just said, costs are just one
of the questions about whether

42:34.166 --> 42:36.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this model could be
replicated more widely.

42:36.566 --> 42:38.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Miles joins me
now from Boston.

42:38.933 --> 42:43.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Miles, tell us more
about why -- and so this is
the first plant of its kind.

42:43.400 --> 42:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What are the challenges
in trying to replicate
this somewhere else and
getting the same results?

42:50.433 --> 42:54.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well,
Judy, the secret sauce
of this one, according
to the innovators behind

42:55.533 --> 42:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it, is, they reduced the cost
of creating the carbon capture.

43:01.300 --> 43:04.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
When I say cost,
the cost in power.

43:04.100 --> 43:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Normally, what the assumption
is, that it reduces the output
of any given power plant

43:10.666 --> 43:14.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
by as much as 30 percent
in order to run the
carbon capture system.

43:14.333 --> 43:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What they did in this case was
they decided not to use the
actual turbines which light

43:21.800 --> 43:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the lights that I'm using
right now, but rather a
separate co-generation
plant air, a smaller

43:25.833 --> 43:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
power plant on site that can
be run much more efficiently.

43:27.900 --> 43:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they say that they -- it's
costing them about 15 percent
of the power-generating capacity

43:33.933 --> 43:35.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of that plant.

43:35.366 --> 43:37.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So that's a big hurdle
that they have gotten over.

43:37.366 --> 43:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, 15 percent is still a
big number, and unless you
have some commodity or the CO2

43:43.100 --> 43:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has some value, the business
model doesn't add up just yet.

43:46.800 --> 43:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you were
telling us, Miles, there are
also some physical challenges as

43:51.333 --> 43:53.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
well.

43:53.400 --> 43:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, being 80
miles near an old oil field that
could use that CO2 to capture

43:59.266 --> 44:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and recover a lot of
stubborn oil from the
ground makes it all work.

44:01.700 --> 44:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The question is, could a
fossil fuel plant of any kind
that's a long way away from an

44:05.600 --> 44:10.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
oil field, could it avail itself
of this kind of transaction?

44:10.600 --> 44:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And CO2 can be pumped in
pipelines for an indefinite
amount of distance, as long as

44:17.166 --> 44:20.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you recompress every now
and then, sort of have
a booster system in.

44:20.166 --> 44:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, again, that's going
to be a significant cost.

44:23.200 --> 44:27.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is not an insurmountable
thing technologically,
and it could be done.

44:27.366 --> 44:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We already have significant CO2
pipelines in the oil sector.

44:31.666 --> 44:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You could extend it out, if
you were determined to do this.

44:34.166 --> 44:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, just
quickly, you were also saying
other practical limits.

44:38.033 --> 44:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, yes.

44:40.200 --> 44:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's -- the limits on this are
-- there are some concerns,
for example, about putting

44:46.566 --> 44:49.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CO2 in seismically active
places, for example.

44:49.466 --> 44:53.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You wouldn't want to put
buried CO2 underneath San
Francisco, for example.

44:53.966 --> 44:58.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, having said all that, when
you consider all the places
that it can be stored, the

45:01.033 --> 45:03.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
experts tell me, we have enough
storage capacity underneath the
continental United States to

45:03.766 --> 45:06.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
last about 900 years
of CO2 production.

45:06.600 --> 45:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's just a question of
societal priorities and whether
we want to pay a little more for

45:10.500 --> 45:13.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
power to get the
carbon dioxide out.

45:13.033 --> 45:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Miles
O'Brien, thanks very much.

45:15.400 --> 45:16.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN:
You're welcome, Judy.

45:16.933 --> 45:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: a new
national voice for poetry.

45:30.300 --> 45:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a tradition dating back to
1937, the Library of Congress
selects a prominent writer to

45:37.233 --> 45:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
serve as the country's poet
laureate for terms that have
ranged from one to three years.

45:43.566 --> 45:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The goal, according to
the library, to raise the
national consciousness
to a greater appreciation

45:48.033 --> 45:50.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the reading and
writing of poetry.

45:50.200 --> 45:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The new laureate was revealed
today, and our Jeffrey Brown
had a chance to talk with her

45:54.700 --> 45:56.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
earlier this week.

45:56.666 --> 46:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Empathy and
self-awareness through language,
that is the creed that comes

46:03.566 --> 46:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through in talking with 45 year
old Tracy K. Smith, writer,
teacher, spouse and mother

46:10.366 --> 46:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of three, including 4-year-old
twins, and now taking on a very
public role as the nation's

46:15.533 --> 46:17.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
poet laureate.

46:17.500 --> 46:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRACY K. SMITH,®MD-B U.S.
Poet Laureate: This is a
position that allows me to kind

46:19.533 --> 46:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of profess publicly all that
I really hold true privately,
that, if we can listen actively

46:28.133 --> 46:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enough, if we can put
enough pressure on
ourselves and our thought
process, language can be a

46:33.866 --> 46:36.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
real tool of revelation.

46:36.166 --> 46:41.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I love being able to do
that with my students
and my little seminars.

46:43.100 --> 46:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I love the idea that maybe
there's a way that this position
allows me to do that with

46:47.066 --> 46:49.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
my fellow Americans.

46:49.200 --> 46:53.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Smith is
author of three books
of poetry, including the
Pulitzer Prize-winning

46:55.566 --> 46:59.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Life on Mars," in part an elegy
for her father, who served in
the Air Force before leaving

47:00.000 --> 47:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to work on the Hubble telescope.

47:02.700 --> 47:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In her 2015 memoir titled
"Ordinary Light," she
writes of growing up in
a tight-knit middle-class

47:09.933 --> 47:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
family in Northern California,
a coming-of-age tale exploring
love and loss, race and faith,

47:17.600 --> 47:20.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a theme that
suffuses her poetry.

47:20.033 --> 47:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRACY K. SMITH: I wasn't even
aware that that's what I was
doing until after my last book

47:25.033 --> 47:28.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of poems came out, and
I realized, wow, there's
a -- these poems are
thinking about space,

47:28.666 --> 47:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but they're also searching
for God, in a way.

47:32.333 --> 47:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it comes back to
that sense that I grew up with
that there is something large

47:35.833 --> 47:38.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that we can cleave
to, if we choose to.

47:38.833 --> 47:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wanted to figure out if
there was a way that the artist
in me and the 21st century

47:50.433 --> 47:55.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
academic in me could
find something like a
plausible version of God
or a plausible version

47:58.400 --> 48:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the afterlife that I would
be willing to claim publicly.

48:04.733 --> 48:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that language
facilitated that.

48:06.833 --> 48:10.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Another
big area that you're
often exploring is race.

48:10.533 --> 48:15.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, in your memoir,
you talk explicitly
about sort of comparing
your upbringing to your

48:17.466 --> 48:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
parents and your grandparents,
the differences there, but
also things that have remained.

48:23.700 --> 48:26.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TRACY K. SMITH: A lot
of my awareness of how
race had imprinted by
my parents, who grew

48:28.833 --> 48:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up in the segregated South,
a lot of that was shaped by a
sense of sadness and a sense

48:34.900 --> 48:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of anxiety on my part that made
me not want to talk about it.

48:39.366 --> 48:44.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there were a lot of silences
that I was drawn to explore
in writing about that time

48:46.200 --> 48:50.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that I had never felt capable
of bringing into speech
when I was growing up.

48:52.766 --> 48:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As I get older, I realize the
history that felt so ancient
when I was growing up is so

48:56.600 --> 49:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - so close to us and present
in ways that I had never
imagined, or didn't want to let

49:04.033 --> 49:06.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
myself imagine
when I was a child.

49:06.333 --> 49:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, writing about it, I think,
is a way of reckoning with
what is yet to be resolved

49:13.200 --> 49:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the present moment, about
how we are willing to love
each other, even though we

49:20.333 --> 49:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
look different from one another.

49:22.633 --> 49:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Smith has
been a professor at Princeton
since 2005 and now heads its

49:29.700 --> 49:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
creative writing program,
teaching small seminars to
young poets in the making.

49:34.333 --> 49:37.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Here especially, she
says, the emphasis is
on how we use language.

49:37.566 --> 49:42.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRACY K. SMITH: Yes, this
is our library and one of
our favorite classrooms.

49:42.466 --> 49:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want them to start thinking
that a poem isn't just an
expression of all these things

49:47.033 --> 49:52.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that you're feeling, but
it's a set of choices that
you're making in language.

49:53.966 --> 49:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, every description, every
question, every statement, every
turn is a choice that opens

49:59.633 --> 50:01.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
up or closes off
certain possibilities.

50:01.866 --> 50:05.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you don't always think
about that when you're sitting
down to write in the flush

50:05.533 --> 50:06.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of emotion.

50:06.533 --> 50:07.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But thinking about...

50:07.966 --> 50:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I mean, the
feelings are part of it, right?

50:09.166 --> 50:10.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRACY K. SMITH: The
feelings are part of it.

50:10.633 --> 50:11.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And the
expression is part of it.

50:11.866 --> 50:14.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But you're saying the
language choices...

50:14.333 --> 50:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACY K. SMITH: Beyond
that, yes, the language
can help you get some
traction in those feelings.

50:17.233 --> 50:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"One of the women greeted me.

50:19.533 --> 50:22.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
'I love you,' she said.

50:22.233 --> 50:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She didn't know me, but I
believed her, and a terrible new
ache rolled over in my chest."

50:29.233 --> 50:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: To hear some of
her language, Smith read part
of a new poem titled "Wade

50:34.566 --> 50:36.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the Water."

50:36.700 --> 50:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRACY K. SMITH: "I love you
throughout the performance in
every hand clap, every stomp.

50:42.533 --> 50:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I love you in the rusted iron
chains someone was made to drag
until love let them be unclasped

50:50.233 --> 50:52.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and left empty in the
center of the ring."

50:52.566 --> 50:57.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now Tracy K.
Smith will have a prominent
voice, a very public national

50:58.733 --> 51:01.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
platform, to reach
new audiences.

51:01.500 --> 51:06.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If you think about the
tumultuous times we're
in technologically, all
kinds of changes around

51:06.233 --> 51:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us, if you think about
the divisions politically
at this moment, it seems
like an appropriate

51:13.333 --> 51:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
moment to say, why poetry?

51:15.500 --> 51:16.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Why bother?

51:16.600 --> 51:18.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why bother being a poet?

51:18.100 --> 51:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What kind of impact could you
possibly have, amidst all that?

51:20.966 --> 51:23.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRACY K. SMITH: Mm-hmm.

51:23.033 --> 51:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will say that a poem
allows or requires you to
submit to something else.

51:30.133 --> 51:31.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Often...

51:31.133 --> 51:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Submit means?

51:33.200 --> 51:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRACY K. SMITH: That's one of
the things we don't want to
do, to say, OK, I'm not the

51:35.233 --> 51:36.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
expert.

51:36.233 --> 51:37.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You're the expert.

51:37.233 --> 51:39.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Let me listen.

51:39.600 --> 51:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let me respond to
something that's completely
counterintuitive for
me, that pulls me toward

51:45.200 --> 51:48.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a different sense
of what's valuable.

51:48.533 --> 51:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, when we do that with
a work of art, we're learning
how to do that in real time

51:55.500 --> 51:57.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with other people.

51:57.033 --> 51:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Does that mean
even making us better citizens?

51:59.533 --> 52:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRACY K. SMITH: I think so.

52:01.766 --> 52:03.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Poems remind us of that.

52:03.366 --> 52:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Poems remind us that someone
is saying, come here.

52:07.766 --> 52:09.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This has happened to me.

52:09.100 --> 52:10.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is how it made me feel.

52:10.700 --> 52:13.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is who I am in
the wake of this thing.

52:13.933 --> 52:17.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we all have
stories like that.

52:17.033 --> 52:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're important to honor,
and they're important also
to say, maybe my story helps

52:24.600 --> 52:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
me listen and cherish this
other person's story, too.

52:31.600 --> 52:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Smith says a key
goal for her as laureate will
be to bring poetry into places

52:36.000 --> 52:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
where it's not often heard.

52:37.833 --> 52:41.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Jeffrey Brown in
Princeton, New Jersey.

52:41.833 --> 52:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, online,
you can watch Tracy K.
Smith read two new poems.

52:48.000 --> 52:52.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's on our Web site
at PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:52.566 --> 52:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And some late-breaking news
before we leave you tonight.

52:55.800 --> 53:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is word that the
special counsel for the Russia
investigation, Robert Mueller,

53:02.766 --> 53:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is expanding his investigation
to consider whether President
Trump may have committed

53:06.566 --> 53:08.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
obstruction of justice.

53:08.500 --> 53:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is according to
The Washington Post,
citing unnamed officials.

53:11.733 --> 53:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The report says the obstruction
of justice probe began days
after the firing of FBI Director

53:18.300 --> 53:20.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
James Comey.

53:20.966 --> 53:24.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In response to the Post
story tonight, a spokesman
for the president's legal
team said in a statement

53:27.233 --> 53:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
- - and I quote -- "The
FBI leak of information
regarding the president is
outrageous, inexcusable,

53:32.733 --> 53:34.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and illegal."

53:34.600 --> 53:36.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that is the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

53:36.700 --> 53:41.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On Thursday, our Making
Sense team takes a look
at a government foreign
investment program

53:43.866 --> 53:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's under the
microscope because of
its results and potential
use by the Trump family.

53:47.466 --> 53:48.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:48.933 --> 53:51.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again
right here tomorrow evening.

53:51.000 --> 53:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank you,
and we will see you soon.
