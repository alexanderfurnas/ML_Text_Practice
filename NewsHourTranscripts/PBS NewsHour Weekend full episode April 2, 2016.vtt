THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:49.633 --> 00:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS PROPOSING THE

00:50.533 --> 00:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOUGHEST REGULATIONS IN U.S.

00:51.633 --> 00:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HISTORY TO COMBAT CLIMATE

00:52.433 --> 00:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGE.

00:53.333 --> 00:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN A VIDEO PREVIEWING TOMORROW'S

00:54.700 --> 00:55.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANNOUNCEMENT, THE PRESIDENT SAYS

00:55.967 --> 00:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT AN

00:57.033 --> 00:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPINION, BUT A FACT AND A

00:57.833 --> 00:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THREAT.

00:59.333 --> 01:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE CALLS POWER PLANTS THE

01:00.800 --> 01:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIGGEST DOMESTIC SOURCE OF

01:01.900 --> 01:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLLUTING EMISSIONS THAT

01:02.900 --> 01:04.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTRIBUTE TO GLOBAL WARMING.

01:04.400 --> 01:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RULE WOULD

01:05.800 --> 01:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REQUIRE EXISTING POWER PLANTS TO

01:07.600 --> 01:09.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CUT EMISSIONS BY 32% BY THE YEAR

01:09.767 --> 01:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
2030, COMPARED TO 2005 LEVELS.

01:12.400 --> 01:13.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER RULES WOULD LIMIT

01:13.767 --> 01:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSTRUCTION OF NEW COAL-BURNING

01:14.733 --> 01:15.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLANTS AND REQUIRE MORE USE OF

01:15.667 --> 01:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLEAN ENERGY SOURCES LIKE WIND

01:17.200 --> 01:18.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SOLAR.

01:18.967 --> 01:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WE LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF TOXIC

01:20.133 --> 01:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHEMICALS-- LIKE MERCURY AND

01:21.400 --> 01:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SULFUR AND ARSENIC-- IN OUR AIR

01:22.800 --> 01:23.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WATER, AND WE'RE BETTER OFF

01:23.767 --> 01:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR IT.

01:25.333 --> 01:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT EXISTING POWER PLANTS CAN

01:26.600 --> 01:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STILL DUMP UNLIMITED AMOUNTS OF

01:28.433 --> 01:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARMFUL CARBON POLLUTION INTO

01:30.000 --> 01:31.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE AIR WE BREATHE.

01:31.767 --> 01:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THE SAKE OF OUR KIDS, FOR

01:33.633 --> 01:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL

01:35.333 --> 01:37.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICANS, THAT'S ABOUT TO

01:37.167 --> 01:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGE.

01:38.633 --> 01:39.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: EVERY STATE

01:39.567 --> 01:40.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GIVE THE

01:40.767 --> 01:41.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

01:41.767 --> 01:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ITS PLAN FOR CURBING EMISSIONS.

01:43.333 --> 01:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE RULES FACE OPPOSITION

01:44.733 --> 01:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS

01:46.700 --> 01:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND LAWSUITS FROM THE ENERGY

01:48.533 --> 01:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDUSTRY AND COAL POWER STATES.

01:50.733 --> 01:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO DISCUSS OBAMA'S CLIMATE

01:52.900 --> 01:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGE PLAN, I'M JOINED BY "NEW

YORK TIMES" REPORTER GARDINER

01:54.767 --> 01:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARRIS, WHO IS COVERING THE

01:55.933 --> 02:00.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STORY IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

02:00.767 --> 02:02.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THESE HAVE TARGETS UNDER THIS

02:02.267 --> 02:04.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLAN BUT THEY CAN SET THEIR OWN

02:04.667 --> 02:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAY TO GET TO THOSE TARGETS

02:06.300 --> 02:07.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT?

02:07.267 --> 02:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

02:07.933 --> 02:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY CAN SORT OF TAKE TWO

02:10.500 --> 02:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENT PATHS, EVEN DO A CAP

02:13.333 --> 02:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND TRADE PATHWAY WHICH IS

02:15.000 --> 02:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY THE FAVORED PATHWAY BY

02:16.633 --> 02:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WHICH

02:18.900 --> 02:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATE'S SORT OF GET TOGETHER IN

02:21.333 --> 02:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A REGIONAL WAY TRY HIT THEIR

02:23.333 --> 02:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TARGETS AND IF ONE STATE GETS A

02:25.433 --> 02:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOT MORE IN TERMS OF CARBON

02:27.533 --> 02:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REDUCTION IT CAN THEN SELL THAT

02:29.433 --> 02:30.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARBON REDUCTION TO A

02:30.667 --> 02:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEIGHBORING STATE THAT DIDN'T

02:31.900 --> 02:33.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUITE HIT ITS TARGET.

02:33.567 --> 02:36.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OTHER WAY TO DO IT IS, THAT

02:36.067 --> 02:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE STATES COULD SIMPLY REGULATE

02:38.233 --> 02:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR WAY TO THE CUT.

02:40.933 --> 02:43.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND REQUIRE REDUCTIONS ON A SORT

02:43.067 --> 02:46.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF A PLANT-BY-PLANT BASIS.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HARI THIS IS OBVIOUSLY GOING

02:49.867 --> 02:51.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO LEAD TO A HUGE POLITICAL

02:51.300 --> 02:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BATTLE.

02:52.333 --> 02:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> RIGHT AND THE OPPOSITION IS

02:53.733 --> 02:54.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LINED UP.

02:54.967 --> 02:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CERTAINLY THERE ARE COAL STATES

02:56.333 --> 02:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUCH AS WEST VIRGINIA THAT ARE

02:57.400 --> 02:59.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO PUSH BACK.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO HOW LONG COULD THIS TAKE?

03:00.867 --> 03:05.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO I LIVED IN HAZARD,

03:05.967 --> 03:07.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KENTUCKY FOR MANY, MANY YEARS

03:07.467 --> 03:09.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE IMPORTANT

03:09.667 --> 03:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COAL PRODUCING AREAS OF THE

03:11.533 --> 03:12.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRY AND THIS IS GOING TO BE

03:12.500 --> 03:14.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY HARD FOR THOSE PLACES AND

03:14.467 --> 03:17.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S LIKELY GOING TO LEAD TO THE

03:17.567 --> 03:20.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHUTDOWN OF MUCH OF THE COAL

03:20.967 --> 03:22.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRODUCING CAPACITY IN THE UNITED

03:22.867 --> 03:26.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES, AT LEAST IN THE

03:26.667 --> 03:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APPALACHIA REGION.

03:28.100 --> 03:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT, STATES HAVE TO

03:30.200 --> 03:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COME UP WITH THEIR PLANS WITH

03:32.500 --> 03:35.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE GOAL FOR THESE REDUCTIONS TO

03:35.367 --> 03:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEGIN BITING IN 2022.

03:36.833 --> 03:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE OPPOSITION SAYS THIS IS

03:39.333 --> 03:41.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO RAISE PRICES FOR

03:41.067 --> 03:42.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UTILITY CONSUMERS, ENERGY

03:42.867 --> 03:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSUMERS.

03:43.333 --> 03:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT WILL

03:44.333 --> 03:45.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOWER PRICES.

03:45.333 --> 03:46.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW DO WE FIGURE THIS OUT?

03:46.767 --> 03:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WHAT THIS RULE WILL DO IS

03:48.933 --> 03:49.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACCELERATE CHANGES THAT ARE

03:49.867 --> 03:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALREADY GOING ON IN THE MARKET.

03:51.233 --> 03:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, THE COAL POWERED POWER

03:56.933 --> 03:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLANT IS GOING AWAY ALREADY.

03:58.433 --> 04:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE COMB IS ACTUALLY FAIRLY

04:01.233 --> 04:03.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPENSIVE, COMPARED TO, RIGHT

04:03.267 --> 04:06.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, NATURAL GAS WHICH IS ALMOST

04:06.167 --> 04:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FREE BECAUSE OF THE ABUNDANCE OF

04:08.100 --> 04:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GAS IN FRACKING.

04:09.733 --> 04:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE SOME PLACES THAT ARE

04:11.233 --> 04:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLEARLY, THIS IS GOING TO BE

04:12.933 --> 04:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE EXPENSIVE, SOME PLACES OUT

04:15.100 --> 04:19.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEST, SOME PLACES IN APPALACHIA

04:19.967 --> 04:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

FOURTH POWER PLANTS.

04:23.467 --> 04:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE

04:26.333 --> 04:28.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME FAIRLY WRENCHING

04:28.267 --> 04:29.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
