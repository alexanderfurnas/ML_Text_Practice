WHAT SEEMS TO HAVE HAPPENED IS

04:58.900 --> 05:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MR. ERDOGAN'S GAMBLE IN HOLDING

05:01.000 --> 05:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECOND ELECTION IN THE SPACE OF

05:02.100 --> 05:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
5 MONTHS HAS WORKED.

05:03.433 --> 05:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE REASONS FOR THAT SEEM TO

05:04.633 --> 05:07.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE AS I SAY BECAUSE THE TURKS

05:07.267 --> 05:10.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRAVE STABILITY, THERE ARE ALSO

05:10.633 --> 05:11.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE TERRORIST BOMBS SOME TIME

05:11.833 --> 05:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGO.

05:12.433 --> 05:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT'S LED PEOPLE TO GO

05:14.533 --> 05:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSHING PERHAPS TO MR. ERDOGAN'S

05:19.533 --> 05:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AKP PARTY.

05:21.500 --> 05:23.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAYING DURING THE JUNE ELECTIONS

05:23.267 --> 05:28.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE AKP PARTY SUPPORTERS

05:28.267 --> 05:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DESSERT -- DESERTED IT BECAUSE

05:30.333 --> 05:33.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WERE DISILLUSIONED BY IT,

05:33.967 --> 05:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE OTHER THING THAT SEEMS

05:35.833 --> 05:38.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO HAVE HAPPENED WAS THERE WAS

05:38.967 --> 05:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISUNITY AMONGST THE OPPOSITION

05:40.400 --> 05:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTIES AND PEOPLE PUNISH THEM

05:41.933 --> 05:42.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR NOT HAVING THE ABILITY TO

05:42.967 --> 05:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COME UP WITH AN ALTERNATIVE TO

05:45.233 --> 05:45.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MR. ERDOGAN'S PARTY.

05:45.867 --> 05:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THAT APPEARS TO BE THE REASON

05:48.233 --> 05:51.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY HE'S WON.

05:51.467 --> 05:53.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALTHOUGH THIS WAS SUBSTANTIAL

05:53.167 --> 05:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND UNEXPECTED VICTORY HE

05:54.700 --> 05:57.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APPEALED FOR THE AKP PARTY TO

05:57.967 --> 06:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE HUMILITY IN THIS VICTORY

06:00.333 --> 06:02.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND NOT TO BE ARROGANT ABOUT IT.

06:02.567 --> 06:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> BECAUSE OF THE SECURITY

06:03.833 --> 06:05.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION YOU MENTIONED ALREADY,

06:05.100 --> 06:08.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT ABOUT THE REFUGEES THAT ARE

06:08.967 --> 06:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LANDING ON TURKEY'S DOOR?

06:10.533 --> 06:14.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY HAVE 2 MILLION REFUGEES,

06:14.067 --> 06:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTICULARLY ENTIRE CITIES OF

06:16.133 --> 06:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REFUGEE CAMPS NOW.

06:16.700 --> 06:18.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THIS IS REALLY A MAJOR

06:18.500 --> 06:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBLEM FOR TURKEY BUT ALSO FOR

06:19.833 --> 06:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EUROPE.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WHAT THIS ELECTION VICTORY

06:22.533 --> 06:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOES REALLY IN A WAY SIT

06:26.133 --> 06:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRENGTHENS MR. ERDOGAN'S HAND

06:27.833 --> 06:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING WITH

06:29.000 --> 06:29.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EUROPE.

06:29.567 --> 06:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW THEY KNOW WHO THEY'RE

06:30.933 --> 06:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEALING WITH.

06:31.400 --> 06:32.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE IN EUROPE

06:32.967 --> 06:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR EXAMPLE WHO THINK

06:34.600 --> 06:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MR. ERDOGAN AND HIS PARTIES HERE

06:37.300 --> 06:39.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE BEEN BLACKMAILING EUROPE

06:39.000 --> 06:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO TRYING TO GET MORE MONEY

06:40.300 --> 06:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT OF THEM IN ORDER TO SUPPORT

06:42.133 --> 06:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE REFUGEES.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT NOW, AT LEAST EUROPE KNOWS

06:45.700 --> 06:47.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WHO IT'S DEALING WITH.

06:47.067 --> 06:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT THERE IS SOME SORT OF

06:48.500 --> 06:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNMENT HERE.

06:49.300 --> 06:51.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO PERHAPS, SOME SORT OF

06:51.000 --> 06:52.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARRANGEMENT CAN NOW BE WORKED

06:52.600 --> 06:53.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT.

06:53.167 --> 06:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

QUESTIONNAIRES OR POLLS TAKEN ON

06:58.267 --> 06:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT INFLUENCED PEOPLE WHEN THEY

06:59.133 --> 07:01.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WENT INTO THE POLLS TODAY?

07:01.367 --> 07:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT SORT OF EVIDENCE HAS NOT

07:03.100 --> 07:05.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY COME OUT ON TURKISH

07:05.167 --> 07:06.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TELEVISION.

07:06.033 --> 07:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE HERE

07:07.933 --> 07:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RATHER UNHAPPY ABOUT THE

07:09.100 --> 07:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESULTS.

07:09.600 --> 07:12.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE PEOPLE ON THE LEFT OF

07:12.567 --> 07:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TURKISH SOCIETY AND ALSO PEOPLE

07:14.800 --> 07:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE KURDISH AREAS IN THE

07:17.733 --> 07:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOUTHEAST PERTURBED ABOUT THE

07:20.033 --> 07:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEVEL OF VICTORY MR. ERDOGAN

07:21.833 --> 07:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEMS TO HAVE ACHIEVED.

07:24.433 --> 07:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE SEEMING TO SUGGEST THAT

07:26.233 --> 07:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WERE SOME KIND OF DIRTY

07:28.200 --> 07:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRICKS BUT THE INTERNATIONAL

OBSERVERS ORGANIZATION, THE THE

07:33.633 --> 07:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORGANIZATION FOR SECURITY IN

07:35.133 --> 07:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EUROPE, SEEM PRETTY HAPPY OF THE

07:37.433 --> 07:39.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAY THE ELECTION WAS CARRIED OUT

07:39.300 --> 07:40.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN COMPLETE FAIRNESS.

07:40.567 --> 07:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE THINGS A LITTLE BIT

07:43.100 --> 07:45.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRANGE HERE FOR EXAMPLE THE

07:45.767 --> 07:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFFICIAL STATE ORGANIZATION THAT

07:48.300 --> 07:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTS THE POLLS CLOSED DOWN,

07:50.233 --> 07:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT PUZZLED THE MOST

07:53.233 --> 07:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPERIENCED POLITICAL ANALYSTS.

07:54.933 --> 07:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THAT HAS

07:56.400 --> 07:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENED.

07:57.033 --> 08:00.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE OTHERS WHO ARE ANGRY,

08:00.567 --> 08:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE DISTURBANCES IN THE

08:03.633 --> 08:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CENTER OF THE KURDISH REGION IN

08:04.933 --> 08:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SOUTHEAST, THE PEOPLE WHO

08:07.533 --> 08:11.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPPORT THE KURDISH PARTY THE

08:11.000 --> 08:13.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HTP, WHO DID SO WELL IN THE JUNE

08:13.967 --> 08:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTION, ARE DISAPPOINTED THEIR

08:15.100 --> 08:16.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NUMBERS HAVE DROPPED.

08:16.267 --> 08:17.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE THINK THE REASON THEY

08:17.467 --> 08:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIDN'T DO SO WELL THIS TIME IS

08:19.300 --> 08:20.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THEY ARE FORCED INTO A

08:20.767 --> 08:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POSITION OF SUPPORTING IN A WAY

08:23.200 --> 08:26.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
