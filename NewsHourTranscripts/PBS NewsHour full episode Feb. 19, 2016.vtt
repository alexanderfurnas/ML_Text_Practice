JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.540 --> 00:12.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: a
scramble for
Republicans and a close race for
Democrats.

00:12.279 --> 00:18.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Candidates have one last day to
campaign until
voting tomorrow in South
Carolina and Nevada,

00:18.619 --> 00:23.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
making a perfect Friday preview
for Mark Shields
and David Brooks. They are here
to analyze

00:24.057 --> 00:25.926 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the week's news.

00:26.026 --> 00:31.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: a report from the Greek
island of Lesbos,
where winter weather has done
little to stem

00:31.465 --> 00:33.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the flow of refugees.

00:33.233 --> 00:49.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: A normal day. The boat have
a problem
with the engine. It cannot move.
The people

00:49.483 --> 00:50.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
inside, we have too many
children, two sick
guys, in this case, we have to
put on board

00:50.550 --> 00:52.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and take them ashore to have a
medical test.

00:52.586 --> 00:55.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we remember
Harper Lee,
author of the classic novel "To
Kill a Mockingbird."

00:55.522 --> 00:58.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She died today at age 89.

00:58.759 --> 01:03.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:03.997 --> 01:05.832 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:05.933 --> 01:18.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thousands of
people, among
them President and Mrs. Obama,
paid final

01:18.211 --> 01:23.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
respects today to Supreme Court
Justice Antonin
Scalia. He died last Saturday at
the age of

01:24.084 --> 01:30.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
79, and lay in repose today at
the building
where he had worked since 1986.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has our report.

01:32.626 --> 01:37.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It was a day
of solemn scenes
at the land's highest court,
starting with

01:37.998 --> 01:43.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the flag-covered casket being
carried past
men and women who clerked for
Scalia during

01:43.136 --> 01:45.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his 30 years as a justice.

01:45.238 --> 01:49.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The procession moved into the
Great Hall,
passing the eight remaining
justices, and

01:49.309 --> 01:54.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the casket was placed on a
funeral bier first
used after President Lincoln's
assassination.

01:54.514 --> 01:59.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, a private ceremony, with
the justice's
widow and children looking on,
as his son,

02:00.087 --> 02:02.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Reverend Paul Scalia, read the
Lord's Prayer.

02:02.222 --> 02:06.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. PAUL SCALIA, Son of Antonin
Scalia: Our
father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy

02:06.960 --> 02:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
name. Thy kingdom come, thy will
be done on
earth, as is it is in heaven.

02:13.600 --> 02:18.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Throughout the
day, former
clerks stood vigil, occasionally
wiping away

02:18.438 --> 02:23.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tears, as the court opened for
public viewing.
Visitors ranged from tourists,
to members

02:23.210 --> 02:28.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Congress, to federal appeals
Judges Sri
Srinivasan and Patricia Millett,
who are being

02:28.749 --> 02:31.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mentioned as possible
replacements for Scalia.

02:32.052 --> 02:35.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Outside, for much of the day,
the line stretched
around the block.

02:35.889 --> 02:40.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Someone who knew the law,
had the right
opinions about the law, and just
had the wit

02:40.761 --> 02:44.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to actually convey those
opinions in a way
that, like, stuck with you and,
like, made

02:44.931 --> 02:46.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an impression.

02:46.733 --> 02:48.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF CULLER, Washington, D.C.: I
couldn't
be further from the polar
opposite of Justice

02:48.568 --> 02:52.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Scalia and a lot of his
philosophies. You
know, I'm probably as far to the
left as he

02:53.040 --> 02:56.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is to the right, but, you know,
that isn't
really important. When someone
dies, it's

02:56.943 --> 02:59.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
just kind of time to put
politics aside.

02:59.379 --> 03:04.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Another
mourner, Benjamin
Williams, offered a bagpipe
tribute, as he

03:04.618 --> 03:07.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said he's done for senators and
congressmen
before.

03:07.854 --> 03:11.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This afternoon, President Obama
and the first
lady paid their respects. The
Obamas will

03:11.858 --> 03:16.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not attend tomorrow's funeral,
but Vice President
Biden and his wife will be there
at Washington's

03:16.730 --> 03:20.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Basilica of the National Shrine
of the Immaculate
Conception.

03:20.467 --> 03:26.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news, an
offshoot Kurdish militant group
claimed responsibility

03:26.740 --> 03:33.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today for a suicide bombing that
rocked Turkey's
capital this week. The blast in
Ankara killed

03:33.346 --> 03:39.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
28 people. The Kurdistan Freedom
Falcons said
it was revenge for Turkish
military assaults

03:39.886 --> 03:41.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on Kurdish rebels.

03:42.055 --> 03:47.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prospects for peace in Syria
have dimmed even
further. The U.N.'s Syria envoy
today called

03:48.095 --> 03:53.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off peace talks planned for next
week. Staffan
de Mistura said he cannot
realistically arrange

03:54.067 --> 03:59.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
negotiations right now. Fighting
has intensified
in the last week, with a new
offensive by

03:59.773 --> 04:04.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syria's military and its allies,
backed up
by Russian bombing.

04:04.744 --> 04:11.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. warplanes attacked an
Islamic State training
camp in Libya overnight and may
have killed

04:11.184 --> 04:17.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a top Tunisian militant. U.S.
officials say
that Noureddine Chouchane was
linked to last

04:17.324 --> 04:23.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year's attack on a museum in
Tunis that killed
22 people. A Pentagon spokesman
said he was

04:23.163 --> 04:27.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spotted at a site near the town
of Sabratha,
close to the border with
Tunisia.

04:27.901 --> 04:31.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER COOK, Pentagon Press
Secretary: This
group, and this particular
individual, who

04:31.271 --> 04:39.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had -- was named as a suspect
previously in
an attack in Tunisia, posed,
again, a threat

04:39.946 --> 04:46.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to Libya specifically, to
interests in the
region, and posed a national
security threat

04:46.586 --> 04:48.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the United States.

04:48.488 --> 04:52.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Video of the
aftermath showed
the destruction, and the
victims. Local officials

04:52.459 --> 04:58.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said more than 40 people were
killed, but
the Pentagon could not confirm
the number.

04:58.165 --> 05:03.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Israeli forces shot dead three
more Palestinians
today in an ongoing wave of
violence. The

05:04.070 --> 05:09.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Israeli military said one man
rammed a car
into Israeli troops in the West
Bank town

05:09.943 --> 05:15.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Ramallah. Another fired on
soldiers near
Bethlehem. And a third stabbed
and wounded

05:15.415 --> 05:21.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two officers in Jerusalem. The
near-daily
attacks started last September.

05:21.221 --> 05:25.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
European leaders say they have
reached an
agreement tonight that could
keep Britain

05:25.725 --> 05:31.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the European Union. It came
after a two-day
summit in Brussels went into
overtime. Prime

05:31.731 --> 05:36.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Minister David Cameron said the
deal gives
Britain special status. The
summit outcome

05:36.570 --> 05:42.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could help Cameron win a summer
referendum
on remaining part of the E.U.

05:42.108 --> 05:47.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vietnam and the Philippines are
the latest
to protest China's placement of
surface-to-air

05:48.081 --> 05:54.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
missiles in the South China Sea.
The batteries
are deployed on Woody Island in
the Paracels.

05:54.854 --> 06:00.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is controlled by China, but
also claimed
by Vietnam and Taiwan. The
Chinese said today

06:00.627 --> 06:04.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they are acting in response
to American
actions.

06:04.564 --> 06:08.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HONG LEI, Spokesman, Chinese
Foreign Ministry
(through translator): The U.S.
has been continuously

06:08.735 --> 06:13.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
increasing its military presence
in the South
China Sea by sending out
military aircraft

06:13.406 --> 06:17.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and ships. The U.S. has
repeatedly pressed
on its alliance and partners to
conduct joint

06:17.811 --> 06:22.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
military exercises. These
actions have escalated
the tensions, meaning more
militarization

06:22.849 --> 06:24.718 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this region.

06:24.818 --> 06:28.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. has
criticized China's
missile move, and said that it
will continue

06:28.822 --> 06:32.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to insist on freedom of
navigation throughout
the region.

06:33.093 --> 06:38.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Uganda, voting turned to
violence a day
after the country's presidential
election.

06:38.498 --> 06:44.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Angry protests broke out when
the main opposition
candidate was arrested again.
Police fired

06:44.237 --> 06:49.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tear gas and bullets into the
air to disperse
the crowds. The country's
president, Yoweri

06:49.976 --> 06:53.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Museveni, has held power for 30
years.

06:53.546 --> 06:58.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, the last
of Louisiana's
Angola Three inmates was
released after more

06:58.885 --> 07:05.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than 40 years. Albert Woodfox
and two others
spent decades in isolation at
state prisons

07:05.525 --> 07:11.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Angola and elsewhere. He was
twice convicted
of murder in the death of a
prison guard,

07:11.564 --> 07:16.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but the verdicts were
overturned. Woodfox
was awaiting a new trial when he
agreed to

07:16.169 --> 07:20.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plead no contest and go free at
the age of
69.

07:20.674 --> 07:25.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The state of Oregon is headed
towards the
highest minimum wage in the
country. A bill

07:25.211 --> 07:31.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to raise the wage over six years
won final
approval Thursday. It is the
first such measure

07:31.584 --> 07:39.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to set pay by region. By 2022,
Portland employees
will earn $14.75 an hour, while
workers in

07:40.026 --> 07:44.264 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rural areas will make $12.50.

07:44.364 --> 07:48.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Wall Street finished the
week with mixed
results. The Dow Jones
industrial average

07:48.368 --> 07:56.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lost 21 points to close at
16392. The Nasdaq
rose nearly 17 points, and the
S&amp;P 500 was

07:56.876 --> 07:59.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
virtually unchanged.

07:59.245 --> 08:04.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
why winning
South Carolina is so important
to the GOP

08:04.851 --> 08:10.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidates; Mark Shields and
David Brooks
take on a packed week of news; a
dangerous

08:10.357 --> 08:28.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
journey for children seeking
refuge in Greece
with their families; and much
more.

08:28.508 --> 08:33.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Presidential candidates in both
parties are
down to less than 24 hours until
the next

08:33.213 --> 08:35.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
two critical contests.

08:35.115 --> 08:40.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, they spent one last day
trying to make
their case, the Democrats in
Nevada and the

08:40.887 --> 08:42.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Republicans in South Carolina.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
The pope was great. He made a
beautiful statement

08:45.091 --> 08:46.926 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this morning.

08:47.027 --> 08:50.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That was Donald
Trump in Myrtle
Beach today, taking a softer
line after his

08:50.897 --> 08:58.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
flare-up with Pope Francis. The
pontiff had
said Trump is not a Christian if
he advocates

08:58.438 --> 09:00.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
building a wall along the
Mexican border.

09:00.874 --> 09:05.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: They had him
convinced that
illegal immigration was like a
wonderful thing.

09:05.645 --> 09:08.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Not wonderful for us. It's
wonderful for Mexico.

09:08.648 --> 09:13.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In turn, the
Vatican said the
pontiff's comments were -- quote
-- "in no

09:13.353 --> 09:18.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way a personal attack, nor an
indication on
how to vote."

09:18.358 --> 09:25.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump, though, faced continuing
attacks from
his Republican rivals, while
defending a lead

09:25.331 --> 09:28.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that some polls suggest may be
shrinking.

09:28.902 --> 09:32.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Texas Senator Ted Cruz also
campaigned in
Myrtle Beach.

09:32.138 --> 09:36.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
It's easy to say make America
great again.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can even print that on a
baseball cap.

09:38.511 --> 09:40.280 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

09:40.380 --> 09:44.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: But the question
to ask is,
do you understand what made
America great

in the first place?

09:46.019 --> 09:48.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARBARA BUSH, Former First Lady:
Jeb Bush.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

09:49.756 --> 09:53.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For another
rival, Jeb Bush,
tomorrow could be make-or-break.

09:53.726 --> 09:55.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEB BUSH (R), Presidential
Candidate: Thank
you, mom.

09:55.628 --> 09:59.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He brought along
his mother,
former first lady Barbara Bush,
and took a

09:59.232 --> 10:01.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
decidedly humble tack.

10:01.201 --> 10:04.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEB BUSH: Thank you, lord, for
allowing me
to be a candidate, to be -- to
run for the

10:04.838 --> 10:10.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presidency of the United States
in the most
extraordinary country on the
face of the earth.

10:10.577 --> 10:16.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Democrats hold
their primary
in South Carolina next Saturday.
And, today,

10:16.883 --> 10:22.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton picked up a
critical endorsement.
It came from Jim Clyburn, the
state's top

10:22.222 --> 10:25.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Democrat and first black
congressman since
Reconstruction.

10:25.525 --> 10:30.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. JAMES CLYBURN (D), South
Carolina: A
few people speculated that my
head was with

10:30.129 --> 10:38.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one candidate, and my heart with
the other.
That wasn't the case at all. My
heart has

10:38.171 --> 10:40.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
always been with Hillary
Clinton.

10:41.007 --> 10:46.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last night, both
Clinton and
Bernie Sanders appeared in a
town hall in

10:46.312 --> 10:54.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Las Vegas hosted by MSNBC and
Telemundo. The
night's big focus, immigration.
Sanders was

10:54.120 --> 10:59.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
asked to explain his 2007 vote
against a comprehensive
reform bill.

10:59.559 --> 11:03.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
Included in that legislation was
a guest-worker

11:03.696 --> 11:10.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
provision, which organizations
saw as almost
akin to slavery. Guest workers
came in, and

11:11.037 --> 11:16.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if they didn't do what their
bosses wanted
them to do, if they didn't
accept exploitation

11:17.043 --> 11:19.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and cheating, then they're going
to be thrown
out of this country.

11:19.812 --> 11:25.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Clinton
talked of continuing
President Obama's executive
actions that defer

11:25.118 --> 11:28.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the deportations of many
undocumented immigrants.

11:28.154 --> 11:31.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
And I will do everything I can
to make sure

11:31.791 --> 11:36.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they are kept in place. As
you know,
there's a court action
challenging them. I

11:36.863 --> 11:41.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't know what's going to
happen now because
of the Supreme Court situation.
But I will

11:41.434 --> 11:45.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
renew them. I will go further,
if it's at
all legally possible.

11:45.305 --> 11:50.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Both Clinton and
Sanders stuck
to stumping in the Silver State
today, where

11:50.810 --> 11:56.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the race is neck and neck.
Democrats will
caucus there tomorrow, as
Republicans hold

11:56.416 --> 11:59.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their primary in South Carolina.

11:59.452 --> 12:04.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the day wasn't over without
Trump making
another controversial statement.
He called

12:04.223 --> 12:10.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a boycott of Apple products
until the
tech company complies with an
FBI order to

12:10.430 --> 12:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unlock a phone used by one of
the San Bernardino
shooters.

12:13.666 --> 12:20.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: First of all,
Apple ought to
give the security for that
phone, OK? What

12:20.406 --> 12:25.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think you ought to do is
boycott Apple until
such time as they give that
security number.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.546 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(END VIDEO CLIP)

12:26.646 --> 12:28.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: How do you like --
I just thought
of -- boycott Apple.

12:28.748 --> 12:34.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Although Trump
seems to defy
conventions, South Carolina
history tells

12:34.420 --> 12:40.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us one thing for sure. The
Palmetto State
has a unique brand of
sharp-edged politics.

down to six
candidates, and they all know
the saying South

12:48.701 --> 12:50.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Carolina picks presidents.

12:50.570 --> 12:54.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEB BUSH: You all have the
chance to reset
the race. That's what South
Carolinians have

12:54.907 --> 12:56.709 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
done in the past.

12:56.809 --> 12:59.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: And now South
Carolina is going
to play the role that it has
always played

12:59.479 --> 13:03.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in presidential race, the
historic role of
choosing presidents.

13:03.816 --> 13:11.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. NIKKI HALEY (R), South

presidents. Let's make Marco
Rubio the next

13:11.324 --> 13:15.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president of the United States!
God bless!

13:15.361 --> 13:22.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every year since 1980 from

NEWT GINGRICH (R), Former
Speaker of the House:
We want to run not a Republican
campaign.

13:27.940 --> 13:30.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We want to run an American

BRUCE HAYNES, Republican

Carolina, in the past, has gone
for more establishment

13:43.222 --> 13:48.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
types, strong leaders typically
with a lot
of experience in politics. But
this time,

13:48.227 --> 13:50.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we may be turning a different
page.

13:50.163 --> 13:54.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: He is
referring, of course,
to Donald Trump, who's doubled
down in South

13:54.133 --> 13:59.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carolina, with far more events
per day than
in Iowa or New Hampshire. He has
the same

13:59.372 --> 14:01.174 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
strong words.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Who's the best on

It's Trump. Who's the best on
the economy

14:04.010 --> 14:05.678 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is Trump.

BRUCE HAYNES: There's a piece of
the state
that's still catching up. The
cut-and-sew

14:12.018 --> 14:16.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
textile plants have shut down
and closed,
and those jobs have gone
overseas, which plays

14:16.756 --> 14:22.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right into the message that
Donald Trump is
delivering about trade, about
jobs and about

14:23.096 --> 14:24.831 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
China.

please, continue
this awakening. Continue this
spirit of revival.

14:35.041 --> 14:39.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

we might pull
back from the abyss.

14:39.412 --> 14:43.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: South Carolina
is pivotal
because of the calendar. It's
the first presidential

14:43.816 --> 14:47.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vote in the South. But it is
important because
of numbers.

14:47.520 --> 14:53.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In 2012, nearly 600,000
Republicans voted
in the primary there. That's
more than Iowa

14:53.426 --> 14:58.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and New Hampshire combined. One
key part of
the political landscape, the
military. As

14:58.231 --> 15:03.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many as one in six voters in the
Palmetto
State is current military or a
veteran, and

15:03.936 --> 15:05.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the candidates clearly know it.

15:05.938 --> 15:10.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We are going to
make our military
so big, so strong, so powerful,
nobody's ever

15:10.243 --> 15:12.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to have to mess with us,
folks.

15:12.211 --> 15:13.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),

Who could be complaining about
anything, when

15:13.679 --> 15:17.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you think about what these guys
endured over

science at The Citadel and
believes Trump's

15:24.924 --> 15:26.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
tough talk gives him an
advantage.

15:26.826 --> 15:30.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUBOSE KAPELUCK, The Citadel:
The idea that
if you poke the United States,
we're going

15:30.263 --> 15:35.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to come back with full force,
overwhelming
force, and get the job done
militarily and

15:35.768 --> 15:42.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pull out, I think that is a
sentiment that
Trump expresses that resonates
well with our

15:42.608 --> 15:44.343 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people here in the military.

15:44.443 --> 15:48.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: True even after
Trump went
on the attack against former
President George

W. Bush.

15:50.716 --> 15:54.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: The World Trade

down during the reign of George
Bush. He kept

15:54.253 --> 15:55.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
us safe? That is not safe.

(BOOING)

15:57.957 --> 16:01.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUBOSE KAPELUCK: You would
expect veterans
to be maybe inflamed about that
and upset,

16:01.394 --> 16:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but that didn't really faze
them. In fact,
you saw some sympathy for that
point of view,

16:07.733 --> 16:09.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which was, I think, telling.

LISA DESJARDINS: The state has a
sharp reputation
for what some would call
political tricks.

16:14.273 --> 16:19.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In just the past day, the Cruz
campaign posted
this photo that looks like Marco
Rubio shaking

16:19.679 --> 16:25.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hands with Barack Obama. But it
is Photoshopped
from a stock image that Twitter
users found.

16:25.618 --> 16:30.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Cruz campaign later posted a
different,
undoctored photo, and said their
candidate

16:30.756 --> 16:35.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been Photoshopped in others'
ads. And
more tricks could still be
ahead.

BRUCE HAYNES: They come,

during the primary, so the other
campaigns

16:40.399 --> 16:43.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't have time to respond to

17:21.207 --> 17:26.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's an accumulation of

17:26.545 --> 17:30.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
George Bush and the Iraq War.
You call everybody
a liar. Then you have the pope
thing. Then

17:30.416 --> 17:32.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you have the Apple thing.

17:32.285 --> 17:36.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question is, will fatigue
ever set in?
And some of the polls suggest
no. In some

17:36.722 --> 17:39.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the polls, he's still doing
solidly. But there
are another set of polls.
There's a stream

17:40.059 --> 17:43.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of polls, including the NBC/Wall
Street Journal
poll, which suggest it's
beginning to hurt

17:43.896 --> 17:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him and that he's beginning to
slide. There
is some exhaustion factor.

17:47.466 --> 17:54.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I don't think it's one thing
that's -- but
it's the accumulation of
bombast. And there

17:54.373 --> 17:57.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
may be this -- we may be getting
to the moment
-- and I thought he was
completely unhinged

17:57.743 --> 18:01.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the debate Saturday night --
where that
begins to have some telling
effect.

18:01.847 --> 18:06.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you see some
of the magic
maybe dissipating from Donald
Trump?

18:06.886 --> 18:10.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, I agree with
David, first
of all, on the debate.

18:10.122 --> 18:16.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My only explanation for it is,
he was unnerved
by the public booing. And the
booing was so

18:16.529 --> 18:22.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sustained. And this is a man who
feeds off
the adulation of his own
rallies. There's

18:22.201 --> 18:27.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no way in the world you planned
going into
a national debate for
Republicans on national

18:27.473 --> 18:31.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
television that you were going
to suggest
-- charge, not suggest -- charge
that the

18:31.777 --> 18:35.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last Republican president of the
United States
not only knew that there were no
weapons of

18:35.815 --> 18:41.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mass destruction, but took the
country into
war knowing that.

18:41.554 --> 18:46.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it was just -- it was really
bizarre,
beyond. As far as the pope is
concerned, it

18:47.059 --> 18:53.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
will come as an enormous
surprise to Donald
Trump that the pope has probably
no idea who

18:53.199 --> 19:00.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he is. The question was, what
about someone
who advocates building walls,
rather than

19:00.473 --> 19:07.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
building bridges, and closes off
any access
or really compassion to those
who are suffering

19:07.613 --> 19:10.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from forced migration and the
dispossessed?

19:11.017 --> 19:17.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the pope said, that's
un-Christian, and
I think by just about any
definition. There

19:17.256 --> 19:20.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is an iron rule in American
politics about
the clergy, whether it's the
pope or a rabbi

19:21.027 --> 19:26.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or a minister. And that is, they
should never
interfere in politics, unless
they -- the

19:26.565 --> 19:29.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one exception being when they
agree with me
and my side.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.504 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

19:31.604 --> 19:36.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: So I think that,
after John
McCain and Mexicans and Muslims
and Megyn

19:36.909 --> 19:41.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kelly, the pope -- I wouldn't
put Apple in
the same category as a
sympathetic institution.

19:41.580 --> 19:43.549 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

19:43.649 --> 19:47.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: But, at some
point, the accumulation
of the people he has just not
only made enemies

19:48.054 --> 19:52.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with, but denigrated, I think,
becomes a weight
too heavy for his candidacy.

19:53.025 --> 19:56.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, maybe
another problem
for Donald Trump, David, is the
endorsement

19:56.495 --> 20:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Marco Rubio by the Governor
Nikki Haley
in South Carolina. Does
something like that

20:01.000 --> 20:02.935 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
help Rubio? Does it move him?

20:03.035 --> 20:05.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I think, in
general, endorsements
don't matter, but in this case
it matters,

20:05.971 --> 20:10.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, in part because of the
debate performance
from a couple of weeks ago where
his campaign

20:10.342 --> 20:14.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seemed to be in decline. This
helps revive
the story that he's on the
rebound.

20:14.313 --> 20:17.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, indeed, if you look at the
polls, he's
on the rebound. To me, the most
interesting

20:17.249 --> 20:21.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
story on the Republican side,
unless the polls
are completely wrong, Trump will
probably

20:21.187 --> 20:26.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
win. But Rubio could beat Cruz
for second.
They seem neck and neck in most
of the polls.

20:26.125 --> 20:31.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if Ted Cruz comes in second
in South Carolina,
an evangelical-heavy state, a
pretty conservative

20:31.230 --> 20:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state, that says something about
-- that says
something serious about the Cruz
candidacy.

20:34.800 --> 20:38.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
the Rubio/Cruz
thing? Cruz has been -- gotten
in trouble,

20:38.204 --> 20:43.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as Lisa just reported, Mark,
over those TV
spots he's been running. And he
has really

20:43.209 --> 20:46.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been in a tough back-and-forth
with both Trump
and with Rubio.

20:46.378 --> 20:50.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Did anybody notice
that they
were shaking hands with their
left hands?

20:50.950 --> 20:58.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's how bad that was. It was
really a lousy
Photoshop job, in addition to
being cheap

20:58.124 --> 21:00.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and tawdry politics.

21:00.159 --> 21:06.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that, as a general rule,
endorsements,
unless it's the spouse of one
candidate endorsing

21:07.032 --> 21:07.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the opponent...

21:07.433 --> 21:09.301 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

21:09.401 --> 21:11.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: ... really don't
-- people don't
quite say, I was undecided. I
was either going

21:11.637 --> 21:15.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to vote between Kennedy and
Nixon, but the
lieutenant governor endorsed
Nixon, so I'm

21:16.041 --> 21:17.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going to vote for him.

21:17.910 --> 21:20.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's a very personal -- but
I do think
Nikki Haley may be the
exception. She's one

21:20.679 --> 21:26.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the -- she's 4-1 favorable
among Republican
voters. She has a favorable
rating among African-American

21:27.019 --> 21:30.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voters, rare for any Republican
in the country,
let alone one in South Carolina.

21:30.990 --> 21:37.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's just really -- I think
it does give
him a little narrative that --
with Tim Scott

21:37.596 --> 21:43.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Trey Gowdy, that he is on
the rebound
and coming back.

21:43.435 --> 21:49.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If, in fact, Ted Cruz, having
won Iowa and
finished third in New Hampshire
-- and it

21:49.842 --> 21:53.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was expected that once they went
below the
Mason-Dixon Line, you were
getting into his

21:53.546 --> 21:57.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
favorable territory -- if he
finishes third,
I think it's a real setback for
him.

21:57.917 --> 22:03.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I have to ask you
both about
Jeb Bush, one of the so-called
establishment

22:03.789 --> 22:07.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trio. David, he had his brother
the former
president in there. He had his
mother, Barbara

22:08.027 --> 22:11.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bush, as we just reported, in
there. What's
going on with Jeb Bush? Is this
helping him?

22:12.064 --> 22:15.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: The press thought
Bush was coming
back until -- and he's -- I
think if he hangs

22:16.001 --> 22:18.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around 10, he can stay in until
Florida. He's
got the money.

22:18.270 --> 22:19.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ten percent. Yes.

22:19.271 --> 22:22.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I think he's
performing well.

22:22.208 --> 22:27.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People have sort of closed their
mind, but
if he falls down to around 5 or
6, you know,

22:27.179 --> 22:32.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then, nationally, he's at 4, so
that's not
good. And so I think he can hang
around, just

22:32.851 --> 22:34.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
because I -- he may feel...

22:34.220 --> 22:35.321 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

22:35.421 --> 22:37.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Even if he comes
in fourth
or fifth?

22:37.389 --> 22:43.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, I see Mark
frowning at
me. And I hate to -- now I have
the lord judgment

22:43.929 --> 22:44.263 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
upon me.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.198 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

22:46.298 --> 22:49.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But I still think
he feels called
to hit back at Trump. I think he
would hate

22:49.935 --> 22:52.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to think that he wasn't there to
hit back
at Trump.

22:52.404 --> 22:55.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He, of course, would hurt the
anti-Trump cause
by getting out, but I'm sure
that's not how

22:55.841 --> 22:56.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he feels in his heart.

22:56.742 --> 22:58.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

22:58.744 --> 23:02.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That Wall Street Journal/NBC
poll that David
cited did an interesting thing.
They did matchups

23:03.048 --> 23:07.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if it did come down to two
candidates, if
it were Marco Rubio against
Trump, or it were

23:07.953 --> 23:14.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ted Cruz against Trump. And both
of them would
beat Trump by 16 points, which
is pretty impressive,

23:14.393 --> 23:16.161 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
56-40.

23:16.262 --> 23:20.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there is a real ceiling
Donald Trump has.
The one candidate Donald Trump
did beat in

23:20.199 --> 23:26.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a matchup was Jeb Bush. And I
just think,
at some point, it becomes just
obvious.

23:26.939 --> 23:29.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean in a
head-on-head,
head-to-head.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.143 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

23:31.243 --> 23:34.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Do you want to go
home to Florida,
where you were a successful and
popular two-term

23:34.647 --> 23:43.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
governor, and lose, and
especially if Marco
Rubio, the mentee, gets the
boost out of South

23:44.023 --> 23:49.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carolina, and the mentor --
having finished
sixth in Iowa, fourth in New
Hampshire, I

23:49.495 --> 23:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mean, do you really continue
with another
fourth in South Carolina?

23:54.233 --> 23:57.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it becomes awfully
difficult, almost
painful.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me move you
quickly to
the Democrats.

24:00.039 --> 24:06.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nevada, they're voting in those
caucuses tomorrow.
David, both of you said last
week words to

24:06.145 --> 24:11.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the effect that you don't see
Hillary Clinton
has a rationale to her
candidacy. Seven days

24:11.884 --> 24:13.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
later, do you still feel the
same way?

24:13.385 --> 24:15.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: I do.

24:15.287 --> 24:18.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's gone more aggressively in
trying to
use identity politics to trump
class politics,

24:18.857 --> 24:23.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which I don't think is a good
strategy in
2016. This is a very economic
class war they're

24:23.796 --> 24:28.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
having. And secondly, the
interesting thing
about what's happening in Nevada
is that it's

24:28.233 --> 24:31.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
close. It didn't seem that way
several weeks
ago.

24:31.270 --> 24:37.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's because Sanders has
done well with
Latinos. And it's interesting.
There is a

24:37.176 --> 24:40.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
difference between the way
Latino voters are
reacting and African-American
voters, especially

24:40.379 --> 24:44.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in South Carolina. The
African-Americans are
still pretty solidly behind
Clinton, but the

24:44.350 --> 24:46.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Latino voters are not.

24:46.285 --> 24:51.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, assuming he does -- ties
or even wins,
the question will be whether
people in South

24:51.156 --> 24:54.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carolina in African-American
communities,
in other communities are willing
to take another

24:54.693 --> 24:58.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look at him, because there's a
lot of people
who really haven't focused on
him yet.

24:58.464 --> 25:05.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, if he does win Nevada,
that changes
the storyline and gives him just
another -- just

25:05.137 --> 25:08.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
another step up of what has been
a series
of pretty good steps over the
last six weeks.

25:08.640 --> 25:09.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you see
going on with
Clinton-Sanders?

25:09.942 --> 25:13.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I wish I could
disagree with
David.

25:13.445 --> 25:20.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that Bernie Sanders
right now is in
a period of momentum. And I
think what's interesting,

25:20.753 --> 25:27.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton since April has
slipped in
overall polling by the Wall
Street Journal/NBC

25:27.659 --> 25:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
poll -- they put up of their
surveys together
-- with every demographic group,
I mean, across

25:33.966 --> 25:41.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the board, age, income,
education, gender,
nationality, but particularly
among Latinos,

25:41.573 --> 25:44.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which there is no explanation
for it.

25:44.543 --> 25:49.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And her campaign, when New
Hampshire looked
sort of dreary, had boasted
openly that they

25:49.381 --> 25:59.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had a 25-point lead in Nevada,
raising expectations.
As far as her rationale, it's
basically it's

25:59.358 --> 26:07.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary's turn. She's strong.
She's tested.
We live in a dangerous world,
and she's ready,

26:07.332 --> 26:10.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and you need somebody there who
is steady
and ready.

26:10.135 --> 26:16.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or the third one is, do you want
Barack Obama's
third term? I promise you, I
will give that.

26:16.375 --> 26:19.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That seems to me to be the
rationale for her
candidacy at this point.

26:19.645 --> 26:25.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And she was
making what appeared
to be an effort to nail down her
strong position

26:25.818 --> 26:27.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on immigration, on supporting...

26:27.686 --> 26:31.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes. She did have
one great
spot -- I don't know if you have
seen it -- where

26:31.723 --> 26:32.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the little Latino girl...

26:32.991 --> 26:34.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

26:34.893 --> 26:38.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes. Her parents
are going to
be deported. And Hillary Clinton
shows a kindness

26:38.630 --> 26:43.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a compassion, a soft side,
which I think
has been missing totally from
her candidacy.

26:43.202 --> 26:48.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, I want
to come to
the death of the Supreme Court
Justice Antonin

26:49.007 --> 26:50.375 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Scalia.

26:50.476 --> 26:53.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David, reflections on him before
we talk about
the politics of it?

26:53.745 --> 26:58.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, he was a
joyous spirit,
poker player, cigar, wine.

26:58.217 --> 27:02.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you want to convert
people to your
side, you can issue court
opinions, but be

27:02.921 --> 27:07.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a pleasant spirit. And I'm
really impressed
by the court. We have so much
polarization.

27:07.593 --> 27:12.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They generally are friends with
each other
and they work hard on that. It's
a very impressive

27:12.631 --> 27:14.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
institution.

27:14.600 --> 27:18.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes. He -- Abner
Mikva, former
congressman from Illinois,
member of the Court

27:18.136 --> 27:21.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Appeals, remember, when he
was nominated,
he said he had served...

27:21.907 --> 27:22.508 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

27:22.608 --> 27:23.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A Democrat.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: A Democrat.

27:25.210 --> 27:28.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When Antonin Scalia was
nominated to the Supreme
Court, he said, great guy, just
a terrific

27:28.347 --> 27:30.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
guy. I disagree with him on
everything.

27:30.382 --> 27:36.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that was it. He
never let the
disagreements define any
relationship. And

27:36.555 --> 27:41.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the one with Ruth Bader
Ginsburg, you see
the two of them laughing and
thoroughly enjoying

27:41.960 --> 27:48.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
each other in an open and
natural way, which
is refreshing in Washington in
this particular

27:48.400 --> 27:51.970 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
era.
JUDY WOODRUFF: I think you could
see that
as they were standing there
today at the Supreme

27:52.070 --> 27:53.839 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Court.

27:53.939 --> 27:57.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There may not have been
disagreements that
way, but there certainly are
disagreements

27:57.142 --> 28:01.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
politically, David, over what's
going to happen
now. The president says he's
going to nominate

28:01.179 --> 28:04.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
someone. The Senate Republican
leadership
is saying, well, we're not going
to confirm

28:04.750 --> 28:06.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them. We may not even consider.

28:06.718 --> 28:09.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. Well, of
course they should
consider. He is president. And
the Constitution

28:09.721 --> 28:13.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says the president nominates,
and the Constitution
is there to put rules around our
struggles

28:13.559 --> 28:15.360 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for power.

28:15.460 --> 28:20.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Marshall was nominated by
John Adams,
like, after the election had
already happened.

28:20.232 --> 28:22.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think it's totally
fair. And the
Republicans are going to
probably get away

28:22.935 --> 28:24.736 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with not doing anything.

28:24.836 --> 28:27.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, to me, what it will do --
and I don't
know the effect of this -- it
will polarize

28:27.306 --> 28:31.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the bases. It will create more
conflict. It
will elevate the social issues
on the Republican

28:32.044 --> 28:35.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
side. It will elevate campaign
finance on
the Democratic side. And so it
will probably

28:35.581 --> 28:37.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have a polarizing effect on the
election.

28:38.083 --> 28:42.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the candidacies are strong,
it would probably
help a Cruz and a Sanders
because of the issues

28:42.754 --> 28:43.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that would get elevated.

28:43.655 --> 28:45.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Less than 30
seconds.

28:45.524 --> 28:49.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Oh, I think
Senator McConnell
could only have been trying to
appeal to the

28:49.928 --> 28:55.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
restive, restless, angry
Republican primary
voters who are so disappointed
in the Republicans

28:55.100 --> 28:59.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Congress, that they said they
haven't overturned,
they have been rolled by Obama.
He was going

28:59.338 --> 29:01.139 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to step out.

29:01.239 --> 29:05.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before the body was cold, before
condolences
were offered to the family, he
announced that

29:05.243 --> 29:09.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there would be -- regardless,
made no difference
whom the president nominated. It
was -- and

29:09.247 --> 29:15.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he got a number of Republicans
in tough races
to follow him, I mean, Senator
Ayotte in New

29:15.554 --> 29:19.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hampshire, Senator Portman in
Ohio, Senator
Johnson in Wisconsin.

29:19.992 --> 29:26.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're all -- they made a big
mistake. That
is not the American tradition.
And I think

29:26.732 --> 29:27.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it was a misstep politically.

29:27.699 --> 29:29.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you get the
last word.

29:29.901 --> 29:39.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mark Shields, David Brooks, we
thank you both.

29:39.311 --> 29:48.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

But, first, new figures from the
United Nations
show that an average of two
children have

30:02.534 --> 30:08.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drowned every day since last
September, as
their families attempted the
perilous crossing

30:08.306 --> 30:10.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from Turkey to Greece.

30:10.208 --> 30:15.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week alone, off the Greek
island of Lesbos,
more than 900 people have been
rescued at

30:15.714 --> 30:17.582 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sea.

30:17.683 --> 30:21.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant accompanied
European Union border police
this week as

30:21.953 --> 30:27.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they patrolled the Aegean Sea,
and he was
there when dozens of those
people were saved.

30:27.325 --> 30:32.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Dawn at Molyvos
in northern
Lesbos, where traditional
rhythms of island

30:32.898 --> 30:35.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
life coexist with the new.

Portuguese maritime police
attached to Frontex,
the E.U.'s border agency,
they're heading

30:40.338 --> 30:45.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out on patrol. So far this year,
despite winter
weather, more than 50,000
migrants have made

30:45.844 --> 30:52.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the five-mile crossing from
Turkey to Lesbos,
driven by the war intensifying
in Syria.

30:52.150 --> 30:53.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Frontex spokesman Chris
Borowski:

30:54.052 --> 30:58.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BOROWSKI, Frontex: Frontex
is supporting
the Greeks in both patrolling
their waters

30:58.423 --> 31:03.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then, in the end, once the
migrants arrive,
we're registering them to make
sure that we

31:03.228 --> 31:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have counted all of them and
that we have
-- we know who's coming across
the border.

31:07.566 --> 31:12.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're registered, counted,
their nationalities
are determined, and the point is
to kind of

31:12.704 --> 31:14.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
know who's coming into Europe.

31:14.473 --> 31:16.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But how is that
protecting
Europe's borders?

31:17.042 --> 31:23.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BOROWSKI: The bottom line
is that it's
up to the Greeks to protect the
borders here.

31:23.281 --> 31:25.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're here to support them in
any way we possibly
can.

31:25.550 --> 31:29.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: For more than a
week, the
Portuguese have not seen any
migrants. The

31:30.088 --> 31:36.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
police don bulletproof life
jackets, in case
they encounter violent
smugglers, or worse.

31:36.895 --> 31:42.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a boat in distress. The
skipper cranks
up the engines to 45 knots.

31:42.901 --> 31:51.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The calm weather is perfect for
crossing from
Turkey. Other European civilian
volunteers

31:51.977 --> 32:03.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have already arrived to ensure
there's no
loss of life. This is a familiar
scenario.

32:03.455 --> 32:08.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The cheap outboards either die
mid-channel,
or the migrants cut the engines
and call for

32:08.226 --> 32:15.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
help by mobile phone.

32:16.001 --> 32:37.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a problem with the
engine, they shout.
The dinghy is carrying 58
people, including

32:37.155 --> 32:44.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
18 mainly small children. The
Portuguese prime
concern is that, in their haste
to get off,

32:45.030 --> 32:49.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the refugees will destabilize
the vessel and
it will capsize.

32:49.734 --> 32:57.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Hold the line. You hold the
line here.

32:57.742 --> 33:02.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Scores of
people have drowned
in these waters so far this
year. As many

33:02.914 --> 33:05.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as 4,000 died in 2015.

33:05.750 --> 33:09.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where are both of you from?

33:09.221 --> 33:10.889 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: From Syria.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Yes.

33:12.724 --> 33:19.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you think of this? What
do you think
of the way that you're being
met?

33:19.798 --> 33:23.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: It's good, good. Thank you.

33:23.468 --> 33:27.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The gentle sea
state helps
the Portuguese agents.

33:27.706 --> 33:35.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Today, it's them. Tomorrow,
maybe Portuguese
can need people, too. So, we
have to take

33:35.247 --> 33:36.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
care of each other.

33:37.015 --> 33:43.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: A normal day. The boat have
a problem
with the engine. It cannot move.
The people

33:44.022 --> 33:49.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
inside, we have too many
children, two sick
guys, in this case, we have to
put on board

33:49.961 --> 33:52.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and take them ashore to have a
medical test.

33:53.031 --> 34:07.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: You wait. You wait for us
to call you,
OK? Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
Wait.

34:07.679 --> 34:13.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Like many of
those on board,
Abdullah Harmoush is from
Latakia on Syria's

34:13.551 --> 34:15.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
coast, the home town of
President Bashar al-Assad.

34:15.887 --> 34:21.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABDULLAH HARMOUSH, Refugee:
There are many
troubles in my city because of
the violence,

34:21.626 --> 34:25.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and it's that we couldn't stay
there in Syria.

34:25.230 --> 34:39.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, we left Syria to take
refugee. It was
a very good response from the
police. We was

34:39.911 --> 34:48.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very afraid in the sea, but when
we entered
the water of Greece, we have the
support very

34:48.420 --> 34:55.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quickly. We are expecting very,
very fast
response from the police in the
sea from Greece.

34:55.293 --> 35:03.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's really an amazing feel that
we -- at
the time we entered the water of
Greece, we

35:03.168 --> 35:08.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are rescued, and we are very,
very, very happy
about it, here in this boat.

35:08.974 --> 35:14.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Acting as
purely a rescue
service, which is what you're
doing, aren't

35:14.212 --> 35:17.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you actually encouraging more
people to come
because they know they're going
to be safe?

35:18.016 --> 35:24.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHRIS BOROWSKI: We do not
encourage people
to come here. We're here to help
patrol the

35:24.122 --> 35:30.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
waters. And once the migrants
cross in, we
are -- if it's a
search-and-rescue operation,

35:30.862 --> 35:36.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have to help them get to the
-- get on
the boats, and then we have to
allow them

35:36.868 --> 35:40.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to come to Greece to then
register them and
allow them to seek asylum.

35:40.605 --> 35:43.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But some of the
people on
this boat were saying, we knew
we were going

35:44.075 --> 35:48.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be rescued, so we just set
off. So isn't
that just encouraging people?

35:48.146 --> 35:52.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BOROWSKI: What we are
doing is, we are
supporting the Greeks in
patrolling their

35:52.317 --> 35:59.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
borders and we are doing all we
can to both
make sure that we both register
everybody

36:00.025 --> 36:05.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who comes here and rescuing
those who needs
-- who needs rescues.

36:05.230 --> 36:10.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: In the past 10
days, NATO
has deployed to reinforce
Europe's borders.

36:10.568 --> 36:15.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are five ships out in the
international
waters of the Aegean Sea, which
divided Greece

36:15.240 --> 36:17.042 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from Turkey.

36:17.142 --> 36:20.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, NATO insists that it's not
going to be
intercepting refugee boats and
turning them

36:20.912 --> 36:26.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
back. They will adhere to
international treaties,
which require them to go to the
help of people

36:26.284 --> 36:32.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in distress upon the sea. That
means that
people picked up by NATO vessels
will be returned

36:32.791 --> 36:34.859 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Turkey.

36:34.959 --> 36:40.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Will this strategy work?
Professor Christodoulos
Yiallouridis, dean of Athens'
Panteion University,

36:41.066 --> 36:42.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
believes it could make a
difference.

36:42.967 --> 36:46.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTODOULOS YIALLOURIDIS,
Panteion University
(through translator): NATO can't
stop them

36:46.271 --> 36:51.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coming. She can, however, assist
in restricting
the flow of migrants simply
because of her

36:51.709 --> 36:57.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presence. It will be known that
NATO is waiting
for them, and this should act as
a deterrent.

36:57.816 --> 37:05.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: NATO didn't
deter these 90
Afghans picked up by the Greek
coast guard.

37:05.156 --> 37:07.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do you feel about being in
Europe?

37:07.992 --> 37:10.295 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: We are feeling good. Good.

37:10.395 --> 37:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Among them,
Edriss Bayat,
who used to work as an
administrator for NATO

37:14.866 --> 37:16.701 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Afghanistan.

37:16.801 --> 37:19.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDRISS BAYAT, Refugee: What do
you think about
the way Europe is reacting to
the refugee

37:19.104 --> 37:20.972 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
crisis?

37:21.072 --> 37:26.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, I think they are doing a
good job. At
least, they are -- they know
that who is entitled

37:26.945 --> 37:33.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to seek the assistance. And, for
example,
we come from Afghanistan, Iraq,
Syria, and

37:33.418 --> 37:37.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are the people who very --
really need
to leave their country and --
because save

37:38.022 --> 37:39.757 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their life.

37:39.858 --> 37:42.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But why
couldn't you stay
in another country like Turkey,
for example?

37:42.360 --> 37:44.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why did you have to come to
Europe?

37:44.596 --> 37:49.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDRISS BAYAT: Well, there is a
lot of issues
in Turkey, for example,
job-wise. They are

37:49.667 --> 37:58.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not giving you the immigrants.
You cannot
get like a permanent visa or a
Turkish passport

37:58.710 --> 38:00.278 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or anything.

38:00.378 --> 38:06.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Where do you
want to go in
Europe? What do you want to do?

38:06.985 --> 38:10.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ABDULLAH HARMOUSH: For me, I
want to continue
my study and have a good future.

38:10.255 --> 38:14.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Do you want to
stay in Europe,
or do you want to go back to
Syria? What do

38:14.225 --> 38:15.927 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you want to do?

38:16.027 --> 38:19.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABDULLAH HARMOUSH: Of course,
when the war
is over, I will come back to my
country.

38:19.130 --> 38:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: And what do you
want to do
for your country when you...

38:22.300 --> 38:24.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ABDULLAH HARMOUSH: OK. Rebuild
it.

38:24.169 --> 38:28.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDRISS BAYAT: I really wish to
have a safe
country. If our country gets
safe, we will

38:28.106 --> 38:29.941 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
go back.

38:30.041 --> 38:34.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: European Union
nations are
doing all they can to stem the
migrant tide,

38:34.712 --> 38:39.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but, as Middle Eastern violence
threatens
to draw in Turkey, the flow
shows no sign

38:40.051 --> 38:41.252 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of abating.

38:41.352 --> 38:46.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Lesbos.

38:46.591 --> 38:59.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Iranians will go
to the polls
next week to elect a new
parliament and to

38:59.604 --> 39:03.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
choose the small group that will
pick the
next supreme leader.

39:03.374 --> 39:08.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of our colleagues from NPR
is just back
from a reporting trip to Iran,
and William

39:08.680 --> 39:10.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Brangham has that conversation.

39:10.548 --> 39:14.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The signing of
the landmark
nuclear deal with Iran was
supposed to begin

39:14.519 --> 39:19.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a new era of relations between
Iran and the
West. The deal would free Iran
from decades

39:19.224 --> 39:23.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of crippling economic sanctions,
while giving
the West some confidence that
Iran won't be

39:23.595 --> 39:25.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
able to develop a nuclear
weapon.

39:25.830 --> 39:29.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many in the United States,
however, remain
wary of Iran's intentions,
including virtually

39:29.901 --> 39:34.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all the Republican candidates
running for
president. They all vow to
renegotiate the

39:34.272 --> 39:35.073 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agreement.

39:35.173 --> 39:37.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But what is happening inside
Iran?

39:37.342 --> 39:40.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
National Public Radio's Steve
Inskeep is just
back from a reporting trip, and
he joins me

39:40.745 --> 39:41.679 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

39:41.779 --> 39:43.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Steve, welcome back. And welcome
to the show.

39:43.147 --> 39:44.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP, National Public
Radio: Thanks.
Glad to be here.

39:45.016 --> 39:48.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The nuclear
deal has been
signed. Iran is freed somewhat
from these

39:48.319 --> 39:49.587 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sanctions.

39:49.687 --> 39:52.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is it like there? Are
things getting
better for Iranians?

39:52.490 --> 39:55.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
STEVE INSKEEP: No, not in
day-to-day life,
not yet.

39:55.526 --> 39:59.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, in talking with people
on the street,
which I find to be one of the
most productive

39:59.464 --> 40:03.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things to do when traveling to
Iran, I find
a lot of pessimism. People have
gone through

40:03.968 --> 40:08.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years of economic suffering.
Many people have
disagreed with the political
direction of

40:08.439 --> 40:10.208 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their government.

40:10.308 --> 40:14.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even though things are
moving, in their
point of view, in a more
optimistic direction,

40:14.145 --> 40:20.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's very slow. And of course
it's too early
to see any concrete economic
results from

40:20.518 --> 40:22.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the end of sanctions that just
happened a
few weeks ago.

40:22.920 --> 40:27.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a time when people
were saying just
the anticipation of the end of
sanctions was

40:27.659 --> 40:31.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
improving Iran's economy, but
that seems not
to have trickled down to
ordinary people.

40:32.063 --> 40:37.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But I don't
understand.
Rouhani was elected in no small
part to eliminate

40:37.568 --> 40:41.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sanctions, to improve relations
with the West,
to try to make the economy
better. Is this

40:42.006 --> 40:44.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the sense that it's not
happening fast enough
or not enough?

40:44.709 --> 40:46.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: That is exactly
right.

40:46.711 --> 40:51.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is this residue of support
for Hassan
Rouhani. I even found people in
centers of

40:51.582 --> 40:55.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
support for the prior president,
who was very
different, who said, yes, I
support Rouhani.

40:55.119 --> 40:56.988 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm with Rouhani.

40:57.088 --> 41:02.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think more liberal people
or Western-facing
people who want much greater
openness, who

41:02.994 --> 41:05.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want much greater change have
been disappointed
not to see more.

41:05.763 --> 41:09.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And I know, in
one of your
reports this week, you reported
on how there

41:09.801 --> 41:13.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are certainly still some people
in Iran who
don't want any of those changes
to occur.

41:14.072 --> 41:15.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is it that they're afraid
of?

41:16.074 --> 41:20.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is it that they're worried
-- if business
starts to flourish, if the
economy gets better?

41:21.045 --> 41:22.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Help me understand what the
concern is.

41:22.980 --> 41:24.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Well, on a basic
level, they're
afraid of us. They're afraid of
the United

41:25.016 --> 41:26.784 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

41:26.884 --> 41:29.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was a government that was
founded on
a few basic principles, and one
of them was

41:29.587 --> 41:34.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opposition to the United States.
And the United
States was blamed for many of
Iran's previous

41:34.459 --> 41:40.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problems before 1979. There's
been a longstanding
rivalry. They're aware of
profound distrust

41:40.498 --> 41:42.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the United States of Iran.

41:43.067 --> 41:47.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so you have two governments
that are very
much at odds on everything other
than the

41:47.372 --> 41:52.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nuclear deal. And so, on one
level, it's as
simple as that. On another
level, you have

41:52.377 --> 41:59.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a government, a clerical-led
government, that
has elections, that has a
semblance of democracy,

41:59.550 --> 42:03.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
but that knows it is not
fundamentally supported
by a lot of people.

42:03.955 --> 42:07.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Some people might say the
majority of Iranians
oppose the government. I can't
go that far.

42:07.592 --> 42:11.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know what the numbers
are. But it's
clear there is a lot of
cynicism, a lot of

42:11.629 --> 42:15.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
disappointment with this
government, and a
lot of impatience with this
government.

42:15.933 --> 42:20.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you're in charge, you
know that. And
so you wonder what's going to
happen next.

42:20.671 --> 42:23.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You don't want things to go the
wrong way
and for your government to fall.

42:23.574 --> 42:26.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: One of the
things that,
in the West, we like to tell
ourselves is

42:26.644 --> 42:31.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that it was the economic
sanctions that crippled
their economy and brought Iran
to the negotiating

42:31.349 --> 42:33.184 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
table.

42:33.284 --> 42:36.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of your reports really
detailed this
-- the cynicism almost that
people think that

42:36.587 --> 42:41.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some of the problems within Iran
might have
been because of corruption and
mismanagement

42:41.292 --> 42:42.460 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
within their own government.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Oh, yes. No, this
was really
interesting.

42:44.462 --> 42:48.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a talking point for
Iranians during
sanctions: Your sanctions aren't
really hurting

42:48.699 --> 42:51.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
us too much. It's other things
that are going
on here.

42:51.436 --> 42:56.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's also something that a
lot of Iranians
firmly, genuinely believe, that
there were

42:56.541 --> 43:00.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ways that they found to get
around economic
sanctions. And, by the way,
during all my

43:00.411 --> 43:04.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
visits over the last several
years, I have
stories about people finding
ways to sell

43:04.182 --> 43:08.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
carpets to Germany, people
finding ways to
sell petrochemicals to China, in
spite of

43:08.853 --> 43:09.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
various sanctions.

43:09.854 --> 43:11.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, certain things did happen.

43:11.255 --> 43:13.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Big ingenious
population
in Iran.

43:13.157 --> 43:17.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Yes, exactly. And
you can get
around economic sanctions, to an
extent, although

43:17.595 --> 43:19.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they were more and more
punishing over time.

43:19.730 --> 43:24.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what has been harder to get
around is
that sense of mismanagement of
the economy,

43:24.836 --> 43:32.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hyperinflation in the economy,
36,000 Iranian
rials for $1, 36,000. And it was
much, much

43:32.577 --> 43:33.711 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
less just a few years ago.

43:33.811 --> 43:35.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's
incredible.

43:35.713 --> 43:38.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: And so you have
serious problems
in the economy, and you have a
clear sense

43:38.850 --> 43:42.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of corruption, that some of
these government
entities that are deeply
involved in the economy

43:43.020 --> 43:44.722 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
also take a cut.

43:44.822 --> 43:48.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We know
there's elections
coming up at the end of next
week. And in

43:48.226 --> 43:52.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
typical Iranian fashion, a whole
slew of people
who wanted to run were told, you
can't run,

43:52.964 --> 43:54.432 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
reasons unstated.

43:54.532 --> 43:57.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what are you looking for in
particular
in that election next week?

43:57.502 --> 43:59.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STEVE INSKEEP: Yes.

43:59.337 --> 44:01.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you say typical Iranian
fashion, it's
the system. It's officially the
system.

44:01.105 --> 44:02.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Right.

44:02.974 --> 44:04.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: There's a group
called the
Guardian Council that is there
to disqualify

44:05.009 --> 44:09.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidates who are considered
not Islamic
enough or not enough with the
Islamic Revolution

44:09.313 --> 44:11.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and whatever else.

44:11.482 --> 44:16.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you're correct that they're
not very transparent
about their reasons for people
being disqualified.

44:16.621 --> 44:21.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't even know -- or I don't
at this moment
-- maybe somebody does --
exactly who is in

44:21.592 --> 44:23.494 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or out.

44:23.594 --> 44:27.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that many people were
disqualified.
There are elections for the
Assembly of Experts

44:27.798 --> 44:34.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this time. The Assembly of
Experts is charged
with overseeing the supreme
leader, to the

44:34.505 --> 44:39.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
extent that anybody does. That's
the body
that elects the supreme leader.
That's the

44:39.477 --> 44:44.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
body that, at least in theory,
could remove
or impeach, as Americans would
say, the supreme

44:44.515 --> 44:48.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
leader, if there was some
incapacity or he
couldn't do his job.

44:48.386 --> 44:53.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's considered vitally
important who gets
on that panel, who chooses the
next supreme

44:53.891 --> 44:59.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leader. Let's remember that this
is a system
was designed, rather like the
American system,

44:59.830 --> 45:04.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with lots of checks and
balances. Any new
leader of that country would
still inherit

45:04.835 --> 45:07.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that system with all of its
checks and balances.

45:07.238 --> 45:10.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would be very hard to move
Iran in any
direction but the direction it's
in now.

45:10.908 --> 45:13.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Steve Inskeep
from National Public Radio,
thank you for

45:13.844 --> 45:16.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
your reporting. Thanks being
here.

45:16.647 --> 45:25.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Glad to come.

45:26.090 --> 45:34.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight:
the loss of
a literary legend reclusive in
life, but renowned

45:34.498 --> 45:37.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for crafting one of the great
American novels.

45:37.201 --> 45:38.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And to Jeffrey Brown.

45:39.070 --> 45:42.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Harper Lee was a
little known
writer living in New York when
"To Kill a

45:42.673 --> 45:48.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mockingbird" was published in
1960. The book
would win the Pulitzer Prize a
year later,

45:48.613 --> 45:55.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sell more than 30 million copies
in 40 languages,
and be read and loved by
generations.

45:55.353 --> 46:03.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Its fame grew with the 1962 film
version starring
Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch,
father of the

46:03.260 --> 46:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
young narrator, Scout, and a
lawyer in a segregated
Alabama town who defends a black
man against

46:09.600 --> 46:11.202 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a rape charge.

46:11.302 --> 46:16.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a 1964 radio interview, Lee
said this about
"Mockingbird"'s enormous
success:

46:16.307 --> 46:18.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARPER LEE, Author, "To Kill a
Mockingbird":
My reaction to it wasn't one of
surprise.

46:18.109 --> 46:24.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was one of sheer numbness. It
was like
being hit over the head and
knocked cold.

46:24.281 --> 46:25.783 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:25.883 --> 46:30.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARPER LEE: I never expected
that the book
would sell in the first place.

46:30.755 --> 46:35.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: But in the
decades that followed,
Lee did little or no talking. It
was news

46:35.826 --> 46:41.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when she went to the White House
in 2007 to
accept a Presidential Medal of
Freedom.

46:41.565 --> 46:47.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, she lived quietly most
of her life
in the town of Monroeville,
Alabama. And while

46:47.905 --> 46:54.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
readers waited, no other books
came, until
the surprise this past summer of
"Go Set a

46:54.311 --> 46:59.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Watchman," a book described as
written before
"Mockingbird," but only
discovered and published

46:59.583 --> 47:02.019 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
55 years later.

47:02.119 --> 47:07.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It drew more readers, mixed
reviews, and many
questions about the
circumstances of its writing

47:07.558 --> 47:09.694 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and publication.

47:09.794 --> 47:15.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Harper Lee died in her sleep
last night. She
was 89 years old.

47:15.366 --> 47:20.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And joining us now is novelist
and short story
writer Allan Gurganus. His books
include "Oldest

47:20.371 --> 47:24.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Living Confederate Widow Tells
All," "Plays
Well With Others," and most
recently "Local

47:24.709 --> 47:25.276 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Souls."

47:25.376 --> 47:26.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Allan, welcome to you.

47:27.011 --> 47:31.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What explains the popularity in
the end of
"To Kill a Mockingbird"?

47:31.415 --> 47:37.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLAN GURGANUS, Author, "Local
Souls": I think
it's a fable about the
extraordinarily difficult

47:37.922 --> 47:43.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
subject of race that presents
itself with
charm and a kind of innocence
that makes the

47:43.794 --> 47:47.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
investigation acceptable and
beguiling.

47:47.465 --> 47:53.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the name Scout of the
child is appropriate.
She's our representative in this
strange moral

47:54.038 --> 47:59.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
morass that she finds herself
in. And I think
she's spoken to a lot of people
over the years.

47:59.677 --> 48:05.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And set in its
particular time,
when you think of both the
historical qualities

48:05.449 --> 48:09.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and for you, as a writer, its
writing qualities.

48:09.887 --> 48:17.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLAN GURGANUS: It's a book with
a lot of
precision, a lot of poetic
passages about

48:17.261 --> 48:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
small-town life that rings
completely true,
as somebody who grew up in a
small town.

48:22.533 --> 48:28.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think, ethically, the
questions are
strenuous and difficult and
interesting. And

48:28.172 --> 48:35.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that combination of giving us
candy and salt
at the same time has made the
book so popular.

48:35.312 --> 48:38.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's also short, which is great
for junior
high school readers.

48:38.682 --> 48:40.284 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:40.384 --> 48:45.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALLAN GURGANUS: But it manages
to pull heartstrings
and ask big, big questions.

48:45.489 --> 48:50.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Not to be
underemphasized,
the length of a book sometimes,
right?

48:50.361 --> 48:51.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What about Harper Lee the
author?

48:51.829 --> 48:53.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ALLAN GURGANUS: No, and
especially for young
people.

48:53.931 --> 48:59.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What about Harper
Lee the author
and the sort of -- the mythology
of the -- that

48:59.270 --> 49:04.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
came to surround her as writing
this one book,
all but disappearing, people
waiting endlessly

49:05.042 --> 49:06.944 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for another book?

49:07.044 --> 49:14.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLAN GURGANUS: I think she was
a very shy,
charming person used to living
in a very small

49:14.285 --> 49:19.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
town, where everybody knew her,
and the attention
that she got when this novel
came out and

49:19.657 --> 49:24.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
became a bestseller for 88 weeks
was overwhelming.

49:25.029 --> 49:30.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was also protecting her
private life,
her sexual life, which is a
decision that

49:30.668 --> 49:37.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I respect. And she just made a
decision not
to go public. I think the
pressure of following

49:37.675 --> 49:43.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a book that wins the Pulitzer
Prize can't
be overestimated.

49:43.147 --> 49:49.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she was -- I think had set
out to write
a book that mythologized her
father, her actual

49:50.054 --> 49:55.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lawyer father, in a way that met
her own standards.
He still spoke to her after she
had written

49:55.960 --> 50:01.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the book. And she was pleased
with what she
had done. And I think her
mission was in some

50:01.198 --> 50:03.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ways complete.

50:03.167 --> 50:06.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And then, of
course, there's
the "Go Set a Watchman," a very
strange episode,

50:07.037 --> 50:11.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many questions that came about,
whether it
was an early draft of
"Mockingbird," whether

50:11.976 --> 50:14.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she had agreed or should have
agreed to its
publication.

50:14.578 --> 50:18.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What, in the end, do you think
that we should
take from that?

50:19.083 --> 50:25.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLAN GURGANUS: I think every
writer has two
or three novels hidden away in
drawers and

50:25.589 --> 50:29.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
closets that would ruin their
literary reputation.

50:29.460 --> 50:36.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for somebody to come in late
in your game
and public those with only half
of your permission

50:37.001 --> 50:44.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
may be a smart move in terms of
moneymaking,
but it was a devastating blow to
her reputation.

50:44.174 --> 50:48.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of boys had been named
Atticus, and
people actually went to court to
have their

50:48.178 --> 50:54.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sons named changed when the
Atticus in the
second book turned out to be a
conventional

50:54.151 --> 51:00.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
racist like the other people on
the town council.
So I think it was a mistake for
her reputation.

51:00.190 --> 51:04.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the singular book that she
will be remembered
for is the "Mockingbird."

51:04.361 --> 51:06.196 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

51:06.297 --> 51:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. I was going
to say, so,
briefly, the legacy really, you
just think,

51:09.133 --> 51:13.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should be defined by one this
book, but what
a book it was.

51:13.537 --> 51:16.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALLAN GURGANUS: What a book it
was.

51:16.507 --> 51:24.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to think that it came out in
1960, just
before the huge riots and the
German shepherds

51:24.782 --> 51:30.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the fire hoses in the South,
I think it
taught white America how to
think about race.

51:30.220 --> 51:35.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we needed an innocent child
to lead us
into that difficult and complex
subject.

51:35.259 --> 51:43.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it made the prophecy of what
was coming
palatable and easy to understand
and digest.

51:43.968 --> 51:49.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it served an extraordinary
function, and
it's to be remembered and
treasured, I think.

51:49.206 --> 51:56.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Allan Gurganus on
the life
and work of Harper Lee, thank
you so much.

51:56.280 --> 52:07.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online: when
