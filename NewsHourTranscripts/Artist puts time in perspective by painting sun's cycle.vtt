JUDY WOODRUFF: A new exhibit,
Sunrise, Sunset, by Swiss artist
Nicolas Party, recently opened

00:06.433 --> 00:09.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at the Hirshhorn Museum
in Washington, D.C.

00:09.233 --> 00:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Party, known for his large works
of public art, painted directly
on 400 feet of the museum's

00:15.733 --> 00:17.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
circular walls.

00:17.466 --> 00:19.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We tracked his progress
over two weeks.

00:19.866 --> 00:24.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Party told the "NewsHour" he
was inspired by the notion
that, no matter what happens,

00:24.533 --> 00:27.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the sun will rise
in the morning.

00:27.100 --> 00:32.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICOLAS PARTY, Artist: I was
aware of the circle shape of the
building, and that influenced

00:32.700 --> 00:34.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my decision.

00:34.800 --> 00:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I decided to do a show about
sunsets and sunrises, which is
this kind of end and beginning

00:40.300 --> 00:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that happens every day, but
also implied this idea of this
very, very long timeline that

00:45.966 --> 00:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just shows the rotation of
every element in the universe.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And let's give a perspective
of maybe, like, seeing history
and things in a much bigger

00:55.433 --> 00:57.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way, and maybe not being
always focused on the daily.

00:57.733 --> 01:01.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The circle aspect really
defines the project.

01:01.633 --> 01:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, after, I'm trying
to kind of build up a
rhythm into this space.

01:05.933 --> 01:09.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every wall is a different
color, but also every shape of
the paintings that I'm doing

01:09.966 --> 01:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the wall also has a different
format to give like a rhythm
and an energy to the wall.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I like to improvise.

01:17.266 --> 01:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So there's an element of freedom
when I work on the walls.

01:20.266 --> 01:23.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So I use the wall almost
as a piece of paper.

01:23.066 --> 01:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sometimes, of course, I have
sketches, but, yes, I work
very organically, so there's an

01:28.066 --> 01:29.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
element of surprise.

01:29.066 --> 01:30.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's really exciting.

01:30.766 --> 01:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, yes, it's really
exciting to have all this space.

01:33.666 --> 01:37.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In a matter of seven
days, I will do like
30 different paintings.

01:37.233 --> 01:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A lot of art that I love, they
feel really alive and energetic.

01:40.300 --> 01:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so you need to be in that
stage when you're doing them.

01:43.833 --> 01:45.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A lot of landscape painting.

01:45.266 --> 01:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have been obviously
painting sunsets and sunrises.

01:47.866 --> 01:52.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the only moment
during the day that you
can really see, visually,
how the entire universe

01:54.033 --> 01:55.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
functions.

01:55.466 --> 01:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can really see the rotation
of Earth at that moment.

01:57.300 --> 01:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Right now, we can't see it.

01:59.433 --> 02:02.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But during those 30 minutes
of a sunset or a sunrise, you
can actually feel it, and you

02:02.866 --> 02:04.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can see it very clearly.

02:04.900 --> 02:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all those kind of different
reasons that the color change
the sky, that's the physical

02:11.800 --> 02:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reaction of the light
going through different
kind of angles and stuff.

02:14.033 --> 02:16.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I thought
that's fascinating.

02:16.500 --> 02:21.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, the daily life
and our little preoccupations
that are very important,
but so it's interesting

02:22.633 --> 02:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to put them in perspective
with this big thing.

02:24.800 --> 02:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's very different stages
when I do those murals.

02:28.133 --> 02:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's like the beginning
that is very slow and
allow myself a lot of time.

02:31.633 --> 02:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then there's a moment when it's
-- everything is beginning to
build up, and I realize, oh,

02:34.866 --> 02:38.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I made mistakes in the
placements or the size,
colors or whatever.

02:38.633 --> 02:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's getting very stressful.

02:41.033 --> 02:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so then there's a
moment it's very difficult,
usually, because it's
not going how I want

02:45.266 --> 02:47.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to go.

02:47.900 --> 02:51.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, just like coming to
a space, doing something
and this thing will
disappear or more or less

02:53.400 --> 02:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being covered up, so it will
still be here, but it will be
covered by a layer of paint.

02:57.966 --> 03:00.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's like ruins
that are underneath.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like the cave painting, you
don't see, but I'm sure there's
a lot of them that we don't

03:01.866 --> 03:05.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see or we don't know about,
but still they exist.

03:05.266 --> 03:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's very different steps
between the moment you start, to
run to the moment it's extremely

03:10.133 --> 03:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
difficult, to the end, when
you feel totally fine just
running through the line.

03:13.500 --> 03:18.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's all those moments
that are very exciting,
yes, to look forward to do.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You don't need to
change the world.

03:21.833 --> 03:24.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You can just change your
few meters around you.

03:24.533 --> 03:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so I did change the circle.

03:27.433 --> 03:27.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what I did.
