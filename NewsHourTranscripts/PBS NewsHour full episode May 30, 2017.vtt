JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.772 --> 00:07.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.607 --> 00:11.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: As
President Trump
tries to settle back in after
his trip to

00:11.077 --> 00:16.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Middle East and Europe, the
White House
faces new and persistent
questions over the

00:16.249 --> 00:17.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Russia investigations.

00:17.917 --> 00:23.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, I sit down with the former
Director
of National Intelligence James
Clapper to

00:23.556 --> 00:29.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talk North Korea, the terrorist
threat, and
those recent revelations linking
Jared Kushner

00:29.362 --> 00:31.197 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Russia.

00:31.231 --> 00:34.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES CLAPPER, Former U.S.
National Intelligence
Director: If it's true that the
objective

00:34.167 --> 00:45.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here was to use Russian secure
communications
as the mode of this dialogue or
this communication,

00:45.145 --> 00:48.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that is, I will say, curious.

00:48.148 --> 00:54.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And bringing
poetry to Chicago's
schools, how the nation's first
Mexican-American

00:54.587 --> 00:58.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
poet laureate is urging students
to find their
voice through verse.

00:58.391 --> 01:03.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN FELIPE HERRERA, U.S. Poet
Laureate: The
poetry is there, but it's there
rumbling in

01:03.430 --> 01:09.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the heart and in the blood and
what they see,
you know, what they see day to
day.

01:09.536 --> 01:11.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we want to bring all that
out.

01:11.838 --> 01:14.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:14.974 --> 01:19.212 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:19.245 --> 01:31.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: From the outside,
it appears
the Trump White House has spent
this day fending

01:31.524 --> 01:38.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off questions about ties to
Russia, relations
with Germany, and staff
shakeups, all of this

01:38.364 --> 01:41.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the president tries to move
ahead amid
the turmoil.

01:42.001 --> 01:43.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang has our report.

01:43.770 --> 01:48.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It was the first
on-camera White
House briefing in more than two
weeks, but

01:48.675 --> 01:51.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
topic A was still the Russian
connection.

01:51.544 --> 01:56.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Press Secretary Sean Spicer
brushed aside
reports that presidential
son-in-law Jared

01:56.416 --> 02:02.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Kushner met the Russian
ambassador in December,
seeking to set up a direct line
to Russian

02:02.322 --> 02:06.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Vladimir Putin outside
normal diplomatic
channels.

02:06.426 --> 02:08.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
I think that assumes a lot, and
I would just

02:08.561 --> 02:12.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say that Mr. Kushner's attorney
has said that
Mr. Kushner has volunteered to
share with

02:12.398 --> 02:16.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congress what he knows about
these meetings
and he will do the same if he's
contacted

02:16.136 --> 02:18.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or connected with any other
inquiry.

02:18.138 --> 02:22.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The New York Times
reported investigators
are also looking into a meeting
Kushner held

02:22.709 --> 02:27.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the head of a state-owned
Russian bank
that is under U.S. sanctions.

02:27.213 --> 02:32.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And CNN reported that, during
the presidential
campaign, U.S. intelligence
intercepted Russian

02:32.519 --> 02:38.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officials, saying they had
potentially derogatory
financial information about Mr.
Trump and

02:38.791 --> 02:40.627 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
some top aides.

02:40.660 --> 02:45.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This morning, the president
tweeted: "Russian
officials must be laughing at
the U.S. and

02:45.331 --> 02:51.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how a lame excuse for why the
Dems lost the
election has taken over the fake
news."

02:51.971 --> 02:57.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now back home, after his first
overseas trip,
Mr. Trump traded tough words
today with German

02:57.710 --> 02:59.445 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Chancellor Angela Merkel.

02:59.479 --> 03:04.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After the two met at European
summits, the
German leader said, "We in
Europe have to

03:04.817 --> 03:08.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
take our fate into our own
hands."

03:08.221 --> 03:12.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In turn, the president tweeted:
"We have a
massive trade deficit with
Germany.

03:12.792 --> 03:17.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plus, they pay far less than
they should on
NATO and military.

03:17.530 --> 03:18.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This will change."

03:19.032 --> 03:22.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Spicer insisted the
leaders' relationship
is unbelievable.

03:22.468 --> 03:24.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: They get along very
well.

03:24.571 --> 03:26.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He has a lot of respect for her.

03:26.272 --> 03:30.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They continued to grow the bond
they had during
their talks in the G7.

03:30.810 --> 03:34.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: All this comes amid
rumblings of
a staff shakeup.

03:34.847 --> 03:39.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House communications
director Michael
Dubke has quit after only three
months on

03:39.052 --> 03:44.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the job, and the White House may
set up a
rapid-response war room to deal
with the Russia

03:44.624 --> 03:46.192 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investigations.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

03:48.428 --> 03:52.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will take
a closer look
at how all this affects work at
the White

03:52.532 --> 03:54.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
House later in the program.

03:54.968 --> 03:59.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
U.S. military
announced that it knocked a mock
warhead out

03:59.239 --> 04:03.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the sky in the first such
test in three
years.

04:03.209 --> 04:07.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It targeted a long-range missile
like the
one that North Korea is
developing.

04:07.880 --> 04:12.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An interceptor launched from
Southern California
hit the warhead that was
launched from more

04:12.785 --> 04:16.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than 4,000 miles away over the
Pacific Ocean.

04:16.756 --> 04:22.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South Korea's president charged
today that
the U.S. delivered more
anti-missile launchers

04:22.161 --> 04:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to his country without his
approval, and he
demanded an investigation.

04:27.033 --> 04:33.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Moon Jae-in took office this
month after his
predecessor was ousted in a
corruption scandal.

04:33.039 --> 04:38.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Moon wants to review the
decision to deploy
the THAAD anti-missile system.

04:38.211 --> 04:41.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now a spokesman says he wasn't
told about
the new launchers arriving.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Â®MD-BO /YOON YOUNG-CHAN, South
Korean Presidential
Spokesman (through translator):
President

04:44.117 --> 04:47.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Moon was briefed on such facts,
and said it
was very shocking.

04:47.253 --> 04:50.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He ordered his senior secretary
for civil
affairs and the national
security council

04:51.024 --> 04:55.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chief to find the truth behind
the unauthorized
entry of the four rocket
launchers.

04:55.528 --> 05:01.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Both China and
North Korea
strongly oppose South Korea
installing the

05:01.167 --> 05:02.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
anti-missile system.

05:03.002 --> 05:09.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The death toll in Sri Lanka has
hit at least
194 in the wake of severe floods
and mudslides.

05:09.742 --> 05:11.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The disaster started last
Friday.

05:11.911 --> 05:17.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Today, Indian aid teams
off-loaded shiploads
of goods as rescue efforts
continued.

05:17.717 --> 05:21.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Water levels slowly receded as
the weather
cleared.

05:21.554 --> 05:26.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Almost 100 people are still
missing, and more
than 80,000 are still displaced
and remain

05:27.026 --> 05:28.795 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in relief camps.

05:28.828 --> 05:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

man accused of fatally stabbing
two other

05:33.299 --> 05:35.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
men appeared in court today.

05:36.002 --> 05:42.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Police say the victims
intervened as Jeremy
Christian was verbally abusing
two young Muslim

05:42.475 --> 05:44.277 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
women.

05:44.310 --> 05:47.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The 35-year-old suspect
repeatedly shouted
to the courtroom during his
briefing hearing.

05:47.947 --> 05:52.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEREMY CHRISTIAN, Defendant:
Death to the
enemies of America.

05:52.452 --> 05:56.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Leave this country if your hate
our freedoms.

05:56.422 --> 05:58.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You call it terrorism.

05:58.424 --> 05:59.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I call it patriotism.

05:59.425 --> 06:00.393 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You hear me?

06:00.426 --> 06:02.161 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Die.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The mayor of
Portland says
he hopes the killings will lead
to changes

06:04.263 --> 06:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the nation's political
dialogue.

06:06.999 --> 06:11.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The city of Cleveland has fired
the police
officer who fatally shot a
12-year-old black

06:11.804 --> 06:13.873 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
boy, Tamir Rice.

06:13.906 --> 06:17.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officer Timothy Loehmann shot
Rice at a recreation
center in 2014.

06:17.076 --> 06:24.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It happened moments after
Loehmann and another
officer answered a call about
someone pointing

06:24.150 --> 06:25.118 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a gun.

06:25.151 --> 06:27.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It turned out Rice had a pellet
gun.

06:27.920 --> 06:32.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cleveland's police chief says
that Loehmann
was fired for inaccurate details
on his job

06:32.358 --> 06:35.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
application, and not for the
Rice shooting
itself.

06:35.695 --> 06:40.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CALVIN WILLIAMS, Cleveland,
Ohio, Police Chief:
There's a 12-year-old kid dead,
so, I mean,

06:40.199 --> 06:44.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, people on both sides
are going to
say it wasn't enough, it was too
much.

06:44.537 --> 06:49.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After, you know, over two years
of investigation
by our agency, the county
prosecutor's office

06:50.009 --> 06:56.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the sheriff's department, I
think we have
come to a -- what we consider a
fair conclusion

06:56.682 --> 06:58.618 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to this process.

06:58.651 --> 07:03.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Loehmann's
partner on the force
was suspended for 10 days for a

Meanwhile, five people are dead
and 44 wounded
in Chicago after a wave of
shootings over

07:09.162 --> 07:10.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Memorial Day weekend.

07:10.963 --> 07:15.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The holiday has become one of
the deadliest
times of the year in the city.

07:15.034 --> 07:19.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This year's numbers are actually
lower than
last year, when seven people
were killed and

07:19.705 --> 07:21.774 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
61 wounded.

07:21.808 --> 07:27.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

that golfing
great Tiger Woods had not been
drinking when

07:27.046 --> 07:28.881 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they arrested him early Monday.

07:28.915 --> 07:33.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A police report confirms Woods'
statement
that alcohol wasn't involved.

07:33.853 --> 07:38.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It does say the golfer was --
quote -- "asleep
at the wheel" and that his
speech was -- quote

07:38.257 --> 07:40.960 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- "extremely slow and slurred."

07:40.993 --> 07:43.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Woods is still facing a charge
of driving
under the influence.

07:43.863 --> 07:47.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He blames a reaction to
medication.

07:47.066 --> 07:52.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Wall Street, a seven-day
rally ended as
interest rates fell and pulled
down bank stocks.

07:52.472 --> 07:57.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 50 points

Manuel Noriega
died in Panama City today.

08:07.854 --> 08:14.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He grabbed power in the early
1980s and initially
became a U.S. ally, but a U.S.
invasion ousted

08:14.560 --> 08:21.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him in 1989, and he served 17
years in a U.S.
federal prison for drug
trafficking and money

08:21.701 --> 08:22.935 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
laundering.

08:22.969 --> 08:26.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He later served time in France
and back in
Panama as well.

08:26.305 --> 08:29.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Manuel Noriega was 83 years old.

08:29.609 --> 08:34.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
one-on-one
with the former director of
national intelligence;

08:34.313 --> 08:39.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what effect are the Russia
investigations
and turmoil inside the White
House having

08:39.852 --> 08:49.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the president's agenda?;
bombings rock
Baghdad at the start of Ramadan;
and much

08:49.896 --> 08:57.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the president's agenda?;
bombings rock
Baghdad at the start of Ramadan;
and much

08:57.537 --> 08:59.238 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

08:59.272 --> 09:02.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now to my interview with the
former director
of national intelligence, James
Clapper.

09:02.408 --> 09:07.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He served in that post for
six-and-a-half
years under President Obama,
stepping down

09:07.046 --> 09:08.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just this past January.

09:08.848 --> 09:11.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We spoke earlier today.

09:11.350 --> 09:14.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former Director of National
Intelligence James
Clapper, thank you very much for
talking with

09:14.787 --> 09:16.622 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

09:16.656 --> 09:18.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES CLAPPER, Former U.S.
National Intelligence
Director: Well, thanks for
having me, Judy.

09:18.457 --> 09:21.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me start with
the news
that was out this morning from
CNN, essentially,

09:21.360 --> 09:30.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that U.S. intelligence officials
last year
picked up from Russian sources
that Russian

09:30.369 --> 09:37.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government officials said they
had derogatory
information about then-candidate
Donald Trump

09:37.577 --> 09:39.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and people close to him, some of
his top aides.

09:39.779 --> 09:41.614 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you know anything about this?

09:41.647 --> 09:49.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES CLAPPER: Well, I can't
comment on specific
reports, whether we have them or
not or the

09:49.255 --> 09:50.990 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
content of them.

09:51.023 --> 09:58.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will say, though, that, in
general, that
there was concern that all of us
had about

09:58.497 --> 10:03.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these interactions, whether we
had direct
reflections or indirect
reflections of them,

10:03.536 --> 10:08.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
based on discussions among the
Russians themselves.

10:08.574 --> 10:14.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We didn't know the intent and we
didn't know
the content, but, in the context
of what else

10:14.246 --> 10:20.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Russians were doing to
interfere with
our election and the long
history of what

10:20.620 --> 10:27.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Russians do -- have done and
continue
to do to undermine us, undermine
our processes

10:27.693 --> 10:32.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and undermine our system, there
was great
concern about what was going on.

10:32.098 --> 10:36.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask you
about another
story that surfaced in the last
week, and

10:36.802 --> 10:40.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that has to do with the
president's son-in-law,
Jared Kushner.

10:41.007 --> 10:49.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Essentially, it was reported
that he was trying
to set up a secret back channel
to Russian

10:49.749 --> 10:54.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government officials in early
December, during
the transition last year.

10:54.353 --> 10:58.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Is there any rational
explanation, any explanation
you can think of for doing that?

10:58.891 --> 11:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES CLAPPER: Well, I guess a
benign explanation
was simply an outreach to the
Russians, the

11:07.066 --> 11:08.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Russian government.

11:08.067 --> 11:11.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So that's not, in and of itself,
untoward.

11:11.570 --> 11:21.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, again, not knowing the
intent or the
content, and whether or not the
sort of time-honored

11:21.180 --> 11:28.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
principle of one president at a
time in this
country, that did give rise,
particularly

11:28.054 --> 11:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
given the attempts to mask,
apparently, this
dialogue, so that was certainly
a concern

11:40.099 --> 11:41.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to all of us.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It certainly was to me
personally.

11:42.902 --> 11:48.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Can you think of
a reason why
it would be necessary to have a
secret -- a

11:48.708 --> 11:52.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
channel that was secret from
U.S. intelligence
agencies?

11:52.311 --> 11:55.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES CLAPPER: Well, if it's
true -- and,
again, I'm not -- I can't
confirm or deny

11:55.848 --> 12:02.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- but if it's true that the
objective here
was to use Russian secure
communications as

12:02.888 --> 12:13.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the mode of this dialogue or
this communication,
that is, I will say, curious.

12:13.833 --> 12:16.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why all the cloak-and-dagger
secrecy?

12:16.769 --> 12:26.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the intent was simply to
reach out to establish
-- to make acquaintance -- but
one wonders

12:26.912 --> 12:30.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if there was something worse
than that or
more nefarious than that.

12:30.850 --> 12:35.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, again, we didn't know, I
certainly didn't
know before I left the
government on the 20th

12:35.588 --> 12:37.356 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of January.

12:37.389 --> 12:40.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm asking
because yesterday
-- or, over the weekend, the
secretary of

12:40.292 --> 12:45.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
homeland security, John Kelly,
said in an
interview, he said, it's a good
thing.

12:45.097 --> 12:48.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said, if there were attempts
to open lines
of communication, it's a good
thing.

12:48.968 --> 12:50.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a positive thing.

12:51.003 --> 12:54.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES CLAPPER: Well, it could
be, and I agree
with him.

12:54.573 --> 12:57.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, again, this is not a new
thing.

12:57.209 --> 13:04.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Other governments have sought
back channels,
and particularly as
administrations change

13:04.650 --> 13:06.318 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
over.

13:06.352 --> 13:12.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is an art form here to
how this
is done, and there is a line
between reaching

13:12.358 --> 13:17.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out, establishing lines of
communication,
vs. substantively undermining
the policies

13:17.763 --> 13:19.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the current administration.

13:19.165 --> 13:22.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, again, we do have a
principle here of
one president at a time.

13:22.935 --> 13:29.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to ask you
about two
recent disclosures of classified
information

13:29.308 --> 13:31.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by the president himself.

13:31.143 --> 13:35.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One was in a meeting with
Russian officials
in the Oval Office when the
president shared

13:35.848 --> 13:39.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
information about ISIS
capabilities...

13:39.084 --> 13:40.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES CLAPPER: Right.

13:40.920 --> 13:44.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... that had all
the earmarks
of coming from Israeli
intelligence, and then

13:44.123 --> 13:48.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
separately in a conversation
with the president
of the Philippines, when the
president said

13:49.028 --> 13:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that two U.S. nuclear subs had
been in the
vicinity of North Korea.

13:53.699 --> 13:57.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Is this truly damaging
information to share,
or is all this overblown?

13:57.469 --> 14:02.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES CLAPPER: Well, certainly,
I guess there
are two dimensions to this.

14:02.341 --> 14:08.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One, the public revelation of
this, which,
of course, was in both cases
somehow leaked

14:09.014 --> 14:13.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the media, that -- and leaks,
I have to
say, are bad.

14:13.853 --> 14:21.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know that's the lifeblood of
the media business,
but, for the intelligence
community, leaks

14:21.827 --> 14:23.729 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are bad.

14:23.762 --> 14:28.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They compromise sources and
methods, tradecraft,
in some cases, can endanger the
lives of assets.

14:28.734 --> 14:31.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, leaks are damaging.

14:31.737 --> 14:38.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other dimension, of course,
is the revelation
of these things to a foreign
government.

14:38.711 --> 14:47.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, that kind of thing goes on
all the time,
but it's also in due deference
to protecting

14:47.152 --> 14:52.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
either the operational equities
or the intelligence
equities.

14:52.925 --> 14:55.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's not something you just
kind of wing
extemporaneously.

14:55.661 --> 15:01.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: These incidents
must give some
in the intelligence community
pause.

15:01.700 --> 15:03.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES CLAPPER: I'm sure it does.

15:03.802 --> 15:05.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it's not exactly
confidence-building.

15:05.704 --> 15:15.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's important to
restore or
achieve a level of confidence
that that flow

15:15.147 --> 15:16.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can continue unabated.

15:16.916 --> 15:21.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you hear
from your
friends in the intelligence
community about

15:21.287 --> 15:23.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their view of President Trump?

15:23.255 --> 15:32.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES CLAPPER: I think the view
of the intelligence
community, as much as I
explained to him when

15:32.231 --> 15:37.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke with him by phone on the
11th of January,
after he characterized the
intelligence community

15:37.069 --> 15:43.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as Nazis, that the national
intelligence community
is a national treasure, and that
the men of

15:43.842 --> 15:49.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the women of the community stand
ready to
support the president, whoever
it is, particularly

15:49.748 --> 15:51.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in his role as commander in
chief.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The terrorist
threat.

15:53.886 --> 15:57.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over the last few days, the
secretary of homeland
security, John Kelly, has
painted a pretty

15:57.957 --> 16:00.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
frightening picture.

16:00.125 --> 16:05.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said at one point he expects
-- quote -- "a
lot more attacks" like the one
in Manchester,

16:05.464 --> 16:06.832 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
England.

16:06.865 --> 16:09.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he said: "The terror threat
is worse than
most people realize.

16:09.234 --> 16:12.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If people knew what I knew, they
would never
leave the house in the morning."

16:12.571 --> 16:14.273 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Do you share...

16:14.306 --> 16:19.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES CLAPPER: And he went on to
praise the
counterterrorism efforts that we
have under

16:19.211 --> 16:26.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way, of course, very much of
which the intelligence
community is involved in.

16:26.118 --> 16:32.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have gone to great
lengths and made
great investments to try to
ensure that we

16:32.758 --> 16:38.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't have a similar instance as
happened
in Manchester.

16:38.931 --> 16:44.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I would point out that this
may not necessarily
come from outside.

16:44.937 --> 16:48.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the issues we have had in
this country
have been caused by U.S.
citizens.

16:48.574 --> 16:52.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you share that
level of
alarm, though, that people
wouldn't leave

16:52.144 --> 16:53.779 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their houses if they knew...

16:53.812 --> 16:57.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES CLAPPER: Well, I'm here,
so I left my
house this morning.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: North Korea.

17:00.786 --> 17:05.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Do you believe there's a
realistic chance
now that North Korea could pull
back from

17:05.290 --> 17:07.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
its nuclear weapons development
program?

17:08.027 --> 17:14.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES CLAPPER: I think it's
unlikely, and
I certainly think it's not
realistic for us

17:14.800 --> 17:19.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to expect the North Koreans to
give up their
nuclear weapons.

17:19.838 --> 17:22.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That is their ticket to
survival.

17:22.274 --> 17:30.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was taken aback when I visited
North Korea
in November 2014 to bring out
two of our citizens

17:30.115 --> 17:32.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who were in hard labor then.

17:32.051 --> 17:38.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have been a student of the
Korean Peninsula
for a long time, ever since I
served there

17:38.557 --> 17:42.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the director of intelligence
for U.S. Forces
Korea in the mid-80s.

17:42.327 --> 17:50.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I had underestimated the
level of paranoia
and the siege mentality that
prevails in Pyongyang.

17:50.269 --> 17:55.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as they look out outward,
all they see
are enemies.

17:55.674 --> 17:58.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so they're not going to give
up their
nuclear weapons.

17:58.777 --> 18:02.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you're
going to be in
South Korea in coming days.

18:02.948 --> 18:06.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you think the best
approach is for
the United States?

18:06.251 --> 18:08.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES CLAPPER: Well, I think
dialogue.

18:08.220 --> 18:13.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I know we have had --
there's a long history
here of dialogue which hasn't
turned out so

18:13.659 --> 18:15.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
well with the North Koreans.

18:15.194 --> 18:17.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I attempted it myself.

18:17.930 --> 18:24.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that's a far better
option than
a military confrontation, which
I think would

18:24.903 --> 18:26.505 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be a disaster.

18:26.538 --> 18:28.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And how much does
it matter
what the president says and
tweets?

18:28.740 --> 18:31.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES CLAPPER: Well, it matters
a lot.

18:31.677 --> 18:32.778 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Words count.

18:32.811 --> 18:36.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's quite important what he
says or doesn't
say.

18:36.348 --> 18:39.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One final
question about Robert
Mueller.

18:39.718 --> 18:45.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know him well, named special
counsel to
oversee the Russia
investigation.

18:45.491 --> 18:48.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How confident are you that he's
going to be
able to get to the bottom of
what happened?

18:48.894 --> 18:53.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES CLAPPER: I think that was
an inspired,
brilliant choice to pick Bob
Mueller for that

18:54.032 --> 18:55.801 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
function.

18:55.834 --> 19:01.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In my opinion, he's cut from the
same cloth
as Jim Comey, two outstanding
public servants.

19:01.974 --> 19:08.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Bob will get to the bottom
of this, and
he will not be intimidated by
any outside

19:08.113 --> 19:09.948 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
influences.

19:09.982 --> 19:13.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: James Clapper,
former director
of national intelligence, thank
you very much.

19:13.719 --> 19:17.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES CLAPPER: Thank you.

19:17.089 --> 19:29.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We return our
focus to the
White House, how the Trump
administration

19:29.468 --> 19:35.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is responding to mounting
tensions, and how
that compares to past
administrations, with

19:35.040 --> 19:39.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Gerald Seib, executive
Washington editor for
The Wall Street Journal.

19:39.711 --> 19:45.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Christopher Ruddy, he's the
CEO of the
conservative Newsmax media and a
friend of

19:45.184 --> 19:46.685 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
President Trump.

19:46.718 --> 19:48.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And welcome, both of you, to the
program.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Chris Ruddy, I'm going to start
with you.

19:50.656 --> 19:54.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You told The Wall Street Journal
for their
today's editions that right now
the White

19:54.092 --> 19:58.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House is in a what you call
perpetual quagmire
on side issues.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What did you mean by that?

20:00.699 --> 20:04.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER RUDDY, CEO, Newsmax:
Well, the
side issues are things you have
been talking

20:04.603 --> 20:08.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about, Judy, and a lot of the
other media
on the Russia issue.

20:08.473 --> 20:14.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sometimes, the president's
tweets cause some
of those side issues.

20:14.046 --> 20:19.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're not focusing on the
-- I think
the big agenda items of the
Trump administration

20:19.451 --> 20:26.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are very positive for him,
such as his
jobs programs and efforts there,
the fact

20:26.458 --> 20:31.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he is getting China to open
up its markets
for the first time in 30 years
to American

20:31.930 --> 20:38.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
businesses, incredible movement
on making
the country more secure.

20:38.337 --> 20:42.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those things are not being
talked about,
and they're focusing on
personnel issues and

20:42.507 --> 20:47.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other things that are not
necessarily moving
their agenda or making the
president more

20:47.980 --> 20:49.715 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
popular.

20:49.748 --> 20:50.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jerry Seib, how
do you see
the state of affairs right now
in the White

20:50.949 --> 20:52.751 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
House?

20:52.784 --> 20:54.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERALD SEIB, The Wall Street
Journal: Well,
I think there is a danger at a
time like this

20:54.653 --> 20:58.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the controversy, the
scandal, the investigation
swallows up to the rest of the
agenda.

20:58.724 --> 21:03.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we saw this -- I think back
to the Reagan
White House in the second term,
the Iran-Contra

21:03.462 --> 21:04.429 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
scandal.

21:04.463 --> 21:06.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You saw it, as well as I did.

21:06.198 --> 21:09.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there was a real danger that
the whole
second term could be swallowed
up by that

21:09.234 --> 21:11.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
scandal, and so the White House
moved.

21:11.303 --> 21:13.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It brought in new blood.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It brought in a new chief of
staff, a new
White House counsel, a new
national security

21:15.407 --> 21:17.342 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
adviser.

21:17.376 --> 21:21.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, importantly, it set up an
entire separate
channel to handle the
investigation, the scandal,

21:21.446 --> 21:25.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the controversy, trying to wall
off the rest
of the agenda, so it wouldn't
get consumed,

21:25.517 --> 21:28.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and so the rest of the White
House staff could
work on things other than the
scandal that

21:28.987 --> 21:30.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
seemed to be everywhere.

21:30.822 --> 21:34.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It took a long while, and people
who worked
in that White House think they
lost almost

21:34.526 --> 21:38.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
an entire year to the
controversy, but eventually
they figured out how to get some
other things

21:38.497 --> 21:40.165 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
done.

21:40.198 --> 21:42.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that's in many ways the
challenge
before the Trump White House
right now.

21:42.701 --> 21:46.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Chris Ruddy, you
talk to this
president on a regular...

21:46.772 --> 21:48.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER RUDDY: Well...

21:48.707 --> 21:49.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, pick up on
that, because
I'm curious to know how the
president is seeing

21:49.574 --> 21:50.542 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

21:50.575 --> 21:52.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Does he feel he's able to turn
things around?

21:52.411 --> 21:58.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER RUDDY: Well, I
always say Donald
Trump moves in two parallel
tracks at the

21:58.850 --> 22:00.519 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
same time.

22:00.552 --> 22:05.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's the controversial
political guy that's
always out there with his
tweets.

22:05.557 --> 22:10.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He comes from a showbiz
background, as well
as a very successful career in
finance and

22:10.829 --> 22:12.664 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
real estate.

22:12.698 --> 22:16.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He loves sometimes the
controversy more than
some people -- the press thinks
they're totally

22:16.101 --> 22:17.736 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
aggravating him.

22:17.769 --> 22:23.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He sometimes thrives on the
public controversy
and the hitting back.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, he's very
results-oriented.

22:25.577 --> 22:31.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He knows that the American
people are going
to judge him by his performance
on the economy,

22:31.750 --> 22:34.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on jobs, on national security.

22:34.386 --> 22:38.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on those things, Judy, he
has been pushing
forward relentlessly.

22:38.423 --> 22:40.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I spoke to Steve Bannon today.

22:40.625 --> 22:44.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said to me that they are
-- the morale
in the administration is very
high, that they're

22:44.863 --> 22:46.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pushing forward on all these
agenda items.

22:46.932 --> 22:51.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're not going to get bogged
down on these
investigations.

22:51.136 --> 22:52.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that's the important
thing.

22:52.804 --> 22:55.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the president will
keep his eye
on the ball.

22:55.340 --> 22:58.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jerry Seib, if
that's the case,
is that coming across?

22:58.377 --> 23:00.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JERRY SEIB: Well, I don't think,
at the moment
it is.

23:00.712 --> 23:04.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's a tendency at a time
like this
in the White House to think,
well, the problem

23:04.649 --> 23:08.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the press or the problem is
the leakers,
and if we could just have a
better communication

23:08.754 --> 23:11.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strategy and get our message
out, everything
will be OK.

23:11.289 --> 23:13.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's rarely that simple.

23:13.091 --> 23:17.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think one of the realities
that I think
past presidents have discovered
at times like

23:17.262 --> 23:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is, the one thing you can't
really do
is stonewall the investigative
process.

23:21.500 --> 23:22.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have to sort of let it play
out.

23:22.934 --> 23:26.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in fact, clearing the air
is an important
thing in the long run.

23:26.104 --> 23:29.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the short run, that's a very
tough thing
for any president to see.

23:30.008 --> 23:34.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do think, right now -- and
this is why
the next few weeks I think are
really crucial

23:34.112 --> 23:39.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- the way you look forward out
of a rut like
that is to show some forward
momentum on your

23:39.518 --> 23:41.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
agenda in Washington.

23:41.319 --> 23:44.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem right now is that,
on health care
and the budget and tax cuts,
that doesn't

23:44.890 --> 23:46.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
look like it's going to be an
easy thing to
do.

23:46.324 --> 23:48.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You need to put some wins on the
board.

23:48.059 --> 23:49.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Chris Ruddy, is
that feasible?

23:49.828 --> 23:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER RUDDY: Well, let's
start with
one other -- well, Gerald says
stonewalling

23:55.367 --> 23:56.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the investigative process.

23:56.835 --> 23:59.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Where has the president
stonewalled the investigative
process?

23:59.371 --> 24:01.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're cooperating with
Congress.

24:01.139 --> 24:05.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's never said for Congress --
he's got majorities
in the House and Senate.

24:05.310 --> 24:10.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Never encouraged anybody to shut
down investigation,
never -- even with the firing of
Comey, he

24:10.949 --> 24:14.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could have -- the way you shut
down that investigation
was in the Justice Department.

24:14.419 --> 24:15.487 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He knew that.

24:15.520 --> 24:17.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He could have tried to shut down
that investigation.

24:17.422 --> 24:23.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was never -- he was upset
that Comey
was pursuing this, when people
are making

24:23.295 --> 24:31.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
leaks of the most highly
classified conversations
our president can have with
foreign leaders,

24:31.036 --> 24:34.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they're making them out of
the intelligence
community, and nobody wants to
investigate

24:35.006 --> 24:36.908 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

24:36.942 --> 24:42.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet he feels, after six
months of investigating
Russia, they keep saying there's
no evidence

24:42.280 --> 24:46.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of collusion on this, but yet it
keeps going
on and on.

24:46.218 --> 24:51.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I don't think he -- there is
any evidence
that he's been trying to shut
down these investigations.

24:51.389 --> 24:55.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the same time, I think
he's frustrated
that the media keeps focusing on
them.

24:55.494 --> 24:58.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But is it
realistic, Jerry
Seib -- and I will come back to
you, Chris

24:58.497 --> 25:03.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ruddy, on this -- to expect that
the media
is just going to stand down
while these investigations

25:03.168 --> 25:04.803 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
take place?

25:04.836 --> 25:06.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERALD SEIB: Well, first, I
wasn't saying
that there had been
stonewalling.

25:06.171 --> 25:08.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm saying that's the temptation
at a time
like this.

25:08.139 --> 25:10.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think past presidents have
learned you
have to avoid that temptation.

25:10.842 --> 25:13.245 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I agree with Chris entirely
on that.

25:13.278 --> 25:16.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's not realistic to
think that the
press is going to stand down.

25:16.281 --> 25:18.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this is going to be with us
for a while.

25:18.183 --> 25:22.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think the way you approach
this is, you
accept that there's going to be
this distraction,

25:22.821 --> 25:25.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but you can't make it -- allow
it to become
an all-consuming distraction.

25:26.024 --> 25:28.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so you almost need a
two-track strategy.

25:28.159 --> 25:29.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's really the point I
was trying to
make.

25:29.761 --> 25:31.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Chris Ruddy, is
there -- are
there more staff...

25:31.930 --> 25:32.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER RUDDY: Well...

25:32.964 --> 25:34.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Go ahead.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER RUDDY: No, you go
ahead, Judy.

25:36.134 --> 25:37.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I keep interrupting you.

25:37.235 --> 25:38.203 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

25:38.236 --> 25:40.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're...

25:40.105 --> 25:40.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER RUDDY: This is my
first time on
your show, so I'm learning your
tempo a little

25:40.672 --> 25:42.374 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bit.

25:42.407 --> 25:45.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I'm curious
to know,
are there going to be, you
expect, more staff

25:45.210 --> 25:46.945 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
changes?

25:46.978 --> 25:50.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw the communications
director leave today,
or expected the leave after
today.

25:51.016 --> 25:53.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER RUDDY: I think there
will be.

25:53.985 --> 25:55.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think it's going to be
wholesale.

25:55.854 --> 26:00.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, sometimes, the press says,
President
Trump is going the make this
wild, major shakeup.

26:00.692 --> 26:03.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't -- I think there will be
changes.

26:03.395 --> 26:06.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, let's go back to certain
core facts
here.

26:06.998 --> 26:09.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a man that was never a
politician,
never in Washington.

26:09.868 --> 26:11.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He brought in some fresh faces.

26:11.736 --> 26:13.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He thought it was going to open
up government.

26:13.238 --> 26:16.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He realizes he needs more
veteran, experienced
hands.

26:16.608 --> 26:19.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's on a learning curve, I
think a pretty
fast one.

26:19.611 --> 26:22.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's brought in some very good
people in the
Cabinet.

26:22.380 --> 26:26.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's deferring to them on most
of the major
stuff, which is good.

26:26.251 --> 26:27.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he's brought in McMaster,
who is excellent.

26:27.919 --> 26:29.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he's bringing in other
people.

26:29.287 --> 26:31.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think you see these
changes over time.

26:31.890 --> 26:33.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it will be very healthy
for him.

26:33.758 --> 26:36.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's going to be good
for the country
as a whole.

26:36.928 --> 26:39.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I do think there will be
additional changes
coming down the pike.

26:39.598 --> 26:42.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, very quickly,
if that's
what they do, Jerry Seib, can
that make a

26:42.901 --> 26:43.835 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
difference?

26:43.868 --> 26:45.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GERALD SEIB: I think it can,
absolutely.

26:45.670 --> 26:47.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think one of the things
you have to
remember is that Republicans on
the Hill who

26:47.906 --> 26:52.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
control the House and the
Senate, they're
the ones who kind of have to
take the next

26:52.143 --> 26:53.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
step at pushing the agenda
forward.

26:53.511 --> 26:54.879 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's not all on Donald Trump.

26:54.913 --> 26:57.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's on Republican leadership
in the House
and the Senate as well.

26:57.549 --> 26:59.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We are going to
have to leave
it there.

26:59.718 --> 27:05.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gentlemen, we look forward to
having you back
to discuss this and much more to
follow.

27:05.390 --> 27:12.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jerry Seib, Chris Ruddy, thank
you.

27:12.197 --> 27:23.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

27:23.274 --> 27:27.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": how
some simple
changes could be revolutionizing
care for

27:27.846 --> 27:33.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
premature babies; a view from
Arkansas -- the
state's governor on the
Republican health

27:33.752 --> 27:40.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
care plan; and a poet laureate
helping Chicago
students realize the power of
words.

27:41.026 --> 27:46.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: Twin bombings rocked
Baghdad early
this morning, just days after
the beginning

27:46.965 --> 27:49.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the Muslim holy month of
Ramadan.

27:49.768 --> 27:51.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has more.

27:51.603 --> 27:55.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The first attack
hit a popular
ice cream parlor in the Karrada
district of

27:55.407 --> 27:57.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the capital just after midnight.

27:57.375 --> 28:01.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A suicide bomber struck as
families milled
about following their breaking
of the fast.

28:01.680 --> 28:05.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At least 15 people were killed,
and nearly
twice as many were wounded.

28:05.950 --> 28:08.153 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISIS has claimed responsibility.

28:08.186 --> 28:12.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second attack came during
the morning
rush hour in a central district
of Baghdad.

28:12.524 --> 28:18.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A car bomb there killed at least
14 and wounded
more than 30, all this as Iraqi
forces, backed

28:18.830 --> 28:24.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
by U.S. and coalition
airstrikes, press the
offensive on Mosul, the last
major ISIS foothold

28:24.436 --> 28:25.770 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in Iraq.

28:25.804 --> 28:29.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We turn to Susannah George of
the Associated
Press in Baghdad.

28:29.441 --> 28:30.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Susannah, thank you for joining
us.

28:31.009 --> 28:35.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, these attacks are clearly
targeting places
where many are gathered, right?

28:35.814 --> 28:37.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What can you tell us about the
bombings?

28:37.582 --> 28:41.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSANNAH GEORGE, Associated
Press: In the
aftermath of the bombings, there
was a lot

28:41.119 --> 28:42.921 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of anger.

28:42.954 --> 28:47.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of that anger was to the
militants that
carried out the bombings, that
deliberately

28:47.892 --> 28:51.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
targeted targets where there
were children
and families.

28:51.896 --> 28:57.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there was a lot of anger at
Iraq's political
leadership, who many Iraqis hold
responsible

28:57.635 --> 29:03.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the security failings that
allowed these
bombs to get into Central
Baghdad.

29:03.808 --> 29:09.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is not the first time that
we have seen
these large-scale bombings
during Ramadan.

29:09.581 --> 29:15.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, a large truck bombing
in the same
neighborhood in Karrada killed
hundreds of

29:15.120 --> 29:16.955 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

29:16.988 --> 29:21.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was the largest single
attack in Baghdad
since the 2003 overthrow of
Saddam Hussein.

29:21.860 --> 29:27.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, afterwards, Iraqi security
officials
pledged to revamp the security
of the district

29:27.632 --> 29:28.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Baghdad.

29:28.867 --> 29:30.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They increased checkpoints.

29:30.201 --> 29:31.669 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They increased security checks.

29:31.703 --> 29:33.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But the attacks have continued.

29:33.538 --> 29:39.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So is there a
fear or a sense
even that this is the beginning
of a new terror

29:39.944 --> 29:45.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign, the beginning of
Ramadan season,
and what is the level of
security in Baghdad?

29:45.049 --> 29:49.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSANNAH GEORGE: Well, this is
just the first
few days of the holy month of
Ramadan that

29:49.821 --> 29:53.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
often sees an uptick of violence
here in Iraq.

29:53.158 --> 29:58.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And civilians and Iraqi security
officials
are warning of more attacks to
come.

29:58.429 --> 30:02.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say this is partially
because of the
holy month of Ramadan, but also
because I.S.

30:02.867 --> 30:09.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fighters are losing ground in
Mosul in the
north of Iraq, and we often see
this increase

30:09.874 --> 30:16.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in insurgent activity in
Baghdad, other places
far from the front lines as the
extremists

30:16.181 --> 30:18.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lose territory on the
battlefield.

30:18.817 --> 30:24.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You mentioned
Mosul and ISIS
losing ground, yes, but the
fight does continue

30:24.789 --> 30:26.157 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
there very much.

30:26.191 --> 30:28.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Give us -- very briefly, where
do things stand?

30:28.626 --> 30:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSANNAH GEORGE: I.S. only holds
a small pocket
of neighborhoods in Western
Mosul, mainly

30:34.799 --> 30:38.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Old City and a few other
neighborhoods
around that area.

30:38.636 --> 30:43.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iraqi forces are advancing, but
the advance
is incredibly slow.

30:43.208 --> 30:47.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is some of the most densely
populated
neighborhoods in Mosul.

30:47.979 --> 30:55.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N. estimates that more
than 100,000
civilians are trapped in this
part of Mosul,

30:55.420 --> 31:02.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the Iraqi military has asked
these people
to flee in an effort to speed up
the military

31:02.427 --> 31:04.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
operations in that district.

31:04.429 --> 31:08.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But aid groups are warning that
that could
be incredibly dangerous for the
civilians

31:09.000 --> 31:14.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are trapped inside the Old
City, as there
are no safe passageways for them
to exit.

31:14.239 --> 31:19.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it would mean that thousands
of civilians
would be crossing front lines
and could get

31:19.444 --> 31:24.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
caught up in some of the deadly
clashes between
I.S. fighters and the Iraqi
security forces.

31:24.916 --> 31:30.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Susannah, you
alluded to this
earlier, but these new bombings
in Baghdad

31:30.121 --> 31:37.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
raise the question about whether
this is because
ISIS is stronger or weaker in
taking an action

31:37.061 --> 31:38.162 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like this.

31:38.196 --> 31:40.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you see, and what are
people telling
you?

31:40.098 --> 31:44.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSANNAH GEORGE: Well, Iraqi
officials and
coalition officials will say
that these bombings

31:44.903 --> 31:50.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Baghdad, at the same time
that I.S. is
losing ground on the front lines
in places

31:50.508 --> 31:56.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like Mosul, are an effort to
distract from
those territorial defeats, that
it's actually

31:56.214 --> 31:57.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a sign of weakness.

31:57.982 --> 32:04.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the fact that the group is
still able
to plan and carry out these
rather complex

32:04.222 --> 32:11.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attacks inside a very secure
part of the Iraqi
capital shows that the group
maintains significant

32:11.796 --> 32:16.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
insurgent capabilities, despite
the fact that
they have lost significant
territory.

32:17.001 --> 32:21.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
Susannah George
of the AP in Baghdad, thank you
very much.

32:21.606 --> 32:29.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSANNAH GEORGE: Thank you.

32:29.213 --> 32:36.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the great
medical advances
in recent years is the treatment
and care

32:36.487 --> 32:38.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of premature babies.

32:38.790 --> 32:44.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Despite that, these tiny infants
born before
full term are still at higher
risk for a range

32:44.762 --> 32:46.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of problems down the road.

32:46.931 --> 32:51.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Correspondent William Brangham
and producer
Jason Kane bring us the first of
two stories

32:51.970 --> 32:57.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about a study under way that's
testing whether
the simplest human interactions
can make a

32:57.041 --> 32:59.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
big difference in these
children's lives.

33:00.011 --> 33:06.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Most moms
don't have to
travel 25 miles every morning to
see their

33:06.050 --> 33:07.585 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
newborn baby.

33:07.618 --> 33:11.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But for Kate Ilie, there's an
hour-long commute,
frantic calls...

33:11.789 --> 33:15.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATE ILIE, Mother: I would
rather just meet
in the unit, if we're allowed
to.

33:15.727 --> 33:21.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: ... Manhattan
gridlock,
all to do the one thing she most
desperately

33:21.666 --> 33:24.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wants, be with her baby girl,
Caroline (ph).

33:24.802 --> 33:28.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: All right, Caroline, so
we are going
to reconnect with mommy now.

33:28.172 --> 33:33.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But, as you
can see, Caroline
had a rough path into the world.

33:33.111 --> 33:38.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Born 13 weeks too soon, she's
had to live
here in Morgan Stanley
Children's hospital,

33:38.216 --> 33:39.183 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for months.

33:39.217 --> 33:42.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: OK, now we're going to go
skin-to-skin.

33:42.754 --> 33:46.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Kate and baby
Caroline are
part of an ongoing research
effort out of

33:46.724 --> 33:52.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Columbia University Medical
Center and New
York Presbyterian examining
whether the most

33:52.397 --> 33:58.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
basic nurturing techniques, like
this quiet
moment, can help heal the
traumas of premature

33:58.336 --> 33:59.670 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
birth.

33:59.704 --> 34:03.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: The more you do this, the
more you
reinforce that connection.

34:03.107 --> 34:05.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATE ILIE: It took us a little
while, but
we're doing it now.

34:05.410 --> 34:07.178 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

34:07.211 --> 34:11.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARTHA WELCH, Columbia
University: You are
calming me, and I am calming
you, and then

34:11.282 --> 34:14.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the two crave being together,
and it's self-perpetuating.

34:14.218 --> 34:18.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This
intervention is the
brainchild of Dr. Martha Welch.

34:18.322 --> 34:22.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She says that, while much of
this seems like
the standard care offered to
premature babies

34:22.760 --> 34:29.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and their parents, here, the
focus is 100
percent on strengthening the
emotional connection

34:29.200 --> 34:30.334 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
between mother and child.

34:30.368 --> 34:31.335 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

34:31.369 --> 34:32.403 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARTHA WELCH: It's not cerebral.

34:32.437 --> 34:33.471 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's visceral.

34:33.504 --> 34:35.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's gut feelings.

34:35.139 --> 34:39.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're beginning to set
this pattern
of calming each other.

34:39.777 --> 34:41.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It seems so
basic.

34:41.479 --> 34:42.447 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

34:42.480 --> 34:44.282 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARTHA WELCH: Very basic.

34:44.315 --> 34:48.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For the last
few months,
we have been following several
moms and their

34:48.119 --> 34:51.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
premature babies through this
process.

34:51.355 --> 34:56.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Neonatal intensive care units
give these children
a better shot at survival now
than at any

34:56.327 --> 34:58.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
other time in history.

34:58.296 --> 35:04.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the early '90s, a child born
as early as
23 or 24 weeks was unlikely to
survive.

35:04.836 --> 35:06.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now they routinely do.

35:06.871 --> 35:13.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, despite that, leaving the
womb so early
still puts these kids at high
risk for emotional,

35:13.177 --> 35:15.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
behavioral and developmental
challenges.

35:15.746 --> 35:18.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This intervention is meant to
help minimize
those impacts.

35:18.649 --> 35:21.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: You make momma feel more
comfortable
now.

35:21.352 --> 35:25.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Nurse Mary
McKiernan says
step one is often connecting
with a child

35:25.823 --> 35:29.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's literally wrapped in
lifesaving technology.

35:29.293 --> 35:31.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They call these calming
Sessions.

35:31.095 --> 35:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY MCKIERNAN, Nurse: There's
so much medical
equipment, and monitors, and
beeping, and

35:34.999 --> 35:35.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
some mothers, they're afraid.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're afraid to speak to their
babies.

35:37.969 --> 35:41.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATE ILIE: I'm trying to figure
out how to
hold Caroline.

35:41.172 --> 35:42.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She has her CPAP on.

35:42.473 --> 35:44.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She has her tube in.

35:44.575 --> 35:50.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This woman comes up to me, and
she says: "My
name is Mary, and I'm a nurse
here.

35:50.548 --> 35:53.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you want me to help you hold
your baby?"

35:53.384 --> 35:55.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I could cry just telling
this.

35:55.887 --> 35:58.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I was like, I will take
anything.

35:58.156 --> 36:03.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY MCKIERNAN: I know she's
sleeping, but
she can -- she knows your voice,
so talk to

36:03.261 --> 36:06.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her in your emotional tone, as
you always
do.

36:06.597 --> 36:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KATE ILIE: You have had a long
morning.

36:08.399 --> 36:09.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You finished your whole bottle

36:09.667 --> 36:12.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARY MCKIERNAN: It feels good,
right?

36:12.236 --> 36:14.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KATE ILIE: There's nothing
better.

36:14.372 --> 36:15.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARY MCKIERNAN: Yes.

36:15.640 --> 36:19.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KATE ILIE: It's like therapy for
both of us.

36:19.043 --> 36:25.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm telling you, that was the
first time I
felt like I could breathe, and I
could bond

36:25.583 --> 36:26.551 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with my baby.

36:26.584 --> 36:27.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For the first
time?

36:27.585 --> 36:28.586 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
KATE ILIE: Yes.

36:28.619 --> 36:30.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it was so emotional.

36:30.488 --> 36:35.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Welch and
McKiernan say
this is a step beyond what's
known as kangaroo

36:35.626 --> 36:40.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
care, the skin-to-skin contact
that's been
taught in many NICUs since the
1990s.

36:40.131 --> 36:43.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY MCKIERNAN: I have been a
nurse here many
years, but there was something
missing.

36:43.601 --> 36:47.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what was missing was that
helping the
mother to get to that emotional
connection.

36:47.805 --> 36:52.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIA CARDENAS, Mother: Take care
of them for
me, St. Jude.

36:52.310 --> 36:56.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Getting past
her fear of
losing her babies has been one
of the biggest

36:56.881 --> 36:58.649 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
obstacles for Elia Cardenas.

36:58.683 --> 37:03.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIA CARDENAS: Please help the
nurses give
them all the care that they
need, so I can

37:03.454 --> 37:05.356 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bring them home.

37:05.389 --> 37:09.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Her twin boys,
Lukas (ph)
and Tadeo (ph), were born at 26
weeks, three-and-a-half

37:09.927 --> 37:11.929 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
months too soon.

37:11.963 --> 37:18.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her previous child had also been
born prematurely,
but he only lived a few hours,
and she's terrified

37:18.102 --> 37:19.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the twins won't survive either.

37:19.737 --> 37:25.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIA CARDENAS: On my way home, I
was crying
the entire way.

37:25.276 --> 37:28.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I wasn't planning on having them
so early.

37:29.013 --> 37:35.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, when I got home, it
was even worse,
because, you know, I had all
these things

37:35.086 --> 37:36.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the babies ready.

37:37.021 --> 37:42.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Each day,
Cardenas makes
the hour-long trip to the
hospital from her

37:42.126 --> 37:44.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
home in Port Chester, New York.

37:44.195 --> 37:46.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But she's put up her own
barriers.

37:46.163 --> 37:48.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELIA CARDENAS: It made me feel
helpless.

37:48.199 --> 37:52.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It made me feel -- I didn't feel
like a mom
seeing them there.

37:52.837 --> 37:57.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I didn't feel like they were my
babies because
they were in the hospital, and I
didn't know

37:57.875 --> 37:59.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if they were going to make it or
not.

37:59.377 --> 38:01.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I really didn't want to get
close with
them.

38:01.879 --> 38:05.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I didn't want to -- I don't
know.

38:05.049 --> 38:06.951 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's hard to describe that
feeling.

38:06.984 --> 38:11.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Like everyone
who was part
of this intervention, Cardenas
was also encouraged

38:11.289 --> 38:15.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to talk with the boys, and
taught how to hold
them inside the incubators.

38:15.693 --> 38:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dr. Welch will even put her
hands on Cardenas'
back and on her arm to mimic the
touch and

38:22.333 --> 38:24.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pressure she can use on the
boys.

38:24.502 --> 38:25.703 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

38:25.736 --> 38:29.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTHA WELCH: I was trying to
elicit emotion
from Elia.

38:29.507 --> 38:35.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was holding her back, so that
she would
feel the kind of comfort that I
wanted her

38:35.446 --> 38:37.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to convey to her baby.

38:38.015 --> 38:40.251 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is not a didactic session.

38:40.284 --> 38:41.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's experiential.

38:41.919 --> 38:46.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She has to experience me and she
has to experience
what she's doing to the baby.

38:46.791 --> 38:48.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELIA CARDENAS: I'm trying to be
here for them.

38:48.826 --> 38:49.794 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

38:49.827 --> 38:50.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARTHA WELCH: And you have been.

38:50.828 --> 38:51.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ELIA CARDENAS: Yes.

38:51.829 --> 38:52.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I'm always scared.

38:52.830 --> 38:54.565 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

38:54.598 --> 38:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTHA WELCH: Yes, and even
though things
are really good now, that
feeling doesn't

38:56.434 --> 38:57.635 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
exactly go away.

38:57.668 --> 38:59.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELIA CARDENAS: No, it doesn't.

38:59.770 --> 39:00.738 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

39:00.771 --> 39:01.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARTHA WELCH: It will.

39:01.872 --> 39:03.774 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It will go away.

39:03.808 --> 39:09.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once the baby calms the mother,
and the mother
feels that, she begins to
believe in the baby's

39:09.280 --> 39:14.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
survival capacity, because, if
this baby can
make her feel like that, the
baby's viable.

39:14.985 --> 39:17.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIGUELINA TAVAREZ, Mother: We
had eggs.

39:17.121 --> 39:19.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
After dinner, I told my dad a
ghost story.

39:19.724 --> 39:21.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Boy, did he get scared.

39:21.659 --> 39:26.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Another mother
in the study,
Miguelina Tavarez, says she
can't really explain

39:26.230 --> 39:31.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
why, but these simple
interventions have had
a powerful effect or her ability
to connect

39:31.335 --> 39:33.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with her daughter Reylan (ph).

39:33.037 --> 39:37.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIGUELINA TAVAREZ: I actually
come in now,
and I can take a deep breath and
be like,

39:37.742 --> 39:38.709 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm all right.

39:38.743 --> 39:40.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And she's all right.

39:40.578 --> 39:42.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, in the long run, I
will be like,
you know what, me and you have a
trust besides

39:42.880 --> 39:48.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a mother and a daughter bond,
that I can express
myself to you, and you will
appreciate it.

39:48.152 --> 39:52.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Today, she's
learning another
part of the intervention: using
what's known

39:52.423 --> 39:53.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as a scent cloth.

39:53.424 --> 39:55.226 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

39:55.259 --> 39:58.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTHA WELCH: We have a little
flannel square
that the mother wears in her
bra, which she

39:58.229 --> 39:59.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
then gives to the baby.

40:00.030 --> 40:04.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we put the same kind of
cloth under the
baby's head, and give that to
the mother.

40:04.835 --> 40:08.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIGUELINA TAVAREZ: I felt like
my whole body
was relaxed.

40:08.472 --> 40:09.640 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

40:09.673 --> 40:10.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTHA WELCH: How do you feel
now when you
smell it?

40:10.474 --> 40:11.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIGUELINA TAVAREZ: The same way.

40:11.475 --> 40:12.443 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's like...

40:12.476 --> 40:13.444 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

40:13.477 --> 40:15.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARTHA WELCH: Let all the stress
drain out.

40:15.179 --> 40:19.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But do these
interventions
really make any tangible
difference?

40:19.150 --> 40:25.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tomorrow, we will examine some
of the surprising
results, and we will look at
questions over

40:25.156 --> 40:27.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
some of Dr. Welch's past
practices.

40:27.391 --> 40:36.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," in New
York, I'm William
Brangham.

40:36.467 --> 40:51.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We turn now to
another health
care story, this one the ongoing
political

40:51.215 --> 40:53.851 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
battle to replace Obamacare.

40:53.884 --> 40:58.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. Senate is beginning to
write its
own reform bill, and discovering
there are

40:58.122 --> 41:02.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some big differences of opinion
over what
Republicans passed in the House.

41:02.526 --> 41:07.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier this month, we spoke
with Democratic
Governor John Hickenlooper of
Colorado about

41:07.398 --> 41:10.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
efforts to replace the
Affordable Care Act.

41:10.100 --> 41:11.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Today, we hear from a
Republican.

41:11.969 --> 41:13.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And our Lisa Desjardins has
that.

41:13.838 --> 41:17.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As part of our
ongoing look
at what's at stake in health
care for those

41:17.708 --> 41:21.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
closest to the problem, we're
now joined by
Asa Hutchinson, the Republican
governor from

41:21.946 --> 41:23.747 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Arkansas.

41:23.781 --> 41:27.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our viewers will recall that
Arkansas was,
of course, one of the states to
expand Medicaid

41:27.551 --> 41:28.619 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
under Obamacare.

41:28.652 --> 41:31.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Governor Hutchinson, thank you
for joining
us.

41:31.956 --> 41:33.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, you're in an interesting
position.

41:33.757 --> 41:37.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have opposed the Affordable
Care Act,
but also you and your
predecessor, as we just

41:37.828 --> 41:40.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
said, supported the expansion.

41:40.130 --> 41:44.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And because of those things, we
have seen
uninsurance rates in your state
get slashed

41:44.401 --> 41:46.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in half under the Affordable
Care Act.

41:46.804 --> 41:48.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What do you think of the
Affordable Care Act
right now?

41:48.839 --> 41:50.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Does it need full repeal?

41:50.140 --> 41:51.542 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

41:51.575 --> 41:54.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ASA HUTCHINSON (R), Arkansas:
Well, we need
to change what we have.

41:54.211 --> 41:56.113 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It doesn't work completely.

41:56.146 --> 42:03.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, we wanted to reform
the Medicaid
expansion in Arkansas with a
simple work requirement,

42:03.621 --> 42:09.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just lick we have on the SNAP
program, but
under Obamacare, the previous
administration

42:09.326 --> 42:11.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wouldn't give us that
requirement.

42:11.262 --> 42:13.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We needed to control the cost
more.

42:13.631 --> 42:20.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're unable to do that whenever
it's mandatory
that you cover everybody up to
138 percent

42:20.738 --> 42:22.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the federal poverty level.

42:22.673 --> 42:26.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so we're trying to
concentrate limited
resources in Arkansas.

42:26.610 --> 42:29.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't have the flexibility we
need under
the current program.

42:29.547 --> 42:35.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, yes, I supported a change in
it, and I
applaud the House for starting
the debate

42:35.686 --> 42:40.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with passing a repeal and a
replacement.

42:40.190 --> 42:45.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we need to obviously do
more, and I'm
looking for the Senate to --
they're starting

42:45.262 --> 42:46.230 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
over.

42:46.263 --> 42:48.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're drafting it.

42:48.098 --> 42:50.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I hope they listen to the
governors to provide
the flexibility that's needed,
and I hope

42:50.334 --> 42:55.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they take some ideas from
Arkansas as to some
of the good things we have done
in terms of

42:55.940 --> 42:59.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reform, controlling costs, but
also expanding
health care coverage.

42:59.310 --> 43:03.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: One of the
items of flexibility
that House Republicans would
give you is the

43:03.747 --> 43:08.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ability to waive out of some
things like essential
benefits or a cap on the costs
for people

43:09.019 --> 43:11.322 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who have preexisting conditions.

43:11.355 --> 43:13.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are those things that you would
want to waive
out of?

43:13.958 --> 43:15.693 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

43:15.726 --> 43:20.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ASA HUTCHINSON: Not necessarily,
but we have
got to be able to have the
flexibility and

43:20.064 --> 43:22.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
options for the state.

43:22.099 --> 43:27.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, for example, on the health
care benefits,
I think the state should be able
to give more

43:27.371 --> 43:29.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
flexibility in terms of
coverage.

43:29.640 --> 43:33.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Not everybody wants every
essential health
benefit.

43:33.911 --> 43:39.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They might want to have
different options
and a menu of options that suit
their particular

43:39.550 --> 43:41.285 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
needs.

43:41.318 --> 43:44.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's give the states the option
to enhance
coverage, to make sure there's
health care

43:45.022 --> 43:50.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
options that are out there, but
also the ability
to control costs.

43:50.127 --> 43:52.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so we want to look at a menu
of options.

43:52.863 --> 43:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We take two options right now in
terms of
reform.

43:56.367 --> 44:02.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want to be able to reduce it
from 138 percent
of the federal poverty level
down to the poverty

44:02.806 --> 44:08.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
level, so we can concentrate our
limited resources
on those that need it the most,
shift more

44:08.746 --> 44:14.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the exchange, where they will
have support
and coverage, but it will be a
cost-saving

44:14.318 --> 44:17.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
measure, both for the state and
the federal
government.

44:17.221 --> 44:20.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are types of reforms and
flexibility
that will make sense.

44:20.891 --> 44:25.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The work requirement is
important to encourage
people to have the training they
need to move

44:25.329 --> 44:30.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up the employment ladder, to
make more money,
but, at the same time, have some
support for

44:30.567 --> 44:31.869 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
health care.

44:31.902 --> 44:33.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are the reforms we want to
put into
place.

44:33.737 --> 44:37.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Governor, House
Republicans
would offer you more
flexibility, as you say,

44:37.908 --> 44:41.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but they would also cut some of
the Medicaid
funding you get from the
government, and it

44:41.979 --> 44:44.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seems they are increasing
uncertainty.

44:44.715 --> 44:48.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Insurers need to set their rates
for the next
year, and they aren't sure if
they are going

44:48.852 --> 44:52.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get the subsidies that the
president and
Congress control.

44:52.222 --> 44:56.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What does that uncertainty feel
like, and
are you worried about funding
cuts?

44:56.660 --> 44:58.395 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

44:58.429 --> 45:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ASA HUTCHINSON: Yes, that's one
of the big
faults of the House bill is that
it's a cost

45:03.033 --> 45:04.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
shift to the states.

45:04.568 --> 45:09.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to absorb more of the
cost to maintain
the same level of coverage.

45:09.406 --> 45:11.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't need that cost shift to
the states.

45:11.542 --> 45:14.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need to continue a good
federal-state partnership.

45:14.144 --> 45:21.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I'm looking to the Senate to
rewrite that
portion of it, so the
flexibility is good,

45:21.719 --> 45:27.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but you cannot accompany that
with a massive
cost shift to the states that
would leave

45:27.458 --> 45:33.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more and more uninsured, because
the states
cannot absorb that kind of a
burden.

45:33.397 --> 45:38.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the flexibility is an
important part of
it to be able to manage it.

45:38.302 --> 45:40.003 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Two points.

45:40.037 --> 45:44.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Under Obamacare, they
underestimated the number
that was going to go on
Medicaid.

45:45.008 --> 45:46.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Too many went on Medicaid.

45:46.944 --> 45:52.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They overestimated those that
would go on
the exchange, and there are too
few on the

45:52.049 --> 45:53.183 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
exchange.

45:53.217 --> 45:54.985 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We want to reverse that.

45:55.018 --> 46:00.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And under Arkansas' plan, you're
going to
restrict those that are on the
Medicaid portion

46:00.891 --> 46:06.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of it, shift more to the
exchange, and that's
the original design that makes
it more cost-effective

46:06.697 --> 46:07.664 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for the states.

46:07.698 --> 46:09.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: I see.

46:09.399 --> 46:12.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Governor Asa Hutchinson,
Republican of Arkansas,
thank you so much for joining
us.

46:12.202 --> 46:13.170 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

46:13.203 --> 46:17.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ASA HUTCHINSON: Great to be with
you.

46:17.641 --> 46:29.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
a distinct
way of giving students their own
voice.

46:29.052 --> 46:33.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Earlier, we reported on another
violent holiday
weekend in Chicago.

46:33.524 --> 46:36.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
More than 50 people were shot
over four days.

46:36.894 --> 46:39.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last year, more than 4,000 were
shot in the
city.

46:39.797 --> 46:44.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Often, when we talk about the
school system
in Chicago, we hear about too
much violence

46:44.368 --> 46:46.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and too little money.

46:46.303 --> 46:51.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we look at a project
led by the nation's
poet laureate to give kids a way
of creating

46:52.009 --> 46:56.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
meaningful expression about
their lives and
challenges they face.

46:56.613 --> 46:58.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown is back with this
report.

46:58.348 --> 47:01.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of our weekly series
Making the
Grade.

47:01.518 --> 47:10.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The reality of
one ninth grade
girl's life told in the language
of poetry,

47:10.994 --> 47:12.296 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by Nakia Sales.

47:12.329 --> 47:15.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NAKIA SALES, Student: Black kid,
black kid,
you have been shot.

47:15.566 --> 47:18.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Black kid, black kid, why you
have to die?

47:18.435 --> 47:20.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Never got to see you walk across
the stage
in a suit and tie.

47:20.470 --> 47:23.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now your momma crying over your
casket, asking
God why.

47:23.373 --> 47:28.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Earlier, at her
West Side Chicago
school, she'd told me how she
came to write

47:28.178 --> 47:29.880 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
her poem.

47:29.913 --> 47:33.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NAKIA SALES: When we came back
from Christmas
break, I had just lost two of my
friends.

47:33.750 --> 47:35.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Lost them to
violence?

47:35.118 --> 47:36.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NAKIA SALES: Yes.

47:36.820 --> 47:43.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They was walking down the street
one day,
and a car had rolled past, and
they had got

47:43.727 --> 47:45.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shot, both of them, in the head.

47:45.629 --> 47:50.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, when I got back to
school that day,
when I got to writing, "Black
Kid" automatically

47:50.367 --> 47:52.903 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
came to my mind.

47:52.936 --> 47:58.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This ceremony at
the Harold
Washington Public Library was
the culmination

47:58.609 --> 48:04.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a year-long pilot program to
bring poetry
into the curriculum of about 40
inner-city

48:04.281 --> 48:14.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chicago high schools and a
chance for students
to read their work for Juan
Felipe Herrera,

48:14.925 --> 48:27.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the outgoing U.S. poet laureate.

48:27.871 --> 48:32.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This past year, Herrera ran four
workshops
for ninth grade English
teachers, offering

48:32.809 --> 48:35.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ideas and prompts to encourage
writing.

48:35.846 --> 48:40.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He urged them to choose their
own reading
texts as examples,anything they
thought their

48:40.050 --> 48:41.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
students might relate to.

48:41.985 --> 48:47.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Across the city, more than 85
percent of students
in Chicago public schools are
children of

48:47.591 --> 48:50.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
color, and most are classified
as economically
disadvantaged.

48:51.028 --> 48:54.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MISSY HUGHES, Teacher, Michele
Clark Magnet
High School: I'm really
intentional about

48:54.231 --> 48:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
finding poems that speak to
their experience.

48:56.934 --> 49:01.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Nakia's teacher,
Missy Hughes
of Michele Clark High School,
was one of the

49:01.405 --> 49:03.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
instructors who signed up for
the program.

49:03.407 --> 49:09.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MISSY HUGHES: We just saw how
students were
able to tell their story,
because there's

49:09.813 --> 49:13.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like -- there's this mainstream
narrative
out there about who they are and
what their

49:13.250 --> 49:18.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lives are, and that's -- it
doesn't honor
the complexity or the nuances or
really their

49:18.288 --> 49:20.157 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
own voice.

49:20.190 --> 49:25.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Herrera also
pushed the teachers
to find their own voice through
poetry, and

49:25.729 --> 49:27.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to read the results out loud.

49:27.197 --> 49:28.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MISSY HUGHES: It's intimidating.

49:28.732 --> 49:31.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the poet laureate of the
United States.

49:31.735 --> 49:33.503 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It keeps me honest to do it.

49:33.537 --> 49:38.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's really hard to do that, to
go up there
and write something intimate,
most likely

49:38.041 --> 49:42.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about your life and your
experience, and then
to share that work with
everyone.

49:42.112 --> 49:47.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It worked for the
teachers,
and for students like Nakia, who
says poetry

49:48.018 --> 49:50.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has already had a huge impact on
her young
life.

49:50.921 --> 49:55.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NAKIA SALES: It's a way to get
anger out too,
stress.

49:55.525 --> 49:57.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Anything that you got on your
mind, just let
it out on a piece of paper.

49:57.794 --> 50:02.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But just how do
you reach young
people who don't have experience
with poetry?

50:02.132 --> 50:04.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN FELIPE HERRERA, U.S. Poet
Laureate: It
may not be in their background,
maybe, in

50:04.201 --> 50:07.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
terms of books, having books at
home.

50:07.037 --> 50:08.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But they have a lot of stories.

50:08.972 --> 50:14.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the poetry is there, but
it's there rumbling
in the heart and in the blood
and what they

50:14.778 --> 50:18.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see, you know, what they see day
to day.

50:18.348 --> 50:20.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we want to bring all that
out.

50:20.484 --> 50:25.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For Herrera, the
nation's first
Mexico-American poet laureate,
the project

50:25.222 --> 50:26.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is deeply personal.

50:27.024 --> 50:32.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we first met two years ago,
he told me
of growing up in California, the
son of migrant

50:32.062 --> 50:33.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
workers from Mexico.

50:33.864 --> 50:38.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He spoke only Spanish at first,
an experience
that left him feeling like an
outsider.

50:38.635 --> 50:42.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN FELIPE HERRERA: And it
created a lot
of combustion in me, because I
wanted to be

50:42.939 --> 50:47.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
inside society, I wanted to
communicate, I
wanted to have conversations.

50:47.377 --> 50:49.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I got to the point where I just
had to explode.

50:49.346 --> 50:54.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Herrera credits
words and poetry
with unlocking his ability to
communicate

50:54.718 --> 50:56.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with the larger world.

50:56.520 --> 51:00.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN FELIPE HERRERA: That's the
place I found
peace, the place I found
freedom, the place

51:00.791 --> 51:04.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I found my voice, and the place
where I could
construct things.

51:04.094 --> 51:07.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's the hope
for these students
as well.

51:07.397 --> 51:12.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lynette Mendoza is a teacher at
the Marine
Leadership Academy, a public
school where

51:12.169 --> 51:16.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
students prepare for military
service and
wear uniforms.

51:16.873 --> 51:22.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the laureate visited the
school, Mendoza
says, it had a strong impact on
her students,

51:22.379 --> 51:24.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than 90 percent of whom are
Latino.

51:24.281 --> 51:27.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LYNETTE MENDOZA, Marine
Leadership Academy:
They have a male military
instructor, and

51:27.717 --> 51:30.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some of them come from homes
where it's male-dominated.

51:30.387 --> 51:36.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was really important for the
kids to see
a man could read poetry, write
poetry, and

51:36.493 --> 51:38.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be inspired and still be a man.

51:38.462 --> 51:39.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: That was
important, that he
was a man?

51:39.729 --> 51:41.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LYNETTE MENDOZA: I felt it was
real important.

51:41.531 --> 51:45.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But you're making
-- make the
connection from what they learn
from poetry,

51:45.802 --> 51:48.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to a science class, or a math
class, or a
government class.

51:48.905 --> 51:52.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LYNETTE MENDOZA: You're looking
at the formulas
in math or in science, that's
the power.

51:52.342 --> 51:58.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you know how to work it,
you know how
to make certain adjustments, you
can come

51:58.148 --> 52:00.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
up with something
earth-shattering.

52:00.083 --> 52:01.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the same thing happens with
words.

52:01.885 --> 52:04.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The district
partnered with
the Library of Congress, which
selects the

52:04.988 --> 52:10.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
poet laureate, and the
Chicago-based Poetry
Foundation, which, for the
record, also supports

52:10.694 --> 52:12.095 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the "NewsHour."

52:12.129 --> 52:15.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This remains a small program,
and costs have
been minimal.

52:15.599 --> 52:20.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The school system provides subs
to fill in
when teachers have their
workshop days with

52:20.170 --> 52:21.471 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Herrera.

52:21.505 --> 52:27.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LaTanya McDade heads the Office
of Teaching
and Learning.

52:27.744 --> 52:33.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And while she admits the
district, the third
largest in the nation, faces
enormous challenges,

52:33.650 --> 52:36.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
getting buy-in for a poetry
program wasn't
one of them.

52:36.419 --> 52:39.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LATANYA MCDADE, Office of
Teaching and Learning:
If you look over time at schools
that have

52:39.389 --> 52:43.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strong arts programs, you see
higher performance
in students overall.

52:43.994 --> 52:49.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So when you show that kind of
data, you're
seeing a higher percentage of
students really

52:49.232 --> 52:52.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
showing strong academic
performance where
there is high arts investments.

52:52.702 --> 52:57.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The next step,
McDade says,
is to measure the impact of the
poetry classes.

52:57.707 --> 53:02.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The district has signed on for
another year
and will track the effectiveness
of the program

53:02.646 --> 53:04.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for both teachers and their
students.

53:04.247 --> 53:11.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUAN FELIPE HERRERA: Dinky
planet on a skateboard
of dynamite, oh, what to do?

53:11.454 --> 53:16.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: As for Juan
Felipe Herrera,
his term as U.S. poet laureate
is ending,

53:16.626 --> 53:20.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but he's committed to continue
working in
Chicago's schools.

53:20.197 --> 53:25.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says poetry's place in the
education of
young people is needed more than
ever.

53:25.101 --> 53:29.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN FELIPE HERRERA: We have got
to let our
students' lives, all their
lives, not just

53:29.873 --> 53:33.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
part of their lives, express
itself in as
many ways as possible.

53:33.510 --> 53:36.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And where else are they going to
get that
openness and freedom?

53:36.813 --> 53:38.848 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
In what other area in school?

53:38.882 --> 53:41.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maybe there's other areas, but,
for sure,
poetry.

53:41.551 --> 53:45.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Herrera and
others involved
hope this project can be a model
for other

53:45.589 --> 53:47.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cities around the nation.

53:47.424 --> 53:55.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jeffrey Brown
in Chicago.

53:55.665 --> 54:06.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online right
now: In a deeply conservative
West Virginia

54:06.576 --> 54:12.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
town, dubbed the most Trumpian
place in America
by its mayor, there's a new
movement of women

54:12.249 --> 54:16.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are coming together to
protest the president,
even if family and neighbors
don't like what

54:16.987 --> 54:18.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they have to say.

54:18.488 --> 54:23.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We take a close look at that
community on
our Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

54:23.760 --> 54:25.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

54:25.161 --> 54:26.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:26.229 --> 54:28.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening.

54:28.398 --> 54:34.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and we will see you soon.

54:34.804 --> 54:38.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and we will see you soon.
