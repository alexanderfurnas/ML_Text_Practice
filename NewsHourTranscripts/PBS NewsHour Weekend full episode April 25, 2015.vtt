00:14.915 --> 00:17.317
EARTHQUAKE-- MORE THAN 1,500 ARE

00:17.317 --> 00:19.386
FEARED DEAD; NEW PROTESTS IN

BALTIMORE FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF

00:21.021 --> 00:23.056
A YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN IN

00:23.056 --> 00:25.225
POLICE CUSTODY; HOW ISRAEL'S

00:25.225 --> 00:26.493
WATER SURPLUS COULD ALTER

00:26.493 --> 00:27.861
RELATIONS WITH ITS ARAB

00:27.861 --> 00:28.729
NEIGHBORS.

00:28.729 --> 00:30.330
>> ISRAEL NOT ONLY HAS PLENTY TO

00:30.330 --> 00:32.432
DRINK, BUT POTENTIALLY PLENTY TO

00:32.432 --> 00:33.467
SHARE.

00:33.467 --> 00:34.434
>> Stewart: CAN WHAT ISRAEL HAS

00:34.434 --> 00:35.936
LEARNED BE PUT TO USE IN

00:35.936 --> 00:36.837
CALIFORNIA?

00:36.837 --> 00:40.140
NEXT ON PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:40.140 --> 00:42.175
FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS IN

00:42.175 --> 00:43.777
LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:43.777 --> 00:45.212
ALISON STEWART.

00:45.212 --> 00:46.413
>> Stewart: GOOD EVENING.

00:46.413 --> 00:47.915
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:47.915 --> 00:50.050
ABOUT 1,500 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

00:50.050 --> 00:52.185
KILLED IN NEPAL AFTER A POWERFUL

00:52.185 --> 00:54.554
EARTHQUAKE REGISTERING 7.8 ON

00:54.554 --> 00:56.089
THE RICHTER SCALE STRUCK EARLIER

00:56.089 --> 00:57.057
TODAY.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.525
ELLEN BARRY, THE SOUTH ASIA

00:58.525 --> 00:59.726
BUREAU CHIEF OF THE "NEW YORK

00:59.726 --> 01:00.827
TIMES," HAS BEEN FOLLOWING THE

01:00.827 --> 01:02.129
STORY FROM HER POST IN

01:02.129 --> 01:03.864
NEIGHBORING INDIA AND JOINS US

01:03.864 --> 01:05.632
NOW VIA SKYPE.

01:05.632 --> 01:06.667
ELLEN, CAN YOU GIVE US SOME OF

01:06.667 --> 01:07.968
THE DETAILS, FILL US IN ON SOME

01:07.968 --> 01:09.036
OF THE DETAILS, FOR EXAMPLE,

01:09.036 --> 01:13.140
WHAT AREA WAS HARDEST HIT?

01:13.140 --> 01:13.807
>> Reporter: SURE.

01:13.807 --> 01:15.509
I MEAN, THE PART OF KATMANDU

01:15.509 --> 01:17.377
THAT WAS MOST SERIOUSLY

01:17.377 --> 01:19.112
DEVASTATED WAS THE OLD HISTORIC

01:19.112 --> 01:21.715
PART OF TOWN, WHERE THERE IS

01:21.715 --> 01:25.085
SORT OF DENSELY LOCATED

01:25.085 --> 01:27.321
HERITAGE, LANDMARK BUILDINGS,

01:27.321 --> 01:28.588
TEMPLES AND PALACES.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.624
A NUMBER OF THOSE WERE SIMPLY

01:30.624 --> 01:32.759
PANCAKED, IN SOME CASES WITH A

01:32.759 --> 01:34.361
A LOT OF PEOPLE INSIDE THEM.

01:34.361 --> 01:35.128
>> Stewart: ELLEN, FOR THOSE

01:35.128 --> 01:37.397
THAT DID SURVIVE THIS QUAKE AND

01:37.397 --> 01:38.832
ARE TRAPPED IN THE RUBBLE AND

01:38.832 --> 01:40.400
ARE BEING RESCUED, WHAT KIND OF

01:40.400 --> 01:41.568
MEDICAL ATTENTION IS AVAILABLE

01:41.568 --> 01:42.502
FOR THEM?

01:42.502 --> 01:43.503
>> WHAT I HEARD TOWARDS THE END

01:43.503 --> 01:44.705
OF THE DAY IS THAT THE HOSPITALS

01:44.705 --> 01:46.573
WERE COMPLETELY OVERFLOWING.

01:46.573 --> 01:48.108
PEOPLE BEING TREATED IN THE

01:48.108 --> 01:49.543
STREET, AND THERE WERE SHORTAGES

01:49.543 --> 01:51.745
OF BASIC MEDICAL GOODS LIKE

01:51.745 --> 01:54.114
GAUZE, AS WELL AS MEDICATIONS.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.148
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO

01:55.148 --> 01:56.583
HAD TO HAVE AMPUTATIONS BECAUSE

01:56.583 --> 01:58.452
THEY WERE STUCK IN COLLAPSED

01:58.452 --> 01:59.653
BUILDINGS DURING THE COURSE OF

01:59.653 --> 02:00.554
THE DAY.

02:00.554 --> 02:01.588
WATER IS GOING TO BE A BIG

02:01.588 --> 02:03.357
PROBLEM IN KATMANDU.

02:03.357 --> 02:04.891
THE STORES WERE ALREADY RUNNING

02:04.891 --> 02:08.228
SHORT OF BOTTLED WATER, AND EVEN

02:08.228 --> 02:09.563
UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES IT'S

02:09.563 --> 02:11.031
A CITY THAT HAS SERIOUS PROBLEMS

02:11.031 --> 02:12.132
WITH WATER.

02:12.132 --> 02:12.866
>> Stewart: IN TERMS OF RELIEF

02:12.866 --> 02:13.934
AGENCIES, HAVE THEY BEEN ABLE TO

02:13.934 --> 02:15.702
GET TO THE CITY AND GET TO THE

02:15.702 --> 02:16.570
SITE?

02:16.570 --> 02:18.338
AND WHO'S SENDING RELIEF?

02:18.338 --> 02:20.874
>> WELL, BOTH CHINA AND INDIA

02:20.874 --> 02:22.843
HAVE COME FORWARD PROPOSING

02:22.843 --> 02:25.145
SIGNIFICANT RELIEF, BUT I THINK

02:25.145 --> 02:26.813
A LOT OF IT IS ON THE WAY RIGHT

02:26.813 --> 02:27.314
NOW.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.182
THERE'S A WHOLE AREA THAT HAS

02:29.182 --> 02:31.585
BEEN... HAS NOT REALLY BEEN

02:31.585 --> 02:34.187
REACHED BY ANYONE, AND THAT IS A

02:34.187 --> 02:36.590
LOT OF VILLAGES AROUND KATMANDU,

02:36.590 --> 02:38.425
WHERE PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN

02:38.425 --> 02:40.994
THATCH AND MUD HOUSES THAT MAY

02:40.994 --> 02:43.597
HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY DEMOLISHED.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.932
THOSE NUMBERS, WE'LL GET MORE OF

02:45.932 --> 02:47.501
A SENSE OF THOSE TOMORROW I

02:47.501 --> 02:49.036
THINK WHEN RESCUE TEAMS GET OUT

02:49.036 --> 02:51.772
TOWARDS THE EPICENTER OF THE

02:51.772 --> 02:53.540
EARTHQUAKE, WHICH IS ABOUT 50

02:53.540 --> 02:55.509
MILES NORTHWEST OF THE CAPITAL.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.343
>> Stewart: AND I'VE BEEN

02:56.343 --> 02:57.310
FOLLOWING YOUR TWITTER FEED, AND

02:57.310 --> 02:59.079
IT SEEMS THERE ARE STILL TREMORS

02:59.079 --> 03:01.581
BEING FELT?

03:01.581 --> 03:02.949
>> Reporter: YES, AND THE

03:02.949 --> 03:05.786
POPULATION OF KATMANDU IS VERY,

03:05.786 --> 03:07.287
VERY RATTLED.

03:07.287 --> 03:08.889
PEOPLE SCREAM EVERY TIME THERE'S

03:08.889 --> 03:09.923
AN AFTERSHOCK.

03:09.923 --> 03:10.957
SOME OF THE AFTERSHOCKS WERE

03:10.957 --> 03:12.459
VERY PROLONGED.

03:12.459 --> 03:13.760
IN THE FIRST TWO HOURS, I THINK

03:13.760 --> 03:15.295
THERE WERE I THINK 12

03:15.295 --> 03:16.730
SIGNIFICANT AFTERSHOCKS, WHICH

03:16.730 --> 03:18.432
IS A LOT.

03:18.432 --> 03:19.866
MANY PEOPLE HAVE REFUSED TO GO

03:19.866 --> 03:21.201
BACK IN THEIR HOMES OVERNIGHT,

03:21.201 --> 03:22.769
SO THEY'RE SLEEPING OUTSIDE AT

03:22.769 --> 03:25.105
THE PARADE GROUND OR AT MOSQUES

03:25.105 --> 03:26.973
OR SIMPLY ON THE ROAD BECAUSE

03:26.973 --> 03:28.008
THEY'RE AFRAID IF THEY GO

03:28.008 --> 03:30.577
INSIDE THAT THEY WOULD FACE

03:30.577 --> 03:31.845
ANOTHER BUILDING COLLAPSE.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.013
>> Stewart: ELLEN BARRY OF THE

03:33.013 --> 03:34.214
"NEW YORK TIMES," THANK YOU SO

03:34.214 --> 03:35.982
MUCH FOR MAKING THE TIME FOR US.

03:35.982 --> 03:37.451
>> Reporter: THANK YOU.

03:37.451 --> 03:38.118
>> Stewart: FROM THE MIDDLE

03:38.118 --> 03:39.553
EAST, WORD OF NEW GAINS BY

03:39.553 --> 03:41.822
ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS IN SYRIA.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.123
FIGHTERS FROM THE AL QAEDA-

03:43.123 --> 03:45.092
AFFILIATED NUSRA FRONT CAPTURED

03:45.092 --> 03:46.359
WHAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS A

03:46.359 --> 03:48.128
STRATEGICALLY LOCATED TOWN WITH

03:48.128 --> 03:49.729
A POPULATION OF 50,000 IN THE

03:49.729 --> 03:52.099
NORTHWEST OF THAT COUNTRY.

03:52.099 --> 03:53.400
LAST MONTH, ANOTHER TOWN NEAR

03:53.400 --> 03:55.268
THE SYRIA-TURKEY BORDER FELL TO

03:55.268 --> 03:56.770
THE ISLAMISTS.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.038
IN NEIGHBORING IRAQ, WEST OF

03:58.038 --> 03:59.606
BAGHDAD, ISLAMIC MILITANTS IN

03:59.606 --> 04:01.108
VEHICLES PACKED WITH BOMBS

04:01.108 --> 04:02.976
ATTACKED AND REPORTEDLY CAPTURED

04:02.976 --> 04:05.612
CONTROL OF A PART OF A DAM.

04:05.612 --> 04:06.780
ACCORDING TO REUTERS, THE DAM

04:06.780 --> 04:08.415
SERVES AS FLOOD CONTROL FOR

04:08.415 --> 04:10.617
BAGHDAD AND OTHER CITIES.

04:10.617 --> 04:11.952
ISIS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR

04:11.952 --> 04:13.520
THE ATTACK, WHICH REPORTEDLY

04:13.520 --> 04:14.888
TOOK THE LIVES OF DOZENS OF

04:14.888 --> 04:16.256
IRAQI GOVERNMENT SOLDIERS,

04:16.256 --> 04:18.658
INCLUDING TWO SENIOR OFFICERS.

04:18.658 --> 04:20.127
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES, LARGE

04:20.127 --> 04:21.895
NEW PROTESTS TODAY IN BALTIMORE

04:21.895 --> 04:23.296
OVER THE RECENT DEATH OF AN

04:23.296 --> 04:25.132
AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN WHILE HE

04:25.132 --> 04:26.900
WAS IN POLICE CUSTODY.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.435
25-YEAR-OLD FREDDIE GRAY DIED

04:28.435 --> 04:29.736
LAST SUNDAY.

04:29.736 --> 04:31.104
HIS FAMILY SAID IN A STATEMENT

04:31.104 --> 04:33.440
THAT HIS SPINE WAS 80% SEVERED

04:33.440 --> 04:34.741
AT THE NECK AFTER POLICE

04:34.741 --> 04:36.109
APPREHENDED HIM.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.344
THE BALTIMORE POLICE DEPARTMENT

04:37.344 --> 04:38.778
SAYS IT HAS NOT CONCLUDED ITS

04:38.778 --> 04:40.013
INVESTIGATION BUT DID

04:40.013 --> 04:41.114
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE ARRESTING

04:41.114 --> 04:42.716
OFFICERS SHOULD HAVE CALLED FOR

04:42.716 --> 04:43.817
AN AMBULANCE.

04:43.817 --> 04:44.651
WE'LL HAVE MORE FROM A

04:44.651 --> 04:45.852
"BALTIMORE SUN" REPORTER

04:45.852 --> 04:48.021
COVERING THIS STORY IN A MOMENT.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.656
NOW TO HAWAII.

04:49.656 --> 04:50.957
IT IS ON THE VERGE OF BECOMING

04:50.957 --> 04:52.292
THE FIRST STATE TO RAISE THE

04:52.292 --> 04:54.161
LEGAL SMOKING AGE.

04:54.161 --> 04:55.362
BOTH THE STATE HOUSE AND SENATE

04:55.362 --> 04:56.963
HAVE PASSED LEGISLATION THAT

04:56.963 --> 04:58.765
BARS ANYONE YOUNGER THAN 21

04:58.765 --> 05:00.767
YEARS OLD FROM SMOKING, BUYING

05:00.767 --> 05:02.469
OR POSSESSING EITHER CIGARETTES

05:02.469 --> 05:04.437
OR ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES.

05:04.437 --> 05:05.605
HOWEVER, THE GOVERNOR STILL

05:05.605 --> 05:07.140
NEEDS TO SIGN THE BILL.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.375
THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL

05:08.375 --> 05:09.709
AND PREVENTION SAYS SMOKING IS

05:09.709 --> 05:11.077
THE LEADING CAUSE OF PREVENTABLE

05:11.077 --> 05:12.946
DEATHS IN THE UNITED STATES.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.447
NEARLY HALF A MILLION PEOPLE DIE

05:14.447 --> 05:17.350
A YEAR AS A RESULT OF SMOKING.

05:17.350 --> 05:19.019
TENNESSEE HAS A NEW LAW ALLOWING

05:19.019 --> 05:20.720
PEOPLE WITH HANDGUN PERMITS TO

05:20.720 --> 05:22.689
CARRY THEIR FIREARMS TO PARKS,

05:22.689 --> 05:24.357
PLAYGROUNDS AND SPORTS FIELDS.

05:24.357 --> 05:25.892
THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION

05:25.892 --> 05:27.794
HAILED THE NEWS AS A VICTORY FOR

05:27.794 --> 05:29.496
SECOND AMENDMENT FREEDOMS.

05:29.496 --> 05:30.830
THE LEGISLATION WAS OPPOSED BY

05:30.830 --> 05:32.465
GUN CONTROL ACTIVISTS AND BY THE

05:32.465 --> 05:33.567
MAYOR OF THE STATE'S SECOND

05:33.567 --> 05:35.335
BIGGEST CITY, NASHVILLE, WHO

05:35.335 --> 05:36.870
SAID THE NEW STATE LEGISLATION

05:36.870 --> 05:38.872
WOULD OVERRIDE ANY LOCAL BANS

05:38.872 --> 05:40.941
THAT HAD BEEN PUT IN PLACE.

05:40.941 --> 05:44.044
ALMOST 17 MILLION PEOPLE WATCHED

05:44.044 --> 05:45.445
OLYMPIC CHAMPION BRUCE JENNER

05:45.445 --> 05:47.347
SAY IN A NATIONALLY-TELEVISED

05:47.347 --> 05:48.815
INTERVIEW LAST NIGHT, QUOTING

05:48.815 --> 05:50.584
NOW, "FOR ALL INTENTS AND

05:50.584 --> 05:52.452
PURPOSES, I AM A WOMAN."

05:52.452 --> 05:54.154
JENNER, WHO WON THE DECATHLON IN

05:54.154 --> 05:56.489
1976, SAID DURING AN INTERVIEW

05:56.489 --> 05:58.758
WITH DIANE SAWYER OF ABC NEWS

05:58.758 --> 06:00.093
THAT HE HAS KNOWN HE'S TRULY

06:00.093 --> 06:02.128
FEMALE SINCE HE WAS A CHILD.

06:02.128 --> 06:04.064
JENNER IS NOW 65.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.665
JENNER ALSO TOLD SAWYER THE

06:05.665 --> 06:08.935
INTERVIEW WAS HIS LAST AS A MAN.

06:08.935 --> 06:10.036
AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO GO

06:10.036 --> 06:11.404
SOMEWHERE WHERE PEOPLE ARE

06:11.404 --> 06:12.939
HAPPY, YOU MIGHT WANT TO BOOK A

06:12.939 --> 06:14.808
TRIP TO SWITZERLAND.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.509
SWITZERLAND CAME IN NUMBER ONE

06:16.509 --> 06:18.378
IN THE U.N'S THIRD ANNUAL WORLD

06:18.378 --> 06:19.713
HAPPINESS REPORT.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.248
FACTORS CONSIDERED INCLUDED LIFE

06:21.248 --> 06:23.049
EXPECTANCY, ECONOMIC STANDING

06:23.049 --> 06:24.050
AND FREEDOM.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.385
AND IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING,

06:25.385 --> 06:27.454
OUT OF 158 COUNTRIES, THE UNITED

06:27.454 --> 06:30.957
STATES CAME IN 15th.

06:41.868 --> 06:42.902
>> Stewart: FOR MORE ABOUT THE

06:42.902 --> 06:44.070
INVESTIGATION INTO THE DEATH IN

06:44.070 --> 06:46.273
BALTIMORE OF 25-YEAR-OLD FREDDIE

06:46.273 --> 06:48.074
GRAY, WE'RE JOINED NOW BY LUKE

06:48.074 --> 06:48.842
BROADWATER.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.010
HE IS A REPORTER FOR THE

06:50.010 --> 06:50.977
"BALTIMORE SUN."

06:50.977 --> 06:51.945
AND LUKE, CAN YOU JUST GET UP US

06:51.945 --> 06:53.413
TO SPEED ON WHERE THE

06:53.413 --> 06:55.515
INVESTIGATION STANDS NOW?

06:55.515 --> 06:56.116
>> YES.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.717
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IS

06:57.717 --> 06:59.519
FOCUSING IN ON WHAT THEY DON'T

06:59.519 --> 07:00.954
KNOW AND WHAT THEY STILL NEED TO

07:00.954 --> 07:01.888
FIGURE OUT.

07:01.888 --> 07:04.324
AND THERE ARE TWO KEY GAPS IN

07:04.324 --> 07:06.226
THE INFORMATION THAT WE KNOW.

07:06.226 --> 07:07.661
ONE IS THE TIME FROM WHEN

07:07.661 --> 07:11.131
FREDDIE GRAY RUNS FROM POLICE TO

07:11.131 --> 07:13.533
THAT TIME WHEN THE FIRST VIDEO

07:13.533 --> 07:15.468
THAT WE'VE ALL SEEN PICKS HIM UP

07:15.468 --> 07:19.072
ON THE GROUND, SCREAMING, AS

07:19.072 --> 07:22.208
POLICE ARE ARRESTING HIM.

07:22.208 --> 07:23.443
AND THE SECOND IS, WHAT HAPPENED

07:23.443 --> 07:24.577
INSIDE THE VAN?

07:24.577 --> 07:25.245
>> Stewart: LET'S TALK A

07:25.245 --> 07:26.346
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT TIME

07:26.346 --> 07:27.614
INSIDE THE VAN.

07:27.614 --> 07:28.481
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF ATTENTION

07:28.481 --> 07:30.250
GIVEN TO WHAT HAS BEEN CALLED

07:30.250 --> 07:32.185
"ROUGH RIDES," GIVING ROUGH

07:32.185 --> 07:33.987
RIDES TO PEOPLE WHO ARE IN

07:33.987 --> 07:34.988
CUSTODY.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.122
CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO OUR VIEWERS

07:36.122 --> 07:37.457
WHAT THAT MEANS?

07:37.457 --> 07:40.293
>> WELL, A ROUGH RIDE IS AN

07:40.293 --> 07:41.594
UNSANCTIONED TECHNIQUE.

07:41.594 --> 07:43.463
IT'S ACTUALLY ILLEGAL.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.764
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO IT.

07:44.764 --> 07:48.501
IT VIOLATES DEPARTMENT POLICY.

07:48.501 --> 07:50.203
BY POLICY, DETAINEES ARE

07:50.203 --> 07:51.471
SUPPOSED TO BE SEATBELTED AND

07:51.471 --> 07:54.207
SECURED INSIDE A VAN, AND ANY

07:54.207 --> 07:56.042
TIME AN OFFICER DRIVES

07:56.042 --> 07:58.478
ERRATICALLY TO TRY TO THROW

07:58.478 --> 08:00.714
SOMEBODY AROUND AND INJURE THEM,

08:00.714 --> 08:03.316
THAT IS INTENTIONALLY CAUSING

08:03.316 --> 08:05.051
HARM AND THAT IS NOT ALLOWED

08:05.051 --> 08:06.653
UNDER POLICE PROCEDURES.

08:06.653 --> 08:07.654
THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE

08:07.654 --> 08:08.621
LAWSUITS AGAINST THE POLICE

08:08.621 --> 08:10.390
DEPARTMENT OVER TIME, INCLUDING

08:10.390 --> 08:12.258
SOME BIG JUDGMENTS, FOR THESE

08:12.258 --> 08:13.927
KINDS OF ACTIONS.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.061
AND THE PROBLEM WITH A ROUGH

08:15.061 --> 08:18.098
RIDE IS, BECAUSE THE PERSON HAS

08:18.098 --> 08:21.334
THEIR HANDS HANDCUFFED, THEY

08:21.334 --> 08:22.769
CAN'T BRACE THEMSELVES.

08:22.769 --> 08:26.306
SO, IF YOU TAKE A RAPID TURN

08:26.306 --> 08:28.475
AROUND THE CORNER AND CAUSE THE

08:28.475 --> 08:30.210
GENTLEMAN TO FALL FORWARD,

08:30.210 --> 08:31.778
BASHING HIS HEAD INTO SOMETHING,

08:31.778 --> 08:33.313
THERE'S NO WAY FOR HIM TO BRACE

08:33.313 --> 08:34.114
HIMSELF.

08:34.114 --> 08:34.814
>> Stewart: THERE HAVE BEEN

08:34.814 --> 08:36.116
TWO ENORMOUS JUDGMENTS, ONE FOR

08:36.116 --> 08:39.052
$39 MILLION FOR ONE PERSON,

08:39.052 --> 08:41.187
ANOTHER FOR $7.4 MILLION.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.122
WE SHOULD SAY THAT BOTH OF THOSE

08:42.122 --> 08:43.490
PEOPLE WERE PARALYZED.

08:43.490 --> 08:44.924
AND A THIRD WOMAN IS SUING IN

08:44.924 --> 08:46.226
FEDERAL COURT... A THIRD PERSON

08:46.226 --> 08:47.460
IS SUING IN FEDERAL COURT.

08:47.460 --> 08:48.294
AND I WANT TO READ A

08:48.294 --> 08:48.828
QUOTE.

08:48.828 --> 08:49.662
THIS IS FROM THE "BALTIMORE

08:49.662 --> 08:50.764
SUN" WHICH SOME OF YOUR

08:50.764 --> 08:51.731
COLLEAGUES HAVE REPORTED.

08:51.731 --> 08:53.767
SHE'S DESCRIBED IT THIS WAY:

09:01.975 --> 09:03.476
SO, IF WE PULL OUT A LITTLE BIT,

09:03.476 --> 09:04.711
DOES THIS SUGGEST A BIGGER

09:04.711 --> 09:06.880
PROBLEM REGARDING THE POLICE IN

09:06.880 --> 09:08.014
BALTIMORE?

09:08.014 --> 09:09.416
>> THE BALTIMORE POLICE HAVE A

09:09.416 --> 09:12.952
LONG AND NEGATIVE HISTORY WITH

09:12.952 --> 09:15.755
THE CITY OF BALTIMORE, WITH THE

09:15.755 --> 09:17.023
RESIDENTS.

09:17.023 --> 09:19.058
THIS DATES BACK... FRANKLY, IT

09:19.058 --> 09:21.161
DATES BACK A CENTURY.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.929
AND I DON'T THINK THAT

09:22.929 --> 09:24.798
NECESSARILY THE PROBLEMS OF THE

09:24.798 --> 09:25.932
POLICE DEPARTMENT CAN BE LOOKED

09:25.932 --> 09:27.934
AT JUST IN A VACUUM.

09:27.934 --> 09:29.035
BALTIMORE ITSELF HAS A LONG

09:29.035 --> 09:31.538
HISTORY OF RACISM AND RACIST

09:31.538 --> 09:32.939
PRACTICES IN TERMS OF

09:32.939 --> 09:36.176
SEGREGATIONIST HOUSING, WHERE

09:36.176 --> 09:38.645
WHITE... COVENANTS FOR WHITE

09:38.645 --> 09:39.913
NEIGHBORHOODS CAUSED SOME PEOPLE

09:39.913 --> 09:41.214
TO LIVE IN SOME NEIGHBORHOODS

09:41.214 --> 09:43.316
AND BLACKS WERE FORCED OUT INTO

09:43.316 --> 09:45.652
OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS.

09:45.652 --> 09:48.822
AND TO THIS DAY, WE'VE SEEN THE

09:48.822 --> 09:50.657
RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT.

09:50.657 --> 09:52.926
UNDER TWO MAYORS AGO, GOVERNOR

09:52.926 --> 09:55.094
O'MALLEY IN A TOUGH-ON-CRIME

09:55.094 --> 09:58.064
EFFORT, A PROGRAM CALLED ZERO

09:58.064 --> 09:59.299
TOLERANCE WAS PUT INTO PLACE,

09:59.299 --> 10:01.401
AND THAT RESULTED IN OVER

10:01.401 --> 10:04.304
100,000 ARRESTS OF BALTIMORE

10:04.304 --> 10:07.507
CITY RESIDENTS ALMOST EVERY

10:07.507 --> 10:08.107
YEAR.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.375
THAT'S ABOUT ONE IN SIX PEOPLE

10:09.375 --> 10:11.077
IN BALTIMORE WERE ARRESTED.

10:11.077 --> 10:12.212
AND SOMETIMES AS MUCH AS A

10:12.212 --> 10:14.214
FOURTH OF THOSE CASES DIDN'T

10:14.214 --> 10:15.915
EVEN RESULT IN CHARGES.

10:15.915 --> 10:18.818
AND THOSE RESULTED IN A BIG RIFT

10:18.818 --> 10:20.687
BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND THE

10:20.687 --> 10:21.821
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

10:21.821 --> 10:22.622
>> Stewart: LUKE BROADWATER

10:22.622 --> 10:23.823
FROM THE "BALTIMORE SUN."

10:23.823 --> 10:24.791
THANKS FOR SHARING YOUR

10:24.791 --> 10:25.792

OVERCOME CHRONIC WATER

10:49.649 --> 10:50.650

10:50.650 --> 10:51.317
IT'S A DEVELOPMENT WITH

10:51.317 --> 10:52.652
POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT POLITICAL

10:52.652 --> 10:54.053

JORDAN.

11:08.434 --> 11:09.669

11:21.948 --> 11:23.816
>> Reporter: AND SHALLOW, TOO.

11:23.816 --> 11:25.018
IN THE '60s, THE WATER LEVEL OF

11:25.018 --> 11:26.886
THE JORDAN RIVER WAS ACTUALLY

11:26.886 --> 11:28.421
WHERE WE'RE STANDING NOW.

11:28.421 --> 11:29.589
>> IN WINTERTIME, IT WAS THIS

11:29.589 --> 11:30.290

11:36.129 --> 11:38.698
HERE, WERE UNDER THREAT OF BEING

11:38.698 --> 11:41.034
DROWNED BY THE STRENGTH, BY THE

11:41.034 --> 11:43.169
POWER OF THIS RIVER.

11:43.169 --> 11:45.738
TODAY, A MOUSE WHEEL WILL HARDLY

11:45.738 --> 11:47.340
TURN WITH WHAT'S LEFT OF THIS

11:47.340 --> 11:48.508
RIVER.

11:48.508 --> 11:49.475
>> Reporter: FOR DECADES, ISRAEL

11:49.475 --> 11:50.977
AND ITS NEIGHBORS DIVERTED THE

11:50.977 --> 11:52.879
JORDAN'S FLOW TO SUPPLY DRINKING

11:52.879 --> 11:55.248
WATER AND WATER FOR CROPS.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.350
WHILE THE RIVER IS DOWN 95% FROM

11:57.350 --> 11:58.985
ITS HISTORICAL FLOW, THERE'S

11:58.985 --> 12:00.253
HOPE THAT SOMEDAY IT COULD

12:00.253 --> 12:02.689
RETURN TO ITS FORMER GLORY.

12:02.689 --> 12:04.123
THAT'S BECAUSE ISRAEL TODAY HAS

12:04.123 --> 12:06.092
MORE WATER THAN IT NEEDS; IT'S

12:06.092 --> 12:07.427
GONE FROM DROUGHT TO WATER

12:07.427 --> 12:09.629
SURPLUS IN JUST A FEW YEARS--

12:09.629 --> 12:10.763
IMPRESSIVE ANYWHERE, BUT

12:10.763 --> 12:12.565
ESPECIALLY IN THE ARID MIDDLE

12:12.565 --> 12:14.334
EAST, ONE OF THE DRIEST REGIONS

12:14.334 --> 12:15.868
IN THE WORLD.

12:15.868 --> 12:17.136
FOR YEARS, ISRAEL'S WATER

12:17.136 --> 12:19.105
AUTHORITY RAN PUBLIC SERVICE TV

12:19.105 --> 12:20.807
ADS LIKE THIS ONE.

12:20.807 --> 12:22.542
"ISRAEL'S DRYING UP," SHE SAYS,

12:22.542 --> 12:24.611
AS HER FACE BEGINS TO CRACK.

12:24.611 --> 12:26.312
"SAVE WATER!"

12:26.312 --> 12:27.480
NOW THE ADS HAVE BEEN

12:27.480 --> 12:29.182
DISCONTINUED, NOT NEEDED

12:29.182 --> 12:30.450
ANYMORE.

12:30.450 --> 12:31.651
THROUGH A COMBINATION OF

12:31.651 --> 12:33.753
RECYCLING, CONSERVATION AND MOST

12:33.753 --> 12:35.288
RECENTLY DESALINATION

12:35.288 --> 12:37.523
TECHNOLOGY-- REMOVING SALT FROM

12:37.523 --> 12:38.758
SALTWATER-- ISRAEL NOT ONLY HAS

12:38.758 --> 12:41.761
PLENTY TO DRINK, BUT POTENTIALLY

12:41.761 --> 12:43.363
PLENTY TO SHARE.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.231
AND THAT COULD BE GOOD NEWS FOR

12:45.231 --> 12:46.899
EASING TENSIONS IN A REGION

12:46.899 --> 12:48.601
WHERE WATER IS OFTEN THE SOURCE

12:48.601 --> 12:50.003
OF CONFLICT.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.237
ISRAEL IS ALREADY EASILY THE

12:51.237 --> 12:53.606
WORLD LEADER IN WATER REUSE, FAR

12:53.606 --> 12:55.341
OUTPACING THE REST OF THE WORLD,

12:55.341 --> 12:57.877
INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES.

12:57.877 --> 12:59.479
ACROSS ISRAEL, PLANTS LIKE THIS

12:59.479 --> 13:01.180
ONE IN THE DESERT TOWN OF RAHAT

13:01.180 --> 13:02.615
TREAT WASTEWATER INSTEAD OF

13:02.615 --> 13:04.317
LETTING IT GO TO WASTE.

13:04.317 --> 13:05.518
SO-CALLED GREY WATER FROM THE

13:05.518 --> 13:07.186
KITCHEN AND BATHROOM AS WELL AS

13:07.186 --> 13:08.855
BLACK WATER FROM SEWAGE IS

13:08.855 --> 13:10.623
FILTERED, CLEANED AND REUSED FOR

13:10.623 --> 13:12.025
IRRIGATION.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.593
IT'S A PERFECT LITTLE RECYCLING

13:13.593 --> 13:14.794
ECOSYSTEM.

13:14.794 --> 13:15.962
THE WASTE FROM THE PEOPLE OF

13:15.962 --> 13:18.498
RAHAT OVER THERE IS TREATED HERE

13:18.498 --> 13:20.299
AND THEN USED TO IRRIGATE THE

13:20.299 --> 13:22.835
FIELDS NEARBY.

13:22.835 --> 13:24.003
BUT THE REAL LEAP FORWARD HAS

13:24.003 --> 13:26.305
BEEN IN DESALINATION TECHNOLOGY,

13:26.305 --> 13:27.674
VASTLY IMPROVING ISRAEL'S

13:27.674 --> 13:30.143
ABILITY TO TURN SALTY WATER INTO

13:30.143 --> 13:32.412
FRESH DRINKING WATER.

13:32.412 --> 13:33.946
IN TEN YEARS, ISRAEL HAS BUILT

13:33.946 --> 13:35.815
FIVE DESALINATION PLANTS ALONG

13:35.815 --> 13:38.117
ITS MEDITERRANEAN COAST IN

13:38.117 --> 13:40.119
ASHKELON, ASHDOD, SOREK,

13:40.119 --> 13:41.921
PALMACHIM AND HADERA.

13:41.921 --> 13:44.957
EACH COST AROUND $400 MILLION.

13:44.957 --> 13:46.092
THEY'RE PRIVATELY OWNED AND SELL

13:46.092 --> 13:47.427
THEIR WATER TO THE GOVERNMENT,

13:47.427 --> 13:49.395
WHICH SELLS IT ON TO THE PEOPLE.

13:49.395 --> 13:50.496
TOGETHER, THE DESALINATION

13:50.496 --> 13:52.298
PLANTS PROVIDE UP TO 50% OF

13:52.298 --> 13:54.167
ISRAEL'S DRINKING WATER.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.835
THE ISRAELIS HAVE ACHIEVED

13:55.835 --> 13:57.036
SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY.

13:57.036 --> 13:58.237
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN YEARS AGO, IT

13:58.237 --> 14:00.673
WAS ALL ABOUT "SAVE WATER AND

14:00.673 --> 14:02.709
BATHE TOGETHER," AND NOW THEY'VE

14:02.709 --> 14:04.143
GOT MORE WATER THAN THEY NEED.

14:04.143 --> 14:05.178
>> IT IS REMARKABLE.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.512
IT'S BEEN A SLOW PROCESS.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.748
SO, ISRAEL'S LEADERSHIP IN

14:08.748 --> 14:10.516
TREATING SEWAGE HAS TAKEN PLACE

14:10.516 --> 14:12.585
OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS, BUT THE

14:12.585 --> 14:13.920
BREAKTHROUGH HAS BEEN IN THE

14:13.920 --> 14:15.388
DEVELOPMENT OF MEMBRANE

14:15.388 --> 14:17.924
TECHNOLOGY FOR DESALINATION

14:17.924 --> 14:20.693
BECAUSE THAT BREAKTHROUGH IN

14:20.693 --> 14:23.096
TECHNOLOGY DRAMATICALLY REDUCED

14:23.096 --> 14:24.630
THE COSTS OF DESALINATING

14:24.630 --> 14:25.865
SEAWATER.

14:25.865 --> 14:26.733
>> Reporter: FROM ABOUT $1 A

14:26.733 --> 14:28.367

14:28.367 --> 14:29.102

14:29.102 --> 14:31.137
TO LESS THAN HALF THE COST.

14:31.137 --> 14:32.205

70 METERS DOWN WHERE ALL THIS

15:06.172 --> 15:07.974
WATER IS COLLECTED, AND IT COMES

15:07.974 --> 15:09.942
BY GRAVITY FROM THE SEA; IT'S

15:09.942 --> 15:11.577
UNDER SEA LEVEL.

15:11.577 --> 15:12.812
THE PUMPS HERE LIFT IT HERE FROM

15:12.812 --> 15:15.615
THIS PIT TO THE PRETREATMENT

15:15.615 --> 15:16.415
AREA.

15:16.415 --> 15:17.483
>> Reporter: FROM PRE-TREATMENT,

15:17.483 --> 15:18.918
THE WATER MOVES THROUGH A SERIES

15:18.918 --> 15:20.486
OF SMALLER AND SMALLER SCREENS

15:20.486 --> 15:21.654
AND FILTERS.

15:21.654 --> 15:22.922
THEN, THE WATER IS PIPED INTO

15:22.922 --> 15:24.924
THIS COMPLEX OF BUILDINGS WHERE

15:24.924 --> 15:26.225
A FINE MEMBRANE IS USED TO

15:26.225 --> 15:28.261
REMOVE THE LAST BITS OF SALT AND

15:28.261 --> 15:29.662
OTHER MINERALS.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.597
THERE'S ABOUT 2,000 PRESSURE

15:31.597 --> 15:33.800
VESSELS HERE THAT SHOOT WATER

15:33.800 --> 15:36.235
DOWN THROUGH THE MEMBRANES AT A

15:36.235 --> 15:38.805
PRESSURE OF 70 ATMOSPHERES.

15:38.805 --> 15:41.007
HALFWAY DOWN, THE WATER BECOMES

15:41.007 --> 15:42.975
DRINKING WATER.

15:42.975 --> 15:44.410
THE DESALINATED WATER FINALLY

15:44.410 --> 15:46.078
PASSES THROUGH THESE PIPES TO

15:46.078 --> 15:47.947
ENTER ISRAEL'S WATER GRID.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.249
THIS TAP IS ALWAYS OPEN TO CHECK

15:50.249 --> 15:51.851
AT EVERY INSTANT THE QUALITY OF

15:51.851 --> 15:53.319
THE WATER THAT ISRAELIS WILL

15:53.319 --> 15:54.086
DRINK.

15:54.086 --> 15:55.021
>> 45 MINUTES AGO, THIS WAS

15:55.021 --> 15:56.956
SEAWATER, AND NOW DRINK IT AND

15:56.956 --> 15:58.424
SEE HOW TASTY IT IS.

16:02.862 --> 16:03.996
YOU LIKE IT?

16:03.996 --> 16:05.064
ACCORDING TO SPEC?

16:05.064 --> 16:06.799
>> Reporter: STILL, THERE ARE

16:06.799 --> 16:07.733
QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS

16:07.733 --> 16:08.668
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT; VERY SALTY

16:08.668 --> 16:09.969
WATER IS A BYPRODUCT OF THE

16:09.969 --> 16:11.404
PROCESS, AND IT GETS DUMPED BACK

16:11.404 --> 16:13.539
INTO THE MEDITERRANEAN.

16:13.539 --> 16:14.607
ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY THERE'S

16:14.607 --> 16:16.008
NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION TO KNOW

16:16.008 --> 16:17.777
THE LONG-TERM IMPACTS THAT MIGHT

16:17.777 --> 16:19.712
HAVE ON SEA LIFE.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.480
AND THE PROCESS USES A LOT OF

16:21.480 --> 16:23.783
ENERGY, AROUND 3% OF ALL OF

16:23.783 --> 16:25.484
ISRAEL'S ANNUAL ELECTRICITY

16:25.484 --> 16:27.186
OUTPUT.

16:27.186 --> 16:28.821
AS EVERYTHING HERE IS POLITICS,

16:28.821 --> 16:30.756
ISRAEL'S NEW WATER INDEPENDENCE

16:30.756 --> 16:32.859
COULD YIELD POLITICAL PROGRESS,

16:32.859 --> 16:33.993
THOUGH HISTORICALLY THAT

16:33.993 --> 16:36.329
PROGRESS HAS BEEN SLOW.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.029
>> THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THE

16:37.029 --> 16:37.897
MINDSET.

16:37.897 --> 16:39.999
IT'S BEEN ALL OR NOTHING FOR THE

16:39.999 --> 16:41.701
LAST 20 YEARS.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.736
THE NEGOTIATIONS IN THE PEACE

16:43.736 --> 16:45.238
PROCESS HAVE EITHER BEEN "WE

16:45.238 --> 16:47.206
AGREE ON ALL FIVE FINAL STATUS

16:47.206 --> 16:48.674
ISSUES OF THE PEACE PROCESS--

16:48.674 --> 16:49.842
WATER BEING ONE OF THEM, BUT

16:49.842 --> 16:51.143
ALSO JERUSALEM, SETTLEMENTS,

16:51.143 --> 16:53.012
BORDERS-- OR WE AGREE ON

16:53.012 --> 16:54.013
NOTHING."

16:54.013 --> 16:55.715
AND THEREFORE, FOR 20 YEARS,

16:55.715 --> 16:57.083
WE'VE AGREED ON NOTHING.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.150
>> Reporter: WATER'S OFTEN

16:58.150 --> 16:59.619
CAUGHT UP IN WIDER POLITICAL

16:59.619 --> 17:00.720
DEBATES.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.154
FOR EXAMPLE, WE VISITED THE

17:02.154 --> 17:03.856
PLANNED WEST BANK PALESTINIAN

17:03.856 --> 17:05.591
CITY OF RAWABI, WHERE

17:05.591 --> 17:06.993
CONSTRUCTION STOPPED FOR A YEAR

17:06.993 --> 17:08.527
AND A HALF OVER DISPUTES ABOUT

17:08.527 --> 17:09.629
WATER.

17:09.629 --> 17:10.663
THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER CUT

17:10.663 --> 17:12.365
THROUGH THE RED TAPE THIS YEAR

17:12.365 --> 17:13.699
AND PROMISED TO OPEN THE TAP

17:13.699 --> 17:15.034
THIS SPRING.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.736
STILL, IN THE PAST, THE ISRAELIS

17:16.736 --> 17:18.204
HAVE USED WATER TO PREVENT

17:18.204 --> 17:19.205
CONFLICT.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.040
IN THEIR 1994 PEACE ACCORD,

17:21.040 --> 17:23.175
ISRAEL AGREED TO PROVIDE JORDAN

17:23.175 --> 17:25.311
WITH 5% OF ITS ANNUAL WATER

17:25.311 --> 17:27.613
NEEDS AT NO COST, AND THAT'S

17:27.613 --> 17:29.916
BEEN INCREASED TO ABOUT 7% JUST

17:29.916 --> 17:32.118
BECAUSE ISRAEL CAN.

17:32.118 --> 17:34.053
AND WATER EXPERTS LIKE BROMBERG

17:34.053 --> 17:35.421
HOPE ISRAEL'S GOVERNMENT WILL

17:35.421 --> 17:37.490
USE ITS CURRENT WATER SURPLUS TO

17:37.490 --> 17:39.258
EXTEND THE SAME GENEROSITY TO

17:39.258 --> 17:40.960
THE PALESTINIANS LIVING IN THE

17:40.960 --> 17:42.228
WEST BANK.

17:42.228 --> 17:45.431
>> WE CAN MOVE FORWARD TODAY,

17:45.431 --> 17:48.301
AND EVERY PALESTINIAN CAN TURN

17:48.301 --> 17:50.636
ON THEIR TAP AND HAVE WATER

17:50.636 --> 17:51.370
FLOWING.

17:51.370 --> 17:52.138
>> Reporter: IN FACT, THE

17:52.138 --> 17:53.072
ISRAELI GOVERNMENT HAS AGREED IN

17:53.072 --> 17:54.106
PRINCIPLE TO SELL THE

17:54.106 --> 17:56.876
PALESTINIANS 20 MILLION TO 30

17:56.876 --> 17:57.843
MILLION CUBIC METERS OF ITS

17:57.843 --> 18:00.079
DESALINATED WATER, ENOUGH TO

18:00.079 --> 18:01.380
SUPPLY DRINKING WATER TO THE

18:01.380 --> 18:02.682
WEST BANK FOR ABOUT EIGHT

18:02.682 --> 18:04.283
MONTHS.

18:04.283 --> 18:05.618
WATER OFFICIALS FROM BOTH SIDES

18:05.618 --> 18:06.786
SAY THEY ARE EAGER TO WORK

18:06.786 --> 18:07.553
TOGETHER.

18:07.553 --> 18:08.788
THE HEAD OF THE ISRAELI WATER

18:08.788 --> 18:09.855
AUTHORITY'S DESALINATION

18:14.160 --> 18:15.161
DO SPEAK TOGETHER.

18:15.161 --> 18:16.829
WE DON'T WAIT TO HAVE COMMITTEES

18:16.829 --> 18:17.863
TO MEET TOGETHER.

18:17.863 --> 18:20.733
WE MEET MANY TIMES, EVEN DURING

18:20.733 --> 18:23.970
ALL KINDS OF WARS, ALL KINDS OF

18:23.970 --> 18:25.905
CONFLICTS THAT WE HAVE WITH

18:25.905 --> 18:27.073
THEM.

18:27.073 --> 18:28.441
WATER PEOPLE ARE TALKING ALL THE

18:28.441 --> 18:30.242
TIME, MEETING ALL THE TIME AND

18:30.242 --> 18:31.410
SHARING INFORMATION ALL THE

18:31.410 --> 18:32.378
TIME.

18:32.378 --> 18:33.179

18:33.179 --> 18:35.181
MINISTER MAZEN GHONEIM:

18:35.181 --> 18:38.551
>> WE HAVE NOTHING AGAINST THE

18:38.551 --> 18:39.752
ISRAELI SIDE.

18:39.752 --> 18:42.288
WHAT WE WANT, EXACTLY, JUST TO

18:42.288 --> 18:45.257
HELP OUR PEOPLE.

18:45.524 --> 18:46.359
>> Reporter: TODAY, ISRAEL'S

18:46.359 --> 18:48.227
CHALLENGE IS TO DO ALL IT CAN TO

18:48.227 --> 18:50.329
SECURE ITS WATER INDEPENDENCE

18:50.329 --> 18:52.198
AND TO USE THAT INDEPENDENCE TO

18:52.198 --> 18:53.566
BUILD BRIDGES WITH ITS

18:53.566 --> 18:55.301
NEIGHBORS.

18:56.202 --> 18:57.203
>> Stewart: KEEPING ISRAEL'S

18:57.203 --> 18:58.504
SUCCESSFUL PLAN IN MIND, WE

18:58.504 --> 19:00.639
WONDERED IF OR HOW ISRAEL'S

19:00.639 --> 19:02.875
WATER TECHNOLOGY, ESPECIALLY ITS

19:02.875 --> 19:04.610
USE OF DESALINATION, COULD BE

19:04.610 --> 19:05.945
PUT TO USE IN DROUGHT-STRICKEN

19:05.945 --> 19:07.279
CALIFORNIA.

19:07.279 --> 19:08.748
FOR MORE ABOUT THAT NOW, WE ARE

19:08.748 --> 19:10.449
JOINED FROM SAN FRANCISCO BY

19:10.449 --> 19:11.250
DANIEL POTTER.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.519
HE IS A REPORTER FOR KQED

19:13.519 --> 19:14.553
SCIENCE.

19:14.553 --> 19:15.454
SO, DANIEL, IT'S SORT OF

19:15.454 --> 19:15.955
OBVIOUS.

19:15.955 --> 19:17.223
PEOPLE LOOK AND THINK, WELL,

19:17.223 --> 19:18.357
CALIFORNIA'S OBVIOUSLY RIGHT

19:18.357 --> 19:19.959
NEXT TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN.

19:19.959 --> 19:22.028
WHY ISN'T DESALINATION A

19:22.028 --> 19:23.396
BIGGER PART OF CONVERSATION

19:23.396 --> 19:24.397
ABOUT THE DROUGHT?

19:24.397 --> 19:26.065
WHY ISN'T IT?

19:26.065 --> 19:26.932
>> I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER IS

19:26.932 --> 19:28.968
BECAUSE DESALINATION IS A

19:28.968 --> 19:29.969
REALLY... SETTING UP A

19:29.969 --> 19:31.437
DESALINATION PLANT IS A VERY

19:31.437 --> 19:32.638
LONG-TERM PROCESS.

19:32.638 --> 19:34.473
IT REQUIRES A LOT OF PERMITTING

19:34.473 --> 19:36.075
AND A HUGE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT.

19:36.075 --> 19:38.044
SO, SETTING UP A DESALINATION

19:38.044 --> 19:39.412
PLANT, A LOT OF PEOPLE I HAVE

19:39.412 --> 19:40.880
TALKED TO HAVE SAID THERE IS A

19:40.880 --> 19:43.049
GOOD CHANCE THAT PLANT WOULD NOT

19:43.049 --> 19:44.417
BE FINISHED UNTIL LONG AFTER THE

19:44.417 --> 19:45.518
DROUGHT ENDED.

19:45.518 --> 19:46.819
>> Stewart: ARE THERE

19:46.819 --> 19:48.587
DESALINATION PLANT WORKING, IN

19:48.587 --> 19:50.256
PROGRESS IN CALIFORNIA?

19:50.256 --> 19:51.057
I KNOW THERE ARE A COUPLE THAT

19:51.057 --> 19:52.925
ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING

19:52.925 --> 19:54.527
CONSTRUCTED, CORRECT?

19:54.527 --> 19:55.261
>> Reporter: THERE ARE A FEW

19:55.261 --> 19:57.329
TINY ONES THAT ALREADY EXIST AND

19:57.329 --> 19:59.698
THAT ARE DESALINATING PRESENTLY.

19:59.698 --> 20:02.001
THE BIGGEST ONE IS IN CARLSBAD.

20:02.001 --> 20:03.836
IT'S SET TO COME ONLINE

20:03.836 --> 20:06.272
PROBABLY THIS FALL, AND WHEN

20:06.272 --> 20:07.339
IT'S READY IT WILL PRODUCE

20:07.339 --> 20:09.308
SOMETHING LIKE 7% OF THE WATER

20:09.308 --> 20:10.476
FOR SAN DIEGO COUNTY.

20:10.476 --> 20:12.378
THAT PROJECT IS ON THE ORDER OF

20:12.378 --> 20:13.979
SOMETHING LIKE $900 MILLION OR

20:13.979 --> 20:15.581
MAYBE $1 BILLION.

20:15.581 --> 20:16.615
>> Stewart: SO, IS THERE SOME

20:16.615 --> 20:19.418
SORT OF SUBTEXT HERE ABOUT THE

20:19.418 --> 20:21.187
PRIVATIZATION OF WATER?

20:21.187 --> 20:22.021
>> Reporter: I THINK THAT'S A

20:22.021 --> 20:23.322
FRAUGHT TOPIC, ESPECIALLY IN

20:23.322 --> 20:25.458
CALIFORNIA, BECAUSE THE HISTORY

20:25.458 --> 20:27.626
OF WATER POLICY HERE IS SO

20:27.626 --> 20:29.762
COMPLEX AND SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE

20:29.762 --> 20:31.530
DIFFERENT AND COMPETING SOURCES

20:31.530 --> 20:32.298
OF WATER.

20:32.298 --> 20:34.066
YOU HAVE A FARMER IN ONE PLACE

20:34.066 --> 20:36.035
WHO HAS TO LET HIS CROPS DIE,

20:36.035 --> 20:37.236
AND A FARMER IN ANOTHER PLACE

20:37.236 --> 20:38.437
WHO IS PLANTING ALMONDS WHICH

20:38.437 --> 20:39.972
ARE A VERY WATER-INTENSIVE CROP,

20:39.972 --> 20:41.407
BECAUSE ONE GUY HAS ACCESS TO

20:41.407 --> 20:43.275
WATER AND ANOTHER ONE DOESN'T.

20:43.275 --> 20:45.544
ONE PLACE CAN PAY MAYBE TEN

20:45.544 --> 20:46.879
BUCKS AN ACRE FOOT, WHICH IS

20:46.879 --> 20:47.847
ABOUT A THIRD OF A MILLION

20:47.847 --> 20:49.381
GALLONS OF WATER.

20:49.381 --> 20:50.883
ANOTHER PLACE IN SOUTHERN

20:50.883 --> 20:52.618
CALIFORNIA, PEOPLE PAY HUNDREDS

20:52.618 --> 20:54.253
OF DOLLARS PER ACRE FOOT.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.454
>> Stewart: WHAT IS THE

20:55.454 --> 20:56.589
POLITICAL CLIMATE AROUND

20:56.589 --> 20:57.490
DESALINATION?

20:57.490 --> 20:59.258
>> THERE'S A TENSION THERE.

20:59.258 --> 21:02.161
I THINK FOR COMPANIES THAT SEE

21:02.161 --> 21:03.796
DESALINATION AS AN INVESTMENT

21:03.796 --> 21:06.065
OPPORTUNITY, THERE'S A LOT OF

21:06.065 --> 21:08.801
POTENTIAL, AND THEY SEE IT AS A

21:08.801 --> 21:10.136
BIG GROWTH AREA.

21:10.136 --> 21:12.304
OTHER PARTS OF CALIFORNIA...

21:12.304 --> 21:13.372
CALIFORNIA, OBVIOUSLY, HAS A

21:13.372 --> 21:14.340
VERY STRONG ENVIRONMENTAL

21:14.340 --> 21:16.108
CULTURE, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

21:16.108 --> 21:17.042
SKEPTICAL OF IT.

21:17.042 --> 21:20.079
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY WHY TURN TO

21:20.079 --> 21:20.913
DESALINATION?

21:20.913 --> 21:22.314
IT'S ALMOST AN EXTREME RESPONSE

21:22.314 --> 21:24.617
COMPARED TO CONSERVATION,

21:24.617 --> 21:26.652
COMPARED TO RECLAIMED WATER.

21:26.652 --> 21:27.386
>> Stewart: AND THE

21:27.386 --> 21:29.855
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE IS THE EXTRA

21:29.855 --> 21:31.056
SALT THAT COMES OUT OF THE

21:31.056 --> 21:32.158
WATER, WHAT HAPPENS TO IT WHEN

21:32.158 --> 21:33.292
YOU PUT BACK IN THE OCEAN?

21:33.292 --> 21:34.527
IS THAT RIGHT?

21:34.527 --> 21:35.294
>> Reporter: THAT'S ONE BIG

21:35.294 --> 21:36.061
FACTOR, YES.

21:36.061 --> 21:37.429
THERE'S A LOT OF LEFTOVER SALT

21:37.429 --> 21:38.998
THAT IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL, IF

21:38.998 --> 21:40.833
IT'S DUMPED BACK IN ALL AT ONCE,

21:40.833 --> 21:42.902
IT'S MUCH DENSER THAN SEA WATER

21:42.902 --> 21:44.803
SO IT SINKS AND CAN HURT SEA

21:44.803 --> 21:47.606
LIFE ON THE BOTTOM WHEREVER IT'S

21:47.606 --> 21:48.040
DUMPED.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.576
IT TAKES A LOT OF ENERGY TO RUN

21:50.576 --> 21:52.178
A DESAL PLANT AND SO PEOPLE

21:52.178 --> 21:53.379
GROUSE ABOUT THE CARBON

21:53.379 --> 21:54.580
FOOTPRINT, AS WELL.

21:54.580 --> 21:55.681
>> Stewart: DANIEL POTTER FROM

21:55.681 --> 21:57.183
KQED, THANKS FOR SHARING YOUR

21:57.183 --> 21:58.117
REPORTING.

21:58.117 --> 21:59.752

22:00.853 --> 22:02.087
>> Stewart: WANT TO KNOW MORE

22:33.352 --> 22:34.687
MUSEUM IS ATTRACTING A SET OF

22:34.687 --> 22:36.355
PATRONS WHO ARE ABLE TO

22:36.355 --> 22:37.523
EXPERIENCE THE ARTWORK IN A

22:37.523 --> 22:39.992
DIFFERENT WAY, BY TOUCHING IT.

22:39.992 --> 22:44.964
56-YEAR-OLD JOSÉ PEDRO GONZÁLEZ

22:44.964 --> 22:47.266
LOST HIS SIGHT AT AGE 14 DUE TO

22:47.266 --> 22:48.867
A DETACHED RETINA.

22:48.867 --> 22:50.803
TODAY, HE'S AT THE PRADO MUSEUM,

22:50.803 --> 22:52.371
RUNNING HIS HANDS ALONG EL

22:52.371 --> 22:54.073
GRECO'S "NOBLEMAN."

22:54.073 --> 22:55.374
IT'S ONE OF SIX REPRODUCED

22:55.374 --> 22:56.842
PAINTINGS IN THE EXHIBITION

22:56.842 --> 23:00.312
CALLED "TOUCHING THE PRADO."

23:00.312 --> 23:01.747
>> (translated): SUDDENLY, I

23:01.747 --> 23:02.881
SAW THE RUFFS.

23:02.881 --> 23:03.882
THEY GO ALL THE WAY UP TO HIS

23:03.882 --> 23:04.883
EARS.

23:04.883 --> 23:05.651
I SAW THEM.

23:05.651 --> 23:07.186
AND WHAT ELSE DID I NOTICE?

23:07.186 --> 23:09.221
WELL, HOW THE PAINTING IS DONE.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.256
LOOK, THIS HAS A DIFFERENT

23:10.256 --> 23:12.291
TEXTURE THAN THIS.

23:12.291 --> 23:13.125
>> Stewart: GONZÁLEZ REPRESENTS

23:13.125 --> 23:15.027
LA ONCE, SPAIN'S NATIONAL

23:15.027 --> 23:16.795
ASSOCIATION FOR THE BLIND.

23:16.795 --> 23:18.230
IT'S ONE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS

23:18.230 --> 23:19.531
THAT HELPED BRING THIS

23:19.531 --> 23:21.767
EXHIBITION TO THE MUSEUM.

23:21.767 --> 23:22.901
>> (translated): I HAVE NEVER

23:22.901 --> 23:24.169
BEEN GIVEN THE CHANCE TO TOUCH A

23:24.169 --> 23:25.738
PAINTING IN A MUSEUM, NOT EVEN

23:25.738 --> 23:27.573
IN A SMALLER VERSION OF IT.

23:27.573 --> 23:29.174
SO, FOR ME, THIS IS A UNIQUE

23:29.174 --> 23:31.076
EXPERIENCE.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.011
>> Stewart: THE TACTILE COPIES

23:35.981 --> 23:38.450
IN SPAIN BY DURERO STUDIOS.

23:38.450 --> 23:40.486
DIDÚ WAS FIRST USED IN A 2010

23:42.454 --> 23:44.156

23:44.156 --> 23:45.591
DUE TO ILLNESS.

23:45.591 --> 23:47.192
THE PROCESS USES SPECIAL INKS

23:47.192 --> 23:49.295
AND ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT TO RAISE

23:49.295 --> 23:51.096
PARTS OF THE IMAGES, ALLOWING

23:51.096 --> 23:53.065
THE WORKS TO BE VISUALIZED.

23:53.065 --> 23:54.900
THE PRADO PAID A LITTLE MORE

23:54.900 --> 23:57.770

24:00.272 --> 24:01.440
