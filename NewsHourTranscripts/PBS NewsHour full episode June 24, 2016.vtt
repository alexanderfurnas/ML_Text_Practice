JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.575 --> 00:12.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NIGEL FARAGE, European
Parliament Member:
The sun has risen on an
independent United

00:12.379 --> 00:14.214 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Kingdom.

00:14.248 --> 00:18.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A vote that's
rocked the world.
We're in London to hear what
drove Britain

00:18.218 --> 00:20.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to leave the European Union.

00:20.387 --> 00:25.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The desire to
leave was expressed
most strongly in the
working-class neighborhoods

00:25.325 --> 00:29.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we visited, where residents
felt beaten
down by globalization.

00:29.196 --> 00:34.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Financial markets
plunge in
reaction -- what Brexit means
for the global

00:34.835 --> 00:36.603 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
economy.

00:36.637 --> 00:42.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's Friday. Mark Shields
and David Brooks
analyze what Britain's split may
say about

00:42.142 --> 00:44.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the mood of American voters.

00:44.511 --> 00:51.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:51.184 --> 00:53.921 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:53.954 --> 01:04.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The British
people have spoken,
and, in voting to leave the
European Union,

01:04.064 --> 01:06.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have sent shockwaves around the
world.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant begins
our coverage in London.

01:09.970 --> 01:13.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: The U.K. has voted to
leave the European
Union.

01:13.473 --> 01:20.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The official
word came just
after 7:00 in the morning, U.K.
time.

01:20.480 --> 01:27.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rapturous cheers went up at
leave parties.
The final tally, 52 percent,
more than 17

01:27.654 --> 01:31.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
million people, opted to leave
the 28-member
European Union.

01:31.758 --> 01:36.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AILEEN QUINTAN, Leave Supporter:
We have actually
shown that opposition to the
E.U. isn't a

01:36.596 --> 01:38.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
small fringe -- fringe minority.

01:38.332 --> 01:41.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: For the 48
percent who voted
to stay, the result was
devastating.

01:41.601 --> 01:47.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I think it's going to lead
to great political,
economic, business uncertainty.

01:47.774 --> 01:52.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The political
fallout was
instant. Prime Minister David
Cameron, who

01:52.913 --> 01:56.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
led the campaign to remain,
announced that
he will step down by October.

01:56.249 --> 02:00.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CAMERON, British Prime
Minister: I will
do everything I can as prime
minister to steady

02:00.087 --> 02:05.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the ship over the coming weeks
and months,
but I do not think it would be
right for me

02:05.192 --> 02:10.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to try to be the captain that
steers our country
to its next destination.

02:10.063 --> 02:16.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Cameron
promised the referendum
in 2013, in part to appease E.U.
skeptics

02:16.703 --> 02:18.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in his own conservative party.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.440 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: We got our country back.

02:20.474 --> 02:26.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: U.K.
Independence Party,
deeply anti-E.U., was elated in
victory. Its

02:26.513 --> 02:31.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leader, Nigel Farage, used an
anti-immigration
campaign to rally support.

02:31.251 --> 02:34.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NIGEL FARAGE, European
Parliament Member:
The E.U. is failing, the E.U. is
dying. I

02:34.121 --> 02:39.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hope we have knocked the first
brick out of
the wall. It's a victory for
ordinary people,

02:39.259 --> 02:44.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decent people. It's a victory
against the
big merchant banks, against the
big businesses

02:44.564 --> 02:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and against big politics.

02:46.299 --> 02:50.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: From Brussels,
there was
a clear message that Britain
should leave

02:50.037 --> 02:55.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as soon as possible, and
shouldn't be given
any special treatment in order
to discourage

02:55.208 --> 02:57.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other nations from following
suit.

02:57.144 --> 02:58.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER, President,
European Commission
(through translator):
Personally, I'm very

02:58.912 --> 03:07.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sad about this decision, but, of
course, we
have to respect it. We will
stand strong and

03:07.087 --> 03:13.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
uphold the European Union's core
values of
promoting peace and the
well-being of its

03:13.460 --> 03:18.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people'. The union of 27 member
states will
continue.

03:18.832 --> 03:23.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: From German
Chancellor Angela
Merkel, there were questions
about what comes

03:23.804 --> 03:25.505 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
next.

03:25.539 --> 03:28.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA MERKEL, German Chancellor
(through
translator): We don't know about
the consequences

03:29.009 --> 03:33.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this step that will appear
within the next
days, weeks, months, and years.
That will

03:33.847 --> 03:39.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
depend upon how we, the other 27
members,
are able and willing to react.
There is no

03:39.519 --> 03:44.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quick key solution that we can
take from this
referendum decision. That would
only divide

03:44.057 --> 03:45.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Europe even more.

03:45.859 --> 03:52.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: So, what is the
mechanism
for separation? Britain is
required to invoke

03:52.365 --> 03:58.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the E.U.'s Article 50, which
gives London
two years to negotiate
withdrawal. That includes

03:58.538 --> 04:05.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fate of existing trade
deals, and travel
and work within the E.U. for
British citizens.

04:05.145 --> 04:11.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A majority of the 27 other
member states must
approve the deal. All the
uncertainty sent

04:11.184 --> 04:16.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
global markets from Tokyo to New
York into
freefall. And the British pound
plummeted

04:16.523 --> 04:22.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to its lowest point in over 30
years. The
economic fallout could be a sign
of things

04:22.229 --> 04:27.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to come, and those people who
voted to stay
in the European Union are
pointing to say

04:27.834 --> 04:29.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that they were right.

04:29.636 --> 04:34.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's done little to change
the convictions
of voters in the majority. Most
of London

04:34.274 --> 04:39.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voted to remain, but take a
journey to the
East End, and you meet poor
white working-class

04:39.446 --> 04:41.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Londoners who voted to leave.

04:41.848 --> 04:46.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They feel overwhelmed by
immigration, blaming
the newcomers for driving down
wages and taking

04:46.953 --> 04:48.455 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their jobs.

04:48.488 --> 04:50.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Brian Hughes is one of those
people.

04:50.190 --> 04:52.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRIAN HUGHES, Driver: I think
it's due to
all the immigrants coming in the
country,

04:52.926 --> 04:58.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because they're getting cheaper
labor in,
basically. I have been a driver
for 27 years,

04:58.131 --> 05:02.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I decided that I can't do
the job anymore,
even though there's nothing
wrong with me.

05:02.636 --> 05:06.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Novelist Dreda
Say Mitchell
believes that metropolitan
London has lost

05:06.940 --> 05:08.742 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
touch.

05:08.775 --> 05:11.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DREDA SAY MITCHELL, Author: I
think we have
been living in a bubble, where
we have been

05:11.745 --> 05:17.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thinking that our experiences
within London
have been the same experiences
that most people

05:17.617 --> 05:20.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
outside of London have been
having, and it's
not been true.

05:20.654 --> 05:24.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: To the north,
in Edinburgh,
Scotland, where the remain vote
won, talk

05:24.858 --> 05:28.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the streets was of a second
chance at independence
from Britain.

05:28.695 --> 05:35.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: This will trigger a vote
for independence
in Scotland. And I think it's
one -- the same,

05:35.335 --> 05:37.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one that I would think very
differently about.

05:37.137 --> 05:41.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Scottish First
Minister Nicola
Sturgeon said that second vote
was highly

05:41.508 --> 05:43.243 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
likely.

05:43.276 --> 05:45.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLA STURGEON, Scottish First
Minister:
Scotland faces the prospect of
being taken

05:45.612 --> 05:51.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of the E.U. against her
will. I regard
that as democratically
unacceptable.

05:51.885 --> 05:56.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Leaders in
Northern Ireland
made a similar call, saying
there should be

05:56.356 --> 05:59.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a vote to unite with the Irish
Republic.

05:59.125 --> 06:05.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: For us to be dragged out of
European
Union against our will is
absolutely unacceptable.

06:05.098 --> 06:09.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: All signs of
the seismic
change that has happened, and
may yet take

06:09.502 --> 06:13.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
place in the future, all as a
result of yesterday's
vote -- Judy.

06:13.273 --> 06:17.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Malcolm, I know
you talked
to a lot of people today out on
the streets.

06:17.744 --> 06:19.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What else did you hear from
them?

06:19.579 --> 06:23.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Well, it's -- I
think London
really is completely devastated
today, because

06:23.950 --> 06:28.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it is a city that in the main
voted to remain
in the E.U.

06:28.822 --> 06:32.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think the kind of
professional classes
are very sort of stunned by what
has happened.

06:32.859 --> 06:38.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They went to bed believing that
they were
going to be in the European
Union and woke

06:38.565 --> 06:44.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up to find out that they were in
a small little
island off the west coast of the
European

06:44.771 --> 06:46.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Union, and I think that's really
stunned them.

06:46.506 --> 06:50.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Boris Johnson today when he came
out of his
house, he was booed roundly by
people who

06:50.477 --> 06:54.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had gathered outside. There has
just been
a demonstration outside
Parliament of cyclists

06:54.447 --> 06:56.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who were cursing Boris as they
went past.

06:56.883 --> 07:02.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I was down in East London
today and talked
to some people who were quite
happy about

07:02.956 --> 07:08.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this, but these were mainly sort
of white
people in an area that really
has been overwhelmed,

07:08.662 --> 07:12.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they would say, by immigrants.
And I talked
to a taxi driver, for example,
who said that

07:12.832 --> 07:18.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he voted for nostalgia. He
wanted it to go
back to the way it was before,
which to many

07:18.038 --> 07:21.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people would seem as not being a
very forward
way of thinking.

07:21.074 --> 07:26.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Malcolm,
just quickly,
what have you learned about who
-- how people

07:26.279 --> 07:30.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
voted on each side by age, by
income?

07:30.150 --> 07:36.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Well, the most
staggering
fact of all, I think, is the age
difference

07:36.122 --> 07:40.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between those who voted to
remain and those
who voted to get out.

07:40.727 --> 07:44.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the young people, more than
anybody else,
they wanted to stay in, because
it was their

07:44.798 --> 07:50.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
future that they were voting
for. But it was
older people who decided that
they thought

07:50.303 --> 07:56.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was best for Britain to go
out. And also
the same is true of the wealth
and also education

07:56.710 --> 07:58.545 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
gap.

07:58.578 --> 08:03.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More wealthy, richer people,
better-educated
people, they voted to stay
within the European

08:03.450 --> 08:09.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Union. And those who are lower
down the socioeconomic
classes, they voted to get out.
And the key

08:09.856 --> 08:14.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of vote in all of this was
immigration.
And the people who wanted to
stay in thought

08:14.494 --> 08:18.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that immigration was a very good
thing, but
those who wanted to stay out
thought that

08:18.098 --> 08:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immigration was something that
really had
to change.

08:20.567 --> 08:23.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are the main democratic
points of this
referendum.

08:23.236 --> 08:26.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I know
we're only beginning
to see the repercussions. And,
Malcolm, I

08:26.673 --> 08:30.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know you are going to continue
to report for
us. Thank you.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Thank you,
Judy.

08:31.878 --> 08:36.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We take a closer
look now at
what drove those voters with Sir
Michael Leigh,

08:36.750 --> 08:42.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a former senior official with
the European
Union's executive arm, the
European Commission.

08:42.422 --> 08:47.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's now a consultant to the
German Marshall
Fund. And Tim Montgomerie is a
conservative

08:47.260 --> 08:50.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
columnist for The Times of
London.

08:50.096 --> 08:52.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tim Montgomerie, to you first.
What was your
reaction?

08:54.801 --> 08:57.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM MONTGOMERIE, The Times of
London: Surprise,
first of all.

08:57.504 --> 09:04.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think few people expected that
Brexit would
actually prevail. And it was a
close result,

09:04.711 --> 09:10.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just under 4 percent, but a
decisive result.
And I think what has been
impressive during

09:10.350 --> 09:16.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the course of the day is the
number of M.P.s
who had campaigned for Britain
to remain in

09:16.823 --> 09:21.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the European Union saying, the
British people
have spoken and they will
respect the result.

09:21.861 --> 09:23.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sir Michael
Leigh, what about
you?

09:23.663 --> 09:28.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIR MICHAEL LEIGH, Former
European Union Official:
My main reaction was one of deep
sadness.

09:28.168 --> 09:33.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Part of it is personal, I
acknowledge. I worked
for three decades in the
European institutions.

09:33.273 --> 09:39.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And during that period, I
believe the European
Union was a major peace project
for Europe.

09:39.813 --> 09:44.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Britain had a decisive influence
on the way
the E.U. developed. I saw
Britain influencing

09:44.784 --> 09:47.187 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the single market, enlargement.

09:47.220 --> 09:53.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the E.U., I really felt was
an institution,
a set of institutions that
worked in the interest

09:54.027 --> 09:59.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the U.K. and of Europe. And,
therefore,
I was deeply saddened by this
result.

09:59.065 --> 10:03.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tim Montgomerie,
what do you
believe was driving the vote
result here?

10:03.369 --> 10:09.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM MONTGOMERIE: I think what
Sir Michael
says about the European
project's past contribution

10:09.776 --> 10:16.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is correct, as the European
nations traded
with each other, and they found
themselves

10:16.916 --> 10:18.885 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
together.

10:18.918 --> 10:23.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the war that has
characterized the continent
in the past was put to an end.
But that European

10:23.857 --> 10:28.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
project died. It became much
more ambitious.
It decided to abolish national
currencies

10:28.728 --> 10:35.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and wanted to abolish national
borders. And
with the Eurozone crisis and the
huge unemployment

10:35.635 --> 10:43.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and austerity it created, the
sense that the
passport-free zone, Schengen
zone, was ideal

10:43.643 --> 10:48.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for terrorist activity, I think
the British
people decided that the European
Union was

10:48.615 --> 10:50.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
no longer working.

10:50.416 --> 10:55.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As 28 member states, it was a
dysfunctional
organization that couldn't take
decisions.

10:55.421 --> 11:01.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the major cause for the
Brexit vote was
a freedom of movement regime,
which meant

11:01.561 --> 11:06.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Britain didn't know from
one year to
the next how many immigrants
would be entering

11:06.232 --> 11:11.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the economy and it meant an
inability to plan
for public services like schools
and hospitals.

11:11.504 --> 11:15.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sir Michael, is
that how you
see what went into people's
thinking?

11:15.308 --> 11:20.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIR MICHAEL LEIGH: The issues
that Tim mentioned
are in fact quite pertinent. And
he's right

11:20.747 --> 11:23.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the E.U. faces many real
challenges.

11:23.816 --> 11:29.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I only wish that the campaign,
particularly
on the leave side, had focused
on these issues.

11:29.656 --> 11:37.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Instead, it focused
single-mindedly on people's
fears of immigration, even in
areas with virtually

11:37.363 --> 11:43.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
no immigrants, and it
concentrated on backward-looking
arguments related to
sovereignty, which have

11:44.003 --> 11:47.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
little real meaning in this
globalized world.

11:47.473 --> 11:52.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I feel the decision wasn't
taken after
a serious debate of the pros and
cons, but

11:52.845 --> 11:57.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rather than emotional argument
that looked
backwards, rather than forwards.
It looked

11:57.216 --> 12:01.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
backwards to an imagined past, a
golden age
that will not come again.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're describing
a misleading
campaign?

12:04.490 --> 12:07.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SIR MICHAEL LEIGH: I would say
it was seriously
misleading.

12:07.727 --> 12:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the main leaders of the
leave campaign,
Nigel Farage, had acknowledged
today one of

12:13.766 --> 12:24.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his main arguments, that the
E.U. was costing
the U.K. 380 million pounds, and
that this

12:24.043 --> 12:30.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
money could be redeployed and
spent for the
National Health Service, was a
mistake.

12:30.817 --> 12:35.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was also argued, for example,
that Turkey
was about to join the European
Union, and

12:35.154 --> 12:41.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we would be flooded with Turkish
immigrants.
Everyone knows Turkey will join
in a decade,

12:41.227 --> 12:42.996 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
if ever.

12:43.029 --> 12:48.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And other such arguments that
played more
on fears than on the legitimate
issues that

12:48.301 --> 12:52.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tim raised, where there should
have been a
proper debate on the relative
merits.

12:52.438 --> 12:56.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tim Montgomerie,
was it a misleading
campaign then after all?

12:56.476 --> 13:01.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM MONTGOMERIE: I think some of
the criticisms
Sir Michael makes of the leave
campaign are

13:01.914 --> 13:03.650 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fair.

13:03.683 --> 13:07.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's also the case,
however, that
the remain campaign didn't ever
really try

13:07.587 --> 13:14.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to sell a positive view of the
European Union.
It was also based on scares. The
prime minister

13:14.460 --> 13:19.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said that leaving the European
Union would
put a bomb under the British
economy. There

13:19.399 --> 13:22.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was even hints that it might
lead to a world
war.

13:22.669 --> 13:28.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the British people felt that
was insulting
to their country. The British
people are a

13:28.775 --> 13:33.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
proud people. And I think it was
also the
case that when President Obama
came to London

13:34.013 --> 13:38.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and said to the British people
that, if they
didn't stay in the European
Union, they would

13:38.584 --> 13:44.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go to the back of the queue, the
back of the
line in terms of trade
negotiations with America,

13:44.590 --> 13:50.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you are rude and insulting to
a people,
which I think David Cameron and
President

13:50.697 --> 13:55.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama could both be accused of
being guilty
of, people fight back.

13:55.802 --> 14:00.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't think the American
people would
accept what the British people
have to accept

14:00.440 --> 14:05.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as members of the European
Union, a right,
for example, if it was in the
American situation,

14:05.945 --> 14:12.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Mexicans and Canadians to be
able to work
and live in America freely
without restriction,

14:12.552 --> 14:20.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or for a supreme court in Ottawa
or Mexico
to rule over the U.S. Supreme
Court.

14:20.293 --> 14:24.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the British people
weren't willing
to put up with that anymore
either.

14:24.297 --> 14:28.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to get
your response
and I want to ask both of you if
you see this

14:28.434 --> 14:31.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
result as permanent, as a result
that will
stand.

14:31.537 --> 14:36.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIR MICHAEL LEIGH: This pretty
strong language
concerning President Obama that
we have just

14:36.042 --> 14:41.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
heard sadly typified the leave
campaign and
is deeply to be regretted.

14:41.748 --> 14:46.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama came to Britain
as a friend
of the United Kingdom. And
friends do give

14:46.886 --> 14:50.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
advice to other friends. This is
something
that they do. If they think that
their friends

14:51.023 --> 14:56.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are about to take a misstep,
whether in public
or private life, they say so.
That's what

14:56.395 --> 14:58.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
friendship is all about.

14:58.598 --> 15:03.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But to come to your second
question, I do
think this decision is
irreversible. There

15:03.803 --> 15:08.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been a campaign. There has
been a referendum
based on universal suffrage. I
think there's

15:08.474 --> 15:09.809 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
no turning back.

15:09.842 --> 15:13.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tim Montgomerie,
is there a
turning back?

15:13.146 --> 15:17.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM MONTGOMERIE: I think that's
right. I hope
that's right. The British
people, against

15:17.049 --> 15:22.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the weight of advice of all of
the party leaders
in the British political system,
against IMF

15:22.922 --> 15:27.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and international institutions,
the president
of the United States and other
world leaders,

15:27.960 --> 15:33.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they ignored all of that because
they really
did feel that the European Union
was an insufferable

15:33.432 --> 15:36.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
organization to continue to
belong to.

15:36.402 --> 15:41.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The E.U. has a habit of ignoring
the referenda
decision of member states, but I
don't think

15:41.941 --> 15:44.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Britain will allow their vote to
be ignored.

15:44.911 --> 15:54.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tim Montgomerie,
Sir Michael
Leigh, we thank you both.

15:54.954 --> 16:01.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tim Montgomerie,
Sir Michael
Leigh, we thank you both.

16:01.460 --> 16:05.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now a look at the potential
economic ramifications
of Brexit.

16:05.598 --> 16:11.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many financial markets took an
outright beating
during a global sell-off today.
The Euro Stoxx

16:11.504 --> 16:18.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Index, a broad measure of stocks
in the Eurozone,
fell by almost 8 percent.
London's FTSE Exchange

16:18.678 --> 16:23.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lost 3 percent. And the Japanese
Nikkei dropped
by nearly 8 percent.

16:23.916 --> 16:28.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American markets took big hits
too. The Dow
Jones suffered its largest loss
of the year

16:28.888 --> 16:37.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and gave all of its gains for
2016. It was
down 611 points, or nearly 3.4
percent. The

16:37.230 --> 16:45.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nasdaq dropped 202 points, or 4
percent, and
the S&amp;P fell 76 points, or 3.6
percent.

16:45.805 --> 16:50.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has this part
of the story
from our New York studios.

16:50.076 --> 16:55.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Some analysts
suggest that
leaving the E.U. could plunge
the U.K. back

16:55.047 --> 17:01.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
into recession, and the
consequences could
potentially spread into the
wider global economy.

17:01.087 --> 17:06.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We look at the concerns here and
abroad with
two who watch this closely,
Diane Swonk, the

17:06.125 --> 17:10.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
founder of her own firm, DS
Economics, and
David Wessel, director of the
Hutchins Center

17:10.796 --> 17:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at
the Brookings
Institution and contributing
correspondent

17:14.433 --> 17:15.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for The Wall Street Journal.

17:15.668 --> 17:17.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Diane, I want to start with you.

17:17.470 --> 17:22.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The markets in the U.S. were
down 611 points.
The markets in Europe and Asia,
some of them

17:22.408 --> 17:27.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suffered even greater percentage
losses. What's
the core worry for the world
here? Why these

17:27.647 --> 17:29.348 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ripple effects?

17:29.382 --> 17:32.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DIANE SWONK, Founder, DS
Economics: Well,
the real worry is not only will
the U.K. perhaps

17:32.051 --> 17:36.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
slip into recession -- it's
about 2.5 percent
of the global economy -- but
that there could

17:36.689 --> 17:41.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be domino effects throughout the
European
Union, as other countries come
to the same

17:41.360 --> 17:44.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
verdict and want to opt out of
the European
Union.

17:44.297 --> 17:48.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remember, this is an area where
many companies
got a lot of efficiencies by the
fact that

17:48.501 --> 17:53.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there was free trade and people
could so easily
move between countries. Now that
those trade

17:54.006 --> 17:58.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- those barriers are going to
be much higher,
that will cost companies a lot
more money.

17:58.945 --> 18:03.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And also many companies will
have to move
their location out of London, to
perhaps Ireland,

18:03.516 --> 18:05.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Dublin, or Frankfurt.

18:05.384 --> 18:08.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's where the
concerns are
coming, is, what is the bottom
line for profits,

18:08.554 --> 18:13.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not only in terms of growth and
exports, but
also what is it going to mean in
terms of

18:13.059 --> 18:16.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
additional costs for those
companies as they
operate on a global basis?

18:16.796 --> 18:19.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: David, how
does this impact
companies doing business in the
U.S.?

18:19.799 --> 18:23.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL, The Wall Street
Journal: Well,
I think, generally, it means
that American

18:23.235 --> 18:27.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
companies will sell less stuff
abroad.

18:27.506 --> 18:32.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.K. is a very small part of
American
exports, but Europe as a whole
is about a

18:32.144 --> 18:37.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quarter of all U.S. exports.
That's a lot.
The less well their economy
does, the less

18:37.683 --> 18:42.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stuff they will buy from us.
That means fewer
sales, fewer profits and fewer
jobs here.

18:42.221 --> 18:46.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think the reason the
markets are reacting
goes beyond that. One is that
the value of

18:46.425 --> 18:50.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the dollar has gone up a lot.
And as people
freak out about what's going on
in Europe,

18:50.663 --> 18:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the dollar foreign exchange
value will go
higher. That means it will be
great for people

18:54.734 --> 18:59.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are going to vacation in
Europe, but that
makes it even worse for American
exporters.

18:59.872 --> 19:02.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It acts like a brake on the U.S.
economy.

19:02.274 --> 19:07.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Diane, outside
of today,
then, what are the impacts on
the U.S. companies?

19:07.146 --> 19:12.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANE SWONK: Well, I think, on
net, it is
a dampening effect on the U.S.
economy, not

19:12.084 --> 19:16.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enough for us to take down our
forecasts yet,
because of the uncertainty
surrounding it.

19:16.222 --> 19:19.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is the near term. As David
mentioned,
it's now cheaper to go to
Europe. It's also

19:19.592 --> 19:24.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be easier to get a --
refinance your
mortgage at a lower rate. And
the Fed is now

19:24.063 --> 19:28.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the sidelines to try to
support the economy.
All those are meant to cushion
the blow of

19:28.934 --> 19:33.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what David really accurately
pointed out,
that stronger dollar harder on
manufacturers,

19:33.639 --> 19:37.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
insult to injury to a part of
the economy
that's already been suffering a
lot.

19:37.977 --> 19:42.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so, on net, a minor
negative, but overall
the U.S. economy should be able
to weather

19:42.448 --> 19:46.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the storm coming from Europe.
The problem
is the uncertainty. And I think
that is what

19:46.218 --> 19:51.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're seeing roil markets is,
we just don't
know how far this could -- the
domino effect

19:51.257 --> 19:54.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could be beyond the initial U.K.
vote.

19:54.660 --> 19:59.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: David, there
is that old
adage buy on the rumor, sell on
the news.

19:59.532 --> 20:05.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Having the actual act happen
today, doesn't
that add some certainty, or as
Diane is saying,

20:05.404 --> 20:08.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we don't know exactly what the
next shoe is
and when it's going to drop?

20:08.741 --> 20:12.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: Well, I think the
markets were
a little surprised by the news.
That's why

20:12.445 --> 20:14.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there was such a big reaction.

20:14.980 --> 20:18.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There isn't much certainty,
other than Europe
is -- the U.K. is pulling out of
the European

20:18.684 --> 20:23.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Union. But I think there is a
broader thing
going on here. This is a bunch
of people in

20:23.155 --> 20:31.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a democracy voting to repudiate
trade, globalization,
immigration, all those things
that a lot of

20:31.464 --> 20:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people think have been important
in the growth
of the world economy.

20:34.400 --> 20:39.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the concern is that
this is a
symptom of a broader malaise.
It's true on

20:39.538 --> 20:44.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the continent of Europe and it's
also true
here in the United States. And
so people are

20:44.410 --> 20:49.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thinking is the whole approach
to world trade,
to globalization, grappling
together with

20:49.815 --> 20:54.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
global problems through these
institutions,
is that now all being called
into question?

20:54.520 --> 20:59.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Diane, how
much is this
a referendum on the free trade
policies that

20:59.325 --> 21:01.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the world has been pushing for
the last few
decades?

21:01.527 --> 21:04.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIANE SWONK: Well, I think David
is exactly
right about that.

21:04.230 --> 21:10.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This is a backlash to
globalization and to
really the post-World War II
era. They have

21:10.269 --> 21:15.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been in for 43 years, remember,
in the European
Union, the U.K. had. And I think
this really

21:15.274 --> 21:19.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a global situation, a global
backlash to
that.

21:19.278 --> 21:23.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what concerns me and what
concerns I think
financial markets as well is
that it's a backlash

21:23.616 --> 21:28.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to institutions and to all the
warnings as
well. There is a will break. And
it's going

21:28.220 --> 21:33.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- it is global in nature in
terms of the
socioeconomic, how the vote went
down, the

21:33.526 --> 21:36.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
younger people wanting to stay
in, more educated,
higher -- and wealthier people
wanting to

21:36.996 --> 21:41.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stay in the European Union,
similar things,
and seeing immigration as a
positive instead

21:41.967 --> 21:43.669 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of a negative.

21:43.702 --> 21:46.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Similar things are going on here
in the United
States. We're seeing the
backlash to free

21:46.172 --> 21:51.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
trade, the backlash to
immigration, the desire
to build walls, instead of open
borders. And

21:51.911 --> 21:57.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that really is a breakdown of
what we knew
as a post-World War II
prosperity. And I think

21:57.082 --> 21:58.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that should rattle markets.

21:59.018 --> 22:03.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a -- could be a paradigm
shift, if
it's not contained. And that's
where the uncertainty

22:04.023 --> 22:08.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, is, we don't know how far
it's going to
go because it isn't just one
country. It's

22:08.127 --> 22:11.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
many countries that are
experiencing the same
thing. And we just don't know
how far the

22:12.031 --> 22:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reaction function is going to
go.

22:13.899 --> 22:17.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: David, what
about the idea
of containment? Even if the Bank
of England

22:17.803 --> 22:23.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stands there today and says we
will do what
we have to, to prop up the
British pound,

22:23.042 --> 22:27.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what about these other countries
now that
are saying maybe this is our
license to walk

22:27.646 --> 22:28.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out of the E.U. ourselves?

22:28.981 --> 22:30.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: Right. I think
that's a big
issue.

22:30.983 --> 22:36.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, the central banks and the
finance ministries
will try and manage the shifting
markets,

22:36.355 --> 22:40.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the turmoil to make sure that we
don't have
some breakdown, some bank
failure or some

22:40.559 --> 22:42.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
disorderly trading.

22:42.895 --> 22:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that you're pointing
out this
is a symptom of a much bigger
thing. Will

22:47.366 --> 22:52.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Dutch think about leaving
the European
Union? Is this basically the end
of an era

22:52.938 --> 22:58.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of European integration? I think
it puts a
real pressure on global elites
in business

22:58.844 --> 23:03.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and academics, politicians who
believe in
globalization, who believe that
we have to

23:03.482 --> 23:09.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make international agreements to
solve global
problems, to find a way to
address the anger

23:09.188 --> 23:14.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of people who felt left out,
whose wages haven't
gone up, who, like, don't trust
the government

23:14.260 --> 23:15.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and the experts anymore.

23:16.028 --> 23:19.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Diane Swonk,
David Wessel, thanks so much for
joining us.

23:19.798 --> 23:24.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DIANE SWONK: Thank you.

23:24.937 --> 23:30.042 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: You're welcome.

23:30.075 --> 23:36.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As we heard
earlier, President
Obama, during a trip to the
United Kingdom

23:36.115 --> 23:40.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in April, said that it should
stay in the
European Union.

23:40.319 --> 23:45.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, from Stanford University
in California,
the president gave his appraisal
of yesterday's

23:45.291 --> 23:47.126 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
outcome.

23:47.159 --> 23:49.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
While the U.K.'s relationship
with E.U. will

23:49.295 --> 23:54.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change, one thing that will not
change is
the special relationship that
exists between

23:54.333 --> 23:57.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our two nations. That will
endure.

23:57.970 --> 24:02.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The E.U. will remain one of our
indispensable
partners. Our NATO alliance will
remain a

24:03.008 --> 24:08.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cornerstone of global security,
and in a few
weeks, we will be meeting in
Warsaw for the

24:08.781 --> 24:13.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATO summit. And our shared
values, including
our commitment to democracy and
pluralism

24:13.952 --> 24:19.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and opportunity for all people
in a globalized
world, that will continue to
unite all of

24:19.758 --> 24:21.493 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

24:21.527 --> 24:24.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president
spoke with David
Cameron by phone today, and,
according to

24:24.797 --> 24:29.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the White House, expressed
regret that his
-- quote -- "trusted partner and
friend" decided

24:29.935 --> 24:32.237 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to step aside as prime minister.

24:32.271 --> 24:37.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Obama also spoke with German
Chancellor
Angela Merkel. The two leaders
said they regretted

24:37.576 --> 24:42.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.K.'s decision to leave the
E.U., but
that they respected the will of
the British

24:42.781 --> 24:44.550 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

24:44.583 --> 24:49.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now there are serious questions
about how
this break may change the
current of global

24:49.288 --> 24:51.123 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
politics.

24:51.156 --> 24:55.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We explore what may lie ahead
with Ivo Daalder.
He's a former U.S. ambassador to
NATO. He's

24:55.928 --> 25:01.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now at the Chicago Council on
Global Affairs.
Richard Haass is a former State
Department

25:01.500 --> 25:08.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and top National Security
Council official.
He now runs the Council on
Foreign Relations.

25:08.273 --> 25:12.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And Margaret Warner, the
"NewsHour"'s chief
foreign affairs correspondent.

25:12.177 --> 25:14.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome to all three of you.

25:14.546 --> 25:16.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Richard Haass, I'm going to
start with you.

25:16.448 --> 25:22.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We just heard two guests say
that this could
be the end of an era in terms of
global economics.

25:22.121 --> 25:24.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What about in terms of the
politics of this
globe?

25:24.923 --> 25:28.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD HAASS, President,
Council on Foreign
Relations: Well, I think
historians will look

25:28.794 --> 25:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back on this, and this will be
something of
a defining or dividing line in
terms of the

25:33.899 --> 25:36.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
U.S.-U.K. relationship.

25:36.034 --> 25:40.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president can use the
rhetoric about it
being special, but the fact is,
it isn't very

25:40.839 --> 25:46.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
special anymore, and Britain
won't have the
capacity to be a real partner,
particularly,

25:46.211 --> 25:50.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as I think is likely, Scotland
ultimately
leaves and potentially even
Northern Ireland

25:50.616 --> 25:56.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leaves, so the United Kingdom
becomes the
disunited Kingdom.

25:56.221 --> 26:00.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's also very bad for what's
going on in
Europe. It's not just economic
integration,

26:00.125 --> 26:05.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but it's the entire European
project, and
now lots of other countries may
decide to

26:05.297 --> 26:08.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
find their own path to distance
themselves
from Europe.

26:08.834 --> 26:13.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's a big part of the
post-World War
II architecture. It's one of the
great accomplishments

26:13.639 --> 26:18.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of modern diplomacy, to make
Europe stable
and prosperous. So, I actually
think the last

26:18.710 --> 26:23.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
24 hours, whatever the voters
had in mind,
wanted message they wanted to
send to elites

26:23.982 --> 26:30.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and establishment, they set in
motion a dynamic
that will really detract from
prosperity and

26:30.889 --> 26:33.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stability, I think, in Europe
and conceivably
beyond.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ivo Daalder, how
do you see
the politicalo~ fallout?

26:35.994 --> 26:40.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
IVO DAALDER, Former U.S.
Ambassador to NATO:
Well, I think it is potentially
grave as Richard

26:40.365 --> 26:42.034 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is implying.

26:42.067 --> 26:47.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what we're seeing is not
only the
return of nationalism in the
United Kingdom,

26:47.339 --> 26:52.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and particularly in England, but
that nationalism
can spread throughout the
continent. And you

26:52.344 --> 26:58.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have already seen calls in the
Netherlands
for a referendum there, for a
Nexit. You have

26:58.150 --> 27:05.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seen the same in France for a
possible referendum
for France to leave the Union.

27:06.024 --> 27:10.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what you see is nations
turning inward,
becoming more nationalistic,
wanting to be

27:10.596 --> 27:16.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
self-reliant, breaking away from
the European
Union. And, as a result, you get
the kind

27:16.268 --> 27:22.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of re-nationalization of
European politics
that we saw in the '20s and the
'30s. And

27:22.774 --> 27:25.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we know what the consequences of
that was.

27:25.244 --> 27:30.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there is the very real
possibility of this
spreading to the continent with
more and more

27:30.849 --> 27:35.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
countries trying to leave the
union, trying
to turn inward, finding it
difficult to achieve

27:35.821 --> 27:38.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what they want to achieve, and
therefore turning
against each other.

27:38.757 --> 27:41.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, some of
this sounds fairly
dire.

27:41.193 --> 27:45.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Margaret, I know you have been
talking to
a number of U.S. officials
today. How do they

27:45.297 --> 27:46.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see the effect of all this
politically?

27:46.865 --> 27:50.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Very much the
way Richard
Haass and Ivo Daalder do.

27:50.335 --> 27:53.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, when he we heard what the
president
had to say, one official said to
me, well,

27:53.906 --> 28:01.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that was no drama Obama. But in
the weeks
leading up to this, as it got
close, intelligence,

28:01.079 --> 28:05.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
diplomatic and defense officials
all were
very -- were filled with dread
really about

28:06.018 --> 28:07.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the consequences of this.

28:07.853 --> 28:13.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, nothing will change in
terms of the
U.K. being a major partner. I
mean, this is

28:13.225 --> 28:18.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a country that we share language
and culture
and world view. But, as Richard
said, the

28:18.263 --> 28:24.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concern is that it will be a
less effective
partner, that is, that Prime
Minister Cameron

28:24.703 --> 28:31.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and whoever succeeds him will be
a distracted
partner, that they will be
potentially weaker

28:31.176 --> 28:35.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because there will be -- if
there's a breakup
in the British Isles, and also a
poorer partner,

28:35.981 --> 28:41.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as one official said to me, who
may not even
be able to make the 2 percent
threshold in

28:41.853 --> 28:43.622 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
NATO.

28:43.655 --> 28:47.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So -- and, finally, of course,
there's the
whole question about whether it
weakens U.S.

28:47.259 --> 28:51.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
diplomatic leverage in Europe.
Now, some people
feel that's been overstated. It
wasn't terribly

28:51.763 --> 28:56.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
effective to work through
Britain, say, to
get Germany last year to soften
the terms

28:56.435 --> 28:58.236 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for Greece.

28:58.270 --> 29:04.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, still, with Europe -- with
the U.K. having
a seat at the table, the U.S.
had at least

29:04.943 --> 29:07.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
eyes on the table, and that
won't be true
anymore.

29:07.179 --> 29:12.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Richard Haass,
how much at
this point depends on how this
is handled

29:12.084 --> 29:17.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by world leaders, whether it is
by the British
leadership, by people like
Chancellor Merkel,

29:17.990 --> 29:21.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama? How much could
that affect
what happens?

29:21.693 --> 29:24.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD HAASS: Not all that
much, I'm afraid,
Judy.

29:24.997 --> 29:28.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In terms of the British, they
have got really
limited discretion. It's very
hard for a prime

29:28.700 --> 29:33.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
minister, for Mr. Cameron's
successor, for
the Parliament to somehow ignore
the -- quote,

29:34.006 --> 29:37.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unquote -- "will or voice" of
the British
people.

29:37.876 --> 29:41.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, looking at it from the
other side,
I don't think Brussels is going
to necessarily

29:41.780 --> 29:47.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tell the British, well, never
mind, or somehow
set a precedent that then 27
other countries

29:47.452 --> 29:52.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
might say, OK, we can then
define our own
relationship. Let's have an a la
carte relationship

29:52.057 --> 29:56.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that lets us choose A, B, C, but
we will ignore
D and F.

29:56.495 --> 30:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I actually think, on both
sides, the hands
are relatively tied. And I know
this sounds

30:01.366 --> 30:05.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pessimistic. And there are
people who are
saying just maybe we can work
through this

30:05.170 --> 30:08.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and it wasn't that definitive,
but I actually
don't think so.

30:08.540 --> 30:12.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And even if there is
considerable voters'
remorse -- and I expect there
will be something

30:12.711 --> 30:17.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a collective hangover once
the reality
sinks in of the repercussions --
I still don't

30:17.616 --> 30:21.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think even the British side or
the European
side are going to have that much
discretion.

30:21.787 --> 30:26.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ivo Daalder, pick
up on that.
What do you see could determine
whether this

30:26.558 --> 30:33.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
goes in an even darker, or more
disturbing
direction? What could keep
things on track?

30:33.365 --> 30:37.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, who has the ability to
determine which
direction it goes?

30:37.803 --> 30:43.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IVO DAALDER: So, I agree that
there is not
much leverage or capacity in
Britain, certainly

30:43.709 --> 30:50.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with a lame-duck and now
defeated prime minister
still on the helm, and then a
victor coming

30:50.582 --> 30:53.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in who really doesn't know what
needs to be
done.

30:53.819 --> 31:00.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I don't necessarily agree
that there isn't
any leverage or room for
maneuver, particularly

31:00.058 --> 31:03.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Chancellor Merkel and with
the United
States.

31:03.695 --> 31:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stepping back, we have been at
this 70 years.
This is not just a European
project. It's

31:08.333 --> 31:14.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very much an American project,
and we have
been central for those 70 years
to cajole

31:14.506 --> 31:18.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Europeans at particular
times, when things
were going the wrong way, to do
the right

31:18.977 --> 31:20.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thing and work together.

31:20.746 --> 31:25.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our leverage isn't the same as
it was in the
'40s, and the '50s and the '60s,
but it's

31:25.550 --> 31:31.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still there. We're still a very
critical partner.
And I do believe that, if the
United States,

31:31.356 --> 31:37.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
particularly working together
with Chancellor
Merkel, were to make it very
clear that, yes,

31:37.763 --> 31:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we accept the results of the
voters, and,
yes, there will be a different
relationship

31:41.867 --> 31:47.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between the United Kingdom and
the European
Union, but we still want the
United Kingdom

31:47.272 --> 31:52.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be a fundamental, strong
European power,
and we want the Europeans and
the United Kingdom

31:53.011 --> 31:56.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the United States to work
closely together
-- we will do it in NATO.

31:56.414 --> 32:01.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will do it on an ad hoc basis
outside of
it, but we need to work this out
together

32:01.653 --> 32:06.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in order to maintain this -- the
essential
European project that was
started 70 years

32:06.324 --> 32:08.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ago. It's a defining moment for
American diplomacy.

32:08.960 --> 32:12.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Margaret, in
talking to
U.S. officials, do they
recognize that? Are

32:12.931 --> 32:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they prepared to move in that
direction?

32:14.599 --> 32:16.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Very much so,
Judy.

32:16.468 --> 32:23.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Ivo Daalder just said, the
American security
for 70 or 80 years has relied on
a strong,

32:23.542 --> 32:28.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prosperous, united Europe that
we spent billions,
trillions, I guess, through the
Marshall Plan

32:28.480 --> 32:33.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on forward, and diplomatic years
and decades
to help establish.

32:33.485 --> 32:38.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then you recall, after the
Soviet Union
collapsed, the way to get the
Central and

32:38.590 --> 32:43.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
East European countries as part
of this, with
all their ethnic conflicts and
everything,

32:43.962 --> 32:47.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
was the carrot of E.U.
membership. That was
the incentive.

32:47.599 --> 32:53.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So it's been very, very
important. What U.S.
officials are hoping, going back
to Richard

32:53.038 --> 32:58.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Haass' point, about buyer's
remorse, is that,
if the train can be slowed down
of a lot of

32:58.577 --> 33:04.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other countries clamoring to do
this, that
other Europeans will witness
what happens

33:04.749 --> 33:08.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Britain now, and it probably
won't be a
pretty sight in the medium term.

33:08.386 --> 33:11.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, there is
much more to
unfold.

33:11.790 --> 33:15.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we want to thank all three
of you for
taking a look with us tonight.

33:15.727 --> 33:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Margaret, Margaret Warner here,
Richard Haass,
Ivo Daalder, we thank you.

33:21.199 --> 33:30.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RICHARD HAASS: Thank you.

33:30.508 --> 33:38.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: A
bipartisan group of members of
Congress unveiled

33:38.984 --> 33:44.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a companion bill to the gun
control measure
put forward in the Senate by
Maine Republican

33:44.823 --> 33:50.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Susan Collins. The legislation
would ban anyone
on the government's no-fly list
from buying

33:50.762 --> 33:52.497 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
guns.

33:52.530 --> 33:57.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Virginia Republican
Representative
Scott Rigell, a lifetime NRA
member who owns

33:57.569 --> 34:03.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
10 firearms himself, said he's
urging House
Speaker Paul Ryan to support
their plan.

34:03.208 --> 34:07.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. SCOTT RIGELL (R), Virginia:
If someone
represents such a threat that we
don't want

34:07.846 --> 34:11.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them on a plane, why in the
world would we
let them go in and buy a gun?

34:11.182 --> 34:14.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are going to be pressing the
speaker's
office. I'm not going to tell
you exactly

34:14.853 --> 34:19.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
when, but I have got an
appointment today
with the office, and when we
come back into

34:19.324 --> 34:22.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
session, the pressure will be
continuous.
It'll be respectful, but we're
not going to

34:22.661 --> 34:24.396 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
let go of this.

34:24.429 --> 34:27.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Senate's
version of the
gun control bill cleared a
procedural vote

34:27.565 --> 34:33.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yesterday. But it's effectively
stalled after
falling short of the 60 votes
needed to survive

34:33.538 --> 34:35.340 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a filibuster.

34:35.373 --> 34:40.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In West Virginia, at least 18
people are dead
in some of that state's worst
flooding in

34:40.211 --> 34:46.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a century. Many of the deaths
came in Greenbrier
County, one of the hardest-hit
areas. Thunderstorms

34:46.351 --> 34:52.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have dumped up to nine inches of
rain in some
parts of West Virginia since
yesterday. Tens

34:52.357 --> 34:56.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of thousands were without power
and several
roads were impassable.

34:56.194 --> 34:58.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Governor Earl Ray Tomblin:

34:58.096 --> 35:02.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. EARL RAY TOMBLIN (D), West
Virginia:
Initial reports from our local
emergency management

35:02.734 --> 35:08.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officials indicate at least six
counties have
seen extensive structural
damage.

35:08.540 --> 35:14.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Early reports indicate more than
100 homes
have been seriously damaged or
destroyed.

35:14.946 --> 35:19.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While it appears the active
phase of this
event will end today or
tomorrow, there will

35:19.384 --> 35:21.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be an enormous amount of
recovery work.

35:22.020 --> 35:26.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tomblin said he's
authorized
up to 500 members of the
National Guard to

35:26.825 --> 35:28.593 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
help.

35:28.626 --> 35:33.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Eastern China, the death toll
from yesterday's
massive storm has now risen to
nearly 100

35:33.631 --> 35:39.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people. The number of injured
also climbed
to over 800, following the
tornado that packed

35:39.337 --> 35:45.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
winds of about 80 miles per
hour. Rescuers
continued their search for
survivors today,

35:45.243 --> 35:50.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
while area residents spent the
day combing
through the debris of their
collapsed houses.

35:50.348 --> 35:55.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention
today confirmed what has long
been suspected

35:55.186 --> 36:01.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Flint, Michigan, water
crisis. A CDC
investigation found lead levels
in young children

36:01.826 --> 36:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who drank tap water spiked
significantly after
the city changed its water
source to the Flint

36:08.066 --> 36:10.502 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
River in 2014.

36:10.535 --> 36:16.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Researchers found the children
had a 50 percent
higher risk of dangerously
elevated lead levels

36:16.307 --> 36:19.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in their bloodstream than before
the switch.

36:19.844 --> 36:25.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And President Obama is
designating New York
City's Stonewall Inn as a
national monument,

36:25.450 --> 36:31.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the country's first to honor gay
rights. After
a 1969 police raid on the
Greenwich Village

36:31.456 --> 36:37.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gay bar triggered an uprising,
it became widely
viewed as the birthplace of the
gay rights

36:37.362 --> 36:39.197 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
movement.

36:39.230 --> 36:43.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In his announcement, Mr. Obama
said America's
national parks should reflect --
quote -- "the

36:43.902 --> 36:52.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
full story of our country."

36:52.177 --> 37:02.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The presidential nominees also
weighed in
on the Brexit result today.

37:02.487 --> 37:07.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During a press conference at his
Scottish
resort and golf course this
morning, Donald

37:07.492 --> 37:10.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump praised Britain's decision
to leave
the E.U.

37:10.195 --> 37:12.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I really do see a parallel
between what's

37:12.697 --> 37:17.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happening in the United States
and what's
happening here. People want to
see borders.

37:17.602 --> 37:21.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They don't necessarily want
people pouring
into their country, that they
don't know who

37:21.840 --> 37:24.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they are and where they come
from. They have
no idea.

37:24.342 --> 37:28.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hillary Clinton
also responded
to Britain's vote to leave. In a
statement

37:28.880 --> 37:33.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today, the former secretary of
state said
-- quote -- "We respect the
choice the people

37:33.618 --> 37:36.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the United Kingdom have
made."

37:36.955 --> 37:40.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now to the analysis of
Shields and Brooks.
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields,

37:40.859 --> 37:43.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and New York Times columnist
David Brooks.

37:43.895 --> 37:45.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

37:45.697 --> 37:51.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This whole program up until now
practically
has been about the vote in the
U.K., David,

37:51.202 --> 37:56.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to leave the European Union.
What do you make
of this?

37:56.074 --> 37:59.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, in country
after country,
we're seeing a conflict between
what you might

37:59.377 --> 38:04.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
call urban cosmopolitans and
less well-educated
ethnic nationalism, and ethnic
nationalism

38:04.649 --> 38:06.384 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is on the rise.

38:06.417 --> 38:09.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I agree with everything that
Ivo, Richard
and Margaret were saying, but it
should be

38:09.888 --> 38:13.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said -- and I covered -- I lived
in Brussels
for five years at the Maastricht
Treaty, when

38:13.191 --> 38:18.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all this was coming together --
and the elites,
as much as I hate the leave --
the fact that

38:18.463 --> 38:23.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.K. is going to leave the
E.U., the elites
in some large degree brought
this on themselves.

38:23.935 --> 38:28.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There was built into the
European unification
project an anti-democratic, a
condescending,

38:28.606 --> 38:33.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a snobbish attitude about
popular democracy.
And, secondly -- and this is
also true here

38:33.611 --> 38:38.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- and I'm as pro-immigration as
the day is
long, but we have asked a lot of
people who

38:38.149 --> 38:44.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are suffering in this company to
accept extremely,
radically high immigration
levels.

38:44.122 --> 38:48.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have probably overflooded
the system.
And so while it's easy -- and I
do condemn

38:48.293 --> 38:53.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the vote to leave, get out -- a
little humility
is in order on the part of the
establishment,

38:53.364 --> 38:58.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
frankly, that we have flooded
the system with
more than it can handle. And,
secondly, we

38:58.436 --> 39:05.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have not provided a good
nationalism, a good
patriotism that is cosmopolitan,
that is outward-spanning,

39:05.143 --> 39:09.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that is confident. And,
therefore, a bad
form of parochial,
inward-looking Trumpian

39:09.614 --> 39:11.482 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nationalism has had free rein.

39:11.516 --> 39:13.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark, the elites
brought it
on themselves?

39:13.651 --> 39:21.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think the forces
and the advocates
of globalization have been
primarily obsessed

39:21.659 --> 39:26.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the well-being of the
investor class
and the stockholders and the
shareholders,

39:26.097 --> 39:32.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and been indifferent, oftentimes
callous,
to the dislocation and the
suffering that

39:32.637 --> 39:39.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people in countries affected by
this trade,
the expanded trade, the larger
economy, who

39:39.377 --> 39:41.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have been victimized by it.

39:41.546 --> 39:48.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it has been a accompanied, I
think, by
an elitist condescension, in
many cases, and

39:48.720 --> 39:54.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's been taken advantage of. I
mean, the
shorthand today is that we saw
the words of

39:54.092 --> 40:01.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Republican nominee in
waiting, who is
a part-time presidential
candidate and a full-time

40:01.065 --> 40:08.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
real estate developer, you know,
he won, and
Barack Obama lost, I mean, by
any scorecard.

40:08.172 --> 40:13.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is no spin you can put on
this that
in any way comforts Democrats
today.

40:13.444 --> 40:18.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: If this is the
case, then,
David, what should we expect?
Does this mean

40:18.283 --> 40:20.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the U.S. is going to do
something similar
in the election in November?

40:20.852 --> 40:22.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, I don't
know, of course.

40:22.353 --> 40:24.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I mean, not that
we have to
vote to leave the E.U., but...

40:24.856 --> 40:30.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Let's consider
this one of a
link in a long chain of the rise
of ethnic

40:30.695 --> 40:32.430 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nationalism.

40:32.463 --> 40:37.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As I mentioned, I was in Europe
in the early
'90s. And from '45 through
really '94, we

40:37.101 --> 40:41.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had this just big process of
integration,
with the international
institutions. We had

40:41.039 --> 40:44.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trade agreements. We had the
European project,
the fall of the Berlin Wall.

40:44.108 --> 40:49.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then I remember, at the end
of my stay
there, Yugoslavia pulled apart.
And then you

40:49.180 --> 40:53.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had the Serbs and the Bosnians
and a horrific
war. And, suddenly, you began to
see the nationalism

40:53.685 --> 40:58.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rising up in a way we have seen
sort of ethnic
nationalism rising up in the
Middle East.

40:58.289 --> 41:01.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen polarization in
this country.
We have seen economic
segmentation.

41:01.726 --> 41:06.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we're -- if we came together
for 40 years,
we have been segmenting and
splitting apart

41:06.864 --> 41:10.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for all this time. And we should
expect a
lot more of this sort of
behavior, unless

41:10.835 --> 41:12.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have some sort of radical
change in our
politics.

41:12.837 --> 41:16.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you see
something like this
happening in this country?

41:16.274 --> 41:21.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think there is
no question
part of Donald Trump's appeal is
to people

41:21.245 --> 41:23.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who have been dislocated.

41:23.114 --> 41:27.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week, Peter Hart for the
Annenberg Public
Policy Center at the University
of Pennsylvania

41:27.485 --> 41:35.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conducted a focus group of
really struggling
middle-class workers,
blue-collar, and service

41:35.326 --> 41:40.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
industry workers, most of whom
were sympathetic.

41:40.131 --> 41:45.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There were some Clinton
supporters, but who
were understanding. They felt
that Trump at

41:45.269 --> 41:51.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
least was acknowledging them,
that the two
parties had been indifferent to
their plight.

41:51.142 --> 41:57.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is no accident, Judy, that
the median household
income in the United States is
lower today

41:57.882 --> 42:05.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than it was 20 years ago. And
that has a political
cost to it. And as the top 1
percent and the

42:05.490 --> 42:11.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
top two-tenths of 1 percent have
flourished
and prevailed, the rising tide
has lifted

42:11.062 --> 42:15.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all yachts, but an awful a lot
of boats have
been washed up on the shore.

42:15.333 --> 42:17.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I would just like
to marry something
Mark is talking and something
I'm talking

42:17.468 --> 42:19.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about, which are related, the
economic stagnation.

42:19.437 --> 42:21.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

42:21.239 --> 42:25.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But it's also
feeding into and
sort of intertwining with a
cultural sense

42:25.410 --> 42:27.211 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of loss.

42:27.245 --> 42:30.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you look at Trump voters,
for example,
and certainly probably true of
Brexit voters,

42:30.915 --> 42:34.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they think immigration is a
force for harm,
not good. They think people like
themselves,

42:34.519 --> 42:38.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
basically white people, are
discriminated
against as much as anybody else.
They think

42:38.189 --> 42:41.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the country has because too
multicultural.

42:41.392 --> 42:47.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so these two forces, a sense
of ethnic
loss and economic loss, are
coming together.

42:47.198 --> 42:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's certainly a dangerous
formula.

42:48.966 --> 42:51.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, where does
that leave -- go
ahead, yes.

42:51.235 --> 42:52.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

42:53.004 --> 42:56.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't argue with David's
numbers. But
these are not knuckle-dragging
people who

42:56.574 --> 43:02.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are, you know, out of the cast
of "Deliverance."
These are people who are
really...

43:02.046 --> 43:03.047 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

43:03.080 --> 43:04.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean the
people who voted?

43:04.315 --> 43:05.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: The people who are
supporting
Donald Trump.

43:05.149 --> 43:06.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Donald Trump.

43:06.517 --> 43:09.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: They're struggling
to make it
against enormous costs.

43:09.854 --> 43:15.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's no accident that the
highest debt load
of any generation in history are
those graduating

43:15.793 --> 43:19.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from college this year. The only
one who were
high were the ones who graduated
last year.

43:19.130 --> 43:22.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the only ones that will be
higher than
that will be the ones graduating
next year.

43:22.433 --> 43:30.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there is. And you can look at
the job picture,
and it is hardly encouraging.
So, when you

43:30.107 --> 43:36.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
growing at eight-tenths of 1
percent, you
know, it's one thing to be
accepting of change

43:36.747 --> 43:40.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when that change is working for
everyone.
And that certainly was the case
in the United

43:40.751 --> 43:45.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States for the half-century that
David described
from '45 to '95.

43:45.456 --> 43:49.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was a remarkable epic and era
in world
history.

43:49.727 --> 43:53.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And it should be
said that fear
of cultural -- loss of cultural
cohesion is

43:53.197 --> 43:55.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not silly either.

43:55.066 --> 43:58.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
England is a certain thing. And
America is
a certain thing. And to lose
that thing, because

43:58.236 --> 44:02.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have radically encouraged
immigration,
I think the dynamism is worth
it, but it's

44:02.974 --> 44:06.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
completely reasonable to think,
I'm losing
the country we have had for
centuries.

44:06.444 --> 44:10.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you talked a
minute ago,
David, about immigration.

44:10.515 --> 44:14.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It sounds as if you're saying
that Donald
Trump is the only one out there
speaking,

44:14.318 --> 44:20.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders to some extent,
certainly during
the primaries. Is Donald Trump
the only one

44:20.258 --> 44:23.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of the two presidential
candidates speaking
to these people?

44:23.294 --> 44:26.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I just saw a poll
today. If
you ask Donald Trump supporters
do they think

44:26.631 --> 44:30.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immigration is good or bad for
the country,
80 percent say it's bad.

44:30.568 --> 44:34.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you ask, is the country -- do
they mind
that they're around people who
don't speak

44:34.505 --> 44:40.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
English well, three-quarters
mind. And so
there is just an -- not an
intolerance, but

44:40.111 --> 44:44.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a sense that the country is
getting too diverse,
and that somehow they're the
losers in this

44:44.382 --> 44:48.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
process, or the country as a
whole is a loser
in the process, it's a sinking
ship.

44:48.119 --> 44:52.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so that is, I think, at the
central core
of what Trump is tapping into.

44:52.256 --> 44:55.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: When you're
talking about people
who are struggling to get by
economically,

44:55.259 --> 45:00.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these are the ones who are
competing with
people who come to this country
who are themselves

45:00.565 --> 45:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trying to aspire to a better
life.

45:03.234 --> 45:09.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they are competing,
really, for the
same economic positions, whether
it's a driver

45:10.007 --> 45:17.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or whether it's in the service
industry. And
so, understandably, they see
them as a threat

45:17.648 --> 45:19.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
economically and culturally, as
David described.

45:19.884 --> 45:25.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the same time, we stand
alone as a
country of assimilation, a
country of immigrants.

45:25.990 --> 45:31.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, we are not the United
Kingdom. I mean,
if this -- if Brexit or the
equivalent thereof

45:31.062 --> 45:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were put to the United States,
we're talking
about a third of the electorate
who are nonwhite.

45:35.633 --> 45:39.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: The irony, though,
is that the
U.K. and U.S. are probably the
two best -- two

45:39.370 --> 45:40.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the best countries in the
world...

45:40.805 --> 45:41.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

45:41.205 --> 45:42.106 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

45:42.139 --> 45:43.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: ... pretty
cosmopolitan ways.

45:43.975 --> 45:46.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the one amendment I would
make is, Trump
voters in the primaries, the
average income

45:46.577 --> 45:51.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was $74,000, which is well above
the median
in this country. So, they tend
to be affluent

45:51.849 --> 45:56.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people from poor places. And so
it's a sense
of collective loss, as much as
personal loss,

45:56.687 --> 45:58.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that is driving a lot of those
voters.

45:58.556 --> 46:01.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to --
while we're touching
on immigration, two other things
I want to

46:01.058 --> 46:02.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ask you about, Mark.

46:03.027 --> 46:07.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark, one is the Supreme Court
decision this
week effectively to -- what
means the president's

46:07.732 --> 46:13.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
effort to at least provide some
protection
for those undocumented
immigrants who are

46:13.270 --> 46:18.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this country, maybe the
parents or the
children of others who are here
legally, the

46:18.209 --> 46:22.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
court said that is going to go
back to a lower
court. We will see what happens.

46:22.580 --> 46:27.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's a big setback for the
president.
What does it say going forward?

46:27.151 --> 46:29.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, it's a
setback to his
legacy.

46:29.620 --> 46:35.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It says that, 2013, 68 United
States senators
supported -- voted for a
solution to this

46:35.059 --> 46:40.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problem, to let people come out
of the shadows,
the parents, the relatives of
children who

46:41.032 --> 46:45.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were American citizens, that
they wouldn't
be worried about immigration
authorities showing

46:45.770 --> 46:51.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up and knocking on their door.
And it means
that his legacy is depleted,
that you can

46:51.475 --> 46:55.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only do so much by executive
order, that we
never got a vote in the House of
Representatives.

46:55.613 --> 46:58.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The House of Representatives
never voted on
the immigration act in 2013.

46:58.382 --> 47:02.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes,
substantively, I think
it's a setback, because so many
people's lives

47:02.286 --> 47:05.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are now made more precarious.

47:05.122 --> 47:08.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a matter of process -- and
process matters
when we think about the
Constitution -- I'm

47:08.459 --> 47:12.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
glad the court did what it did.
You can't
-- when you change the status of
five million

47:12.897 --> 47:16.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people, say, that's a big thing.
And that,
to me, is something that should
be done by

47:16.901 --> 47:21.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
law, through Congress, through
the executive
action, through -- I mean,
through executive

47:21.072 --> 47:22.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
signing the bill.

47:22.940 --> 47:26.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It should be done in the normal
constitutional
process. For one man, one
president to make

47:26.610 --> 47:30.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a change in American life that
big through
executive action seems to be
overreaching

47:30.881 --> 47:32.349 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the powers of the presidency.

47:32.383 --> 47:34.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: OK, and the a
little over a
minute left.

47:34.385 --> 47:40.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to ask you both about
this pretty unprecedented
move, Mark, in the House of
Representatives,

47:40.591 --> 47:45.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats sitting on the floor
for hours and
hours to make a statement about
gun control,

47:45.196 --> 47:48.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they wanted legislation
called up for
a vote.

47:48.632 --> 47:53.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the end, they have -- the
House is now
in recess. What did the
Democrats accomplish?

47:53.904 --> 47:56.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Was this an effective move on
their part?

47:56.707 --> 48:00.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: What they did,
Judy, was they
got incredible attention to it.

48:00.544 --> 48:05.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, having John Lewis, a
civil rights
icon who had led sit-ins in
civil rights,

48:05.416 --> 48:09.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lead this brought the attention.
I don't think
there is any question that there
is a profound

48:09.787 --> 48:16.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change in public attitudes in
support of background
checks. And I think Hillary
Clinton, as the

48:16.527 --> 48:24.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democratic nominee, support for
the abolition
of assault weapons will be a
political advantage

48:24.068 --> 48:24.769 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 2016.

48:24.802 --> 48:25.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Twenty seconds.

48:25.936 --> 48:27.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I have do have
questions about
that.

48:28.005 --> 48:32.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The people who -- there may be a
shift on
guns, but the people who vote on
the gun issue

48:32.209 --> 48:36.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have tended to be on the NRA
side. It seems
to me it's a very open question
whether that's

48:36.614 --> 48:38.282 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
changed at all.

48:38.315 --> 48:48.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Brooks,
Mark Shields,
a big week of news. Thank you
both.

48:48.359 --> 48:53.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Brooks,
Mark Shields,
a big week of news. Thank you
both.

48:53.063 --> 48:59.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Finally, tonight, we mark the
passing of a
bluegrass pioneer.

48:59.436 --> 49:04.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ralph Stanley died overnight at
the age of
89, after a long battle with
skin cancer.

49:04.408 --> 49:10.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His haunting voice epitomized
what became
known as the music genre's high
lonesome sound,

49:10.881 --> 49:15.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since forming the band the
Stanley Brothers
and their Clinch Mountain Boys
in 1946.

49:15.986 --> 49:22.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Stanley rose to wider fame
with his appearance
in the 2000 film "O Brother,
Where Art Thou?"

49:22.793 --> 49:24.562 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for which he won a Grammy.

49:24.595 --> 49:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s Jeffrey Brown
spoke with
Stanley back in 2002, and asked
him to explain

49:29.533 --> 49:33.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his distinct singing style.
Here's part of
that profile.

49:33.804 --> 49:36.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RALPH STANLEY, Musician: Now,
that's not my
voice.

49:36.907 --> 49:38.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What do you mean?

49:38.175 --> 49:40.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RALPH STANLEY: That's a
God-given voice.

49:40.411 --> 49:49.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it wasn't for the lord's
will, I couldn't
-- I couldn't sing that way. He
gives everybody

49:49.553 --> 49:55.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everything they have. That's
what I'm a telling
you about changing maybe a verse
or maybe

49:55.526 --> 49:59.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a word or two. It can come to me
that way.
See, that's what you call the
spirit comes

49:59.263 --> 50:01.098 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to you.

50:01.131 --> 50:08.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hey, sometimes, I can't sing a
lick. Sometimes,
I feel real good. Sometimes, I
feel like just

50:08.205 --> 50:13.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
jumping straight up. That's when
you can really
do the singing.

50:13.544 --> 50:19.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Just jumping
straight up in
the air?

50:19.416 --> 50:23.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RALPH STANLEY: Yes.

50:23.921 --> 50:31.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Ralph Stanley is
at his most
haunting and ghostly in the
unaccompanied

50:31.962 --> 50:35.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
dirge "O Death."

50:35.933 --> 50:45.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RALPH STANLEY: There's never
been truer words
ever written, because every word
in that "O

50:45.910 --> 50:52.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Death" song is going to come.
It's going to
come to you and me and everybody
else.

50:52.449 --> 51:02.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I try my best to make people
understand
it when I sing that, that it is.
I never think

51:02.493 --> 51:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I try my best to make people
understand
it when I sing that, that it is.
I never think

51:09.333 --> 51:16.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about it, but I know every -- I
sing that
every night. And I know that,
one day, maybe

51:16.907 --> 51:22.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tomorrow, or maybe 50 years from
today, that's
coming to me, see?

51:22.980 --> 51:26.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's already come to a lot of
people. And
that's true, a true song.

51:26.317 --> 51:35.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can watch
more of Jeff's
profile of Ralph Stanley online
at PBS.org/NewsHour.

51:35.626 --> 51:39.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Gwen Ifill is preparing for
"Washington
Week," which airs later this
evening on PBS,

51:40.030 --> 51:41.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and she's here now with a
preview.

51:41.865 --> 51:43.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Hi, Judy.

51:43.801 --> 51:48.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are picking up where you
leave off tonight
with more analysis of the
surprises this week,

51:48.806 --> 51:54.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Brexit, at the Supreme Court,
on the campaign
trail, and the social
media-powered sit-in

51:54.678 --> 51:59.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the House floor. So much to
talk about,
and we will tackle it tonight on
"Washington

51:59.783 --> 52:00.684 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Week" -- Judy.

52:00.718 --> 52:03.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will be
watching.

52:03.087 --> 52:08.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And tune in for special "PBS
NewsHour Weekend"
coverage of the U.K.'s dramatic
break from

52:08.325 --> 52:12.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the E.U. Hari will anchor both
nights from
London.

52:12.596 --> 52:17.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm
Judy Woodruff. Have a great
weekend. Thank

52:17.034 --> 52:17.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you, and good night
