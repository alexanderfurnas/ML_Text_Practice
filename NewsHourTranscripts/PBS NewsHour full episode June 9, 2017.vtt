James Comey confirmed

a lot of what I
said and some of the

things that he said
just weren't true

the whole truth
and nothing but the

director yesterday
testified several

02:14.500 --> 02:16.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
things that he took
detailed notes of

02:16.733 --> 02:18.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his conversations
with the President to

02:18.433 --> 02:20.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
protect against mr.
Trump lying about

02:20.733 --> 02:23.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what was said he said
he leaked some of

02:23.033 --> 02:25.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
those notes last
month hoping to prompt

02:25.133 --> 02:27.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the naming of a special
counsel I needed

02:27.666 --> 02:29.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to get that out into
the public square

02:29.300 --> 02:31.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he did tell President
Trump several

02:31.500 --> 02:33.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
times that he was not
specifically under

02:33.600 --> 02:36.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
investigation and
Comey testified the

02:36.900 --> 02:39.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president pressured
him to end the probe

02:39.033 --> 02:40.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of former national
security adviser

02:40.866 --> 02:44.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Michael Flynn he did
say under oath that

02:44.200 --> 02:47.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you told him to let
the Flynn you said

02:47.233 --> 02:48.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you hoped the Flynn
investigation you

02:48.966 --> 02:51.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
could like I didn't
say that so he lied

02:51.566 --> 02:53.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about that well I
didn't say that I mean

02:53.866 --> 02:55.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I will tell you I
didn't say that the

02:55.666 --> 02:57.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president also denied
asking Comey for a

02:57.933 --> 03:00.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pledge of loyalty
and he was asked

03:00.566 --> 03:03.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
directly if he has
recordings of their

03:03.033 --> 03:05.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
conversations as he's
hinted before I'm

03:05.433 --> 03:06.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not hinting anything
I'll tell you about

03:06.766 --> 03:09.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it over a very short
period of time when

03:09.433 --> 03:10.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will you tell us
about the role for a

03:10.866 --> 03:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fairly short period of time

03:12.100 --> 03:14.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are there tapes oh
you're gonna be very

03:14.533 --> 03:16.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
disappointed when
you hear the end so

03:16.066 --> 03:18.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
don't worry conservative
news outlets

03:18.133 --> 03:20.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

chairman mark meadows
I think that it

03:24.400 --> 03:26.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was actually a day
that the vindicated

03:26.566 --> 03:28.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the president when
you have director

03:28.500 --> 03:30.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Comey three times
saying that he was not

03:30.533 --> 03:32.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
under investigation

03:32.066 --> 03:34.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republican senator
Susan Collins who's

03:34.433 --> 03:36.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Intelligence
Committee said Comey

03:36.233 --> 03:38.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was wrong to leak
his notes but she

03:38.333 --> 03:40.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
defended him as well
I found him to be

03:40.800 --> 03:43.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
credible candid and
thorough doesn't

03:43.800 --> 03:46.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mean better free
memory has it's exactly

03:46.300 --> 03:48.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
right or that there
aren't different

03:48.566 --> 03:50.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
interpretations but
he testified under

03:50.400 --> 03:52.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
oath this led to
another question for

03:52.866 --> 03:54.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the president so he
said those things

03:54.866 --> 03:57.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
under oath would you
be willing to speak

03:57.133 --> 04:00.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
under oath to give
your version of 100

04:00.333 --> 04:01.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
percent

04:01.600 --> 04:02.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so if Robert Muller
wanted to speak with

04:02.800 --> 04:04.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you about that you
would be glad to tell

04:04.100 --> 04:06.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
him exactly what I
just told you on the

04:06.166 --> 04:07.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
other side of the
aisle Democrats

04:07.800 --> 04:09.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

president House
Minority Leader Nancy

04:11.833 --> 04:14.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Pelosi and there's
no question he abused

04:14.633 --> 04:16.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
power whether he
obstructed justice

04:16.566 --> 04:19.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
remains for the
facts to come forward

04:19.233 --> 04:21.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and that's what we
want are the facts

04:21.233 --> 04:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
meanwhile leaders of the House

04:22.800 --> 04:24.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Intelligence Committee
asked Comey for

04:24.766 --> 04:27.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his notes and memos
they also asked the

White House for any
memos or recordings

critical time for
our country May had

conservative dominance
in Parliament and

was not the result

that we secured and
as I reflect on the

results I will reflect
on what we need

05:41.066 --> 05:43.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to do in the future
to take the party

05:43.700 --> 05:46.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
forward but Westminster

minister to resign

05:53.166 --> 05:56.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Labour leader Corbin
led the charge it

05:56.200 --> 05:58.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was her campaign it
was her decision to

05:58.933 --> 06:01.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
call the election
it was her name out

06:01.200 --> 06:03.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there and she was
saying she was doing

06:03.033 --> 06:05.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it to bring about
strong and stable

06:05.033 --> 06:07.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
government well this
morning it doesn't

06:07.300 --> 06:08.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
look like a strong
government it doesn't

06:08.833 --> 06:10.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
look like a stable
government it doesn't

06:10.300 --> 06:11.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
look like a government
that has any

06:11.566 --> 06:14.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
program whatsoever
Corbin success came

06:14.300 --> 06:16.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in part from
cooperating with the

06:16.000 --> 06:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
grassroots campaign organisation

06:17.800 --> 06:19.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

06:24.533 --> 06:26.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
relationships and
people on the doorstep

06:26.133 --> 06:28.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you listen to them
you communicate your

06:28.233 --> 06:30.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ideas effectively
and help train people

06:30.300 --> 06:33.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on persuading people
of ye Labour's

06:33.033 --> 06:35.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
policies made sense
but Mays opponents

06:35.566 --> 06:37.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
aren't the only
ones questioning her

06:37.166 --> 06:39.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
role and a Subaru
is a Conservative

06:39.366 --> 06:41.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
member of parliament
this is a very bad

06:41.733 --> 06:44.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
moment for the
Conservative Party and we

06:44.100 --> 06:46.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
need to take stock
and our leader needs

06:46.233 --> 06:49.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to take stock as well
will conservatives

06:49.133 --> 06:51.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
go as far as removing
May from power

professor at King's

06:53.900 --> 06:55.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
College London
says it depends on

06:55.666 --> 06:58.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
several key factors firstly the

06:58.366 --> 06:59.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
availability of
someone else who could

06:59.966 --> 07:01.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
command support in
the party secondly

07:01.933 --> 07:03.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the scale of
Opposition in the part

07:03.700 --> 07:06.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to her and thirdly
whether or not the

07:06.266 --> 07:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
members of the
parliamentary party think

07:08.333 --> 07:09.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's better to try
and get rid of her

07:09.700 --> 07:12.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
now or have a
period of calm where

07:12.600 --> 07:14.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
things can bed
themselves in after the

07:14.700 --> 07:16.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
election before
maybe trying to do a

07:16.400 --> 07:18.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
leadership election
next year May has

07:18.533 --> 07:20.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been criticized for
running a lackluster

07:20.466 --> 07:22.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
campaign it was marked
by a proposal to

07:22.966 --> 07:24.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
force elderly people
to pay more for

07:24.900 --> 07:27.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their care and her
decision to skip a

07:27.433 --> 07:29.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
televised debate

07:29.066 --> 07:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
then came the terror attacks in

07:31.400 --> 07:33.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Manchester and London
which refocused

07:33.600 --> 07:36.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the race on security
and Mays role in

07:36.100 --> 07:39.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cutting police ranks
and there's brexit

07:39.333 --> 07:42.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
uk's withdrawal talks
of the EU but you

07:42.400 --> 07:44.733 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
to begin in just
10 days this was

07:44.733 --> 07:46.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
certainly a rejection
of Teresa Mays

07:46.700 --> 07:49.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
very tough brexit
strategy where she was

07:49.700 --> 07:51.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to cleave a
lot of the links

07:51.266 --> 07:53.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
between the UK and the EU John

Springfield is
director of research at

07:55.400 --> 07:57.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Centre for
European reform there's

07:57.366 --> 08:00.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
only about 18 months
left to negotiate

08:00.400 --> 08:04.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the brexit deal
and if say we have

08:04.533 --> 08:06.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
another three or
four months while the

08:06.566 --> 08:08.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
government is formed
that we have fresh

08:08.433 --> 08:10.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
elections then
there's much less time

08:10.500 --> 08:13.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and so the EU then
has an awful lot of

08:13.133 --> 08:15.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
power towards the end
of the negotiating

08:15.233 --> 08:17.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
process for now May
needs a coalition

08:17.933 --> 08:19.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
partner to form a
governing majority in

08:19.733 --> 08:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
parliament most likely Northern

08:21.433 --> 08:23.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Ireland's Democratic
Unionist Party the

08:23.900 --> 08:26.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
group is Pro brexit
but well to the

08:26.000 --> 08:28.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
right on social
issues there's broad

08:28.433 --> 08:29.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
agreement across the
political spectrum

08:29.966 --> 08:32.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that Theresa May is
living on borrowed

08:32.466 --> 08:35.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
time the Labour Party
believes that her

08:35.500 --> 08:37.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
coalition of convenience
with Northern

08:37.866 --> 08:40.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Ireland's DUP is
unsustainable and that

08:40.833 --> 08:42.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there will be a new
general election in

08:42.900 --> 08:45.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the not-too-distant
future mrs. May

08:45.366 --> 08:46.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wants to remain in
office for the next

08:46.766 --> 08:49.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
five years but most
analysts agree that

08:49.633 --> 08:51.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the conservative
establishment will

08:51.466 --> 08:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
terminate her
Premiership when the time

08:53.600 --> 08:55.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is right and they'll
select another

08:55.300 --> 08:57.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
candidate to lead
them into the next

nation of Qatar
unfortunately has

09:28.033 --> 09:30.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
historically been a
funder of terrorism

at a very high level
the time had come

to call on Qatar to
end its funding they

09:40.566 --> 09:44.166 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
have to end that
funding and it's

deny what former

14:44.100 --> 14:45.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
does this compare
to the reaction in

14:45.433 --> 14:46.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
your community
where people paying

14:46.666 --> 14:48.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
attention to this
I think in West

14:48.700 --> 14:50.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Virginia generally
there's the same kind

14:50.500 --> 14:53.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of there's the same
level of attention

14:53.233 --> 14:54.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as there is kind of
generally across the

14:54.900 --> 14:57.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
country but I will
say re that a lot of

14:57.033 --> 14:58.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what's happening in
Washington is being

14:58.666 --> 15:00.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
overshadowed by what's
happening here at

15:00.700 --> 15:02.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the local level in
West Virginia we're

15:02.666 --> 15:04.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about 19 days away
from a government

15:04.766 --> 15:06.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
shutdown and if
lawmakers don't approve

15:06.966 --> 15:08.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a budget by June 30th

15:08.566 --> 15:10.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that means all state
workers get laid

15:10.566 --> 15:12.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
off there's no more
funding for any

15:12.233 --> 15:14.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
government services
and so what's

15:14.100 --> 15:15.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
happening at the
local level for West

15:15.733 --> 15:17.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Virginians is a much
bigger issue than

15:17.666 --> 15:19.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what's going on
in Washington John

15:19.900 --> 15:21.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Ralston all politics
locals at the case

15:21.900 --> 15:24.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in Nevada as well
well I think it is to

15:24.833 --> 15:27.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
some extent our
legislature just ended

15:27.133 --> 15:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but the shadow of Trump is over

15:29.333 --> 15:31.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
everything as you
know they did a lot of

15:31.766 --> 15:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
things in reaction to Trump the

15:33.400 --> 15:35.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
legislative leaders
it's controlled by

15:35.133 --> 15:36.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Democrats here we
have a Republican

15:36.933 --> 15:39.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
governor who is not
that Trump friendly

15:39.266 --> 15:41.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they passed some
bills to try to codify

15:41.866 --> 15:45.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the the Obamacare
here they sent out a

15:45.533 --> 15:48.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lot of press releases
about Trump Nevada

15:48.833 --> 15:51.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is an unusual state
to put it mildly as

15:51.333 --> 15:54.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all of you know but
we're also one of

15:54.200 --> 15:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the few states to go completely

15:55.433 --> 15:59.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Democratic in 2016
went for Clinton the

15:59.233 --> 16:02.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
legislature turned
we had two Republican

16:02.000 --> 16:03.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
congressional seats flip to the

16:03.866 --> 16:06.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Democrats so there
is not it's not

16:06.266 --> 16:08.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
exactly Trump friendly
territory in the

16:08.900 --> 16:11.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
first place but I think that all

16:11.366 --> 16:13.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
politics is local
here in the sense that

16:13.533 --> 16:14.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
people who react

16:14.800 --> 16:16.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what just happened
in the legislature

16:16.433 --> 16:19.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what kind of education
policies were

16:19.200 --> 16:21.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
passed and of course
the big issue here

16:21.200 --> 16:23.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which nobody is
talking about elsewhere

16:23.700 --> 16:25.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is we have a new legalization of

16:25.600 --> 16:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
marijuana and a pot tax which

16:27.600 --> 16:30.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
overshadows a lot
of things I will get

16:30.266 --> 16:31.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to those issues and
second Brandon Smith

people outside the
rapporteur class the

bubble that you're
in in the Statehouse

16:36.866 --> 16:38.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
were they watching
where they tuned in

16:38.766 --> 16:42.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not nearly in the
kind of the fervor you

16:42.000 --> 16:43.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
saw in the nation's
capitol here it was

16:43.933 --> 16:46.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
yeah I think is
Ashton mentioned it's

16:46.133 --> 16:47.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
just sort of viewing
this the same way

16:47.466 --> 16:49.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they viewed everything
coming out of

16:49.200 --> 16:50.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Washington DC these
last few months

16:50.966 --> 16:52.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
certainly walking
around the Statehouse

16:52.766 --> 16:55.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
yesterday which is
where I work you

16:55.200 --> 16:58.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
heard the audio of
the Comey hearing

16:58.300 --> 17:00.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
coming out of a lot
of offices and it

17:00.266 --> 17:01.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was on at the lobbyist
bar across the

17:01.700 --> 17:04.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
street but beyond
that no people weren't

17:04.233 --> 17:06.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
paying nearly as close attention

17:06.033 --> 17:07.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Brandon staying with
you for a second

17:07.900 --> 17:09.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what are people
in Indiana paying

17:09.300 --> 17:11.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
attention to that's
a couple big things

17:11.366 --> 17:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
one the economy this is a heavy

17:12.933 --> 17:14.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
manufacturing state
which is partly why

17:14.933 --> 17:16.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Donald Trump's
message of bringing

17:16.600 --> 17:19.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
American jobs back
referencing carrier

17:19.100 --> 17:21.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which had said that
it was pulling out

17:21.233 --> 17:23.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Indiana and all
of that people care

17:23.400 --> 17:24.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about that here
they pay a lot of

17:24.733 --> 17:26.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
attention to that here

17:26.000 --> 17:27.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that in health care
this is a state that

17:27.333 --> 17:29.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
went through its own
version of Medicaid

17:29.366 --> 17:31.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
expansion with Mike
Pence's hip 2.0

17:31.866 --> 17:33.633 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
which is what he
called Indiana's

17:33.633 --> 17:36.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
program and that
has enrolled 400,000

17:36.833 --> 17:38.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hoosiers in the
program and and if that

17:38.933 --> 17:40.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gets taken away
that's a lot of people

17:40.500 --> 17:42.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
losing out on affordable
health care and

17:42.533 --> 17:43.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's something
people here really care

17:43.933 --> 17:46.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about Ashton Morra
Medicaid expansion

17:46.566 --> 17:48.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
also something in
West Virginia but

17:48.533 --> 17:50.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there's also a lot
of talk about coal

17:50.233 --> 17:52.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
jobs the president
uses that opportunity

17:52.466 --> 17:54.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whenever he gets
right the president

17:54.700 --> 17:57.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
came and visited
the state before the

17:57.333 --> 18:00.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republican primary
last year and he came

18:00.266 --> 18:02.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to talk about coal
and to show his

18:02.400 --> 18:04.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
support for the coal
industry and since

18:04.066 --> 18:06.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he's taken office
has continued talking

18:06.233 --> 18:08.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about putting coal
miners back to work

18:08.333 --> 18:10.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in West Virginia I
will say that the

18:10.300 --> 18:11.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
state you know we're
on the edge of this

18:11.833 --> 18:14.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
fiscal cliff essentially
but in the past

18:14.033 --> 18:15.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
couple of months we've
seen a rebound in

18:15.933 --> 18:18.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the coal industry
and a really small

18:18.233 --> 18:19.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
increase in the
amount of money we're

18:19.933 --> 18:22.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bringing in from the
coal severance tax

18:22.066 --> 18:24.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so at the local level
what West Virginia

18:24.966 --> 18:26.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
voters see is

18:26.400 --> 18:28.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we voted for someone
who said he was

18:28.500 --> 18:30.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to put miners
back to work and

18:30.066 --> 18:32.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
then justice recently
as yesterday one

18:32.833 --> 18:34.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
coal mine in southern
West Virginia

18:34.066 --> 18:35.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
announced hey we're
going to open our

18:35.933 --> 18:37.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
doors again and put
some 300 coal miners

18:37.933 --> 18:39.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
back to work

18:39.133 --> 18:41.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
John Ralston besides
the pot tax what

18:41.733 --> 18:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
else are people in Nevada paying

18:42.933 --> 18:45.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
attention to well
you know he mentioned

18:45.200 --> 18:47.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Medicaid expansion
this is a state

18:47.000 --> 18:48.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that did expand
Medicaid we had a

18:48.433 --> 18:50.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republican governor
one of the few to

18:50.733 --> 18:52.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
expand Medicaid
there is now a bill

18:52.933 --> 18:55.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sitting on his desk
that has gotten a

18:55.366 --> 18:57.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lot of national
attention already that

18:57.566 --> 18:59.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would be Medicaid for
all in other words

18:59.433 --> 19:01.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
universal health
care in the state of

19:01.700 --> 19:04.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Nevada there's a lot
of emotion behind

19:04.233 --> 19:06.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that it's no telling
yet what are the

19:06.266 --> 19:07.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
governor's going to
sign it I think it's

19:07.633 --> 19:10.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
50/50 at best maybe
leaning slightly

19:10.400 --> 19:12.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
against it health
care is a big issue in

19:12.600 --> 19:14.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Nevada we've had a
lot of uninsured the

19:14.833 --> 19:17.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Medicaid expansion
helped hundreds of

19:17.066 --> 19:18.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
thousands of Nevadans
and now you have

19:18.966 --> 19:21.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
our US senator Dean
Heller the only

19:21.600 --> 19:23.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republican incumbent
running in a state

19:23.666 --> 19:26.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that was won by
Clinton going all over

19:26.433 --> 19:28.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the map on Medicaid
expansion first

19:28.466 --> 19:30.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
saying that he wants
to phase it out

19:30.266 --> 19:32.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
then coming back
today and correcting

19:32.433 --> 19:34.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that and saying well
he's not so sure

19:34.133 --> 19:36.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and so that issue of
Medicaid expansion

19:36.266 --> 19:38.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and whether we will
be the only state in

19:38.800 --> 19:40.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the country to have
Medicaid for all if

19:40.966 --> 19:43.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the governor signs
that bill is a huge

19:43.466 --> 19:46.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
issue here you know
I ask all of you a

19:46.066 --> 19:47.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
question about the
level of support that

19:47.766 --> 19:50.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
exists for the
president among those

19:50.033 --> 19:52.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
voters that stuck
with him in the polls

19:52.066 --> 19:54.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
recent polling from
the Washington Post

19:54.300 --> 19:57.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and ABC on Wednesday
reveals of the

19:57.066 --> 19:58.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
majority 56 percent
of Americans say

19:58.800 --> 20:00.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trump is interfering
with the Russia

20:00.300 --> 20:02.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
investigations rather
than cooperating

20:02.633 --> 20:05.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his approval ratings
are relatively low

20:05.700 --> 20:08.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
right now Brandon
let me start with you

20:08.500 --> 20:11.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
well Indiana is as
much Trump country as

20:11.500 --> 20:12.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you're going to find
it's a he won the

20:12.900 --> 20:16.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
state here by 19
points in 2016 and I'm

20:16.300 --> 20:18.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sure that number
isn't as strong as it

20:18.100 --> 20:20.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was in November but
it's still pretty

20:20.800 --> 20:22.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
strong here I think
that the overriding

20:22.333 --> 20:24.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sense among Hoosiers
is a lot of this

20:24.533 --> 20:26.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stuff is distractions
or it's not Donald

20:26.533 --> 20:28.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trump's fault but
it's distracting from

20:28.966 --> 20:30.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the real work and
so they're still

20:30.466 --> 20:32.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
counting on him to
fulfill his promises

20:32.800 --> 20:35.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Asha Mara yeah I
think the same is true

20:35.466 --> 20:37.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
here in West Virginia
President Trump

20:37.700 --> 20:39.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
won the state at
the largest majora

20:39.866 --> 20:41.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ready that's ever
happened over a

20:41.400 --> 20:44.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Democratic candidate
and so I think for

20:44.166 --> 20:46.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the most part Trump
supporters in West

20:46.566 --> 20:48.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Virginia are still
Trump supporters and

20:48.800 --> 20:50.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they feel that way
because of the things

20:50.666 --> 20:51.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that are happening
that we've already

20:51.933 --> 20:53.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
talked about things
at the local level

20:53.666 --> 20:55.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like this small bump in the coal

20:55.866 --> 20:58.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
industry John Ralston
Nevada being a

20:58.566 --> 21:02.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
purple to blue state
Nevada as you know

21:02.400 --> 21:04.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trump lost here by
a couple of points

21:04.733 --> 21:07.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you have essentially
three states here

21:07.566 --> 21:09.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you have the two urban
areas of Reno and

21:09.766 --> 21:11.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Las Vegas then you
have rural Nevada

21:11.366 --> 21:13.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
where Trump won in
a landslide they're

21:13.433 --> 21:15.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the kind of people
where if Donald Trump

21:15.366 --> 21:18.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
shot somebody on
Las Vegas Boulevard

21:18.066 --> 21:20.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
south to strip they
would still support

21:20.400 --> 21:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
him the urban area of Las Vegas

21:22.633 --> 21:24.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
three-quarters of
the votes sometimes

21:24.500 --> 21:27.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
very very democratic
not Trump country

21:27.533 --> 21:29.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in them we have
the swing county of

21:29.600 --> 21:31.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Washoe County which
is Reno and sparks

21:31.733 --> 21:34.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which is closely
more closely divided

21:34.300 --> 21:36.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but I still think
that there that that

21:36.533 --> 21:38.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
leans a little bit
Democratic now when

21:38.733 --> 21:40.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it comes to presidential
races so it's

21:40.566 --> 21:42.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
three states I
don't think anyone's

21:42.433 --> 21:44.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
views are changing
because of what's

21:44.733 --> 21:46.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
happened so far

21:46.000 --> 21:47.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all right well all
three of your states

21:47.600 --> 21:50.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have Senate contests
and the midterms

21:50.233 --> 21:51.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
coming up so I'm
sure we'll check back

21:51.500 --> 21:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in with you Brandon Smith

David Brooks welcome
gentlemen so let's

22:15.633 --> 22:17.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
continue the
conversation about James

22:17.633 --> 22:20.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Comey David we
heard today what the

22:20.400 --> 22:22.100 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
president thinks
of it he said he

22:22.100 --> 22:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thought the former FBI director

22:24.033 --> 22:26.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
vindicated him but
he also was telling

22:26.200 --> 22:29.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lies what did you
think I thought Trump

22:29.300 --> 22:30.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
actually had some
points I think one of

22:30.800 --> 22:32.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the things we learned
on the criminal

22:32.000 --> 22:35.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
side it was not a bad
not a terrible day

22:35.400 --> 22:38.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for for Donald Trump
James Comey seemed

22:38.233 --> 22:40.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to suggest that
there was no maybe

22:40.133 --> 22:42.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there's Cassim dad
at least on the idea

22:42.166 --> 22:43.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there was a lot of
collusion between the

22:43.400 --> 22:44.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Russian government and the Trump

22:44.966 --> 22:46.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
campaign or even a
lot of conversations

22:46.566 --> 22:49.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think what Trump
did to James Comey

22:49.166 --> 22:50.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
clearing the room
and asked him to lay

22:50.700 --> 22:55.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
off on Flynn was a
scandal something

22:55.000 --> 22:56.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
terrible but probably
not something that

22:56.566 --> 22:58.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would rise to the
level of impeachment

22:58.100 --> 23:00.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in any normal presidency
so to me on the

23:00.866 --> 23:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
criminal front not a disastrous

23:02.933 --> 23:04.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
testimony for
Donald Trump on the

23:04.933 --> 23:06.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cultural front on
the moral front kind

23:06.500 --> 23:09.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of disastrous the
thought that he lied

23:09.233 --> 23:12.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is pretty strong we
do know because of

23:12.366 --> 23:13.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what Comey said
yesterday there's going

23:13.733 --> 23:15.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to be a lot more
investigations and

23:15.400 --> 23:17.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
every time there's
a some sort of

23:17.200 --> 23:18.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
independent or
special investigation

23:18.733 --> 23:21.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
into a White House
it can swallow a

23:21.066 --> 23:23.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
white house up for
not only for months

23:23.100 --> 23:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but for years the Whitewater

23:24.400 --> 23:26.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
investigations went
on for seven years

23:26.700 --> 23:28.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and so I think what's
going to happen is

23:28.666 --> 23:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you're going to have a continued

23:29.866 --> 23:31.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
administration that
is dysfunctional

23:31.300 --> 23:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that's under investigation

23:33.133 --> 23:35.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's distrustful
and a president who's

23:35.566 --> 23:37.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
obsessed now with
policy not with

23:37.733 --> 23:38.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
anything instructive

23:38.966 --> 23:41.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but with this sort
of warfare what did

23:41.033 --> 23:42.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you make of James
Comey and what he had

23:42.666 --> 23:43.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to say

23:43.833 --> 23:45.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I thought James Comey
was believable I

23:45.400 --> 23:47.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
thought he was
compelling in in large

23:47.300 --> 23:49.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
part because Judy he
admitted his flaws

23:49.833 --> 23:52.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he did not present
himself as Galahad or

23:52.600 --> 23:55.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
some Profile in
Courage he acknowledged

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the fact that the
pressure of being one

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on one of the
president just in the

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
White House that he
had not said to the

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president was
inappropriate he said he

24:04.000 --> 24:07.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hadn't been strong
enough but it was

24:07.066 --> 24:09.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
most revealing to me
of all the hearings

24:09.733 --> 24:12.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and Republicans and
I do sit want to say

24:12.400 --> 24:14.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one word for the
senators I mean they

24:14.333 --> 24:16.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
didn't do soliloquies
they didn't do

24:16.833 --> 24:18.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
seven-minute statements
followed by a

24:18.766 --> 24:20.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
question do you agree

24:20.000 --> 24:21.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I thought they and
they didn't they

24:21.866 --> 24:24.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
didn't show rank partisanship

24:24.166 --> 24:25.966 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
I felt I thought
that there was a

24:25.966 --> 24:28.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
seriousness led by
Chairman Byrd and

24:28.266 --> 24:31.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
co-chair Warner but
what impressed me

24:31.866 --> 24:34.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
most of all was
that well Republican

24:34.700 --> 24:36.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
senators were willing
to come to the

24:36.366 --> 24:38.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
defense of the president
the point David

24:38.466 --> 24:40.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
made that there
wasn't obstruction of

24:40.766 --> 24:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
justice on his part or whatever

24:42.600 --> 24:45.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
none of them challenged
director Comey's

24:45.900 --> 24:48.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
direct statements the
president lied and

24:48.033 --> 24:50.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that he was a liar
and that that's why

24:50.033 --> 24:53.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he had to memorialize
each meeting with

24:53.266 --> 24:55.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the president each
conversation with the

24:55.000 --> 24:57.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president because
he feared that the

24:57.100 --> 24:59.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president would lie
and nobody said no

24:59.066 --> 25:00.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wait a minute this
is this is George

25:00.866 --> 25:03.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Washington this is
a man of total or I

25:03.400 --> 25:05.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mean he does have
a reputation for

25:05.300 --> 25:09.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
exaggeration hyping
and and some would

25:09.433 --> 25:12.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
say not at not a
totally consistent

25:12.033 --> 25:13.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
relationship with
the truth and reality

25:13.833 --> 25:16.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and I think that's
a real problem for

25:16.333 --> 25:18.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
him and the fact
that he wasn't under

25:18.000 --> 25:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
investigation is significant but

25:20.066 --> 25:23.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ironically nobody
asked and director

25:23.266 --> 25:25.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Comey didn't
volunteer whether as a

25:25.233 --> 25:27.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
consequence of what
happened in his

25:27.366 --> 25:29.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
meetings at the White
House that he may

25:29.333 --> 25:32.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
now have opened
himself up to some

25:32.100 --> 25:34.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
investigation the
President and as we

25:34.600 --> 25:36.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reported earlier
David the president

25:36.200 --> 25:38.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
said today he sure
he'd be glad to or

25:38.466 --> 25:41.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would be willing to
speak under oath to

25:41.833 --> 25:45.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to the special
counsel robert muller

25:45.000 --> 25:48.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about what happened
but but given given

25:48.133 --> 25:49.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what you and Mark
are saying it just

25:49.600 --> 25:51.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
does Kony now come
out of this with his

25:51.500 --> 25:55.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
credibility intact
I think so I think

25:55.700 --> 25:57.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he's a careful
witness he was a very

25:57.600 --> 26:00.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
believable witness
as Mark said and I

26:00.200 --> 26:01.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think what we saw
in the in the Comey

26:01.966 --> 26:04.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
testimony was really
a clash of cultures

26:04.200 --> 26:06.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
James Comey is an
institutional man he

26:06.933 --> 26:09.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
serves the FBI he
believes in the

26:09.233 --> 26:11.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
government of law he believes in

26:11.033 --> 26:12.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
following the procedures
and norms that

26:12.900 --> 26:16.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
really govern our
any organization we

26:16.233 --> 26:18.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are a nation of laws
Donald Trump lives

26:18.600 --> 26:20.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in an entirely
different cultural

26:20.000 --> 26:22.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
universe he's more
clannish believing in

26:22.600 --> 26:24.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Klan believing in
family believing in

26:24.633 --> 26:27.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
loyalty not recognizing
objective law

26:27.500 --> 26:30.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and not representing
the the procedures

26:30.200 --> 26:32.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that is really how
modern government

26:32.633 --> 26:34.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
operates so when
Paul Ryan and other

26:34.800 --> 26:37.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republicans say well
Donald Trump just

26:37.033 --> 26:38.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
didn't know the rules
because he's that

26:38.333 --> 26:40.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he's innocent at
this he's a newbie at

26:40.466 --> 26:43.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this that's
insufficient it suddenly

26:43.033 --> 26:44.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that he doesn't know
the rules but at

26:44.800 --> 26:46.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all along and throughout
his presidency

26:46.333 --> 26:48.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he sort of trampled
on the rooms rules

26:48.900 --> 26:51.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
almost as a matter
of policy as a matter

26:51.100 --> 26:53.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of character because
he does not believe

26:53.000 --> 26:55.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in that kind of
relationships it's all

26:55.300 --> 26:57.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
personal loyalty
not about laws and

26:57.733 --> 26:59.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
norms and standards
and I do think

26:59.733 --> 27:01.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
eventually down the
road that's going to

27:01.633 --> 27:03.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be a continual source
of problem for him

27:03.633 --> 27:06.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that he is continually
violating the way

27:06.400 --> 27:08.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we do our government
in mark what about

27:08.533 --> 27:10.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the david brought
it up Speaker Paul

27:10.433 --> 27:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ryan said essentially gives the

27:12.633 --> 27:14.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president a pass
saying well he's new to

27:14.133 --> 27:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Washington he doesn't know how

27:15.400 --> 27:17.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
government works
he's not a man of

27:17.000 --> 27:19.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
government yeah he's
a he's an enormous

27:19.566 --> 27:22.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
child and we just we
don't have the same

27:22.433 --> 27:24.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rules from I mean
it was it was less

27:24.733 --> 27:29.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
than fatuous it was
it was dishonest and

27:29.366 --> 27:31.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
misleading on the
part of the speaker I

27:31.033 --> 27:33.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mean you cannot say
that I mean this man

27:33.600 --> 27:35.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has been running
for president he is

27:35.266 --> 27:38.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president I mean if
you have any he is a

27:38.400 --> 27:40.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
graduate of Wharton
although I'd like to

27:40.533 --> 27:41.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
see the Director of
Admissions at some

27:41.766 --> 27:44.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
point come forward
and explain his

27:44.133 --> 27:45.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
knowledge of American
government from

27:45.933 --> 27:47.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his experience at
the University of

27:47.200 --> 27:49.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Pennsylvania but I
mean you can't you

27:49.300 --> 27:51.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can't use these kind
of excuses Judy I

27:51.566 --> 27:54.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mean just just picking
up on what David

27:54.666 --> 27:58.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was saying what is
fascinating about

27:58.533 --> 27:59.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Comey

27:59.766 --> 28:01.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
testimony if you
listen to I would

28:01.066 --> 28:03.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
listen every word
of it is that Donald

28:03.000 --> 28:05.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trump David mentioned
loyalty loyalty to

28:05.866 --> 28:08.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Donald Trump is one
way every one of the

28:08.566 --> 28:10.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
co-authors was worked
with him on any of

28:10.666 --> 28:12.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his books has agreed
on one thing he is

28:12.900 --> 28:14.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a man without any
friends he could not

28:14.933 --> 28:18.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
name a friend the one
person that he has

28:18.000 --> 28:20.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
shown any sense of
loyalty to he shows

28:20.766 --> 28:24.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
none to the people
around him is General

28:24.000 --> 28:27.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mike Flynn and it's
curious I mean what

28:27.166 --> 28:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is it about that relationship

28:28.800 --> 28:31.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean what was it
that Mike Flynn did

28:31.933 --> 28:34.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or was doing on
the Donald Trump is

28:34.966 --> 28:37.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
concerned that he
might say I'm he said

28:37.033 --> 28:38.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to the course the
conversation other

28:38.766 --> 28:41.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
satellites referring
to have people who

28:41.100 --> 28:42.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
worked with him in
his campaign other

28:42.633 --> 28:45.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
satellites if they
were involved well go

28:45.266 --> 28:46.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after them you know

28:46.533 --> 28:48.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
okay but could you
go easy on Mike I

28:48.733 --> 28:51.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mean in the idea
of clearing out the

28:51.033 --> 28:53.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
room clearing out the
bited the Attorney

28:53.066 --> 28:55.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
General the United
States walking out I

28:55.033 --> 28:56.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mean Jeff Sessions
at a terrible day

28:56.600 --> 28:59.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
yesterday and so did
Reince Priebus the

28:59.233 --> 29:01.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the chief of staff
of the White House

29:01.066 --> 29:03.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
when it was revealed
that they left the

29:03.866 --> 29:05.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president alone left
the FBI director

29:05.566 --> 29:07.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you know one-on-one
with the president

29:07.933 --> 29:10.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and obviously purpose
that the president

29:10.633 --> 29:13.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wanted special papers
so he was he was

29:13.033 --> 29:15.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
saying go go easy
on lay off of Mike

29:15.733 --> 29:18.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Flynn and tell the
world that I'm in the

29:18.100 --> 29:19.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
clear I'm in the
clear that's right

29:19.633 --> 29:22.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but David so it
comes down to he said

29:22.266 --> 29:24.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
versus he said and
you were saying a

29:24.733 --> 29:26.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
minute ago this could
drag on for years

29:26.666 --> 29:29.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
how much damage has
been your talk I

29:29.233 --> 29:31.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hear he's referring
to the culture how

29:31.666 --> 29:33.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
much damage is
being done to this

29:33.433 --> 29:36.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president yeah I
think modest damage

29:36.566 --> 29:37.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
around the country
as we just heard

29:37.766 --> 29:39.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
around the country
wasn't as big a story

29:39.500 --> 29:41.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as it was in Washington
I was at O'Hare

29:41.133 --> 29:42.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Airport trying to
watch on TV I couldn't

29:42.633 --> 29:44.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
find any TVs that
had the hearings on

29:44.666 --> 29:47.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they were all on
sports channels so I'm

29:47.000 --> 29:48.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not sure politically
immediately but I

29:48.666 --> 29:50.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do think the scandal
here the fact that

29:50.666 --> 29:52.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Trump will probably now be

29:52.500 --> 29:53.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
investigated for
obstruction then maybe

29:53.966 --> 29:56.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sessions will be
investigated and once

29:56.600 --> 29:59.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
these investigations
started they go on

29:59.100 --> 30:00.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
forever rumor there
the Whitewater

30:00.700 --> 30:02.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
investigation started
as a land deal and

30:02.833 --> 30:04.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
then when it started
Monica Lewinsky was

30:04.866 --> 30:07.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an unknown person in
college and then it

30:07.100 --> 30:08.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
turned into the Monica
Lewinsky scandal

30:08.966 --> 30:10.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they go on for years
and they spread out

30:10.633 --> 30:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and when what happens within the

30:12.866 --> 30:14.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
administration is
nobody knows who's

30:14.566 --> 30:16.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
being investigated
nobody knows who's

30:16.733 --> 30:18.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
saying what under
oath and if Donald

30:18.733 --> 30:20.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trump is really
willing 100% to testify

30:20.566 --> 30:21.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
under oath

30:21.766 --> 30:23.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he's very naive about
what that process

30:23.466 --> 30:25.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
means about what
happens when you start

30:25.333 --> 30:27.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
shifting your stories
what happens when

30:27.266 --> 30:28.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you start talking
the way the Donald

30:28.700 --> 30:30.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trump normally talks
which is imprecise

30:30.933 --> 30:34.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at best and that sort
of thing is bound

30:34.333 --> 30:36.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to get an administration
in trouble and

30:36.166 --> 30:38.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think that will
become the rising tide

30:38.566 --> 30:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that will not destroy this

30:40.633 --> 30:42.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
administration but
it's going to be a

30:42.333 --> 30:45.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
long slow entanglement
in the culture of

30:45.800 --> 30:48.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
crisis and the culture
of scandal let me

30:48.033 --> 30:49.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
give you an immediate
problem that they

30:49.600 --> 30:53.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have Judy there's a
gubernatorial race

30:53.133 --> 30:55.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in Virginia Virginia
New Jersey have our

30:55.833 --> 30:59.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
elections and on
Tuesday is the primary

30:59.533 --> 31:00.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
and

31:00.800 --> 31:02.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in Virginia and
lieutenant governor

31:02.266 --> 31:07.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rather mild-mannered
pediatric doctor

31:07.066 --> 31:11.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
surgeon is is running
on a on a slogan

31:11.400 --> 31:15.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and a TV ad that
says do not let this

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
narcissistic maniac
Donald Trump I mean

31:18.000 --> 31:20.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which tells you two
things one sort of

31:20.233 --> 31:22.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
where that we've
debased the dialogue in

31:22.800 --> 31:25.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the debate in America
why is he doing it

31:25.033 --> 31:26.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
though he's wondering
because he's

31:26.200 --> 31:28.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

former congressman tom

Perriello who's backed
by a lot of Obama

31:31.300 --> 31:32.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people and Bernie
Sanders Elizabeth

31:32.866 --> 31:36.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Warren and Ed why is
he running this way

31:36.266 --> 31:39.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because in Virginia
among Democratic

31:39.866 --> 31:42.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
voters according to
kinetic poll Donald

31:42.500 --> 31:44.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trump is 95 percent
unfavorable and

31:44.900 --> 31:47.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
three percent favorable
so that's what

31:47.466 --> 31:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Republicans are facing right now

31:49.000 --> 31:51.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they cannot embrace
him because he's

31:51.433 --> 31:53.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to be he's
going to be Typhoid

Mary

31:54.533 --> 31:57.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in November of 2018
but but David as you

31:57.133 --> 31:58.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and Mark just heard
in hari's interview

31:58.966 --> 32:02.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with those reporters
from Nevada and in

32:02.233 --> 32:04.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Indiana in West
Virginia they're saying

32:04.200 --> 32:06.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you know a lot of
people are going about

32:06.100 --> 32:07.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their their lives
and a lot of people

32:07.933 --> 32:09.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have voted for Donald
Trump or just not

32:09.733 --> 32:12.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
paying much attention
yeah I think

32:12.366 --> 32:13.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's generally
true there's been

32:13.466 --> 32:15.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
slippage among
Republicans since he was

32:15.366 --> 32:17.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
inaugurated Republican
supporters down

32:17.300 --> 32:20.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
7% among those who
are really strongly

32:20.033 --> 32:21.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
supporting him it's
down a little more

32:21.733 --> 32:23.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and so there's been
some slippage it's

32:23.833 --> 32:26.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not it's a it's a
slow erosion I think

32:26.166 --> 32:28.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
right now the
piano he's at 39 or

32:28.266 --> 32:29.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whatever it is percent
approval rating

32:29.633 --> 32:32.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's bad but it's
not cataclysmic

32:32.366 --> 32:34.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
especially among his
base so the problem

32:34.733 --> 32:37.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is right now not a
mass public erosion

32:37.566 --> 32:39.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of support right now
the problem is in

32:39.666 --> 32:41.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Washington where
he actually has to

32:41.133 --> 32:43.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
govern the senators
as Mark said did a

32:43.300 --> 32:45.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
very good job but
there's a huge wall of

32:45.933 --> 32:47.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
difference between
a lot of those

32:47.433 --> 32:49.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republican senators
and the Trump

32:49.733 --> 32:51.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
administration and
they're not going to

32:51.300 --> 32:53.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be getting any
closer and and Mark I

32:53.766 --> 32:55.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
just choose one point
David made about

32:55.866 --> 32:57.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the interest that
Nielsen ratings just

32:57.933 --> 32:59.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
came out there were
nineteen point five

32:59.600 --> 33:02.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
million people who
watched that day time

33:02.233 --> 33:04.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it began at 7 o'clock
in the West Coast

33:04.700 --> 33:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
all right that's it that's a big

33:06.533 --> 33:09.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
audience Judy it
compared there were 20

33:09.733 --> 33:11.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
million who watched
Sunday night's NBA

33:11.633 --> 33:13.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
final between the
Cleveland Kevin

33:13.966 --> 33:15.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Golden State
Warriors I mean so that

33:15.900 --> 33:19.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is a that's a turnout
that and lot more

33:19.333 --> 33:21.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people obviously
saw the news and the

33:21.233 --> 33:23.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
clips and and the
reports and and this

33:23.666 --> 33:27.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
show and so I think
you know it's not

33:27.233 --> 33:30.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's not the same
thing as a you know

33:30.100 --> 33:33.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Wars coverage or
whatever but it's this

33:33.600 --> 33:36.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
real interest in this
and David I I mean

33:36.100 --> 33:37.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I here just quickly
I hear both of you

33:37.733 --> 33:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
saying it's right now mainly in

33:40.133 --> 33:42.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Washington but that's
going to filter

33:42.166 --> 33:44.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
down that's going to
have enough intial

33:44.633 --> 33:47.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
effect on how people
view this yeah we

33:47.333 --> 33:49.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
could have had a
day where the Trump

33:49.033 --> 33:50.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
administration
really was in like

33:50.533 --> 33:52.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Titanic like peril
if there'd been some

33:52.633 --> 33:54.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
testimony about
collusion if there'd

33:54.766 --> 33:57.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been some really
strong repeated push

33:57.500 --> 33:59.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for him to obstruct
justice but we

33:59.266 --> 34:01.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
didn't have that
and so we're looking

34:01.400 --> 34:05.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
more long-term now

didn't see was this

34:51.500 --> 34:53.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you will achieve
nothing because you're

34:53.400 --> 34:54.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
negotiating model
is fundamentally

34:54.966 --> 34:58.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
flawed exactly
after the nine-month

behind-the-scenes
secret negotiations

35:00.233 --> 35:03.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
had led up to the
Oslo Accords this is

35:03.466 --> 35:05.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all chance to make
a difference I go

35:05.233 --> 35:08.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ahead and try in
the play Oslo play

35:08.066 --> 35:11.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

36:21.233 --> 36:23.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
just a handful of
people knew about what

36:23.600 --> 36:25.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was happening on the
palestinian-israeli

36:25.200 --> 36:27.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
under Norwegian side
I think most people

36:27.333 --> 36:29.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are the impression
at the time that this

36:29.466 --> 36:31.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was something which
was very quick

36:31.300 --> 36:33.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
concocted in the
White House and not

36:33.833 --> 36:36.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
something which was
created laboriously

36:36.533 --> 36:39.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
seven days a week
24 hours over nine

36:39.666 --> 36:42.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
months does it
capture the art of

36:42.100 --> 36:44.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
negotiating and
of what your role

36:44.800 --> 36:48.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pulling together the
negotiations yes I

36:48.000 --> 36:50.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think it does
actually because we

36:50.033 --> 36:53.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
defined very strictly
our role to be the

36:53.666 --> 36:56.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

your problems you have to find a

solution to it it's
not our job it's

37:04.300 --> 37:06.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
your job I've been
sent here to try a

Michael Aaron off
in my country we see

37:18.966 --> 37:23.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you as terrorists and
murderers who wish

37:23.666 --> 37:27.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to drive us into the
sea in my country

37:27.500 --> 37:31.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we see you as a savage
nation whose army

37:31.900 --> 37:35.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
shoots our children
for sports overtime

37:35.400 --> 37:38.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the two slowly get
to know and respect

37:38.033 --> 37:40.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
one another thank you

37:40.200 --> 37:45.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I admire your passion
the so called Oslo

37:47.833 --> 37:49.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Accords agreed to by the real

37:49.466 --> 37:52.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
negotiators included
the first formal

37:52.166 --> 37:54.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mutual recognition
between Israel and

37:54.433 --> 37:57.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the PLO and set the
guidelines of what

37:57.133 --> 37:59.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to this day is referred
to as the peace

37:59.700 --> 38:03.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
process in the play
the two Norwegians

38:03.033 --> 38:05.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their actions at
times secret even from

38:05.500 --> 38:07.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their own government
keep the talks

38:07.600 --> 38:10.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going and under
director Bartlett Scheer

38:10.366 --> 38:12.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the actors literally
keep the play

38:12.533 --> 38:15.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
moving along 60
scenes through several

38:15.333 --> 38:18.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cities all on one
stage set welcome to

38:18.500 --> 38:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
backstage at the Vivian Beaumont

38:20.666 --> 38:23.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I spoke to Jefferson

Ely before a recent
performance tire

38:25.533 --> 38:28.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rode Larson came
in to speak to the

38:28.366 --> 38:31.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
company about the
double sometimes

38:31.633 --> 38:34.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
triple game of diplomacy
and when he was

38:34.833 --> 38:37.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
talking about it it
struck me as being

38:37.700 --> 38:41.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
very theatrical and
the diplomats are as

38:41.500 --> 38:44.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
much from what you
knew no no they were

38:44.900 --> 38:46.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Matt's a good diplomat
is I think very

38:46.766 --> 38:51.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
much like a good actor
in that extremely

38:51.066 --> 38:52.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sensitive to the
other people in the

38:52.933 --> 38:57.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
room and is called
upon to play act at

38:57.900 --> 39:00.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
certain points it
has an element of a

39:00.866 --> 39:02.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
spy thriller I
think people come in

39:02.733 --> 39:03.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sometimes thinking I
don't know what I'm

39:03.933 --> 39:05.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to see three
hours of a historical

39:05.833 --> 39:09.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
political drama and
but it's got a sort

39:09.566 --> 39:12.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of binge-watch sort
of hook that gets in

39:12.500 --> 39:14.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you and you really
just want to keep

39:14.266 --> 39:17.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going you said every
character in this

39:17.633 --> 39:20.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
play speaks their
subtext there is no

39:20.366 --> 39:22.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sub there is no
subject it is about

39:22.700 --> 39:24.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ideas it's about
facts and it's about

39:24.866 --> 39:27.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's about narrative
and an incredible

39:27.666 --> 39:29.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
narrative drive when
you have characters

39:29.000 --> 39:30.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who are only saying
exactly what they

39:30.833 --> 39:33.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mean

39:40.433 --> 39:43.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
know their demons
I was expecting an

39:43.000 --> 39:45.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
agreement and great
hope but it didn't

39:45.400 --> 39:47.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
last the following
years brought more

39:47.833 --> 39:49.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
suffering death and enmity that

39:49.700 --> 39:52.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
continued to this
day but tire rod

39:52.533 --> 39:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Larsen the ever optimistic peace

negotiator says the
Oslo Accords did

39:57.300 --> 39:59.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have a lasting
impact including the

39:59.733 --> 40:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
establishment of the Palestinian

40:01.433 --> 40:03.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Authority a peace
between Israel and

40:03.833 --> 40:06.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jordan that has held
and more what we

40:06.433 --> 40:08.600 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
are seeing today
is difficult but

40:08.600 --> 40:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
without these
institutions it would have

40:10.266 --> 40:12.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been gangland and
complete chaos today

40:12.100 --> 40:15.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so which has benefited
Palestinian and

40:15.000 --> 40:17.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Israelis alike when
President Trump

40:17.366 --> 40:19.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

Palestinians he visited

40:19.233 --> 40:21.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Palestinian president
who Springs out of

40:21.333 --> 40:23.366 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the Oslo Accords
if he brings two

40:23.366 --> 40:26.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
parties together
again the premise for

40:26.200 --> 40:28.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
any talk has to be
the own designed

40:28.133 --> 40:29.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
signed agreements
which are there which

40:29.733 --> 40:30.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are the Oslo Accords

40:30.900 --> 40:33.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as for Oslo to
play taking on such

40:33.800 --> 40:36.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
world-shaking history
playwright j.t

40:36.533 --> 40:38.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Rogers cited a
pretty good precedent

40:38.900 --> 40:41.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Shakespeare's plays
are entertaining and

40:41.166 --> 40:43.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
body and sexy and
politics and life and

40:43.666 --> 40:47.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
death and he's pretty
good I think that

40:47.000 --> 40:50.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think it's it's
odd to me that's the

40:50.733 --> 40:52.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the current events
are larger political

40:52.666 --> 40:53.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
things are not
approached more in the

40:53.966 --> 40:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
American theater only because

40:55.966 --> 40:59.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's such great red
meat for us 1200

40:59.733 --> 41:01.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people a night sit
here like around a

41:01.300 --> 41:03.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
campfire and hear the
same story and ask

41:03.866 --> 41:05.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
themselves some
questions and that's

41:05.066 --> 41:08.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
only the theater
can do that no TV no

lives in the Bay
Area had a stroke two

43:01.833 --> 43:04.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
years ago and is
nearly blind but she

43:04.200 --> 43:05.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wants to remain in
her home as long as

43:05.933 --> 43:08.233 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
possible after I
had the stroke I

43:08.233 --> 43:10.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
couldn't do what I
had done before I

43:10.433 --> 43:14.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
also worried about
different people that

43:14.366 --> 43:16.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we didn't know coming
into the home and

43:16.366 --> 43:19.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
everything we're
gonna start with doing

43:19.133 --> 43:21.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the arm stretches
first but since own

43:21.033 --> 43:23.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Eva introduced mrs.
Darden to see Don

43:23.133 --> 43:25.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Thomas those problems
have been solved

43:25.633 --> 43:30.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
oh she's more than
a caregiver you know

43:30.633 --> 43:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I feel like she's a friend

43:33.366 --> 43:35.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
several of mrs.
Darden's adult children

43:52.366 --> 43:54.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
realized many others
had the same issues

43:54.433 --> 43:57.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so in 2014 she came
up with the idea for

own Eva a service providing FBI

woman entrepreneur is

44:17.133 --> 44:19.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not without its
challenges our biggest

44:19.666 --> 44:22.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
challenge is cash we
have to turn stones

44:22.700 --> 44:24.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that some folks don't
have to I mean in

44:24.966 --> 44:27.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all candor I don't
I don't have the

hoodie and I'm not
the 20 something that

44:29.633 --> 44:32.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
most people expect
to see or would want

44:32.533 --> 44:34.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to invest in when you
think about who in

44:34.566 --> 44:36.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Silicon Valley is
most likely to be able

44:36.433 --> 44:38.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to secure that
investment at a 2015

44:38.900 --> 44:41.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
startup competition
Gardein was about to

44:41.100 --> 44:43.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
make a pitch for o
neva when a potential

44:43.233 --> 44:45.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
investor turned to
her husband Bob owned

44:45.066 --> 44:46.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Eva's chief
technology officer and

44:46.833 --> 44:49.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
another business
partner he just looked

44:49.633 --> 44:51.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at them and the two
men and said you're

44:51.366 --> 44:52.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to let the
black girl pitch and

44:52.866 --> 44:55.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that wouldn't flirt
me what was going

44:55.433 --> 44:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
through your head I sang gree I

44:57.033 --> 44:59.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
literally had to
remove myself you

44:59.466 --> 45:01.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
certainly believe as
a woman you've done

45:01.966 --> 45:03.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all the appropriate
things that one

45:03.633 --> 45:05.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
needs to do to be
competitive as a CEO

45:05.933 --> 45:08.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and it's disappointing
when all that

45:08.700 --> 45:11.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
work is culminating in someone

45:11.400 --> 45:14.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
minimizing you as
just a black girl

45:14.033 --> 45:16.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
guard I ended up
winning the competition

45:16.733 --> 45:19.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and being named best
start-up of 2015

45:19.466 --> 45:21.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
nevertheless she's
had a tough time

45:21.966 --> 45:23.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
getting the attention of venture

women start businesses
with less money

45:45.533 --> 45:47.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
than men whether

45:58.866 --> 46:01.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think that we're
seeing that change

46:01.233 --> 46:03.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
particularly because of changing

46:03.166 --> 46:05.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
demographics
Millennials especially

46:05.600 --> 46:07.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

african-american women

she started a

Washington dc-based
company called the

exactly what to do

46:27.333 --> 46:29.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with their money
before they actually

46:29.166 --> 46:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have the chance to spend it

credit stacker
teaches people how to

46:32.666 --> 46:35.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
make wise credit
decisions essentially

46:35.800 --> 46:37.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you have to swap
various pieces around

46:37.766 --> 46:40.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that represent monthly
payments so you

46:40.000 --> 46:41.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have your home loan
your student loans

46:41.466 --> 46:43.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
your car loans and
so forth ah we have

another multiple-choice
question there's

46:45.666 --> 46:47.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
also a credit score
that calculates as

46:47.600 --> 46:49.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
your score and there's
multiple choice

46:49.533 --> 46:51.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
questions built
in to assess your

46:51.066 --> 46:53.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
knowledge along the
way and why a game

46:53.066 --> 46:55.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
weevil is though a
game almost tricks

46:55.966 --> 46:58.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people into having
fun and they end up

46:58.466 --> 46:59.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
learning how to
manage their money at

the same time and
as for money for her

47:12.166 --> 47:14.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
vulnerable populations
they provided us

47:14.366 --> 47:16.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with a ten thousand
dollar grant to turn

our online version

winning a ten thousand
dollar grant to

47:20.300 --> 47:22.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
help improve the
financial literacy of

47:22.400 --> 47:24.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
students and families
and underserved

47:24.233 --> 47:27.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
communities does help
thank you however

47:27.166 --> 47:29.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
funding is definitely
an issue for us

47:29.633 --> 47:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we've been very creative at

47:31.733 --> 47:33.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bootstrapping this
company off of

47:33.666 --> 47:35.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
revenue since 2014

47:35.566 --> 47:37.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what is bootstrapping
for those who

47:37.133 --> 47:39.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't know so
bootstrapping essentially

47:39.300 --> 47:42.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
means operating with
no cash you have to

47:42.433 --> 47:45.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
become very creative
as to how you come

47:45.333 --> 47:47.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
up with things so for
instance we bought

47:47.666 --> 47:50.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on 15 recent graduates
gave them work

47:50.533 --> 47:52.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
experience to develop
the game and jot

47:52.566 --> 47:54.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
recommendations and
in turn we were able

47:54.900 --> 47:57.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to develop our game
for free what we

47:57.000 --> 47:59.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
find is that women
tend to be more

47:59.166 --> 48:01.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
resourceful and they
tend to bootstrap

48:01.666 --> 48:03.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their businesses a
little bit better and

48:03.266 --> 48:05.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so in the long run
what that means is

48:05.833 --> 48:07.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
