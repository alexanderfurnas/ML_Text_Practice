JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.839 --> 00:07.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.341 --> 00:10.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: The
nation reacts
to a new president-elect.

00:11.011 --> 00:17.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We hear from voices across
generations and
zip codes on the future of the
free world.

00:17.417 --> 00:19.253 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it's Friday.

00:19.286 --> 00:23.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks
give their take
on a momentous week, the start
of a new chapter

00:23.957 --> 00:25.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in American political life.

00:25.993 --> 00:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus: Paris one year later -- as
the Bataclan
club reopens for the first time
since the

00:32.799 --> 00:35.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terrorism attacks, a look at how
the city
is coping.

00:35.836 --> 00:38.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROLINE LANGLADE, President,
Life for Paris
(through translator): I think
that the most

00:38.505 --> 00:43.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beautiful response we can give
the terrorists
is love, joy, happiness,
culture, music.

00:43.777 --> 00:46.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we need to keep this going
as loud as
possible.

00:46.813 --> 00:55.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:55.555 --> 00:58.492 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:58.525 --> 01:07.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President-elect
Donald Trump
announced a shakeup today at the
top of his

01:07.367 --> 01:09.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
incoming transition team.

01:09.736 --> 01:14.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vice president-elect Mike Pence
will take
over as chair, replacing New
Jersey Governor

01:15.008 --> 01:18.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Chris Christie, who becomes a
vice chair.

01:18.312 --> 01:22.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former House Speaker Newt
Gingrich and former
New York City Mayor Rudy
Giuliani will be

01:22.783 --> 01:26.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
among the other vice chairs on
the executive
committee.

01:26.687 --> 01:31.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Members of the committee also
include Mr.
Trump's three older children
Donald Jr., Eric

01:31.925 --> 01:36.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Ivanka, as well as Ivanka's
husband, son-in-law
Jared Kushner.

01:36.930 --> 01:41.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In a statement, the
president-elect said -- quote
-- "Together, we will begin the
urgent task

01:41.868 --> 01:47.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of rebuilding this nation,
specifically jobs,
security and opportunity."

01:47.374 --> 01:51.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in his first news interview
since the
election, Mr. Trump told The
Wall Street Journal

01:51.812 --> 01:56.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he is open to keeping some parts
of the Affordable
Care Act.

01:56.283 --> 02:01.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will have more on Mr. Trump's
post-election
moves later in the program.

02:01.621 --> 02:06.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Protesters nationwide spent
another night
rallying against the
president-elect.

02:06.426 --> 02:11.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Demonstrations came to a head in
Portland,
Oregon, where thousands squared
off with police,

02:11.732 --> 02:13.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
throwing bottles and rocks.

02:14.001 --> 02:16.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officers responded with tear gas
and rubber
bullets.

02:16.703 --> 02:18.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They made 26 arrests.

02:18.972 --> 02:24.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For his part, Mr. Trump tweeted
that the protesters
were -- quote -- "very unfair,"
but later

02:24.177 --> 02:27.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said he "loved their passion for
our great
country."

02:27.814 --> 02:33.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The United Nations says the
Islamic State
has carried out a new wave of
public killings

02:33.420 --> 02:36.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and atrocities in the Iraqi city
of Mosul.

02:36.757 --> 02:42.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It reports that, in the last
week, militants
executed at least 70 civilians.

02:42.095 --> 02:44.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some were hung from telephone
poles.

02:44.331 --> 02:49.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, in Geneva, a
spokeswoman for the
U.N. said the group could be
gearing up to

02:49.469 --> 02:51.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
use chemical weapons.

02:51.304 --> 02:53.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAVINA SHAMSADANI, Spokeswoman,
United Nations
High Commissioner for Human
Rights: We don't

02:53.240 --> 02:57.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know when and for what purposes
they are stockpiling
these, but given what they have
done in the

02:57.744 --> 03:03.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
past, we are worried about the
reasons for
their stockpiling of these
chemicals in Mosul

03:03.517 --> 03:04.851 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right now.

03:04.885 --> 03:08.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we can only speculate how
they -- they
intend to use this.

03:08.355 --> 03:13.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The announcement
comes as Iraqi
security forces inched their way
into Mosul.

03:13.894 --> 03:19.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have been slowed by heavy
resistance
and ISIS fighters using human
shields.

03:19.199 --> 03:24.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, President
Obama used
Veterans Day to call for unity
in the wake

03:24.571 --> 03:26.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of a bitter election.

03:26.339 --> 03:31.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Obama laid a wreath at The
Tomb of the
Unknown at Arlington National
Cemetery.

03:31.445 --> 03:36.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said Americans should learn
from the military
in finding ways to come
together.

03:36.183 --> 03:39.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
The American instinct has never
been to find

03:39.352 --> 03:41.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
isolation in opposite corners.

03:41.555 --> 03:49.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is to find strength in our
common creed,
to forge unity from our great
diversity, to

03:49.763 --> 03:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sustain that strength and unity
even when
it is hard.

03:53.433 --> 03:58.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile,
Britain and France
commemorated Armistice Day,
marking the end

03:58.271 --> 04:04.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of World War I. Prince Harry led
a service
at the Armed Forces Memorial in
England, while

04:04.211 --> 04:10.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
French President Francois
Hollande laid a
wreath at his country's Tomb of
the Unknown.

04:10.650 --> 04:14.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stocks were mixed on Wall Street
today, but
the Dow Jones industrial average
closed at

04:14.955 --> 04:19.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a record high, extending its
post-election
rally for another day.

04:19.893 --> 04:24.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow gained more than 39
points to close
at 18847.

04:24.564 --> 04:30.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 28, while the
S&amp;P 500 slipped
three.

04:30.036 --> 04:35.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the week, the Dow gained
more than 5 percent,
its best week since December
2011.

04:35.308 --> 04:40.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500
rose nearly
4 percent.

04:40.847 --> 04:45.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Secretary of State John
Kerry has become
the highest ranking U.S.
official to visit

04:45.986 --> 04:47.721 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Antarctica.

04:47.754 --> 04:51.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's spending two days there,
meeting with
scientists and getting a
firsthand look at

04:51.558 --> 04:55.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the impact that climate change
has had on
the southernmost continent.

04:55.562 --> 05:01.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kerry is gathering information
before he attends
a global climate change summit
in Morocco

05:01.801 --> 05:03.537 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on Tuesday.

05:03.570 --> 05:08.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the fallout
from a sharply divided election
plays out

05:08.175 --> 05:13.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in schools across the nation;
Mark Shields
and David Brooks on what voters
were saying

05:13.580 --> 05:20.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and what lies ahead; healing in
Paris one
year after deadly terror attacks
darkened

05:20.086 --> 05:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the City of Light; and much
more.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now more on the aftermath of
Tuesday's election.

05:36.403 --> 05:41.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We take two looks at the ways
that the rhetoric
and emotion of the highly
charged presidential

05:41.575 --> 05:43.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
campaign continue to
reverberate.

05:43.777 --> 05:49.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, we go to Manassas,
Virginia, about
30 miles West of Washington,
D.C., near the

05:49.683 --> 05:52.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
site of the first major battle
of the Civil
War.

05:52.886 --> 05:58.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After decades of supporting
Republicans, Virginia
voted Democratic on Tuesday for
the third

05:58.458 --> 06:00.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
consecutive presidential
election.

06:00.560 --> 06:07.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The state's demographics are
shifting rapidly,
and like much of America, the
division between

06:07.200 --> 06:09.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
red and blue is stark.

06:09.436 --> 06:13.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We spoke with people from across
of the political
spectrum caught up in the wake
of one of the

06:13.673 --> 06:17.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
biggest political upsets in our
nation's history.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Here are some of their voices.

06:19.145 --> 06:23.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRETT TUCKER, Trump Voter: A lot
of division
has occurred in this great
country over the

06:23.250 --> 06:32.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last decade, and a lot of them
is almost reflective
to the time period of when the
guns blazed

06:32.759 --> 06:34.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on this battlefield and men
fought for what
they believed in.

06:34.728 --> 06:40.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think America is kind of
in the same
scenario where we're divided on
our beliefs

06:40.200 --> 06:41.901 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in politics.

06:41.935 --> 06:46.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To me, as I travel the country,
I just feel
the sense of urgency to repair
it.

06:46.573 --> 06:49.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm Brett Tucker, 46, from
Washington state.

06:49.509 --> 06:50.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I voted for Mr. Trump.

06:50.944 --> 06:54.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DON CLEMONS, Trump Voter: My
name is Don Clemons.

06:54.514 --> 06:56.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I am 80 years old.

06:56.182 --> 07:01.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I live at St. Joseph, Illinois,
and I voted
for Donald Trump for president.

07:01.321 --> 07:06.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have seen John Kennedy, and I
didn't vote
for him.

07:06.726 --> 07:08.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I wished I would have.

07:08.295 --> 07:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have seen Ronald Reagan,
Dwight Eisenhower,
you know, during my lifetime.

07:13.600 --> 07:18.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
See, I have voted in every
presidential election
since 1958.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think that's about right.

07:20.740 --> 07:26.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these are the two weakest
candidates that
I have ever seen that I had to
vote for.

07:26.413 --> 07:27.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUSAN ARTZ, Trump Voter: I'm
Susan Artz.

07:27.414 --> 07:28.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm from Aldie, Virginia.

07:28.415 --> 07:29.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm 67 years old.

07:29.916 --> 07:33.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I voted for Donald Trump for
president
of the United States of America.

07:33.653 --> 07:37.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think these other countries
should do more
of their share.

07:37.223 --> 07:43.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They pay so much less for NATO
than we do.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I traveled around the world by
the time I
was 21.

07:46.866 --> 07:50.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I looked at all they have,
like he says,
with our infrastructure, with
the railroads

07:50.704 --> 07:56.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and all, and they have so much
better than
we do.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VANESSA ALLEN, Trump Voter: I'm
Vanessa Allen.

07:58.244 --> 08:02.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm retired, and life is not
easy, and I am
a Democrat.

08:02.382 --> 08:04.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think we have got a lot of
dummies.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.519 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I really do.

08:06.553 --> 08:12.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, if you truly listen to
what he says,
I don't even see how you can
push that button

08:12.992 --> 08:15.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on that computer voting for him.

08:15.762 --> 08:18.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's just -- it's crazy.

08:18.064 --> 08:23.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I worked all my life, never
took, never got,
unless I made it.

08:23.703 --> 08:28.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And now what, you know?

08:28.608 --> 08:32.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I don't think he will do
anything great.

08:32.712 --> 08:33.847 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I really don't.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SALIM AMIN, Sanders Voter: My
name is Salim
Amin.

08:36.049 --> 08:39.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm 23 years old, and I voted
Bernie Sanders
as a write-in.

08:39.185 --> 08:40.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was born in Germany.

08:40.754 --> 08:42.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And my parents are from
Afghanistan.

08:42.989 --> 08:45.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not primarily concerned
about the president
himself.

08:45.558 --> 08:51.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm more concerned about the
people he's riled
up, the actual racist people,
the misogynistic

08:51.431 --> 08:57.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people that are feeling like
they were -- fueled
the fire to be able to make sure
-- whatever

08:57.337 --> 08:59.072 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they want to do.

08:59.105 --> 09:03.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAMYAA MOWERY, Virginia: We
can't succumb
to what they want, and we need
to be much

09:03.376 --> 09:09.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stronger than we ever were
before.

09:09.482 --> 09:13.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHAN MOWERY, Virginia: I'm
Nathan Mowery,
and I'm a five-year Army combat
veteran.

09:13.987 --> 09:14.954 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
This is my wife.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LAMYAA MOWERY: And I'm Lamyaa
Mowery.

09:16.523 --> 09:17.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm a nursing student.

09:17.991 --> 09:21.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NATHAN MOWERY: And we just got
married in
October.

09:21.594 --> 09:23.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we are here in our house in
Virginia.

09:23.763 --> 09:30.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAMYAA MOWERY: Already, after we
found out
that president-elect Trump won,
people have

09:30.403 --> 09:32.238 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gotten bolder.

09:32.272 --> 09:38.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There have been cases where
women are pumping
gas and they have been yelled at
to take off

09:38.778 --> 09:42.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their scarf, or walking in a
grocery store
and telling them that this is
going to be

09:43.016 --> 09:46.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the end of you and it's time for
you to leave.

09:46.386 --> 09:50.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's only the beginning, and
I'm sure
that everyone is going to see a
rise in it.

09:50.790 --> 09:52.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALICE BUTLER-SHORT, Founder and
Director,
Virginia Women for Trump: When
Mr. Trump says

09:52.792 --> 09:58.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make America great again, he
means let's bring
it back to where it was and move
forward and

09:58.465 --> 10:00.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
make it even greater.

10:00.467 --> 10:03.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I am absolutely convinced
that he will
do that.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My name is Alice Butler-Short.

10:05.805 --> 10:09.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am the founder and director
for Virginia
Women for Trump.

10:09.609 --> 10:14.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Immigrants will always be
welcome in this
country, but the right
immigrants.

10:14.147 --> 10:21.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have got to keep this country
safe, and
we have had experiences of
terrorism and terrorist

10:21.387 --> 10:22.355 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
attacks.

10:22.388 --> 10:23.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we know it's not going to
end.

10:23.990 --> 10:25.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, we have to take precautions.

10:25.492 --> 10:30.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THOMAS VLADIMIR MENDOZA, Opposed
Trump: My
name is Thomas Vladimir Mendoza.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I am a U.S. citizen.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I live in the United States, so
I'm American.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But I was born in El Salvador.

10:36.669 --> 10:43.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My fears is that I won't have a
job, that
I won't be able to feed my
child.

10:43.276 --> 10:44.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Don't fear a loudmouth.

10:44.444 --> 10:46.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You know what I mean?

10:46.513 --> 10:48.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's what this person is.

10:48.281 --> 10:51.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's just -- I have a lot of
friends that
are loudmouths, and you hear and
you dismiss

10:51.317 --> 10:52.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it because they're friends.

10:52.952 --> 10:57.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But because this guy is going to
be the president,
it's really hard to dismiss it.

10:57.323 --> 11:02.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You cannot just say, he's just
talking, man,
it's just locker room talk.

11:02.195 --> 11:03.963 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No, it's true.

11:03.997 --> 11:08.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has that in him, but, you
know, the good
in people is not going to let
him do that.

11:08.735 --> 11:09.702 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I have hope.

11:09.736 --> 11:11.371 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I have faith.

11:11.404 --> 11:14.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what everybody wakes up
and should
have, faith that things will be
better.

11:14.974 --> 11:18.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Some powerful
voices.

11:18.311 --> 11:23.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And next: schoolchildren and how
the combative
political season has affected
them.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And to Hari Sreenivasan in New
York.

11:25.485 --> 11:29.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Teachers and
parents across
the country report heightened
anxiety and

11:29.822 --> 11:35.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disappointment among some
students, even a
number of school walkouts in
recent days.

11:35.395 --> 11:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In other cases, incidents of
intimidation
and bullying have been reported,
including

11:39.699 --> 11:45.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
graffiti with swastikas, calls
for white power
in a Pennsylvania high school,
and Michigan

11:45.605 --> 11:49.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
middle school students chanting
"Build that
wall" during lunch period.

11:49.609 --> 11:53.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The "NewsHour"'s Student
Reporting Labs gathered
these reactions from across the
country.

11:53.146 --> 11:56.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLICIA DEAN, Student: When I
found out that
Donald Trump had won the
presidential election,

11:56.749 --> 11:58.551 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I was scared.

11:58.585 --> 12:02.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was just staring at my phone
in shock, and
I had no idea what was going to
happen next.

12:02.088 --> 12:06.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIAN MASTERS, Student: I'm not
devastated
that Trump is president.

12:06.259 --> 12:09.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it sends a pretty strong
message to
the American people that
something needs to

12:09.696 --> 12:11.097 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
change.

12:11.130 --> 12:15.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A vote for Trump doesn't mean
you are a bigot,
a racist or anti-woman.

12:15.201 --> 12:18.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe the country does need to
be run more
like a business, so we can
actually get things

12:18.638 --> 12:20.506 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
done.

12:20.540 --> 12:24.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSICA BRUNT, Student: I just
didn't understand
how such a hateful man could
rise to power

12:24.844 --> 12:26.045 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
so quickly.

12:26.079 --> 12:30.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have been really angry,
but now I'm
just tired.

12:30.283 --> 12:33.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm tired that he is now
state-sponsored.

12:33.252 --> 12:38.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SKY ISLAND THOMAS, Student: I
feel like a
lot of students, people in
general, educated

12:38.224 --> 12:43.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
themselves through social media
and what was
on television, rather than
informing themselves.

12:43.596 --> 12:48.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTA KIROS, Student: I feel
like, as minorities,
as people of color, at LGBT
community, as

12:48.401 --> 12:54.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Muslims, as everyone who has
ever been prejudiced
again and anyone who's ever
expressed inequality,

12:54.140 --> 12:57.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we all need to make sure that we
stay in school,
we handle our business, we are
good in everything

12:58.011 --> 13:03.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we do, so that we can one
day -- in the
next election, we can make sure
that we make

13:03.650 --> 13:06.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our voices heard, that we are
the ones running
for Senate, we are the ones
running for president,

13:06.786 --> 13:09.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we are the ones representing us
in the communities.

13:09.422 --> 13:13.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIMMY JOSTEN, Student: My
concerns are that
Donald is kind of going to lose
his temper

13:13.059 --> 13:18.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a little bit sometimes and say
some not-so-smart
things and get some people
angry.

13:18.431 --> 13:21.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I don't think he's going to
make too many
bad decisions.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think he knows where he's
going.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think he knows what he's
doing.

13:24.270 --> 13:27.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY OLIVER, Student: The fact
that someone
like Trump is able to be
elected, the things

13:27.240 --> 13:31.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he says for women, about
people in different
races, the fact that it's OK for
him to say

13:31.444 --> 13:35.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those things now makes it seem
more OK for
other people to say those
things.

13:35.048 --> 13:36.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I think that's my biggest
fear.

13:37.016 --> 13:38.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ZACK BRADLEY, Student: My
concern is war.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that's a concern with any
candidate.

13:40.486 --> 13:43.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With Hillary, it was going to be
war with
Russia.

13:43.056 --> 13:45.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
With Trump, it's going to be a
civil war.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the question is, who is
going to win either
of those?

13:48.027 --> 13:54.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE ONTIVEROS, Student: Seeing
that my generation
doesn't want to take action or
take responsibility

13:54.500 --> 14:03.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for their future and my future,
our future,
I just don't want to stay in a
country like

14:03.843 --> 14:05.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this, if that's what it's going
to be like.

14:05.778 --> 14:08.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEALA NAIPO, Student: There is
no doubt that
the president election was a
huge shock to

14:08.981 --> 14:10.416 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me.

14:10.450 --> 14:13.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I call our citizens to have
some respect
and faith in our country.

14:13.619 --> 14:17.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have made it through a civil
war, two world
wars, the Great Depression, and
terrorist

14:17.623 --> 14:18.591 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
attacks.

14:18.624 --> 14:19.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But this is no fight.

14:19.625 --> 14:20.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We elected someone new as
president.

14:20.827 --> 14:21.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That shouldn't be tearing us
apart.

14:21.894 --> 14:23.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It should be bringing us
together.

14:23.663 --> 14:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For a closer
look now, we
turn to Kavitha Cardoza of
Education Week,

14:27.166 --> 14:31.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who has been talking to teachers
across the
country, and Mariama Richards,
an administrator

14:31.037 --> 14:33.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at Friends Central School just
outside of
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Kavitha, let me start with you.

14:35.441 --> 14:37.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What have you found in your
reporting in the
past couple days?

14:37.543 --> 14:41.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA, Education Week:
Well, this
is something that teachers are
used to.

14:41.280 --> 14:45.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have been dealing with
these emotions
through the campaign season.

14:45.685 --> 14:49.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The election results just made
it more concrete.

14:49.956 --> 14:52.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Children in schools are just a
microcosm of
society.

14:52.759 --> 14:57.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they're not surprised at
all that some
of these emotions are spilling
into the classroom.

14:57.096 --> 15:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, are these
the students'
own opinions, or are they
parroting what their

15:00.867 --> 15:01.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
parents say at home?

15:01.934 --> 15:03.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: I think a bit
of both.

15:03.803 --> 15:09.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With the teenagers we just saw,
some of it
is their own, because they are
reading newspapers

15:09.342 --> 15:11.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and watching the television
themselves.

15:11.911 --> 15:18.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I spoke to a teacher in
California, and
she teaches pre-K, and she says
children just

15:18.084 --> 15:20.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
absorb the stress of their
parents.

15:20.920 --> 15:27.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so she teaches in a very
diverse community,
a lot of Muslims, a lot of
immigrants.

15:27.426 --> 15:31.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she said she has noticed
that the children
are more aggressive, they're
more prone to

15:31.898 --> 15:33.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
crying, very emotional.

15:33.866 --> 15:38.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So she and other teachers have
actually put
the learning, the academic goals
on hold with

15:38.471 --> 15:41.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these children and they have
said, you know
what?

15:41.073 --> 15:47.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's create our own curriculum,
how to be
a good friend, how to listen,
how to be calm

15:47.313 --> 15:49.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
when you feel upset.

15:49.081 --> 15:53.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She said a lot of the parents
are stressed
about maybe their families being
split up,

15:53.886 --> 15:57.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
maybe losing health care if
Obamacare goes
away.

15:57.089 --> 16:02.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mariama
Richards, what kind
of things are you grappling with
at your school

16:02.228 --> 16:04.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or the teachers have been coming
to you with?

16:04.063 --> 16:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIAMA RICHARDS, Friends
Central School:
One of the biggest issues that
is in front

16:06.799 --> 16:13.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of us right now is a community
that wants
to see change happen, that felt
really connected

16:13.673 --> 16:20.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to the election season,
regardless of which
side that particular student or
family was

16:20.046 --> 16:21.814 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

16:21.848 --> 16:25.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now they're grappling with
kind of how
do they push through some of the
values that

16:25.585 --> 16:31.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they really do love and
appreciate about the
community that they're building
and finding

16:31.157 --> 16:34.060 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that there's a split in
perspective on how
to move forward.

16:34.093 --> 16:39.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, there are students
who feel so
angry and upset now, that it's
hard for them

16:39.665 --> 16:45.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to think about engaging those
who may have
voted for our current
president-elect, because

16:45.538 --> 16:50.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they see that engagement as
people who think
less of them, who don't think
that they're

16:50.743 --> 16:55.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
full human beings, while there
are other students
who may not necessarily be on
the side of

16:55.047 --> 16:59.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president-elect as well, but
they're in
a position where they feel like
this is an

16:59.185 --> 17:02.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opportunity for us to learn what
the other
side of the world is thinking.

17:02.755 --> 17:09.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so even in places where you
have commonalities
in terms of goals, we're still
seeing students

17:09.095 --> 17:13.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really struggle with kind of,
what's our best
case forward moving forward?

17:13.566 --> 17:18.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With the little ones, they are
struggling
with very similar things that we
just heard,

17:18.271 --> 17:19.906 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fear.

17:19.939 --> 17:23.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They are hearing lots of
information and not
understanding the context for
it.

17:23.876 --> 17:30.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we see it play out
definitely in the classroom
setting in how they're
connecting with others,

17:30.283 --> 17:34.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
whether or not they feel
reserved, whether
or not they feel fear.

17:34.387 --> 17:38.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we are, as teachers, trying
to support
them in the process of getting
through that.

17:38.457 --> 17:44.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Kavitha
Cardoza, are the
teachers saying, in essence,
what the children

17:44.196 --> 17:45.998 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are feeling?

17:46.032 --> 17:50.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, is there a collective
sense of anxiety
or tension, whether --
regardless- of which

17:50.536 --> 17:52.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
side of the election they came
down on?

17:52.638 --> 17:57.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: I think the
teachers are
really, really making a
concerted effort to,

17:57.877 --> 18:02.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no matter what their personal
beliefs, to
be that oasis of calm for the
children and

18:02.848 --> 18:05.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to kind of bring everyone
together.

18:05.284 --> 18:10.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are students who, for
example, supported
climate change, and they are
devastated, we

18:10.456 --> 18:12.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have heard reports.

18:12.258 --> 18:17.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are students -- I spoke to
a teacher
in Ohio, and she said her
students came with

18:17.396 --> 18:22.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump T-shirts and the "Make
America Great
Again" caps, and they were
thrilled.

18:22.101 --> 18:26.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so within these schools and
within all
the children, they teach how do
you make it

18:26.973 --> 18:30.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
safe and calm and respectful,
really?

18:30.343 --> 18:36.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mariama
Richards, you took
steps to prepare parents before
the election.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What are you hearing from them
now?

18:38.651 --> 18:41.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIAMA RICHARDS: After the
election, we have
been in constant communication,
which I think

18:41.954 --> 18:45.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is really key to that
partnership with families.

18:45.725 --> 18:49.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the letters we have sent
home have included
additional links for support.

18:49.762 --> 18:54.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in some cases, we have
parents who really
want us to move away and say,
OK, it's over.

18:54.500 --> 18:58.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's now move on with the
practice of going
to school and doing the work.

18:58.704 --> 19:03.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are other families
that are so ultimately
grateful that we're taking that
time to be

19:03.876 --> 19:06.645 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
able to help their children
through this process.

19:06.679 --> 19:11.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think what we have
learned, as a Quaker
school that's embedded in the
value-centered

19:11.384 --> 19:16.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
curriculum, is that we know, if
students do
not feel affirmed, they actually
won't learn.

19:16.989 --> 19:22.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We won't be able to teach math
if they feel
scared and if they feel like
they are at risk.

19:22.161 --> 19:26.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we have to be able to
find a wonderful
balance of incorporating both of
those in

19:26.532 --> 19:28.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the classroom setting.

19:28.401 --> 19:32.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Kavitha
Cardoza, we have
been seeing such an increase on
every educational

19:32.938 --> 19:38.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
level, from middle schools to
high school
to colleges, of acts of
intimidation, bullying,

19:38.711 --> 19:42.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
swastikas spray-painted here and
there.

19:42.248 --> 19:43.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What are you seeing in your
reporting?

19:43.516 --> 19:46.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: A lot more,
Hari.

19:46.719 --> 19:50.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is that these kids share,
tape everything
and share everything on social
media, so it's

19:50.990 --> 19:53.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
much more accessible.

19:53.959 --> 19:59.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think just today on my Twitter
feed, I saw
someone say: My daughter came
home from school

19:59.732 --> 20:04.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and said she heard that she no
longer has
to be politically correct.

20:04.470 --> 20:09.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so you're seeing a lot of
things which
kids, some of them don't even
know what the

20:09.341 --> 20:11.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
implications are and what it
means.

20:11.544 --> 20:17.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But because it's being shared so
widely, kids,
you know, just copy sometimes.

20:17.349 --> 20:18.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

20:18.784 --> 20:21.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Kavitha Cardoza, Mariama
Richards, thank you
both.

20:21.187 --> 20:26.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Thank you,
Hari.

20:26.425 --> 20:35.601 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARIAMA RICHARDS: Thank you.

20:35.634 --> 20:44.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On this Veterans
Day, we turn
to what a Trump administration
might mean

20:44.210 --> 20:46.445 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for those who have served our
country.

20:46.479 --> 20:52.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Election Day, 61 percent of
veterans voted
for Mr. Trump, 34 percent voted
for Secretary

20:52.852 --> 20:54.286 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton.

20:54.320 --> 20:58.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of non-veterans, 45 percent
voted Trump, while
half voted for Clinton.

20:58.457 --> 21:02.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what do vets expect a
President Trump
to do?

21:02.228 --> 21:03.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has more.

21:03.996 --> 21:08.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Candidate
Trump repeatedly
expressed support for those who
served in

21:08.200 --> 21:11.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the U.S. armed forces, and it
showed in the
results on Election Day.

21:11.837 --> 21:16.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he also angered many with
his denigration
of Senator John McCain and of
the Khan family,

21:16.775 --> 21:19.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
whose son died fighting in Iraq.

21:19.044 --> 21:23.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on what veterans might
want from
a Trump administration, I'm
joined by Paul

21:23.449 --> 21:28.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rieckhoff, executive director of
Iraq and
Afghanistan Veterans of America.

21:28.554 --> 21:34.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paul Rieckhoff, as you saw,
Trump was chosen
by veterans 2-1 over Clinton.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why do you think that is?

21:36.428 --> 21:38.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RIECKHOFF, Founder &amp;
Executive Director,
Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of
America:

21:38.197 --> 21:41.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, I think we have got to
start by being
careful about overgeneralizing
veterans.

21:41.600 --> 21:45.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are 22 million in America,
and they
represent a very large group,
but they're

21:45.771 --> 21:47.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
really not a bloc.

21:47.606 --> 21:53.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If you look at the older
veterans, about 18
million or so that haven't
served since 9/11,

21:53.379 --> 21:55.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they tend to be mostly male.

21:55.548 --> 21:57.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They tend to be more white than
the general
population.

21:57.550 --> 22:02.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, really, what some of that is
just a reflection
of the demographics that
supported Trump vs.

22:02.121 --> 22:03.422 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton.

22:03.455 --> 22:05.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the younger generation,
they're about
20 percent female.

22:05.858 --> 22:07.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're much more ethnically
diverse.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think we see some more
political diversity
there.

22:09.395 --> 22:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think what you do see is a
frustration
with the status quo.

22:13.966 --> 22:17.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You see some frustration with
the bureaucracy
in Washington.

22:17.269 --> 22:19.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You see a certain group of folks
who just
don't like Hillary Clinton.

22:19.972 --> 22:25.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that's a very real
problem, just not
in the veterans community, but
more broadly.

22:25.611 --> 22:27.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you see folks that respond
to rhetoric.

22:27.813 --> 22:29.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump talked a big game
on veterans.

22:29.982 --> 22:33.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said it over and over again:
I'm going
to take care of the vets, I'm
going to take

22:33.085 --> 22:34.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
care of the vets.

22:34.920 --> 22:38.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their policies at times were not
that different,
but his rhetoric was much more
aggressive.

22:38.490 --> 22:40.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's a populist issue.

22:40.726 --> 22:44.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People responded to that and
many people believe
that's what he's going to do.

22:44.730 --> 22:49.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been a campaign platform
that he's really
focused on.

22:49.268 --> 22:51.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now we're going to try to hold
him accountable
as he becomes president.

22:51.637 --> 22:56.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it's going to be a capstone
of his presidency,
it is going to be a very hard
series of things

22:56.108 --> 22:57.876 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to accomplish.

22:57.910 --> 23:00.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every president says he is going
to fix the
VA, and most of them leave
without it getting

23:00.813 --> 23:02.581 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
done.

23:02.615 --> 23:04.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, let's say
you're pulled
into the room and you're asked
to counsel

23:04.183 --> 23:06.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him on policy with regards to
veterans.

23:06.518 --> 23:08.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's priority one for you?

23:08.320 --> 23:14.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RIECKHOFF: I think priority
one is to
establish a real strong
leadership group within

23:14.526 --> 23:19.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Washington that is going to make
veterans
at the hub, and not just the VA
at the hub.

23:19.265 --> 23:23.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our conversation over the last
two years,
especially after the VA scandal,
has been

23:23.435 --> 23:25.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
only really framed around the
VA.

23:25.271 --> 23:28.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think there is an epic
opportunity to be
able to open this conversation
to involve

23:28.907 --> 23:33.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
philanthropy, involve the
private sector,
the medical community,
universities.

23:33.379 --> 23:35.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Government can't be the only
solution here.

23:35.281 --> 23:39.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We see it in some of the members
who come
to us in most urgent need; 70
percent are

23:39.351 --> 23:41.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not enrolled in the VA.

23:41.153 --> 23:44.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, we do need to improve the
VA, but we
have got to have a true veteran
strategy that

23:44.890 --> 23:47.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
expands beyond government.

23:47.693 --> 23:49.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama has never really
laid that
out.

23:50.029 --> 23:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We attacked the VA problem after
the scandal
and we heard a lot of good talk
from Congress,

23:54.300 --> 23:59.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but there was never
comprehensive strategy,
after we engaged in multiple
wars, to actually

23:59.371 --> 24:00.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
care for people coming home.

24:00.372 --> 24:01.807 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So we have got to clear goals.

24:01.840 --> 24:02.908 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have got to have a strategy.

24:02.941 --> 24:04.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we need to have the right
team in place.

24:04.310 --> 24:08.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is an opportunity to bring
together a
bipartisan coalition.

24:08.213 --> 24:12.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It might be the only political
issue we can
get Republicans and Democrats
behind together.

24:12.451 --> 24:16.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, for any president,
it would be
a smart issue to come out in the
first year

24:17.022 --> 24:18.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in such a divisive time.

24:18.824 --> 24:22.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Another issue
that's obviously
very, very troubling is the rate
of suicide

24:22.695 --> 24:26.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
among veterans, something like
20 a day, I
believe.

24:26.365 --> 24:31.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What can a president, what can a
presidential
administration do to address
that horrendous

24:31.637 --> 24:33.372 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issue?

24:33.405 --> 24:35.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RIECKHOFF: Well, I think we
have seen
President Obama make tremendous
progress on

24:36.008 --> 24:37.843 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this in simply talking about it.

24:37.876 --> 24:43.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Veterans advocacy groups like
IAVA and others
have been really screaming for
years for help

24:43.048 --> 24:48.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to try to explain that we're
losing our brothers
and sisters to our left and
right tragically

24:48.287 --> 24:50.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to suicide on a daily basis.

24:50.656 --> 24:55.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had a day last year we had
seven suicide
calls to IAVA in one day alone.

24:55.194 --> 24:57.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think it does start with
prioritizing
it.

24:57.563 --> 25:01.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It also starts with
understanding that it's
not just a veterans issue or a
government

25:01.066 --> 25:02.101 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issue.

25:02.134 --> 25:03.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a national health priority.

25:03.402 --> 25:05.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And we have got to rally
resources around
that.

25:05.537 --> 25:09.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when veterans do come
forward and they
overcome the stigma and they
respond to that

25:09.274 --> 25:11.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rhetoric, the help has got to be
there.

25:11.043 --> 25:12.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we have seen wait times.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.113 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have seen bureaucracies.

25:14.146 --> 25:18.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even the Veterans Crisis Line,
which has been
great, struggled at times to
keep up with

25:18.217 --> 25:20.185 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the demand.

25:20.219 --> 25:23.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if those veterans are brave
and are courageous
and are encouraged to come
forward, the resources

25:23.155 --> 25:24.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have got to be there.

25:24.723 --> 25:26.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have got a critical
shortage of quality
mental health care workers.

25:26.992 --> 25:31.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One thing IAVA has called on
President Obama
to do and will call on President
Trump to

25:31.463 --> 25:36.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do is to issue a national call
to service
for people who are qualified
mental health

25:36.535 --> 25:39.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to serve, to serve in the VA, at
the DOD,
in private nonprofits.

25:39.938 --> 25:45.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need an army of mental health
care workers
to support this flood of need
that is coming

25:45.077 --> 25:49.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
home, not just after our wars in
Iraq and
Afghanistan, but after decades
and decades

25:49.515 --> 25:51.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of veterans who have
underserved.

25:51.383 --> 25:54.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many are the veterans that we're
losing to
suicide are Vietnam veterans who
were never

25:54.787 --> 25:55.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
properly cared for.

25:55.988 --> 25:57.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Paul Rieckhoff,
thank you.

25:57.156 --> 26:04.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL RIECKHOFF: Thank you, sir.

26:04.496 --> 26:14.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we come back
to the analysis
of Shields and Brooks.

26:14.239 --> 26:18.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and
New York Times columnist David
Brooks.

26:18.710 --> 26:22.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And let me just kick this off by
saying there's
nobody I would rather spend more
than nine

26:22.681 --> 26:24.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hours with on election night
than the two
of you.

26:24.450 --> 26:25.417 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

26:25.451 --> 26:26.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you so much,
Judy.

26:26.652 --> 26:27.886 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

26:27.920 --> 26:31.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, having said
that, political
earthquake.

26:31.089 --> 26:33.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The earth moved under our feet,
David.

26:33.492 --> 26:35.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How big an earthquake was it?

26:35.294 --> 26:38.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, it's
certainly the political
shock of our lives, at least my
lifetime.

26:39.031 --> 26:43.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It feels like almost the '60s,
sort of like
political revolution, cultural
revolution,

26:44.002 --> 26:49.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aesthetic revolution, the things
that now
you can say and get elected
president.

26:49.842 --> 26:51.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so it was all those things.

26:51.743 --> 26:56.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm sort of finding myself in a
strange emotional
territory, if I could lie on the
couch here.

26:56.515 --> 26:57.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On the one hand, Trump appalls
me.

26:57.950 --> 27:01.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I won't be shy about that.

27:01.053 --> 27:06.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But having -- with the elective
democratic
process having taken its turn, I
sort of feel

27:06.825 --> 27:11.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have to owe some respect to
the process
and owe some respect to the
electorate and

27:11.930 --> 27:16.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the people who voted him, on the
assumption
that they have something to
teach us.

27:16.034 --> 27:18.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so all these people are
marching in the
street.

27:18.170 --> 27:20.005 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is all this hostility.

27:20.038 --> 27:23.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I find myself -- and I think
this was the
president's attitude and frankly
Hillary Clinton's

27:23.141 --> 27:25.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
attitude -- of respectful pause.

27:25.811 --> 27:30.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe I will be as upset at
Trump as I was
in another week, but what do
they try to teach

27:31.016 --> 27:32.184 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us?

27:32.217 --> 27:33.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just try to understand what the
situation
we're in is.

27:33.452 --> 27:35.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Respectful pause,
Mark?

27:35.220 --> 27:36.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

27:36.989 --> 27:42.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I, Judy, believe devoutly that
the national
election is the closest thing we
have to a

27:42.361 --> 27:45.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
civic sacrament of democracy.

27:45.130 --> 27:53.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I really do think that heed
must be paid,
and when people make a decision,
those who

27:53.805 --> 28:00.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are on the other side, including
me, accept
it, for that reason.

28:00.345 --> 28:06.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that probably the best
analysis, of
the millions of words that were
written, other

28:06.785 --> 28:11.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than David's -- David's were
really perceptive
and wise.

28:11.690 --> 28:18.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's a woman named -- I
don't know
her name -- Salena Zito at
"Atlantic."

28:18.730 --> 28:20.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And she said something.

28:20.566 --> 28:28.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She said, to understand this
election, critics
of Donald Trump take him
literally, but not

28:28.574 --> 28:30.309 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
seriously.

28:30.342 --> 28:33.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
His supporters take him
seriously, but not
literally.

28:33.512 --> 28:41.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In other words, so while his
critics were
very upset with what he said,
the -- his supporters

28:41.286 --> 28:48.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really were the mood and the
positions he
took, rather than precise
phrases or words.

28:48.760 --> 28:53.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I say that because now, as of
Tuesday, everyone
has to take him seriously, and I
think that's

28:53.098 --> 28:55.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what we're seeing.

28:55.067 --> 29:03.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the anxiety in schools
that we hear,
in minority communities, those
with the archbishop

29:03.275 --> 29:09.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Los Angeles at Our Lady of
the Saints Cathedral
yesterday at an interfaith
service with Jewish

29:09.748 --> 29:16.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Muslim, and was very open
and said, our
children are fearful that their
parents -- the

29:16.421 --> 29:18.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government is going to come and
take their
parents away.

29:18.924 --> 29:22.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that's a consequence
of the election.

29:22.561 --> 29:28.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, in addition, the fact
that he won,
but his positions appear to
prevail, and I

29:28.634 --> 29:30.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think there have left fear in a
lot of places.

29:30.569 --> 29:34.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, David, I
was going to
ask the two of you what you
think, with reflection,

29:34.039 --> 29:35.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the voters were saying.

29:35.907 --> 29:39.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I also -- I was struck by
what we just
heard a few minutes ago by
voters in Manassas,

29:39.878 --> 29:41.480 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Virginia.

29:41.513 --> 29:46.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One young woman said, I guess --
she said,
I guess hate is now
state-sponsored.

29:46.585 --> 29:52.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we heard a man say --
another woman say,
I'm for immigrants, just the
right immigrants.

29:52.557 --> 29:53.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What were voters saying, do you
think?

29:54.026 --> 29:55.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, they
certainly want change.

29:55.861 --> 29:57.029 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We know that.

29:57.062 --> 29:59.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're fed up with a lot of
talk and no change.

29:59.865 --> 30:02.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On the issues, they preferred
her.

30:02.267 --> 30:05.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She got better marks on the
economy and foreign
policy.

30:05.937 --> 30:08.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they just didn't get the
sense she was
a reformer.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So they want some unnamed
change.

30:10.709 --> 30:13.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think they also wanted some
sense of dignity,
some sense of being heard.

30:13.912 --> 30:18.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, in some sense, there is
something
noble, in that people that was
people who

30:18.483 --> 30:23.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
felt marginalized, working-class
voters, A,
taking over their party from
basically what

30:23.355 --> 30:28.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had been a corporate party, and
then asserting
their will on the country,
against groups

30:28.160 --> 30:32.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of people who were more
privileged than they
are, both on the left and the
right.

30:32.297 --> 30:33.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so there is something nice
about that.

30:33.632 --> 30:36.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think Trump is the wrong
vehicle for that.

30:36.334 --> 30:40.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, you're living in
a town, there
are no jobs in the town, you
know your friends

30:41.006 --> 30:46.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are dying of O.D.-ing on opiates
or something,
you're having trouble paying
your bills, you're

30:46.745 --> 30:51.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
playing by the rules, and other
people are
getting benefits without playing
by the rules.

30:51.083 --> 30:54.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe you're willing to tolerate
a lot of
bigotry from Donald Trump if you
say, just

30:54.286 --> 30:56.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
change things, just change
things.

30:56.655 --> 31:00.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I don't -- I think the
voters who voted
for him certainly are willing to
tolerate

31:00.559 --> 31:04.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of ugliness, but maybe, if
you're in
desperate circumstances, or you
think the

31:04.730 --> 31:08.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country is deeply in trouble,
you're willing
to tolerate that without
necessarily liking

31:09.000 --> 31:09.968 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

31:10.001 --> 31:10.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What did you
hear?

31:11.002 --> 31:12.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you think the voters
were saying?

31:12.904 --> 31:16.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, the first
thing that bothers
me are my liberal friends, or
too many of

31:16.608 --> 31:20.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them, I think who immediately
run to the race
card.

31:20.445 --> 31:28.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact is that it's the most
dangerous place
to be on the political scale is
to brand those

31:28.420 --> 31:31.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on the other side as racist.

31:31.223 --> 31:32.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's the atomic bomb.

31:32.390 --> 31:35.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the nuclear weapon of an
American.

31:35.060 --> 31:40.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once I accuse you of racist, I
have demonized
you, and it means any future
collaboration,

31:40.866 --> 31:46.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cooperation between us is a sign
of my moral
deficiency, if I would deal with
someone like

31:46.538 --> 31:47.506 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

31:47.539 --> 31:48.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's just -- it's a terrible
thing to do.

31:48.540 --> 31:50.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I say that for a factual reason.

31:50.542 --> 31:53.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Barack Obama carried Iowa,
carried Wisconsin,
carried Michigan.

31:53.678 --> 31:56.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He not only carried Iowa,
Wisconsin and Michigan
twice.

31:56.882 --> 32:01.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He carried the white -- a
majority of the
white vote in those states.

32:01.086 --> 32:09.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so Hillary Clinton lost
them, Donald Trump
won them, and it's a little, I
think, transparent,

32:09.227 --> 32:11.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
false to say that the people are
racist.

32:11.363 --> 32:17.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are the same voters who
would vote for
an African-American man and
didn't vote for

32:17.402 --> 32:18.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the white woman Democrat.

32:18.970 --> 32:21.039 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I think that's dangerous.

32:21.072 --> 32:25.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, Judy, it was a revolt
of working-class
Americans.

32:25.544 --> 32:28.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it was a revolt against
us in the
press.

32:28.446 --> 32:34.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it was a revolt against
the ruling
class who were indifferent to
their plight,

32:34.953 --> 32:40.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to the fact that, for a
generation, their
standard of living has declined
or that their

32:40.225 --> 32:42.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
children's futures are blighted.

32:42.994 --> 32:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought Peter Hart and Dan
McGinn, when
they wrote that the people who
led this revolution

32:48.166 --> 32:51.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are foreign to Washington and
New York, they
don't go to Starbucks and they
don't take

32:51.837 --> 32:58.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their children on tours, they
care about high
school sports more than about
pro sports,

32:58.343 --> 33:01.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they go to Wal-Mart, McDonald's,
and they
have declining incomes, and they
think their

33:02.013 --> 33:04.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
grandparents and parents built
this country.

33:04.249 --> 33:06.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They scream that they want their
country back.

33:06.484 --> 33:11.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that -- I think they
saw indifference
from the ruling elites, both
public and private,

33:11.823 --> 33:12.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
particularly private.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You said it
wasn't race.

33:14.559 --> 33:18.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, yet, David, people -- many
people of
color are saying they feel the
message is

33:19.030 --> 33:20.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
directed at them.

33:20.098 --> 33:21.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Right.

33:21.099 --> 33:22.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, there is a racial element
here.

33:22.400 --> 33:25.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is clearly a racial
element.

33:25.337 --> 33:30.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think that I don't have
a machine
to peer into the souls of the
voters.

33:30.609 --> 33:34.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I don't know how much of the
racial element
was dominant, how much was
there, something

33:34.412 --> 33:36.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they tolerated, something they
endorsed.

33:36.147 --> 33:38.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Clearly, for some people, it was
a large element.

33:38.650 --> 33:42.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do not believe, having spent
these last
many months interviewing Trump
voters, that

33:42.888 --> 33:46.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's a dominant element in at
least a lot
of the people I spoke to.

33:46.424 --> 33:52.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They had good reason, as Mark
just elucidated,
for why they were really upset
with the course

33:52.330 --> 33:54.232 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the country.

33:54.266 --> 34:00.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their culture, their life
economically, socially,
families breaking apart, drug
use, it's going

34:00.138 --> 34:02.207 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
downhill.

34:02.240 --> 34:07.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the two things --
one, we don't
want to turn this into a
children of light,

34:07.212 --> 34:11.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children of darkness, where us
college-enlightened
people, educated, enlightened
people are looking

34:11.182 --> 34:12.684 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
down at those primitive hordes.

34:12.717 --> 34:14.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We do not want that.

34:14.419 --> 34:18.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's what -- that
condescension is what
fueled this thing in the first
place.

34:18.189 --> 34:20.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so I don't think we want
that.

34:20.258 --> 34:24.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Second, through American
history, we have
had populist movements that
often, often,

34:24.930 --> 34:26.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
often have this ugly racial
element.

34:26.598 --> 34:31.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, often, there are warning
signs of some
deeper social and economic
problem.

34:31.670 --> 34:36.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have rapidly increasing
technology,
which is making life very good
for people

34:36.174 --> 34:41.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are good at using words, and
not so good
for people who are not good at
using words.

34:41.212 --> 34:49.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so the ugliness can
sometimes be super
ugly, but also a warning sign of
something

34:49.120 --> 34:50.188 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
down below.

34:50.221 --> 34:51.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, I agree with
what David
said.

34:51.990 --> 34:55.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would just add, Judy, that the
problem is
that what Donald Trump said, if
you take it

34:55.427 --> 34:58.964 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
literally now, is cause for
anxiety and nervousness.

34:58.997 --> 35:00.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean during
the campaign.

35:00.966 --> 35:05.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: What he said
during the campaign,
I mean, is -- it's legitimate,
the anxiety

35:05.236 --> 35:10.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the nervousness that you
feel and that
children feel right now, because
-- if you

35:10.075 --> 35:11.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
do take him literally.

35:11.943 --> 35:20.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has to do something to
reassure, and beyond
tweeting that he either likes or
doesn't like

35:20.585 --> 35:22.454 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
protests.

35:22.487 --> 35:26.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just -- the protests, the
breaking of windows
at this point, I mean, I just
want anybody

35:26.491 --> 35:32.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the protest to have an "I
voted" sticker
on their jacket lapel before
they get out

35:32.764 --> 35:34.099 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

35:34.132 --> 35:39.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I understand the concern,
but please accept
this democracy.

35:39.070 --> 35:41.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he is the president.

35:41.172 --> 35:45.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's going to be the president
in 75 days,
or whatever.

35:45.176 --> 35:51.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, he now has a
responsibility,
I think, to calm those waters
and to reassure

35:51.783 --> 35:55.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people that there isn't going to
be -- there
aren't going to be Storm
Troopers coming down

35:55.186 --> 35:58.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to take their grandparents in a
patrol wagon.

35:58.590 --> 36:02.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly, in
the last couple
of minutes, David, we are seeing
some signals

36:02.560 --> 36:07.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Donald Trump or the people
he has put
on his transition committee,
putting in the

36:07.132 --> 36:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vice president-elect, instead of
Chris Christie.

36:09.034 --> 36:13.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's putting his children, his
son-in-law
on that committee.

36:13.038 --> 36:16.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said today that he's -- in an
interview
with The Wall Street Journal
that he's thinking

36:16.941 --> 36:22.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about keeping part of the health
care reform
law after talking to President
Obama about

36:22.213 --> 36:23.181 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

36:23.214 --> 36:25.016 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, what are we to think?

36:25.050 --> 36:29.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe this is not going to be
all the big
moves that were hinted at during
the campaign?

36:29.554 --> 36:31.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I'm obviously
outraged Tiffany
didn't get a job.

36:32.023 --> 36:35.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maybe she will get Fed chairman
or something.

36:35.093 --> 36:40.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think when -- the nomination
of Mike Pence
is more of a sign that he's
going for conventional

36:40.231 --> 36:42.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Republicans.

36:42.133 --> 36:45.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Until last summer, Pence was a
very conventional
-- he was in the House, well
connected with

36:45.603 --> 36:47.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the conventional movement
Republicans.

36:47.772 --> 36:50.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I assume he will tap, he may
be more conventional.

36:50.375 --> 36:54.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Donald Trump is going to
find it very
hard to do the kind of massive
change he wants.

36:54.813 --> 36:56.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obamacare is woven into the
fabric of health
care.

36:56.681 --> 37:00.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's very hard to just rip it
out, as he sort
of acknowledged with The Wall
Street Journal.

37:00.852 --> 37:05.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Iran deal, maybe we can
withdraw from
the deal, but our other partners
are not going

37:05.290 --> 37:07.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to withdraw from the deal.

37:07.092 --> 37:09.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you get down to each of
these individual
things, deporting people, when
you get down

37:10.028 --> 37:14.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to each of the individual
things, the barriers
to change are massive.

37:14.099 --> 37:17.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the simple promises he makes
just don't
apply to reality.

37:17.102 --> 37:20.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So he's got to do some big
changes, because
what he was voted on.

37:20.238 --> 37:24.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when you think about how to
do it, it
would take massive expertise,
which his people,

37:24.709 --> 37:25.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
believe me, do not have.

37:25.710 --> 37:26.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just 20 seconds,
Mark.

37:26.778 --> 37:28.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you think he...

37:28.613 --> 37:34.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, 213 times to
vote to repeal
Obamacare, it's a very easy,
grandstand act.

37:34.552 --> 37:38.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Doing it and taking 20 million
people and
taking them off insurance, those
with preexisting

37:38.957 --> 37:45.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conditions, those who don't have
any other
coverage, you know, that's a
reality.

37:45.296 --> 37:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it is going to be difficult,
make no mistake
about it.

37:48.299 --> 37:52.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is where you confront
reality from
the rhetoric of the campaign.

37:52.036 --> 37:54.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The transition
begins.

37:54.205 --> 38:04.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mark Shields, David Brooks,
thank you both.

38:04.315 --> 38:13.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mark Shields, David Brooks,
thank you both.

Paris will mark a grim
anniversary Sunday,
one year after a series of
coordinated attacks

38:18.963 --> 38:23.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
across the city on Friday the
13th, 2015.

The Bataclan music club, where
89 people were
murdered during a concert, is
due to reopen

38:28.806 --> 38:31.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tomorrow with a concert by
Sting.

38:31.776 --> 38:38.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gunmen and suicide bombers
allied to ISIS
murdered 130 people in total,
wounding nearly

38:38.349 --> 38:40.218 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
400.

Special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant has
been back to Paris to see how
the French capital

38:43.821 --> 38:46.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is coping one year on.

38:46.090 --> 38:51.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Paris has
returned to a version
of normality, but for those
caught up in the

38:51.629 --> 38:56.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worst attack on the French
capital since the
Second World War, nothing will
ever be the

38:56.301 --> 38:58.069 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
same again.

38:58.102 --> 39:03.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a discreet corner of this
cafe is Caroline
Langlade, a survivor of the
Bataclan.

39:03.341 --> 39:08.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Along with several others, she
hid in a tiny
room for over three hours.

39:08.346 --> 39:11.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They barricaded the door with a
sofa and mini-fridge.

39:11.950 --> 39:16.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The terrorists tried to get in,
failed and
resumed the massacre they began
while the

39:16.921 --> 39:18.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
band was on stage.

39:18.790 --> 39:20.592 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(GUNFIRE)

39:20.625 --> 39:26.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROLINE LANGLADE, President,
Life for Paris
(through translator): I have a
really hard

39:26.798 --> 39:31.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time going to closed-up places
or dark rooms,
movies, concerts, but also
restaurants where

39:31.970 --> 39:32.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there's too many people at
night.

39:33.004 --> 39:35.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It makes me quite jumpy.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.842 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I tend to panic.

39:37.875 --> 39:44.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: During the
interview, sirens
wailed nearby, and Caroline
became uncomfortable.

39:44.983 --> 39:49.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The film director has found it
difficult to
concentrate on work and instead
devotes her

39:49.120 --> 39:54.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
energies running Life for Paris,
an organization
for survivors and families of
those murdered

39:54.659 --> 39:56.060 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on Friday the 13th.

39:56.094 --> 40:00.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAROLINE LANGLADE (through
translator): I'm
no longer afraid of death.

40:00.298 --> 40:04.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have seen it up close, and I
almost died
several times that night.

40:04.335 --> 40:07.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm no longer afraid of death,
but my fear
changed.

40:07.472 --> 40:13.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, today, what frightens me
most is suffering,
physical suffering, human
suffering.

40:13.411 --> 40:17.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had to face a gigantic amount
of it that
evening, and I think that I have
lived through

40:17.915 --> 40:20.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all the suffering I could have
had for a lifetime.

40:20.618 --> 40:25.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This video
captured the panic
and bravery of survivors as they
fled the

40:25.690 --> 40:30.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bataclan and tried to drag the
wounded and
dying to safety.

40:30.128 --> 40:34.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parents watching the atrocities
unfold on
television desperately hoped
their children

40:34.332 --> 40:37.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
had made it through the
emergency exits.

40:37.035 --> 40:44.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For Georges Salines, the
anniversary rekindles
the agony of discovering that
his music-loving

40:44.175 --> 40:46.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
daughter, Lola, was one of the
89 murder victims.

40:46.711 --> 40:50.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /GEORGES SALINES, Father
of Victim:
What I miss the most is simply
talking to

40:50.782 --> 40:59.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her and listening to her about
her new discoveries,
because she was always full of
projects.

40:59.757 --> 41:02.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For me, the most important thing
was writing.

41:02.694 --> 41:04.862 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I wrote a book.

41:04.896 --> 41:09.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And after publishing my book, I
kept on writing.

41:09.100 --> 41:15.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And writing has been very
helpful, because
it helps me to put some distance
between my

41:15.073 --> 41:16.841 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pain and me.

41:16.874 --> 41:22.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: After a year of
silence,
the Bataclan is about to be
revived as a concert

41:22.180 --> 41:27.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hall for the living, no longer
just a shrine
to contemplate the unspeakable.

41:28.019 --> 41:32.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One year after Friday the 13th,
France remains
under a state of emergency.

41:32.323 --> 41:38.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The powers were expanded and
extended after
the horrific attack in Nice,
when a terrorist

41:38.396 --> 41:43.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
took a truck and mowed down
people, killing
86 and wounding nearly 500.

41:43.968 --> 41:48.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
France's interior minister says
the country
cannot live in an indefinite
state of emergency.

41:49.006 --> 41:54.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And groups like Human Rights
Watch have warned
that the continued use of the
powers erodes

41:54.345 --> 41:59.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the rule of law and undermines
the rights
of citizens.

41:59.117 --> 42:04.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Eiffel Tower and other
landmarks may radiate
an abiding allure, but terrorism
has cast

42:04.722 --> 42:07.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a permanent shadow on the City
of Light.

42:07.725 --> 42:12.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's no longer possible to take
a leisurely
stroll beneath the steel
latticework without

42:12.864 --> 42:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first undergoing security
screening.

42:15.733 --> 42:21.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The impression that this is a
country on a
war footing with an invisible
enemy is reinforced

42:21.239 --> 42:23.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by military patrols.

42:23.241 --> 42:28.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Colombe Brossel, the deputy
mayor, with responsibility
for security issues, says the
authorities

42:28.746 --> 42:30.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are trying to strike a balance.

42:30.548 --> 42:33.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COLOMBE BROSSEL, Deputy Mayor of
Paris (through
translator): Our wish, our
directive line,

42:33.217 --> 42:37.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is to say, we have to give our
best, our maximum
when it comes to security
questions.

42:37.889 --> 42:42.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, of course, the way we
organize the events
is different compared to 18
months ago, two

42:42.326 --> 42:44.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or five years ago.

42:44.128 --> 42:48.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we remain adamant on the
fact that Paris
needs to remain a city where
anyone can go

42:48.132 --> 42:51.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out, where we can have events in
the public
space, where we can share
moments of pleasure

42:52.003 --> 42:53.771 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and happiness.

42:53.805 --> 42:56.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANCOIS GERE, President, French
Strategic
Analysis Institute: The Islamic
State is losing

42:56.607 --> 43:00.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ground, is losing also prestige
and glory.

43:00.878 --> 43:05.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Historian
Francois Gere,
president of the French
Strategic Analysis

43:05.817 --> 43:11.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Institute, believes that France
will almost
certainly be hit again by
Islamic State, although

43:11.255 --> 43:14.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
he's convinced the
organization's potency
is diminishing.

43:14.425 --> 43:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANCOIS GERE: It's obvious that
the Islamic
State will try to send
additional people in

43:21.699 --> 43:27.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
order to perpetrate attacks and
terrorist
aggressions in Europe.

43:27.538 --> 43:33.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is still a period of high
danger during
the coming six months.

43:33.644 --> 43:35.680 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
After that, it will decrease.

43:35.713 --> 43:40.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The Marais is
one district
that's especially vigilant, not
least because

43:40.218 --> 43:43.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the high concentration of
Jewish businesses
and institutions.

43:43.621 --> 43:47.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We're
scared, but
we have to keep living normally.

43:47.492 --> 43:51.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): At
every synagogue
and school, you have dozens of
soldiers.

43:51.262 --> 43:54.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm relaxed about it because
it's easier for
us Jews to wear the kippa.

43:54.365 --> 44:00.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: During this whole year, I
think the
thing was to say to yourself,
keep on living.

44:00.872 --> 44:06.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You cannot live in fear, and you
just need
to carry on your daily life as
normal.

44:06.677 --> 44:10.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Otherwise, yes, where do we go?

44:10.348 --> 44:15.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Stephane
Balensi is considering
selling his clothes shop.

44:15.520 --> 44:18.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sales have plunged by 40 percent
over the
past year.

44:18.890 --> 44:23.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Although he's reassured by
military patrols,
he believes they frighten
tourists away.

44:23.528 --> 44:27.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHANE BALENSI, Business Owner
(through
translator): It started with the
13th of November.

44:27.732 --> 44:32.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Quite clearly, ever since the
Bataclan and
then during the normally busy
summer season,

44:32.270 --> 44:33.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we had the Nice attacks.

44:33.671 --> 44:35.840 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's the same, far less tourism.

44:35.873 --> 44:41.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Beligh Nabli is
a political
scientist and analyst of the
Islamic world.

44:41.045 --> 44:45.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says intolerance towards
Muslims has become
more overt since the attacks.

44:45.950 --> 44:49.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BELIGH NABLI, Political
Scientist (through
translator): A lot of people
kept their Islamophobia

44:49.320 --> 44:53.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hidden before, but now they feel
it's OK to
express their aversion and
criticism of Islam

44:53.558 --> 44:56.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in general and towards Muslims
in particular.

44:56.327 --> 45:00.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's created a new social
tension, which has
given more justification to the
jihadis in

45:00.298 --> 45:04.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their strategy of dividing
French society
in order to lure back the Muslim
community

45:04.936 --> 45:06.704 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to their cause.

45:06.737 --> 45:10.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: France is
gearing up for
a presidential election in six
months' time.

45:10.741 --> 45:15.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The latest opinion polls suggest
that almost
a third of the electorate
believe the hard-line

45:15.446 --> 45:20.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stance of Marine Le Pen, leader
of the right-wing
National Front, would make the
country a safer

45:21.018 --> 45:22.753 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
place.

45:22.787 --> 45:29.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the divisions in society
exposed by last
year's attacks worry those most
affected.

45:29.694 --> 45:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGES SALINES: Candidates are
playing this
card, and it's a very dangerous
path, because

45:35.766 --> 45:46.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the most important thing is to
be precise
in targeting the terrorists, the
extremists,

45:46.611 --> 45:54.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Da'esh, and not doing anything
which could
help them to recruit.

45:54.452 --> 45:59.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROLINE LANGLADE (through
translator): I
think that the most beautiful
response we

45:59.156 --> 46:03.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can give the terrorists is love,
joy, happiness,
culture, music.

46:03.561 --> 46:06.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we need to keep this going
as loud as
possible.

46:06.497 --> 46:13.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, yes, I hope we will continue
even stronger,
that people will realize that
life isn't about

46:13.371 --> 46:14.639 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the money.

46:14.672 --> 46:17.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Life doesn't revolve around the
little problems
we might have.

46:17.975 --> 46:21.579 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Life is love.

46:21.612 --> 46:29.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But while Paris
puts on a
brave face, a new survey shows
that terrorism

46:29.120 --> 46:33.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
remains the biggest concern of
almost half
the French population.

46:33.924 --> 46:38.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They fear that Islamic State
will follow through
on a threat made earlier this
year to intensify

46:38.896 --> 46:43.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attacks on France in revenge for
its military
role against the caliphate, a
world away from

46:43.634 --> 46:44.802 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Notre Dame.

46:44.835 --> 46:45.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Paris.

48:00.711 --> 48:01.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later tonight on "Washington
Week": Questions
remain about why voters in the
country's heartland

48:01.712 --> 48:02.680 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
felt they were not being heard.

48:02.713 --> 48:04.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is there a Washington bubble?

48:04.181 --> 48:06.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Washington Week"'s reporters
have some answers
on your PBS station.

48:06.050 --> 48:06.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tomorrow, on "PBS NewsHour
Weekend": a closer
look at president-elect Trump's
ideas to sprout

48:06.751 --> 48:07.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
investments in infrastructure.

48:07.685 --> 48:08.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

48:08.185 --> 48:09.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

48:09.286 --> 48:09.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After this earthquake of a week,
enjoy the
weekend.

48:09.920 --> 48:10.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you, and good night.
