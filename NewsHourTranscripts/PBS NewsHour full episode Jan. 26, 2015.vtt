JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:07.641 --> 00:12.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: The
federal government
closes for a second day and the
death toll

00:12.813 --> 00:18.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
climbs, as the East continues to
dig itself
out of that massive snowfall.

00:18.552 --> 00:24.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: President Obama bans
solitary confinement
for juveniles in federal prison,
saying the

00:24.958 --> 00:28.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
practice has lasting and
devastating effects.

00:29.029 --> 00:35.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we celebrate the birthday of
genius composer
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart by
taking apart one

00:35.736 --> 00:37.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of his masterpieces.

00:37.237 --> 00:39.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW, Composer: This is
on everybody's
cell phone ring tone.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: Everyone has heard
this. Even
if you think you have never
heard a note of...

00:43.277 --> 00:43.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

00:43.744 --> 00:44.978 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

00:45.078 --> 00:46.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: ... music, this is
the one you
have heard.

00:46.446 --> 00:52.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:52.786 --> 00:55.555 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:55.656 --> 01:05.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: More people and
places along
the snowbound East Coast got
back to normal

01:05.999 --> 01:12.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and got back to work today. But
the death
toll rose to 45, and, in
Washington, D.C.,

01:12.372 --> 01:16.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
especially, there was still a
lot of digging
out to do.

01:16.276 --> 01:22.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The nation's capital lurched
slowly back to
life on this third day after the
great blizzard.

01:22.449 --> 01:28.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Federal offices remained closed,
but work
crews were out early to clear
more snow, and

01:28.322 --> 01:30.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the mayor sounded cautiously
optimistic.

01:30.257 --> 01:34.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MURIEL BOWSER (D), Mayor of
Washington, D.C.:
We have finished two full days
of plowing

01:34.127 --> 01:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and removal, and our crews made
good progress
through the night. They have
gotten down to

01:39.967 --> 01:41.868 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
asphalt on all major arteries.

01:41.969 --> 01:47.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Washington's
subway system
was also back to near-normal
operations, albeit

01:47.507 --> 01:54.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with some delays. But many side
streets remained
unplowed, and emergency manager
Chris Geldart

01:54.982 --> 01:57.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said the focus now is getting
into those neighborhoods.

01:57.284 --> 01:59.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER GELDART, Director,
D.C. Homeland
Security and Emergency
Management Agency:

01:59.219 --> 02:04.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That operation will continue
through today
and through tonight. We're
monitoring progress

02:04.524 --> 02:08.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every two hours on where we are
to ensure
that we have no areas in the
city that we

02:08.495 --> 02:10.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have not touched and that are
not passable.

02:10.897 --> 02:17.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That effort will
be vital to
reopening D.C. public schools
tomorrow.

02:17.237 --> 02:22.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another concern: how to pay for
the massive
cleanup effort that's eating up
most of the

02:22.342 --> 02:29.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
city's annual snow removal
budget of $6.2
million. D.C. officials have
asked for federal

02:29.750 --> 02:36.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disaster assistance. And another
kind of help
arrived today in the form of a
snow melter,

02:36.423 --> 02:41.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on loan from Indianapolis. It
was quickly
deployed to tackle the mountains
of snow being

02:42.062 --> 02:43.864 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
collected from city streets.

02:43.964 --> 02:49.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: We have water inside this,
like, a giant
hot tub, basically, get the BTUs
to get the

02:49.302 --> 02:52.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
temperature up to a certain
level, then just
start loading it.

02:52.372 --> 02:57.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, New
York City with
a much larger snow budget has
recovered more

02:57.377 --> 03:02.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
quickly and is already clearing
outer boroughs
of snow.

03:02.616 --> 03:07.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news, Wall
Street surged
ahead as oil prices turned
higher again. The

03:07.954 --> 03:15.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dow Jones industrial average
gained more than
280 points to close at 16167.
The Nasdaq rose

03:15.695 --> 03:20.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
49 points, and the S&amp;P 500 added
26.

03:20.100 --> 03:25.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A congressional task force today
called for
keeping more nonviolent
criminals out of federal

03:25.705 --> 03:31.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prison, and saving $5 billion in
the process.
The panel recommended
prosecuting -- quote

03:31.745 --> 03:37.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- "only the most serious cases"
and repealing
mandatory minimum penalties for
many drug

03:37.551 --> 03:44.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
offenses. That could cut the
federal prison
population by 60,000 in 2024.
It's now nearly

03:45.058 --> 03:46.927 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
200,000.

03:47.027 --> 03:52.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Syria, bombings erupted in
the central
part of the country, killing at
least 20 people

03:52.599 --> 03:57.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and wounding more than 100. The
Islamic State
group claimed responsibility for
the attacks

03:58.004 --> 04:04.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Homs. They struck just three
days before
peace talks are supposed to
begin, and left

04:04.144 --> 04:07.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
refugee officials warning of the
price of
failure.

04:07.380 --> 04:10.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAN EGELAND, Secretary-General,
Norwegian
Refugee Council: As we do now
have momentum

04:10.283 --> 04:19.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get agreements, we can, as
humanitarians,
reach the besieged areas, all of
them, within

04:19.192 --> 04:25.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
days of the agreement. All of
the millions,
we ought to reach within weeks.
We can do

04:26.066 --> 04:35.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it. So, finally, if they lose
this momentum,
I think they will live to regret
it.

04:35.342 --> 04:40.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, Syrian
opposition
groups backed by Saudi Arabia
met in Riyadh

04:40.647 --> 04:46.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to decide whether to attend the
peace talks.
And Russia pushed for the main
Syrian Kurdish

04:46.419 --> 04:52.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
party to participate, despite
opposition from
Turkey, which considers it a
terrorist group.

04:52.726 --> 04:58.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A policeman in Afghanistan shot
dead 10 other
officers late Monday in the
country's latest

04:59.032 --> 05:04.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
insider attack. It happened in
the south,
in Uruzgan province, bordering
the Taliban

05:04.804 --> 05:10.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strongholds of Helmand and
Kandahar. One local
official said the victims were
sleeping when

05:10.777 --> 05:16.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they were killed. Another said
they'd been
drugged. The Taliban claimed
responsibility.

05:16.683 --> 05:22.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Travel warnings about the
mosquito-borne Zika
virus expanded today to the U.S.
Virgin Islands

05:23.023 --> 05:27.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the Dominican Republic. The
Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention
said pregnant

05:27.327 --> 05:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women should consider postponing
any visit
there and to 22 other
destinations. Most are

05:33.833 --> 05:39.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Caribbean and in Latin
America. The
virus is being linked to birth
defects.

05:39.573 --> 05:45.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The official design for a new
World War I
memorial has been unveiled in
Washington.

05:45.412 --> 05:51.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Artist renderings today show
walls bearing
relief sculptures of soldiers,
with quotations.

05:51.751 --> 06:00.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Each cubic foot represents an
American soldier
who died in the war, a total of
116,516. The

06:00.860 --> 06:05.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
memorial will be located near
the White House
in a small urban park.

06:05.966 --> 06:10.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Something old is new again in
the world of
Peter Rabbit. There's word today
that an unpublished

06:11.071 --> 06:16.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
story by renowned children's
author Beatrix
Potter is bound for bookstores,
more than

06:16.209 --> 06:18.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a century after it was written.

06:18.645 --> 06:21.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sharon Thomas of Independent
Television News
has the story.

06:22.015 --> 06:27.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHARON THOMAS: "Once upon a
time, there was
a serious, well-behaved young
black cat. It

06:27.887 --> 06:33.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
belonged to a kind old lady who
assured me
that no other cats could compare
with Kitty.

06:33.627 --> 06:38.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The tale of "Kitty-in-Boots"
tells the story
of a well-behaved cat who leads
a double life.

06:39.032 --> 06:46.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more than a century, it lay
undiscovered.
Beatrix Potter penned 23 books
in her lifetime.

06:46.106 --> 06:51.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now a 24th has been unearthed.
The tale of
"Kitty-in-Boots" was referenced
in an out-of-print

06:51.945 --> 06:56.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
biography on the author. Three
manuscripts
were then found in the Victoria
and Albert

06:56.750 --> 06:58.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Museum archive in London.

06:58.718 --> 07:05.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her classic "Peter Rabbit" has
been published
in 36 languages, and sold more
than 45 million

07:05.558 --> 07:10.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
copies. Beatrix Potter had only
completed
a single drawing to go with
"Kitty-in-Boots."

07:11.064 --> 07:14.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The rest will be created by
illustrator Quentin
Blake.

07:14.134 --> 07:17.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICIA ROUTLEDGE, Beatrix
Potter Society:
I mean, it will go like a hot
cake. It's tantalizing,

07:17.804 --> 07:21.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but, of course, the announcement
has been
made now.

07:22.075 --> 07:28.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHARON THOMAS: This July marks
the 150th anniversary
of Beatrix Potter's birth. The
tale of "Kitty-in-Boots"

07:28.848 --> 07:31.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will be published in September.

07:31.117 --> 07:36.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the story
that started
it all, "The Tale of Peter
Rabbit," was first

07:36.323 --> 07:39.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
published in 1902.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And two passings of note.

07:41.594 --> 07:47.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Actor Abe Vigoda died today in
Woodland Park,
New Jersey. He was best known as
the mafia

07:47.267 --> 07:53.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
captain Tessio in "The
Godfather," and as
the sad-sack Detective Fish in
the 1970s TV

07:53.940 --> 07:58.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
series "Barney Miller." Abe
Vigoda was 94
years old.

07:58.745 --> 08:05.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Concepcion Picciotto has
died at a Washington
homeless shelter. She staged a
three-decade

08:05.251 --> 08:11.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
peace vigil outside the White
House, the longest
political protest in American
history.

08:11.791 --> 08:16.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
an end to
solitary confinement for
juveniles; the fine

08:16.763 --> 08:22.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
line between promoting security
and fear on
the campaign trail; a push for
an alternative

08:22.969 --> 08:36.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to college; and much more.

08:36.583 --> 08:41.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the latter part of his
tenure, President
Obama has put criminal justice
reform high

08:41.521 --> 08:43.390 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on his agenda.

08:43.490 --> 08:49.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His latest move includes a new
ban on solitary
confinement for juveniles in the
federal prison

08:49.562 --> 08:55.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
system. The executive actions
also put new
limits on how long federal
prison officials

08:55.168 --> 08:58.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can use solitary for first-time
offenses.

08:58.405 --> 09:03.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Department of Justice caps
its use at
two months, rather than a full
year. And the

09:03.877 --> 09:09.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president prohibited federal
officers from
using solitary for low-level
infractions.

09:09.582 --> 09:11.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has our look.

09:11.418 --> 09:14.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
president's changes
would affect about 10,000
federal inmates

09:15.021 --> 09:16.890 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a year.

09:16.990 --> 09:19.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In an op-ed published in The
Washington Post,
the president cited the case of
Kalief Browder,

09:19.626 --> 09:25.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who went to prison at the age of
16 and committed
suicide at 22, about two years
after he was

09:25.565 --> 09:29.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
released. He spent nearly two
years in solitary
at Rikers Island.

09:30.069 --> 09:33.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the op-ed, the president says
-- quote
-- "Solitary confinement has the
potential

09:33.807 --> 09:38.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to lead to devastating, lasting
psychological
consequences. The United States
is a nation

09:38.978 --> 09:44.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of second chances, but the
experience of solitary
confinement too often undercuts
that second

09:44.150 --> 09:45.919 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
chance."

09:46.019 --> 09:49.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We discuss these changes with
Shaka Senghor,
who was convicted of
second-degree murder

09:49.155 --> 09:53.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and sent to prison at the age of
19, and during
parts of his sentence, he spent
a total of

09:53.927 --> 10:00.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seven years in solitary. He's
written a memoir
and is with the group #Cut50, a
national bipartisan

10:00.200 --> 10:05.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
initiative to reduce the prison
population.
And Maurice Chammah of The
Marshall Project,

10:05.672 --> 10:09.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a not-for-profit news
organization covering
the criminal justice system.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maurice, I want to start with
you.

10:11.411 --> 10:15.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the critiques here is
that this is
going to affect a very small
population in

10:15.782 --> 10:20.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
federal prison, compared to the
large populations
that we have in state prisons.
How significant

10:21.020 --> 10:22.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is this impact going to be?

10:22.288 --> 10:24.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAURICE CHAMMAH, The Marshall
Project: That's
true.

10:24.224 --> 10:27.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's kind of hard to tell at
this moment sort
of how widespread it will be.
One of the things

10:27.927 --> 10:33.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president has done has been
to ban solitary
confinement for juveniles in the
system, and

10:33.199 --> 10:38.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the federal prison system,
there's maybe
a dozen of that sort of inmate.
But across

10:39.072 --> 10:44.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the states, in state prisons and
jails, like
Rikers Island, where Kalief
Browder was, there

10:44.410 --> 10:48.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are thousands of juveniles who
are sometimes
held in solitary confinement.

10:48.314 --> 10:54.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the president's actions
won't affect them,
though it is a signal, of
course, to people

10:54.587 --> 10:57.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who run prison systems around
the country
that the kind of national mood
is shifting

10:57.991 --> 10:59.859 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on this.

10:59.959 --> 11:02.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Shaka, I'm
sure you're excited
about the president's
announcement today,

11:02.762 --> 11:08.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but tell us a bit of why you
think this is
important. You had been in
solitary. What

11:08.134 --> 11:10.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did it do to you in the short
term and in
the long term?

11:10.904 --> 11:14.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHAKA SENGHOR, #Cut50: Well, I'm
super excited
about the president's decision
today, because

11:14.440 --> 11:18.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know the impact that it is
going to have
on men and women who are
currently in solitary

11:18.444 --> 11:20.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
confinement in the federal
prison system.

11:20.680 --> 11:26.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for me, personally, knowing
the devastating
impact of being in the most
barbaric and inhumane

11:26.386 --> 11:31.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
environment, locked down for 23
hours a day,
and in some cases 24 hours a
day, I just think

11:31.824 --> 11:36.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that it's one of those type of
moments where
it helps people to think about,
you know,

11:36.796 --> 11:41.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what our responsibility is in
terms of men
and women who come home from
prison.

11:41.234 --> 11:44.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have a choice. We have a
choice whether
we want to bring home healthy
men and women

11:45.038 --> 11:49.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or broken men and women. And
when I was in
solitary confinement, I remember
dealing with

11:49.275 --> 11:53.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
depression and dealing with, you
know, the
feeling of hopelessness. And
when you have

11:53.746 --> 11:57.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
somebody incarcerated, the last
thing you
want to do is leave them with a
sense of hopelessness.

11:57.850 --> 12:02.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What did it do
to you when
you were coming out? What kind
of effects

12:02.255 --> 12:05.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did you still have to deal with
and maybe
even deal with today?

12:05.325 --> 12:09.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHAKA SENGHOR: Well, after -- I
served a total
of seven years in solitary
confinement, and

12:09.696 --> 12:11.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at one point four-and-a-half
years straight.

12:11.864 --> 12:16.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the things that I
struggled with
getting out was the ability to
just communicate

12:16.269 --> 12:21.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in normal ways with everyday
people. I wasn't
very trustworthy of people
touching me or

12:21.841 --> 12:27.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
standing behind me. I dealt with
sensory deprivation.
I dealt with depth of field
perception.

12:27.347 --> 12:32.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'll tell you, there was -- I
had a little
struggle driving and being able
to adjust

12:32.452 --> 12:38.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because I had been in a box for
so long. And
so it's small, nuanced things.
And, fortunately,

12:38.524 --> 12:44.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was literate while I was in
solitary, so
I was able to read books about
Nelson Mandela

12:44.230 --> 12:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that kept me focused and kept me
strong.

12:46.833 --> 12:50.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that's not the typical case
in an environment
where the majority of men that I
was around

12:51.004 --> 12:55.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were suffering from severe cases
of mental
illness, and if they didn't have
it going

12:55.208 --> 12:57.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in, they definitely left out
with it.

12:57.143 --> 13:01.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But, Maurice,
what is the
justification and rationale that
prison officials

13:01.414 --> 13:03.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
give you for solitary
confinement?

13:03.516 --> 13:05.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAURICE CHAMMAH: Well, there are
a few.

13:05.618 --> 13:09.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Usually, people are placed in
solitary confinement
because the wardens or the
correctional officers

13:09.956 --> 13:16.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the institution feel that
that person might
be a threat. Either they
attacked someone

13:16.863 --> 13:22.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or they, you know, attacked, you
know, either
their cell mate or an officer.

13:22.301 --> 13:27.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, you know, often, the
justification has
kind of stretched down into
smaller, more

13:28.074 --> 13:34.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mundane, mouthing off at an
officer or refusing
a direct order. You know,
they're -- one of

13:34.814 --> 13:38.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the major concerns I think a lot
of people
have is that correctional
officers have sort

13:38.918 --> 13:43.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of become overly used to using
solitary confinement
as a punishment.

13:43.790 --> 13:49.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sometimes, you also hear the
justification
used that younger inmates, who
are maybe more

13:49.595 --> 13:54.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
vulnerable, need to be in
solitary confinement
for their own protection.
Luckily, that rationale

13:54.734 --> 13:57.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has sort of slowly been ebbing
away, though
it still does exist in some
prisons.

13:58.004 --> 14:02.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Shaka, given
those reasons,
did solitary work? When you were
placed in

14:02.575 --> 14:07.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there, when you came out, did
your behavior
change toward what they wanted?
And I guess

14:08.014 --> 14:09.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the corollary to that is, what
would have
worked better?

14:10.016 --> 14:13.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHAKA SENGHOR: In my instance,
it was more
a matter of what I chose to do
with the time

14:13.920 --> 14:15.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that I had when I was in
solitary confinement.

14:15.788 --> 14:19.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I actually set my cell up like I
was at a
college campus. But, again, that
speaks to

14:19.859 --> 14:26.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my literacy going in. To me,
there's really
no long-term benefits for
putting somebody

14:26.432 --> 14:31.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in solitary confinement. And I
think what
I would have benefited from was
actually counseling,

14:31.704 --> 14:37.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conflict resolution, and being
in an environment
that nourishes the healthy part
of human interactions.

14:37.176 --> 14:41.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, unfortunately, that is just
not the way
our systems are designed. We
have a very punitive

14:41.280 --> 14:46.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
system that has been a model for
decades.
And I think that what the
president has shown

14:46.185 --> 14:50.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that we have to take a step
toward what
we really want to see outcomes
be, which is,

14:50.523 --> 14:53.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
we want to make sure that
healthy men and
women are returning home.

14:53.826 --> 14:58.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in order to do that, you
have to pour
into them a sense of respect,
dignity, hope,

14:58.231 --> 15:03.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and health. And when you fail to
do that,
you can't be surprised when the
outcomes aren't

15:03.436 --> 15:05.304 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
positive.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Maurice, let's
talk a little
bit about some of the other
executive actions,

15:07.406 --> 15:11.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or at least the initiatives that
the administration
is trying to outline today,
besides just the

15:11.344 --> 15:11.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ones for juveniles.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAURICE CHAMMAH: Sure.

15:13.946 --> 15:18.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Well, he's also limiting,
basically, the way
in which solitary confinement
can be used

15:18.384 --> 15:22.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of across the board within
the federal
prison system for people who
break rules.

15:23.089 --> 15:27.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it kind of signals, sends a
message sort
of from the top down to Bureau
of Prison administrators

15:27.693 --> 15:33.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they have to kind of figure
out a different
way to deal with people who
break rules within

15:33.166 --> 15:34.867 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
federal prisons.

15:34.967 --> 15:37.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is kind of broadly in line
with things
that different states have tried
out. The

15:38.004 --> 15:43.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president did mention sort of
state experiments
in his op-ed. And different
states are kind

15:43.309 --> 15:48.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of looking at ways to, instead
of put people
in solitary confinement, to do
sort of what

15:48.614 --> 15:51.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Shaka has been describing, to
give them counseling.

15:51.651 --> 15:55.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Washington state, in
Colorado, they're
doing this. You're kind of
seeing that tide

15:55.655 --> 16:01.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shift a little bit and the
president's -- the
president's op-ed kind of is a
capstone for

16:01.127 --> 16:02.962 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

16:03.062 --> 16:04.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Shaka, in just
the brief amount of time we have
left, you're

16:04.964 --> 16:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
working with an organization
that is trying
to move the ball forward on
different types

16:07.533 --> 16:10.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of criminal justice reform.

16:10.303 --> 16:13.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is there a tipping point here?
There seems
to be some momentum that Maurice
is outlining.

16:13.873 --> 16:15.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHAKA SENGHOR: Yes.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The work that I have been doing
with #Cut50
has been amazing, in the sense
that it gives

16:17.877 --> 16:24.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
us an inside look at what
policies are being
put on the table. But the last
six months,

16:24.250 --> 16:28.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the president has set
the tone as
the leader in terms of assuring
that he's

16:28.721 --> 16:33.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
paving the way by going inside
of prison,
really coming up with these
aggressive policies.

16:33.559 --> 16:37.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While we know that this only
impacts federal
prison, I'm confident that the
states will

16:37.697 --> 16:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pick up his leadership and take,
you know,
and follow his lead.

16:41.400 --> 16:44.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Shaka Senghor
from #Cut50, and Maurice Chammah
from The

16:44.403 --> 16:46.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Marshall Project, thanks so much
for joining
us.

16:46.906 --> 16:53.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAURICE CHAMMAH: Thanks for
having us.

16:53.446 --> 17:00.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHAKA SENGHOR: Thank you for
having us.

17:01.087 --> 17:05.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the race
for president.

17:05.458 --> 17:10.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Political director Lisa
Desjardins takes us
through the busy campaign trail
just in the

17:10.129 --> 17:11.831 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
past day.

17:11.931 --> 17:17.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In campaign
land, the biggest
heavyweight is now the calendar.
We're at

17:17.837 --> 17:22.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tuesday, so candidates and
voters have just
six short days left until next
Monday, the

17:23.075 --> 17:26.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iowa caucuses. And, as time
wanes, intensity
waxes.

17:26.612 --> 17:29.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS CUOMO, CNN: All right, we
are live at
Drake University.

17:29.949 --> 17:34.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Last night, it
was Des Moines,
Iowa, where Democrats engaged at
a forum hosted

17:34.754 --> 17:36.455 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
by CNN.

17:36.555 --> 17:40.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHRIS CUOMO: Is Secretary
Clinton simply better
prepared for the job than you,
sir?

17:41.027 --> 17:42.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Don't leave. We have another 15
minute.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.397 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

17:44.497 --> 17:48.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Bernie Sanders,
the former
underdog, now co-front-runner,
was first on

17:48.234 --> 17:50.069 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stage.

17:50.169 --> 17:50.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
This calls for a standing-up
response.

17:50.703 --> 17:51.370 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CHRIS CUOMO: OK.

17:51.470 --> 17:53.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: That's all.

17:53.372 --> 17:56.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The Vermont
senator argued
that his judgment outweighs
Hillary Clinton's

17:56.142 --> 17:57.910 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
experience.

17:58.010 --> 18:00.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Yes, it's
easy to get
rid of a dictator like Saddam
Hussein, but

18:00.513 --> 18:02.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there's going to be a political
vacuum. There
will be instability.

18:03.082 --> 18:09.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it gives me no pleasure to
tell that much
of what I feared, in fact,
happened. Hillary

18:09.488 --> 18:12.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Clinton voted for the war in
Iraq.

18:12.224 --> 18:15.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I have a much longer history
than one vote,

18:15.394 --> 18:17.129 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which I have said was a mistake.

18:17.229 --> 18:21.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Clinton
responded with a
double-punch, quoting President
Obama on depth

18:21.267 --> 18:22.868 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and readiness.

18:22.969 --> 18:25.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: He said,
you know,
you don't get to pick the issues
you work

18:25.471 --> 18:30.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on when you're president. A lot
of them come
at you. They come in the door
whether you

18:30.376 --> 18:32.178 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
open it or not.

18:32.278 --> 18:35.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The familiar
battle lines
felt sharper. Sanders, pressed
about his plan

18:36.048 --> 18:39.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to raise taxes on Wall Street,
wore it as
a badge of honor.

18:39.151 --> 18:44.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Fine, if
that's the criticism,
I accept it. I demand that Wall
Street start

18:44.256 --> 18:45.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
paying its fair share of taxes.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: From Martin
O'Malley...

18:47.293 --> 18:49.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARTIN O'MALLEY (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I'm excited.

18:49.195 --> 18:52.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: ... came both
an admission
of and an argument about being
the underdog.

18:52.565 --> 18:58.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN O'MALLEY: In the history
of the state
of Iowa, Iowa has found a way to
sort through

18:58.938 --> 19:03.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the noise and to sort through
the national
polls and to lift up a new
leader for our

19:03.843 --> 19:07.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country at times when that was
critical and
essential.

19:07.246 --> 19:08.280 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Hi.

19:08.381 --> 19:10.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Hi, Secretary Clinton.

19:10.282 --> 19:13.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And Clinton
showed a kind
of quiet intensity when an Air
Force veteran

19:13.386 --> 19:18.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Muslim American expressed
concern that
her children could face
discrimination. The

19:18.657 --> 19:21.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
candidate blasted Republican
Donald Trump
as demeaning and dangerous.

19:22.028 --> 19:27.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: He
started with Mexicans.
He's currently on Muslims. But I
found it

19:27.967 --> 19:34.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
particularly harmful the way he
has talked
about Muslims, American Muslims
and Muslims

19:34.840 --> 19:35.541 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
around the world.

19:35.641 --> 19:37.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As for Trump:

19:37.476 --> 19:39.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I am angry. I'm angry about
ISIS. We can't

19:39.812 --> 19:41.580 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
beat em.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: He was in New
Hampshire last
night. But, today, some of his
Republican

19:43.783 --> 19:49.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rivals were playing up the idea
of less divisive
rhetoric. Marco Rubio, back in
Iowa, painted

19:49.822 --> 19:51.657 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
himself as a unity candidate.

19:51.757 --> 19:53.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
Even the people that say mean
things about

19:53.692 --> 19:58.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me, I'm going to keep their
families safe.
I will be a president for all
Americans, even

19:58.431 --> 20:00.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the ones that do not support me.

20:00.332 --> 20:03.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: John Kasich,
who just picked
up endorsements from The Boston
Globe and

20:03.302 --> 20:05.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Concord Monitor, spoke fireside
in New Hampshire.

20:05.738 --> 20:08.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate:
You can't always be with the
most popular.

20:08.474 --> 20:15.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OK? Sometimes, you have got to
just be with
the ones, the people that don't
have any power.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Somebody's got to speak for
them.

20:17.116 --> 20:21.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And Ted Cruz
went for bucolic
optics, standing among hay bails
in Iowa and

20:21.454 --> 20:25.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
picking up the endorsement of
one of Trump's
most vocal critics, former
candidate Rick

20:26.025 --> 20:27.793 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Perry.

20:27.893 --> 20:30.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICK PERRY (R), Former Texas
Governor: He
loves his country. He loves that
Constitution.

20:30.129 --> 20:35.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Endorsements,
handshakes
and rallies, every day now is an
intense fight

20:35.434 --> 20:36.602 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for votes.

20:36.702 --> 20:39.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

20:39.171 --> 20:44.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we are
excited to share
some news about our election
coverage. This

20:44.677 --> 20:50.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year, we are teaming up with NPR
News to cover
the Democratic and Republican
Conventions

20:50.549 --> 20:56.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
together. Throughout the year,
our teams will
also report on the big issues
affecting politics

20:56.388 --> 20:58.157 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in America.

20:58.257 --> 21:03.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We bring you our first joint
topic tonight:
the mood and emotions of the
electorate. It's

21:03.496 --> 21:09.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a theme for NPR'S "Morning
Edition," some
local NPR stations this week,
and here at

21:09.935 --> 21:13.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the "NewsHour." We are looking
at the politics
of fear.

21:13.672 --> 21:19.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we just saw, the issue of
fear and terrorism
came up in the forum last night,
and some

21:19.545 --> 21:24.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the candidates have employed
fear of terrorism
as a way to appeal to voters.

21:24.850 --> 21:30.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Donald Trump has
called for a ban
on Muslims coming into the U.S.,
saying, "Our

21:30.122 --> 21:36.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country cannot be the victim of
tremendous
attacks by people who believe
only in jihad."

21:36.495 --> 21:42.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Ted Cruz has warned,
"Our enemies
are not tired of killing us. And
they're getting

21:42.168 --> 21:48.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stronger," while Senator Marco
Rubio cautioned,
"What happened in Paris could
happen here.

21:48.107 --> 21:51.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are radical terrorists who
want to kill
us."

21:51.710 --> 21:56.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democratic candidate Hillary
Clinton has warned
of retaliation from Trump's
comments -- quote

21:56.615 --> 22:02.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- "He is becoming ISIS' best
recruiter. They
are going to people showing
videos of Donald

22:02.488 --> 22:04.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump insulting Islam."

22:04.990 --> 22:09.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For our discussion on this,
we're joined now
by Stephen Walt, professor of
international

22:09.895 --> 22:15.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
affairs at Harvard University,
and Beverly
Gage. She's a professor of 20th
century American

22:15.901 --> 22:18.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
history at Yale University.

22:18.604 --> 22:20.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we welcome you both.

22:20.272 --> 22:22.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Beverly Gage, to you first.

22:22.141 --> 22:28.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How long have candidates used
fear in one
form or another in American
politics? And

22:28.180 --> 22:30.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
how successful has it been?

22:30.149 --> 22:31.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BEVERLY GAGE, Assistant
Professor of American
History, Yale University: Well,
I would like

22:31.984 --> 22:35.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to say it's a brand-new thing,
and we can
just tamp it down, but there's
always been

22:35.387 --> 22:37.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a certain element of fear
politics.

22:37.756 --> 22:42.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Really, if you look back to the
founding fathers,
they were accusing each other of
all sorts

22:42.228 --> 22:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of things. The Federalists were
accusing their
opponents of all sorts of
conspiracies. So,

22:47.833 --> 22:50.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think we have a very long
history.

22:50.669 --> 22:56.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think, oftentimes, as we're
seeing today,
that history is tied up in both
foreign affairs

22:56.442 --> 23:00.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then issues at home, issues
like race
and crime and immigration.

23:00.246 --> 23:05.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stephen Walt,
what about the
use of fear as a tactic through
history? How

23:05.784 --> 23:07.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
successful do you think it's
been?

23:07.686 --> 23:09.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN WALT, Harvard University
Kennedy School
of Government: Well, I think
it's been used

23:09.521 --> 23:12.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
successfully by a number of
candidates in
the past and been used by
candidates from

23:13.058 --> 23:14.827 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
both parties.

23:14.927 --> 23:18.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You will recall, in the late
'40s and early
1950s, the Truman administration
was accused

23:18.864 --> 23:24.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of losing China, being soft on
communism.
The claim was made by Joseph
McCarthy that

23:24.436 --> 23:27.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
communists were infiltrating key
American
institutions.

23:28.073 --> 23:32.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, in 1960, John F.
Kennedy turned
the tables and accused the
Eisenhower administration

23:33.045 --> 23:38.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of also being weak, of allowing
a missile
gap to develop, even though none
existed.

23:38.717 --> 23:43.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this tactic of trying to
play on people's
fears and insecurities is a
pretty common

23:43.889 --> 23:45.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
one, as Beverly said.

23:45.891 --> 23:50.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Beverly,
used pretty equally
by both political parties, or
has one party

23:50.663 --> 23:52.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or another used it more? What do
you see?

23:53.098 --> 23:57.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEVERLY GAGE: Well, I certainly
think, in
the 20th century, you can go
cherry-picking

23:57.936 --> 24:00.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and find both parties using it.

24:00.239 --> 24:08.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, probably the most famous
example of fear
politics in a campaign actually
was a Democrat

24:08.347 --> 24:14.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
defaming a Republican, so,
Lyndon Johnson
and Barry Goldwater, Johnson's
famous ad that

24:14.119 --> 24:19.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
showed a little girl picking off
the petals
of a daisy, accusing Barry
Goldwater being

24:19.792 --> 24:21.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about to foment nuclear war.

24:21.727 --> 24:26.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think you can see it
happening on both
sides. But I think the more
interesting question

24:26.198 --> 24:31.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is sort of, what position are
candidates usually
in when they're using this kind
of politics?

24:31.904 --> 24:36.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while there are exceptions,
it's often
candidates who are in the
opposition party,

24:36.375 --> 24:41.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it's often candidates who
are trying to
appeal to people who feel like
they have something

24:42.014 --> 24:43.816 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to lose.

24:43.916 --> 24:47.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if a candidate comes in and
says, that's
right, the terrible thing that
you fear may

24:47.386 --> 24:52.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happen is in fact going to
happen, that, unfortunately,
can be a pretty effective
tactic.

24:52.391 --> 24:57.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Stephen Walt,
telescope
that to this year. How do you
see it playing

24:57.930 --> 25:02.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out in this campaign? I just
used some quotes
from some of the candidates a
minute ago,

25:02.267 --> 25:04.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but what do you see?

25:04.169 --> 25:07.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN WALT: Well, what I think
is interesting
about this campaign is the
degree to which

25:07.873 --> 25:13.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's fear of the other, fear of
the alien,
fear of those who aren't really
fully American

25:14.079 --> 25:21.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or aren't potentially -- or
maybe disloyal
in some fashion, so pointing to
Mexican Americans,

25:21.153 --> 25:22.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pointing to Muslim Americans.

25:23.021 --> 25:27.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this theme has actually been
throughout
Obama's presidency, when you
think about it,

25:27.893 --> 25:33.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the various bizarre accusations
that he wasn't
really American or he was
secretly Muslim

25:33.532 --> 25:41.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
himself, this notion that
somehow these people
can't be trusted and real
Americans face dangers

25:41.774 --> 25:43.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that may be enormous.

25:43.575 --> 25:48.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, again, we have seen this in
the past.
This was clearly part of the
McCarthy period.

25:49.014 --> 25:54.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think it's the thing that
is most telling
about 2016. And you even see it
in a slightly

25:54.253 --> 26:00.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
different form with the Sanders
campaign suggesting
that most of the problems in
America are due

26:00.225 --> 26:05.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the greedy 1 percenters of
Wall Street,
and if we could just get them
under control,

26:05.264 --> 26:06.832 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we would be fine.

26:06.932 --> 26:09.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think that is what defines
the use of
fear in this particular
campaign.

26:09.735 --> 26:15.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Beverly
Gage, how do we
distinguish between what's a
responsible,

26:15.574 --> 26:22.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
healthy debate over real threats
to this country,
vs. crossing a line into
something that's

26:22.481 --> 26:24.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just playing on people's fears
and insecurities?

26:24.817 --> 26:28.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEVERLY GAGE: Right. Well, that
is the big
question.

26:28.420 --> 26:34.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, often, we are dealing with
real issues.
So, terrorism is a real issue,
and, in fact,

26:34.326 --> 26:39.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immigration itself is also a
real issue. We
are now at peak levels of
immigration, levels

26:39.465 --> 26:44.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of immigration we haven't seen
really since
the turn of the last century.
So, there is

26:44.269 --> 26:47.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something driving this kind of
politics.

26:47.439 --> 26:52.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the question is
exactly what you
have posed. How do you kind of
deal responsibly

26:52.845 --> 26:58.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with it? It would be nice to
say, well, you
just present the facts, but,
often, that actually

26:58.383 --> 27:03.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not what really works. I
think Obama tried
to do that in terms of terrorism
at his State

27:03.889 --> 27:08.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Union, when he said, you
know, we're
not in the middle of World War
III. We are

27:08.260 --> 27:10.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not at risk as a nation.

27:10.329 --> 27:15.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I'm not sure that actually
played very
well. I think, often, what can
make the real

27:15.334 --> 27:20.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
difference is actually shifting
the debate
a little bit, acknowledging that
the problem

27:20.405 --> 27:25.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is real, and the question is not
how to freak
out about it, but, in fact, how
to begin to

27:25.844 --> 27:27.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
deal with it constructively.

27:27.746 --> 27:32.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stephen Walt,
have you seen
examples of candidates handling
it well this

27:32.417 --> 27:38.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year? And who's responsible for
getting it
all straightened out and making
sure people

27:38.323 --> 27:44.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
know what's -- what is
responsible, what's
healthy, and what's crossing a
line?

27:44.162 --> 27:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN WALT: Well, certainly,
there's a role
for the candidates to challenge
each other.

27:48.166 --> 27:53.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think one of the things
candidates can
do is first force their rivals
to be specific.

27:53.305 --> 27:58.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Don't just point to some menace
whose dimensions
are being exaggerated, but force
people to

27:58.310 --> 28:03.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be concrete and specific about
the policies
that they would follow, what
they would do

28:03.515 --> 28:07.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
differently, how they would make
the problem
manageable.

28:07.519 --> 28:12.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Don't treat it, again, as this
infinitely
large menace, but rather as a
practical problem

28:12.724 --> 28:17.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be solved. There's also,
obviously, a role
here for the media in
challenging the various

28:18.030 --> 28:23.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
claims from the candidates,
asking them for
specifics, asking them for
facts, and not

28:23.802 --> 28:26.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
accepting magical solutions.

28:26.371 --> 28:30.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It shouldn't be acceptable for a
candidate
to be able to say, look, we're
facing a huge

28:30.642 --> 28:36.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
danger here, but I have an easy
way to solve
this particular huge danger.

28:36.281 --> 28:42.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Then, finally, I think
candidates can play
a certain jujitsu on their
rivals by basically

28:42.754 --> 28:47.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
saying, those who are
fear-mongering don't
have enough confidence in
America's basic

28:47.826 --> 28:50.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strengths, don't have confidence
in America's
institutions.

28:50.963 --> 28:57.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think Ronald Reagan was
the modern genius
at this. He used fear-mongering
in the 1980

28:57.603 --> 29:02.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign against Jimmy Carter,
but he also
managed to do it with a sense of
great optimism,

29:02.808 --> 29:08.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that America was fundamentally
good, fundamentally
strong, and these challenges
were something

29:08.447 --> 29:10.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it could overcome.

29:10.282 --> 29:13.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If any of the candidates can
manage that sweet
spot, they're likely to do
pretty well.

29:14.052 --> 29:19.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Beverly Gage,
that means
that there's promise out there
that candidates

29:19.424 --> 29:21.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will handle it well this year
and beyond?

29:21.827 --> 29:26.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEVERLY GAGE: There is promise
out there.
I think there are also some dark
examples

29:26.765 --> 29:28.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from American history.

29:28.800 --> 29:34.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, another moment in which
terrorism, immigration
was really on the table was in
the teens and

29:34.773 --> 29:39.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the '20s. And what we actually
got coming
out of that political moment
was, in fact,

29:39.945 --> 29:46.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pretty extreme immigration
restriction, as
well as the rise of the new Ku
Klux Klan during

29:46.985 --> 29:48.754 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that period.

29:48.854 --> 29:51.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think there's a lot at
stake, and I
think we're still early in the
campaign, and

29:51.223 --> 29:52.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we will see how it goes.

29:53.091 --> 29:56.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A lot at stake.
And you're
right, we are really early in
the campaign.

29:56.361 --> 29:56.995 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

29:57.095 --> 29:59.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will see.

29:59.164 --> 30:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Beverly Gage, Stephen Walt, we
thank you both.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.101 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEVERLY GAGE: Thank you, Judy.

30:03.201 --> 30:08.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEPHEN WALT: Nice talking with
you.

30:08.807 --> 30:21.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us,
coming up on
the "NewsHour": calls to screen
for depression

30:22.087 --> 30:29.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
during pregnancy; a celebration
of Mozart's
genius and birthday; and a young
dancer challenging

30:29.294 --> 30:30.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
gender stereotypes.

30:30.829 --> 30:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, first, a new night for
education.

30:35.133 --> 30:39.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The "NewsHour" has long been
committed to
covering that topic. And
starting tonight,

30:39.504 --> 30:44.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we will be expanding our
coverage on Tuesdays
with a new feature series called
Making the

30:44.743 --> 30:49.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Grade. We will provide in-depth
reporting
on education issues at every
level, from early

30:50.048 --> 30:55.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
childhood and preschool, all the
way through
high school and beyond with the
world of higher

30:55.620 --> 30:57.422 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
education.

30:57.522 --> 31:01.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We will explore the most
fundamental concerns
in schools, communities and
workplaces, and

31:01.159 --> 31:05.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we will also cover plenty of
approaches you
may not have heard about yet.

31:05.797 --> 31:11.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we focus on vocational
education.
There's a growing recognition of
its value

31:11.436 --> 31:16.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for some students. But how do
you determine
when it's working for the long
haul?

31:16.608 --> 31:21.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent John
Tulenko of Education
Week has our story.

31:21.847 --> 31:31.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: This year, more
than a million
students will graduate from high
school, and

31:31.156 --> 31:37.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most will go on to college. It
ought to be
something to celebrate, but, in
fact, nearly

31:37.229 --> 31:42.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
40 percent of those who go to
four-year colleges
and some 70 percent of students
at community

31:42.167 --> 31:43.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
college will never earn their
degree.

31:43.935 --> 31:45.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID WHEELER, Principal,
Southern Regional
Vocational Technical High
School: It's the

31:45.904 --> 31:49.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shame of our nation, when you
look at, a student
comes out of high school, not
knowing what

31:50.075 --> 31:56.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they want to do, goes to
college, drops out.
Now they're in debt, without a
job, and not

31:56.214 --> 32:00.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
knowing what they want to do.
They're worse
off than they were, you know, as
little as

32:00.118 --> 32:04.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a year before. And that's all
preventable,
all of it.

32:04.556 --> 32:10.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: One solution,
principal Dave
Wheeler says, lies in schools
like his, Southeastern

32:10.729 --> 32:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Regional Vocational Technical
High School,
south of Boston.

32:14.633 --> 32:19.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here, in addition to the regular
school subjects,
students learn skilled trades
and professions,

32:20.038 --> 32:24.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, if they choose, instead of
college, they
can go directly into the work
force.

32:24.676 --> 32:29.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WHEELER: You can become
anything you
want here, if you take advantage
of what we

32:29.614 --> 32:31.550 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
have.

32:31.650 --> 32:35.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Choosing a career
program starts
in ninth grade. Students spend
the first semester

32:35.554 --> 32:39.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sampling each of the roughly 20
professions
taught here.

32:39.257 --> 32:42.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dajon Lopes (ph) chose culinary
arts.

32:42.227 --> 32:46.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAJON LOPES, Student: We learn
to cook everything,
a whole bunch of foreign dishes,
American

32:46.164 --> 32:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dishes, anything. You name it,
we got it.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This right here is Asian scallop
saute.

32:50.902 --> 32:53.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Is this a new dish
for you?

32:54.005 --> 32:54.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAJON LOPES: Yes. It's my first
time, matter
of fact.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: The first time,
yes? May I?

32:57.008 --> 32:57.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAULA KFOURY, Southeastern
Regional Vocational
Technical High School: It's not
like you're

32:57.909 --> 32:59.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opening a book and reading about
it.

32:59.144 --> 33:00.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Culinary arts
teacher Paula
Kfoury.

33:00.779 --> 33:01.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAULA KFOURY: It's hands-on,
which is so different.

33:01.746 --> 33:03.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: That's very nice.

33:03.548 --> 33:09.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAULA KFOURY: They come in here
every day
and open a restaurant. And we do
all of the

33:09.521 --> 33:10.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
functions for the school.

33:10.922 --> 33:13.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: This car has -- gave us a
lot of problems.

33:13.758 --> 33:16.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: In collision
repair, the work
is also real.

33:16.361 --> 33:20.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: A customer brings in a car,
we, like,
do a estimate on it.

33:20.699 --> 33:22.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: This is someone's
car?

33:22.567 --> 33:25.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Yes. And then, after that
we call the
customer up, we tell them how
much it will

33:25.303 --> 33:27.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cost, and we start repairing it.

33:27.138 --> 33:33.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WHEELER: Almost all of our
shops do
some form of, we call it live
work. Cosmetology

33:33.578 --> 33:40.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
takes clients. Construction, we
have done
complete renovations of
buildings. We have

33:40.318 --> 33:45.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
done Web sites for people. We do
printing.
There is no better way to engage
a student

33:45.857 --> 33:47.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
than they're doing real,
meaningful work.

33:48.026 --> 33:53.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Of course, they
also do academics.
Every other week, students are
in traditional

33:53.632 --> 33:55.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
classes full-time.

33:55.700 --> 34:00.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WHEELER: Every single kid
is going to
learn algebra. Everyone's going
to get a high-level

34:00.939 --> 34:03.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
literature class. Everyone's
going to get
physics.

34:03.441 --> 34:09.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: On the state math
test, 73 percent
of students scored above
proficient, in English,

34:09.781 --> 34:15.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
90 percent, numbers that nearly
match state
averages. And Southeastern's 93
percent graduation

34:15.687 --> 34:17.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rate is better than average.

34:17.956 --> 34:23.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the flip side, SAT scores and
scores on
advanced placement tests lag
significantly

34:23.328 --> 34:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
behind the state as a whole.
But, for Dave
Wheeler, those are not the
numbers that matter

34:28.800 --> 34:30.535 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
most.

34:30.635 --> 34:34.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID WHEELER: When we do
follow-up studies,
generally speaking, we hit the
90 -- high

34:34.839 --> 34:39.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
90 percent range of students
that are either
in the work force, continue to
be enrolled

34:39.511 --> 34:44.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in college, or have gone into
the military.
The point is to get you to be a
happy, productive

34:45.083 --> 34:46.885 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
citizen.

34:46.985 --> 34:51.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: This approach is
getting lots
of attention from reformers
these days, who

34:51.556 --> 34:55.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see it as a way to improve
engagement and
achievement in high schools.

34:55.627 --> 35:00.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But career and technical
education, or CTE,
as it's sometimes called, has
its critics.

35:00.665 --> 35:05.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROL BURRIS, Network for Public
Education:
Even though that is what people
are touting

35:05.737 --> 35:13.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a possibility, rigorous CTE
programs, in
the reality, I don't think it's
going to happen.

35:13.111 --> 35:18.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: During her 15
years as an award-winning
high school principal in New
York state, Carol

35:18.183 --> 35:20.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Burris had an insider's view on
these programs.

35:20.585 --> 35:27.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROL BURRIS: I think a lot of
schools will
take kids that are behavior
issues and will

35:27.459 --> 35:32.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say, you know what, I think
technical education
is where you need to be. I think
they will

35:32.497 --> 35:37.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take kids who have learning
disabilities,
and rather than work with them
in academics,

35:37.235 --> 35:41.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
push them on that track. We just
know that
historically.

35:41.172 --> 35:47.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Almost from the
start, high
schools were organized into
tracks, with separate

35:48.046 --> 35:52.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
programs for students bound for
college and
those bound for work.

35:52.817 --> 35:55.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL PETRILLI, The Thomas B.
Fordham Institute:
And, oftentimes, the way the
system made that

35:55.253 --> 35:59.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decision was based on the color
of their skin
or by their zip code. You can
imagine that

35:59.924 --> 36:04.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was mostly kids of color and
low-income
kids who were shuffled into
vocational programs,

36:04.829 --> 36:06.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
many of which were terrible.

36:06.598 --> 36:10.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: But Mike Petrilli
who heads
the Thomas Fordham Institute, an
education

36:10.135 --> 36:12.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think tank, says a major shift
was coming.

36:12.570 --> 36:17.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PETRILLI: There was a big
effort to de-track
the high schools and the middle
schools starting

36:17.675 --> 36:20.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the late 1980s, early '90s,
which was very
successful in most big cities.

36:21.079 --> 36:24.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY CARNEVALE, Georgetown
University: We
decided that we were going to
give academic

36:24.849 --> 36:30.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
education, which essentially
teaches abstraction,
we decided to give that to
everybody through

36:30.221 --> 36:31.990 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
high school.

36:32.090 --> 36:35.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: The mission of
public schools
changed, says economist Tony
Carnevale, and

36:35.527 --> 36:37.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
college became the goal.

36:37.395 --> 36:41.599 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TONY CARNEVALE: The basic
American model is
high school to Harvard. The
difficulty with

36:41.699 --> 36:45.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is, it doesn't work for
most students.
You ask the teacher, why am I
taking this

36:46.037 --> 36:50.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
course? And they will say, well,
you need
it for college, and that's
enough. For a lot

36:50.275 --> 36:51.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of kids, that's not enough.

36:51.876 --> 36:55.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Many arrive at
college unprepared,
fall behind and drop out.

36:55.780 --> 36:59.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PETRILLI: It would be a lot
better for
those people to go out into the
work force,

36:59.818 --> 37:05.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get some real skills, and maybe
down the road
they would be ready then to go
and get a postsecondary

37:05.457 --> 37:07.292 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
credential.

37:07.392 --> 37:09.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUSTIN MEEKS, Southeastern
Regional Vocational
Technical High School Graduate:
Schoolwork

37:09.227 --> 37:11.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wasn't -- I wasn't the greatest
at it. I feel
like I'm more of a hands-on
person.

37:11.329 --> 37:15.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: For Justin Meeks,
fabricating
metal was a better fit. He
learned the trade

37:16.067 --> 37:20.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at Southeastern and, through an
apprenticeship
arranged by the school, landed a
full-time

37:20.605 --> 37:22.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
job just days after graduation.

37:22.774 --> 37:28.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUSTIN MEEKS, School prepared me
well for
this. I weld here a lot. I have
to cut well

37:28.146 --> 37:29.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on here and very accurate.

37:29.481 --> 37:31.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: You can't make a
mistake on
a beam like this.

37:31.850 --> 37:33.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUSTIN MEEKS: Yes, you can't fix
it.

37:33.284 --> 37:36.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: If you don't mind
my asking,
how much do you make?

37:36.521 --> 37:40.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUSTIN MEEKS: Fourteen
sixty-six. And if I
can keep getting more money and
more money,

37:40.658 --> 37:44.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a raise, and working harder,
I think I
could be fine without college.

37:44.662 --> 37:46.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Is this a success?

37:47.031 --> 37:51.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PETRILLI: First of all,
let's look at
the alternative. If this was a
young person

37:51.469 --> 37:56.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who wasn't doing well in school,
if he hadn't
been engaged in something that
really motivated

37:56.407 --> 37:59.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him, he probably would have
dropped out or
maybe he would have made it to
graduation,

37:59.677 --> 38:04.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then that was it. And then
he'd be going
into the work force and lucky to
get a minimum

38:04.716 --> 38:07.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wage job. This is a much better
outcome.

38:07.318 --> 38:11.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: And Petrilli says
vocational
schools like Justin's are
different these

38:11.422 --> 38:15.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
days, because, at places like
Southeastern,
tracking is a thing of the past.

38:15.794 --> 38:20.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE PETRILLI: It's very
important that the
pathways are chosen by the kids
themselves.

38:20.698 --> 38:23.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want to provide options, and
let the young
people make decisions.

38:23.201 --> 38:28.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROL BURRIS: I think it's very
dangerous.
I have seen so many kids who
have been academic

38:28.973 --> 38:34.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
late bloomers, who all of sudden
they mature
and they buckle down and they do
their studies

38:34.245 --> 38:35.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and they go on to college.

38:36.014 --> 38:42.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you start to push kids when
they are
too young to make that decision,
they're just

38:43.087 --> 38:44.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not ready to make it.

38:45.023 --> 38:49.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: But that's not
stopping families
from enrolling their teenagers
at Southeastern.

38:49.561 --> 38:53.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This year, some 800 students
applied for 400
spots.

38:53.665 --> 39:01.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In South Easton, Massachusetts,
I'm John Tulenko
of Education Week, reporting for
the "PBS

39:01.940 --> 39:04.709 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
NewsHour."

39:04.809 --> 39:17.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A federal health
panel is now
calling for all women to be
screened for depression

39:17.689 --> 39:21.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
during pregnancy and again after
giving birth.

39:21.125 --> 39:26.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. Preventive Services
Task Force says
there's new evidence that
postpartum depression

39:26.531 --> 39:32.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is more common than previously
believed. The
report also recommends that all
adults over

39:32.136 --> 39:34.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
18 be screened for depression.

39:35.006 --> 39:38.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
William Brangham zeros in on the
new guidelines
and how they apply to women

39:38.876 --> 39:42.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Today's
recommendations
follow recent research
suggesting that as

39:42.914 --> 39:48.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many as one in five women may
develop depression,
anxiety or other forms of mental
illness within

39:48.486 --> 39:50.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a year of giving birth.

39:50.421 --> 39:55.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining me to discuss this is
Dr. Hal Lawrence.
He's a longtime OB/GYN and
currently the CEO

39:55.660 --> 39:58.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the American Congress of
Obstetricians
and Gynecologists.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dr. Lawrence, welcome. Thank you
for being
here.

40:01.099 --> 40:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. HAL LAWRENCE, CEO, American
Congress of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists:
Thank you

40:01.666 --> 40:03.501 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for inviting us.

40:03.601 --> 40:05.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What was your
reaction when
you first heard these
guidelines? Was this

40:05.637 --> 40:06.571 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
good news to you?

40:06.671 --> 40:08.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. HAL LAWRENCE: It's excellent
news to us.

40:08.506 --> 40:11.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the American Congress of
Obstetricians
and Gynecologists, we have been
aware for

40:12.043 --> 40:17.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
decades about the risk of
postpartum depression,
and, in all honesty, the risk of
depression

40:17.782 --> 40:19.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in women at any -- throughout
their life.

40:20.018 --> 40:23.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, one in five women, or
20 percent
of all women, will have a major
depressive

40:24.022 --> 40:29.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
episode during their lifetime,
and pregnancy
and other stressful events
increase that for

40:29.727 --> 40:31.496 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

40:31.596 --> 40:33.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Why is it --
I'm curious.
Just why is it that pregnancy is
a particular

40:33.965 --> 40:35.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
trigger for that?

40:35.800 --> 40:37.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. HAL LAWRENCE: Well, it's
such a stressful
time. And everybody looks at
pregnancy as

40:37.902 --> 40:39.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this joyous moment.

40:39.837 --> 40:45.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is joyous, and you have a
healthy mother,
and you have a healthy baby. But
there's also

40:45.109 --> 40:52.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of stress. That woman's
life has changed.
She feels -- she's so dedicated
to her baby.

40:52.350 --> 40:57.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then anything that makes her
feel uncomfortable,
she questions herself: Am I
doing the right

40:58.056 --> 40:59.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
thing? Am I doing it good
enough?

41:00.091 --> 41:04.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for some women, that just
sort of works
through with the postpartum
blues, which almost

41:04.696 --> 41:11.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every postpartum patient has.
But, by a week
or two or three weeks, that
really passes.

41:11.302 --> 41:16.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for about 20 percent, it
doesn't. It hangs
on for a while, and they
actually have some

41:16.174 --> 41:21.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
depression. And then, for a much
smaller group,
around 2 percent, they can
actually go into

41:21.646 --> 41:26.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something called postpartum
psychosis, which
they can have ideations of
suicide, hurting

41:26.384 --> 41:28.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
themselves, hurting their baby.

41:28.186 --> 41:33.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's all because of the
stress of that
period, and at times feelings of
not being

41:33.891 --> 41:37.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what they want to be or being
what people
expect them to be.

41:37.528 --> 41:42.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: These
recommendations indicate
that mothers should be screened
not just after

41:42.233 --> 41:47.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the birth, but during their
pregnancy. And
I wonder why -- is it that signs
during pregnancy

41:47.572 --> 41:49.340 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tend to show up?

41:49.440 --> 41:51.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. HAL LAWRENCE: Well, as I
said, we know
that 20 percent of all women
will have some

41:51.876 --> 41:56.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
depression during their
lifetime, and so some
women actually enter pregnancy
with some signs

41:56.948 --> 41:58.883 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of depression.

41:58.983 --> 42:04.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some may have already had a
diagnosis of depression
or psychological illness, and
those people

42:04.622 --> 42:10.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are at increased risk. So,
picking that up
early, or if you don't know
about it, helps

42:10.294 --> 42:14.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you be careful about those
parents when they
become postpartum.

42:14.632 --> 42:20.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, screening during pregnancy
is very important.
Screening postpartum is very
important, and

42:20.938 --> 42:25.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
screening, you know, earlier
than even six
weeks. You know, it's
interesting. Many times,

42:25.843 --> 42:31.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the pediatricians who are seeing
the babies
back for growth checks and
weight gain and

42:31.416 --> 42:34.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all that will pick up on this,
because there
will be...

42:34.485 --> 42:36.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Pick up on the
mother's
behavior.

42:36.421 --> 42:42.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. HAL LAWRENCE: Exactly,
because there's
this detachment between the mom
and the baby,

42:42.660 --> 42:44.395 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
which is not normal.

42:44.495 --> 42:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they -- oftentimes, the
pediatricians
will call and say, hey, there's
something

42:48.366 --> 42:52.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going on here. You need to see
Mrs. Jones,
because it's -- they sense that.

42:53.004 --> 42:57.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: If you were a
doctor sitting
opposite me, what does a
screening for depression

42:57.375 --> 42:59.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
look like or sound like?

42:59.310 --> 43:01.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DR. HAL LAWRENCE: Well,
actually, there are
some tools that are out there.
They have this

43:01.946 --> 43:08.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Edinburgh postpartum depression
screen, which
has a series of questions that
are very simple

43:08.586 --> 43:12.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and straightforward. It takes
just a few minutes
for the patients to fill out.

43:12.590 --> 43:16.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can quickly grade it, and
based on how
you grade it, gives you an idea
as to how

43:16.994 --> 43:22.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this woman's emotional stability
is at that
time. So, we recommend that or a
tool like

43:22.366 --> 43:24.202 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that for everybody to utilize.

43:24.302 --> 43:28.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The reason I
ask about this
is that whenever we have a --
for instance,

43:28.573 --> 43:32.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a major episode of gun violence,
people always
talk about the need to increase
mental health

43:32.944 --> 43:34.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
care in this country.

43:34.846 --> 43:38.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the retorts to that
is always,
we don't have the mental health
infrastructure

43:38.749 --> 43:42.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to handle all those people. I'm
just wondering,
do you think that there's a
concern that these

43:42.220 --> 43:46.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
guidelines might be recommending
services
that we don't have the ability
to deliver?

43:47.058 --> 43:51.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. HAL LAWRENCE: Well, I think
we have to
have the ability to deliver
those services.

43:52.096 --> 43:57.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, yes, there is a good reason
to expand
mental health services in this
country. But

43:57.668 --> 44:01.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when you look at the postpartum
patient, I
think it's really a team. Yes,
oftentimes,

44:01.973 --> 44:08.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you need a psychologist or a
psychiatrist,
but, many times, you need an
alert pediatrician,

44:08.212 --> 44:14.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
an alert and sensitive
obstetrician/gynecologist,
family members who see this is
going on, and

44:14.819 --> 44:20.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that team working to help
support and ensure
that the mother's getting the
support and

44:20.491 --> 44:22.460 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
care she needs.

44:22.560 --> 44:26.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to -- when we recognize
it -- I mean,
I have practiced for almost 30
years and delivered

44:26.564 --> 44:32.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over 5,000 babies. I have made
this diagnosis.
I have started these people on
treatment.

44:32.436 --> 44:35.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to do that and see if
you can't get
them healthy.

44:35.640 --> 44:41.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Dr. Hal
Lawrence of the
American Congress of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists,

44:41.212 --> 44:42.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thank you very much.

44:42.547 --> 44:47.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. HAL LAWRENCE: Thank you.
It's a pleasure
to be here.

44:47.518 --> 45:00.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: genius in
three notes.

45:00.298 --> 45:03.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tomorrow marks Wolfgang Amadeus
Mozart's birthday.

45:03.634 --> 45:09.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We celebrate with a conversation
Jeffrey Brown
had recently with composer and
pianist Rob

45:09.540 --> 45:13.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kapilow, who deconstructs music
for us from
time to time.

45:13.544 --> 45:17.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They met up at the Signature
Theatre in Arlington,
Virginia.

45:17.448 --> 45:20.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Happy birthday,
Mozart, right?

45:20.918 --> 45:23.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW, Composer: Yes.

45:23.254 --> 45:26.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Welcome, Rob
Kapilow.

45:26.157 --> 45:29.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's start by acknowledging
this is one of
the world's great musical
geniuses, right?

45:29.727 --> 45:33.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: So true. I mean,
just, whenever
you think of musical prodigy,
who do you think

45:33.631 --> 45:38.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of but Mozart? Writing simple
keyboard pieces
at 5, violin sonatas and
orchestral music

45:38.836 --> 45:43.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at 6 and 7, first symphony at 9.
It's really
disgusting, if you're a composer
like me.

45:43.641 --> 45:45.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You just don't even want to
think about Mozart's
birthday.

45:45.176 --> 45:46.978 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

45:47.078 --> 45:49.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, so
there's a whole
world of Mozart to choose from.
You picked

45:49.513 --> 45:54.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Symphony Number 40, right, the
famous G minor,
and the beginning of that. So,
first, remind

45:54.652 --> 45:56.053 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
us a little of how that...

45:56.153 --> 45:58.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: Right. Yes. This is
on everybody's
cell phone ring tone.

45:58.189 --> 46:00.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

46:00.124 --> 46:01.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: Everyone has heard
this, even
if you think you have never
heard a note of...

46:01.459 --> 46:01.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

46:01.926 --> 46:03.160 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

46:03.260 --> 46:03.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: ... music, this is
the one you
have heard.

46:03.661 --> 46:14.872 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
For

46:14.972 --> 46:18.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many generations of kids, this
was actually
ruined as, it's a bird, it's a
plane, no,

46:18.876 --> 46:22.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's Mozart. And now I have
ruined it for
generations of television
viewers as well.

46:22.413 --> 46:24.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. Yes. So, why
pick that?
Why? Why?

46:24.315 --> 46:27.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: I picked this
because, for one,
it's the most famous or one of
the most famous

46:28.052 --> 46:29.887 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
themes that Mozart ever wrote.

46:29.987 --> 46:34.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But what happens to it is
amazing. I often
say that classical music is
really about becoming,

46:34.725 --> 46:35.159 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not being.

46:35.259 --> 46:36.060 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

46:36.160 --> 46:37.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Becoming, not
being.

46:37.995 --> 46:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: Yes. It's not what
a musical
idea is when you first hear it,
what it is

46:41.766 --> 46:46.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be, but it's about what it
can become or
how it transforms over the
course of a piece

46:46.370 --> 46:48.205 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of music.

46:48.305 --> 46:51.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, in and of itself, while
that's a famous
theme, it's not that amazing, in
and of itself.

46:51.308 --> 46:59.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has got a three-note idea.
That's not so
great. He does it once, does it
again, a third

46:59.684 --> 47:01.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
time, and then leaps up.

47:01.552 --> 47:03.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I'm now going to ruin this
again for a
new generation. I'm going to
call it, do it

47:03.421 --> 47:09.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
once, do it twice, and then leap
up. In and
of itself, that's not so
fantastic by itself.

47:09.560 --> 47:14.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The second half sounds
completely different.
It just goes down a scale.
Though the two

47:14.632 --> 47:17.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
halves are actually connected,
they rhyme,
they have the same rhythm.

47:17.568 --> 47:19.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

47:19.503 --> 47:22.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: Now, in and of
itself, if Mozart
had stopped there, we wouldn't
be celebrating

47:22.373 --> 47:25.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his birthday hundreds of years
later. It's
not that great.

47:25.309 --> 47:30.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what happens to it over the
course of
the piece is amazing. Let's skip
ahead to

47:30.781 --> 47:43.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the middle of the piece. All of
a sudden,
we end up here. This is a normal
place to

47:43.227 --> 47:52.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
end. All of a sudden, three
abrupt chords
take to us a completely
different place. Where

47:52.770 --> 47:55.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are we? We hear our opening.

47:55.606 --> 48:01.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, originally, it was here. We
are now starting
on a different note, what we
call transposing,

48:01.645 --> 48:05.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and we do it here. All sounds
normal.

48:05.483 --> 48:06.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

48:06.884 --> 48:22.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: Everyone expects to
hear this,
but, instead, we get

48:22.299 --> 48:23.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
first shock.

48:23.667 --> 48:25.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's through
the key change
first, yes? Yes.

48:25.536 --> 48:27.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: Absolutely, first
three key changes,
and then change the melody. Then
we do it

48:27.671 --> 48:30.074 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
again.

48:30.174 --> 48:40.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everyone expects -- but, no, we
get second
shock. Then we hear it again,
third time,

48:40.785 --> 48:46.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even lower. And then the piece
just takes
off.

48:46.624 --> 48:50.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, this is like a character in
a novel who
you think you have met. You
think you understand

48:50.961 --> 48:55.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them. But now, all of a sudden,
what he's
going to do is almost
Beethovenian. Now, Beethoven

48:55.399 --> 48:59.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was actually only 18 years old
and still a
babe in the woods, but this is
fundamentally

48:59.436 --> 49:01.205 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Beethovenian.

49:01.305 --> 49:08.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's he's going to do is take
an eight-measure
melody, reduce it to four
measures, reduce

49:08.946 --> 49:12.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it to two measures, 10 notes,
seven notes,
and finally the whole universe
will get summed

49:12.883 --> 49:15.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up in only three notes. So,
watch this.

49:15.519 --> 49:16.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: The whole
universe.

49:16.987 --> 49:18.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: The whole universe
in three notes,
a cosmic essence.

49:19.056 --> 49:20.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK.

49:20.991 --> 49:24.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: We hear Mozart
think out loud.
What I can do? And he says what
if I just...

49:24.428 --> 49:25.429 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

49:25.529 --> 49:26.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Even those three
notes, what...

49:26.831 --> 49:28.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: Yes, what can I do
with these
three notes?

49:28.699 --> 49:33.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's not much. Right? This
is not great.
He says, what if I just take the
ending and

49:33.737 --> 49:45.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
put it down here in the flute
and oboe, and
overlap like this? Try it up
higher, even

49:45.249 --> 49:47.918 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
higher.

49:48.018 --> 50:04.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trying to find out, what does
the idea mean?
And then the ultimate final step
is, we reduce

50:04.568 --> 50:08.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the whole thing to nothing but
the first three
notes. Who would dream that this
could be

50:08.906 --> 50:13.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the topic for an entire piece?

50:13.310 --> 50:22.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We started,
though, this conversation
about genius. Your case is that
that is sort

50:22.820 --> 50:27.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the essence of it, is taking
something
simple, creating a whole
universe in a sense.

50:27.658 --> 50:29.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROB KAPILOW: Exactly.

50:29.460 --> 50:31.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's that quote from Ezra
Pound, genius
is the capacity to see 10 things
where the

50:31.929 --> 50:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ordinary man sees one. We just
hear that opening
idea, but he sees, as you have
just heard,

50:36.600 --> 50:40.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at least 20 things in an idea
that we never
could have imagined.

50:40.304 --> 50:44.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A great Mark Twain quote: "There
never was
yet an uninteresting life."

50:44.241 --> 50:49.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Inside the dullest exterior,
there is a drama,
a comedy and a tragedy. And
Mozart heard the

50:49.813 --> 50:53.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drama, comedy, and tragedy in
all of us, and
turned it into music.

50:53.517 --> 50:55.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, happy
birthday,
Mozart.

50:55.753 --> 50:56.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Rob Kapilow, thanks so much.

50:56.820 --> 51:01.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROB KAPILOW: Thank you.

51:01.592 --> 51:11.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Great music.

51:11.468 --> 51:16.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, finally, the story of a
young dancer
from Pennsylvania striving to
find his place

51:16.941 --> 51:22.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
among his peers while battling
sports stereotypes
and his own anxieties.

51:22.279 --> 51:27.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the second in our series
from Student
Reporting Labs called Outside
the Box, profiles

51:28.018 --> 51:32.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of high school and middle school
students
bravely challenging today's
gender stereotypes.

51:32.823 --> 51:36.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN VARNER, Dance Student,
Cedar Crest High
School: I have danced for eight
years, jazz,

51:36.760 --> 51:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tap, and ballet, as well as
lyrical, modern,
and contemporary.

51:42.967 --> 51:47.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I first started, I was
afraid to tell
people. Some of them don't ever
agree with

51:47.771 --> 51:49.573 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it or accept it.

51:49.673 --> 51:53.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWARD VARNER, Father of Sean
Varner: I think
boys are often stigmatized and
encouraged

51:53.377 --> 51:58.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do something else. It's a lot
easier for
a parent to give a boy a
baseball bat or a

51:58.282 --> 52:00.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
football and say, that's my boy.

52:00.484 --> 52:04.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN VARNER: Most of the guys
don't react
too well, just like try and poke
fun at me.

52:04.989 --> 52:10.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWARD VARNER: I think Sean has
probably lost
friends, but, from my parental
perspective,

52:10.527 --> 52:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think those have been minimal.
He's really
connected with a niche group of
people who

52:16.800 --> 52:18.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like him for who he is.

52:18.736 --> 52:21.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN VARNER: There are some days
when it gets
to me. People typically say,
like, it's girlish

52:21.638 --> 52:25.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or feminine and it's not a real
sport.

52:25.676 --> 52:30.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When I'm not dancing, it
probably does the
opposite of helping me with my
anxiety. When

52:30.914 --> 52:34.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm actually dancing, it helps a
lot, and
it just gives me peace.

52:34.952 --> 52:40.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWARD VARNER: Dance allows him
to address
the anxiety that builds up in
him by being

52:40.858 --> 52:45.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
able to be extremely physical.
It's very good
for him to release some of that
pent-up energy.

52:45.396 --> 52:50.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN VARNER: I am pretty nervous
to go up
to the high school, just because
I'm not sure

52:50.701 --> 52:53.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exactly how people will react.
It will probably
get harder.

52:53.904 --> 52:59.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWARD VARNER: You have to
choose to surround
yourself with people who help
lift you up

52:59.510 --> 53:04.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and separate yourself from those
who are all
about tearing you down. Step up
there, put

53:04.782 --> 53:09.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it out there, and say, this is
who I am. There's
something about the arts that
gives life and

53:09.720 --> 53:11.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
purpose and meaning to life.

53:11.889 --> 53:13.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Impressive.

53:13.824 --> 53:19.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

airport. Making Sense columnist
John Komlos
offers an economic lesson in why
we pay such

53:36.346 --> 53:41.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a steep price and what should be
done about
it. All that and more is on our

to Iraq.

53:55.032 --> 53:57.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for

thank you, and good night.
