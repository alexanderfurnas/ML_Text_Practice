JUDY WOODRUFF: Next: bringing
help to developing countries for
a widely untreated birth defect.

00:07.200 --> 00:10.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fred de Sam Lazaro has a
report from India's commercial
capital, Mumbai, on a condition

00:11.600 --> 00:13.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
called club foot.

00:13.100 --> 00:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Its part of his ongoing
series Agents for Change.

00:16.200 --> 00:20.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: It
only sounds painful.

00:20.833 --> 00:25.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This wailing 5-year-old
is receiving the very
same treatment, a full
leg plaster cast, as

00:26.900 --> 00:30.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this young, perfectly
happy infant.

00:30.233 --> 00:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The therapy here in Mumbai's
Wadia Charitable Hospital will
save these children from a life

00:36.700 --> 00:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of pain and social isolation
that comes from club foot.

00:40.100 --> 00:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a common birth defect
that, in wealthy countries, is
usually corrected early in life.

00:47.600 --> 00:50.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in the developing
world, it remains largely
untreated and becomes a
disability, says orthopedist

00:51.266 --> 00:52.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Dr. ÑMDNMÑAlaric Aroojis.

00:52.266 --> 00:54.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

00:54.266 --> 00:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ÑMDNMÑALARIC AROOJIS,
Orthopedist: It is probably
the second or third important

00:56.333 --> 01:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cause of physical disability
in India, after road traffic
accidents and trauma.

01:00.133 --> 01:03.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's more of a cosmetic
problem initially.

01:03.033 --> 01:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as they grow older and
they can find that they can no
longer play with their friends,

01:06.800 --> 01:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's when it starts
sinking in that this is a
functional problem as well.

01:10.266 --> 01:14.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Club foot
is congenital birth defect in
which a foot, in some cases

01:14.466 --> 01:17.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
both feet, grow inward.

01:17.100 --> 01:19.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Patients learn to walk
on the side of the foot.

01:19.933 --> 01:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Twenty-six-year-old Madhu
Varma says it's painful for
sustained periods, but like most

01:26.100 --> 01:28.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sufferers, she's
learned to adapt.

01:28.233 --> 01:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What she could not deal with
was the sight of her daughter,
Madhuri, when she too was

01:32.866 --> 01:34.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
born with club foot.

01:34.500 --> 01:37.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MADHU VARMA, Mother
(through translator):
It was really difficult.

01:37.800 --> 01:40.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I cried for days when
I saw my child's foot.

01:40.433 --> 01:41.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I could not eat.

01:41.700 --> 01:44.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was just sick with worry.

01:44.066 --> 01:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But they told me that, with
plaster, they could treat it.

01:46.800 --> 01:48.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

01:48.533 --> 01:49.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ÑMDNMÑALARIC AROOJIS:
So this is the daughter
and this is the mother.

01:49.800 --> 01:52.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the daughter's foot
is fully corrected.

01:52.233 --> 01:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
That correction once
required extensive
surgery, Dr. Aroojis says.

01:58.433 --> 02:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now treatment in most cases
is a series of casts over
several weeks:, less invasive,

02:02.733 --> 02:04.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
less expensive and less painful.

02:04.566 --> 02:06.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

02:06.033 --> 02:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ÑMDNMÑALARIC AROOJIS:
It's such a supple method.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We don't force the
foot in any way at all.

02:09.400 --> 02:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, as you can see, that every
time we move the foot just
as much as the child allows.

02:13.633 --> 02:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a procedure which is
done without any anesthetic.

02:15.833 --> 02:20.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
Once corrected, patients
like 5-year-old Nishant
wear a brace attached

02:20.700 --> 02:23.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to an outward-facing
pair of shoes.

02:23.466 --> 02:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a few months, as in
this case, it's only needed
at night and nap time.

02:27.933 --> 02:31.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Nishant shows no sign
of an abnormal gait.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
His parents, struggling
slum dwellers, spent
hundreds of dollars at
ill-equipped and poorly

02:37.133 --> 02:39.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
informed private clinics
with little success.

02:39.366 --> 02:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KETAN DHEPE, Father (through
translator): We had never
heard of club foot until he was

02:43.733 --> 02:45.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
born.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We felt terrible, but when
we brought him to Mumbai, two
or three people told me that

02:48.500 --> 02:50.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Wadia Hospital has
the best treatment.

02:50.700 --> 02:55.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: That
treatment was developed
by an orthopedic surgeon
named Ignacio Ponseti

02:57.033 --> 03:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
half-a-world away here in
Iowa and half-a-century ago.

03:00.633 --> 03:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would take decades before the
Ponseti method became standard
practice for treating club

03:06.066 --> 03:07.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
foot.

03:07.300 --> 03:09.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why do you suppose it
took as long as it did?

03:09.400 --> 03:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHESCA COLLOREDO-MANSFELD,
Business Consultant: One is that
the kinds of people that were

03:13.400 --> 03:18.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
treating club foot, at
least in the U.S., were
orthopedic surgeons.

03:18.100 --> 03:20.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think they became
surgeons for a reason.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They like doing surgery.

03:21.600 --> 03:24.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And this was introducing
a nonsurgical technique.

03:24.933 --> 03:26.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think there was
some resistance to that.

03:26.933 --> 03:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Chesca
Colloredo-Mansfeld, a business
consultant, lived in Iowa city,

03:31.500 --> 03:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where Ponseti, a Spanish
immigrant, was a local legend.

03:34.800 --> 03:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHESCA COLLOREDO-MANSFELD: Dr.
Ponseti's dying wish -- he was
in his 90s at that time -- was

03:39.433 --> 03:42.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to try to get his treatment
out to the rest of the world.

03:42.166 --> 03:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
Colloredo-Mansfeld started
one of several nonprofit
efforts to fulfill

03:46.833 --> 03:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dr. Ponseti's wish to take the
nonsurgical approach, finally
standard in the U.S., to

03:52.566 --> 03:55.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
developing countries.

03:55.233 --> 03:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She co-founded a charity
in 2010 called Miracle
Feet, supported mostly by
high net worth individuals

04:00.233 --> 04:02.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and foundations.

04:02.300 --> 04:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's taken the Ponseti method
and message to clinics in 19
countries so far, with some

04:06.933 --> 04:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
23,000 patients, including
those in Mumbai, providing
training and supplies at low or

04:13.866 --> 04:18.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no cost, including braces
patients will use after their
cast treatments are done.

04:20.433 --> 04:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In India, casting is done by
surgeons, but in countries
where they aren't available,

04:25.233 --> 04:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
non-physicians are trained.

04:27.066 --> 04:31.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Another key role is that
of clinic assistants,
paid by Miracle Feet.

04:31.233 --> 04:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHESCA COLLOREDO-MANSFELD: They
work to educate that family
during the bracing phase to make

04:34.700 --> 04:39.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sure that the children wear the
brace at night and complete the
treatment over the next four

04:39.000 --> 04:41.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

04:41.033 --> 04:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the correction itself only
takes two to three months,
but the follow-up period of

04:44.300 --> 04:46.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
maintaining that correction
is absolutely critical.

04:46.866 --> 04:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
Veteran orthopedic surgeon
Rujuta Mehta says parents
of club foot patients,

04:53.500 --> 04:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
once terrified at the prospect
and cost of surgery, are
elated when they discover it's

04:57.200 --> 04:58.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
no longer needed.

04:58.266 --> 05:00.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

05:00.333 --> 05:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUJUTA MEHTA, Orthopedic
Surgeon: The acceptability,
therefore, of Ponseti is huge.

05:02.600 --> 05:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
Its much simpler, less
intimidating and it's cheaper?

05:05.633 --> 05:06.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

05:06.633 --> 05:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUJUTA MEHTA: Yes, absolutely.

05:07.633 --> 05:09.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Yes, it's cheaper.

05:09.333 --> 05:11.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And this is the kind of
thing you can apply in
a public health program.

05:11.433 --> 05:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The number
of children being treated has
tripled over the past decade

05:14.333 --> 05:16.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or so.

05:16.300 --> 05:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yet five out of six club
foot patients go untreated in
developing countries like India,

05:22.333 --> 05:24.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still enduring an easily
correctable condition for
the rest of their lives.

05:24.966 --> 05:27.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So the challenge is to
get the word out early?

05:27.500 --> 05:29.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

05:29.566 --> 05:32.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUJUTA MEHTA: Absolutely, and
the more awareness there, the
earlier they come, the easier to

05:32.366 --> 05:34.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
treat, the better the
deformity correction.

05:34.933 --> 05:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: A
deformity that is correctable
even in adulthood, as
Madhu Varma discovered

05:41.100 --> 05:45.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
when getting her
daughter treated.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She became the oldest patient
this clinic has ever treated.

05:48.266 --> 05:50.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ÑMDNMÑALARIC AROOJIS: There's
a very good possibility that,
just with serial castings

05:52.400 --> 05:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the Ponseti method, we
should be able to get a
full correction in her.

05:55.633 --> 06:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: She had a
wedding to attend, she told the
doctors, where she and daughter

06:00.166 --> 06:02.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Madhuri would be able to dance.

06:02.366 --> 06:05.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Fred de Sam Lazaro in Mumbai.

06:05.900 --> 06:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that
is something to celebrate.

06:09.200 --> 06:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fred's reporting is a
partnership with the
Under-Told Stories
Project at the University

06:13.633 --> 06:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of St. Thomas in Minnesota.
