00:51.785 --> 00:52.786
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:52.786 --> 00:53.954
MEMBERS OF ITALY'S COAST GUARD

01:02.562 --> 01:04.398

01:04.398 --> 01:05.465
THE VICTIMS WERE TRYING TO GET

01:05.465 --> 01:06.333
FROM THERE TO ITALY.

01:06.333 --> 01:07.834
LATE TODAY, ITALY'S CABINET MET

01:07.834 --> 01:09.036
IN EMERGENCY SESSION.

01:09.036 --> 01:10.971
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR,

01:10.971 --> 01:12.372
AN ESTIMATED 1,500 PEOPLE HAVE

01:12.372 --> 01:13.473
DIED MAKING THE CROSSING TO

01:15.075 --> 01:16.243
IN LIBYA TODAY, ANOTHER ATROCITY

01:16.243 --> 01:17.611
LINKED TO ISIS.

01:17.611 --> 01:18.979

01:23.350 --> 01:25.152

01:25.152 --> 01:26.853
ISIS CALLED THE VICTIMS"

01:26.853 --> 01:27.721
CRUSADERS."

01:27.721 --> 01:29.156
MIXED SIGNALS FROM IRAN TODAY.

01:29.156 --> 01:30.657
THAT COUNTRY'S SUPREME LEADER,

01:30.657 --> 01:32.359
AYATOLLAH ALI KHAMENEI SAID THE

01:32.359 --> 01:34.227
UNITED STATES HAD CREATED "A

01:34.227 --> 01:35.662
MYTH" ABOUT HIS COUNTRY TRYING

01:35.662 --> 01:38.231
TO DEVELOP A NUCLEAR WEAPON.

01:38.231 --> 01:39.766
MEANWHILE, THE DEPUTY COMMANDER

01:39.766 --> 01:41.234
OF IRAN'S ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY

01:41.234 --> 01:42.469
GUARD SAID IRAN WOULD NOT ALLOW

01:42.469 --> 01:45.105
INSPECTIONS OF MILITARY SITES,

01:45.105 --> 01:46.573
CALLING THE IDEA "A NATIONAL

01:46.573 --> 01:48.442
HUMILIATION."

01:48.442 --> 01:50.110
LAST WEEK, DEFENSE SECRETARY ASH

01:50.110 --> 01:51.311
CARTER SAID ANY FINAL DEAL MUST

01:51.311 --> 01:52.913
INCLUDE THOSE INSPECTIONS.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.281
DURING A TELEVISION INTERVIEW

01:54.281 --> 01:55.749
TODAY, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE

01:55.749 --> 01:57.517
SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS

01:57.517 --> 01:59.019
COMMITTEE INSISTED THAT ECONOMIC

01:59.019 --> 02:00.387
SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAN BE PHASED

02:00.387 --> 02:02.255
OUT, NOT ELIMINATED IMMEDIATELY,

02:02.255 --> 02:04.358
IF A FINAL DEAL IS REACHED.

02:04.358 --> 02:05.459
>> I THINKS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

02:05.459 --> 02:06.927
THAT THE PHASE, THE SANCTIONS BE

02:06.927 --> 02:08.228
PHASED, SO THAT WE SEE HOW IRAN

02:08.228 --> 02:10.263
IS BEHAVING AND WHETHER THEY'RE

02:10.263 --> 02:11.832
ACTUALLY LIVING UP TO THE

02:11.832 --> 02:13.834
ARRANGEMENT.

02:13.834 --> 02:16.970
ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS

02:16.970 --> 02:19.506
PEOPLE HAVE IS THAT IRAN TODAY

02:19.506 --> 02:21.708
HAS THE ABILITY THROUGH COVERT

02:21.708 --> 02:23.076
ACTION TO DO ANYTHING THAT THEY

02:23.076 --> 02:24.344
WISH.

02:24.344 --> 02:25.712
>> Sreenivasan: TURNING NOW TO

02:25.712 --> 02:26.847
EUROPE:

02:26.847 --> 02:28.081
ABOUT 300 AMERICAN MILITARY

02:28.081 --> 02:29.850
TRAINERS HAVE ARRIVED IN

02:29.850 --> 02:31.218
UKRAINE, PROMPTING AN ANGRY

02:31.218 --> 02:32.552
RESPONSE FROM THE KREMLIN.

02:32.552 --> 02:33.920
FOR MORE ABOUT THIS, WE ARE

02:33.920 --> 02:35.188
JOINED NOW VIA SKYPE FROM MOSCOW

02:35.188 --> 02:37.257
BY ANDREW ROTH.

02:37.257 --> 02:38.759
HE HAS REPORTED THE STORY FOR

02:38.759 --> 02:39.860
THE NEW YORK TIMES.

02:39.860 --> 02:40.727
SO WHAT ARE THE AMERICAN

02:40.727 --> 02:41.461
ADVISORS DOING ON THE

02:41.461 --> 02:42.429
GROUND?

02:42.429 --> 02:43.497
>> HI, HARI.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.065
THE AMERICAN ADVISOR WHO

02:45.065 --> 02:48.368
CAME FROM IN THE HUDSON 73rd

02:48.368 --> 02:49.736
AIRBORNE BASED IF ITALY AND

02:49.736 --> 02:51.571
THEY COME TO TRAIN UKRAINE'S

02:51.571 --> 02:52.739
FAT GUARD B A THOUSAND

02:52.739 --> 02:53.740
MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL

02:53.740 --> 02:56.176
GUARD ARE ENGAGED IN IN

02:56.176 --> 02:56.843
COMBAT IN THE EAST OF THE

02:56.843 --> 02:58.045
COUNTRY AN THEY'RE GOING TO

02:58.045 --> 02:59.746
BE WORKING ON WHAT THEY SAID

02:59.746 --> 03:01.081
WERE MILITARY TRAINING AS

03:01.081 --> 03:02.349
WELL AS SPECIFICALLY

03:02.349 --> 03:03.950
FOCUSING ON THE OFFICER

03:03.950 --> 03:04.284
CORPS.

03:04.284 --> 03:06.987
SO THIS IS A VERY NEW UNIT

03:06.987 --> 03:09.056
THAT THE NATIONAL GUARD, SO

03:09.056 --> 03:10.590
THE OFFICERS A LOT OF THEM

03:10.590 --> 03:11.491
HAVEN'T HAD MUCH TRAINING

03:11.491 --> 03:12.592
YET AT ALL.

03:12.592 --> 03:13.493
>> Sreenivasan: SO THIS IS

03:13.493 --> 03:14.828
SHORT OF SUPPLYING ANY ARMS

03:14.828 --> 03:16.363
OR WEAPONS TO THE UKRAINE.

03:16.363 --> 03:17.631
THE UNITED STATES HAS

03:17.631 --> 03:18.899
REFUSED TO DO THAT, RIGHT?

03:18.899 --> 03:20.000
>> SO FAR THEY HAVE.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.768
THE UNITED STATES HAS

03:21.768 --> 03:22.903
SUPPLIED SOMEWHAT IS YOU

03:22.903 --> 03:25.372
WILL NONLETHAL AID TO UKRAINE.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.207
THAT INCLUDES PROMISES TO

03:27.207 --> 03:29.109
SUPPLY HUMVEES BOTH ARMOURED

03:29.109 --> 03:31.044
AND UNARMOURED DRONES BUT THEY

03:31.044 --> 03:32.179
HAVEN'T YET AGREED TO SUPPLY

03:32.179 --> 03:35.382
LETHAL AID, WEAPONS IN

03:35.382 --> 03:37.350
PARTICULAR, ANTI-TANK WEAPONS

03:37.350 --> 03:39.386
THAT BOTH PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE

03:39.386 --> 03:40.654
FRONT LINESING SOLDIERS WHO ARE

03:40.654 --> 03:44.091
ON THE FRONT LINES, AS WELL AS

03:44.091 --> 03:45.992
OFFICIALS IN KIEV

03:45.992 --> 03:47.094
DESPERATELY WANT.

03:47.094 --> 03:47.794
>> Sreenivasan: SO WHAT'S

03:47.794 --> 03:49.296
THE REACTION IN MOSCOW WHERE

03:49.296 --> 03:49.796
ARE YOU?

03:49.796 --> 03:51.131
>> THE REACTION IN MOSCOW

03:51.131 --> 03:53.967
HAS BEEN STRONG NEGATIVE

03:53.967 --> 03:55.936
SUGGESTIONS BY PRESIDENT

03:55.936 --> 03:57.437
PUTIN SPOKESMEN THAT THIS

03:57.437 --> 03:58.872
COULD DESTABILIZE THE

03:58.872 --> 04:00.006
SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY.

04:00.006 --> 04:02.442
WE INTERPRET THAT TO MEAN

04:02.442 --> 04:03.610
NEW CONFLICTS OR NEW

04:03.610 --> 04:04.978
OUTBREAK OF VIOLENCE IN THE

04:04.978 --> 04:05.879
SOUTHEAST ALTHOUGH THERE

04:05.879 --> 04:07.347
HAVE BEEN A LOT OF TERRORIST

04:07.347 --> 04:08.815
ACTS IN SEVERAL CITIES IN

04:08.815 --> 04:09.416
UKRAINE AS WELL.

04:09.416 --> 04:10.951
BUT THE KREMLIN HAS REALLY

04:10.951 --> 04:13.053
DRAWN A RED LINE AT

04:13.053 --> 04:13.820
SUPPLYING LETHAL AID.

04:13.820 --> 04:16.890
SO I THINK THAT IT'S NOT

04:16.890 --> 04:18.325
ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT THE

04:18.325 --> 04:19.960
ARRIVAL OF THESE MILITARY

04:19.960 --> 04:21.528
TRAINERS IS GOING TO CHANGE

04:21.528 --> 04:22.662
THE SITUATION IN THE

04:22.662 --> 04:23.163
SOUTHEAST.

04:23.163 --> 04:24.331
WHAT SEEMS FAR MORE

04:24.331 --> 04:25.532
IMPORTANT TO THEM IS THAT

04:25.532 --> 04:26.666
COUNTRIES LIKE THE UNITED

04:26.666 --> 04:28.268
STATES AND EUROPE AND EVEN

04:28.268 --> 04:30.704
ISRAEL DON'T SUPPLY WEAPONS

04:30.704 --> 04:31.538
TO YOU CURRENT.

04:31.538 --> 04:34.040
THAT SEEMS TO BE THEIR REAL

04:34.040 --> 04:34.841
RED LINE.

04:34.841 --> 04:36.843
>> ALL RIGHT, ANDREW ROTH

04:36.843 --> 04:38.111
FROM "THE NEW YORK TIMES"

04:38.111 --> 04:39.846
JOINING US VIA SKYPE FROM

04:39.846 --> 04:40.480
MOSCOW.

04:40.480 --> 04:40.981
THANKS SO MUCH.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.282
>> THANKS.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.986
>> Sreenivasan: IN A DECISION

04:45.986 --> 04:48.021
WITH POSSIBLE REPERCUSSIONS FOR

04:48.021 --> 04:49.055
THE WORLD ECONOMY, CHINA'S

04:49.055 --> 04:50.724
CENTRAL BANK ANNOUNCED NEW

04:50.724 --> 04:52.025
BANKING RULES TODAY.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.360
THEY'RE MEANT TO HELP SPUR BANK

04:53.360 --> 04:54.060
LENDING AND TO COMBAT SLOWER

04:54.060 --> 04:55.262
ECONOMIC GROWTH.

04:55.262 --> 04:56.496
EVEN SO, SOME ANALYSTS

04:56.496 --> 04:57.597
QUESTIONED WHETHER THE MOVE

04:57.597 --> 05:00.934
WOULD ENABLE CHINA TO REACH ITS

05:00.934 --> 05:02.068
7% GROWTH TARGET FOR 2015, ITS

05:02.068 --> 05:03.370
LOWEST IN NEARLY A QUARTER OF A

05:03.370 --> 05:04.404
CENTURY.

05:04.404 --> 05:05.739
RECENT COMMENTS BY F.B.I.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.007

05:16.449 --> 05:17.651
BEEN AIDED BY ACCOMPLICES IN

05:17.651 --> 05:18.752
POLAND AND OTHER COUNTRIES.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.253
THE POLISH EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON

05:20.253 --> 05:21.988
SENT A LETTER TO THE FBI

05:21.988 --> 05:23.723
DIRECTOR SAYING HE HAD, IN THEIR

05:23.723 --> 05:25.091
WORDS, ACCUSED POLES "OF

PERPETRATING CRIMES WHICH NOT

05:26.960 --> 05:28.061
ONLY DID THEY NOT COMMIT BUT

05:28.061 --> 05:29.663
WHICH THEY THEMSELVES WERE

05:29.663 --> 05:30.964
VICTIMS OF.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.465
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW TO SOUTH

THERE OVER THE PAST FEW

05:51.585 --> 05:52.018
WEEKS,?

05:52.018 --> 05:53.019
WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF THIS

05:53.019 --> 05:53.420
VIOLENCE?

05:53.420 --> 05:55.822
>> THERE HAS BEEN AN

TO TRANSIT CAMPS SET UP

06:09.736 --> 06:12.272
AROUND MAJOR CITIES.

06:12.272 --> 06:13.740
IT'S WHAT MANY WOULD SAY IS

06:13.740 --> 06:16.643
DUE TO UNDERLYING PROBLEMS

06:16.643 --> 06:20.280
OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND POVERTY.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.148
AND HAS BEEN CONDEMNED BY

06:29.456 --> 06:30.857
TREND THAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER

06:30.857 --> 06:32.192
AT LEAST TEN YEARS.

06:32.192 --> 06:33.093
>> Sreenivasan: THE PEOPLE

06:33.093 --> 06:34.194
THAT ARE BEING ATTACKED,

06:34.194 --> 06:35.362
WHERE ARE THEY FROM?

06:35.362 --> 06:39.699
>> ZIMBABWE IN MANY CASES,

MALAWI.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.102
MOZAMBIQUE, MANY FROM

NIGERIAN.

06:42.569 --> 06:43.803
A FEW OTHER AFRICAN

06:43.803 --> 06:44.437
COUNTRIES.

06:44.437 --> 06:45.739
SOMETIMES THEY ARE FLEEING

06:45.739 --> 06:47.274
CONFLICTS AND VIOLENCE IN

06:47.274 --> 06:48.675
THEIR HOMELAND.

06:48.675 --> 06:50.477

06:51.611 --> 06:52.445
>> Sreenivasan: HOW ABOUT IS

06:52.445 --> 06:53.280
THE UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION

06:53.280 --> 06:55.148
IN SOUTH AFRICA THAT IS

06:55.148 --> 06:56.082
PROMPTING SOME OF THIS

06:56.082 --> 06:56.750
VIOLENCE.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.717
>> THE OFFICIAL UNEMPLOYMENT

06:57.717 --> 06:58.818
RATE IS ABOUT ONE IN FOUR

06:58.818 --> 06:59.319
PEOPLE.

06:59.319 --> 07:00.720
MOST EXPERTS WOULD SAY THAT

07:00.720 --> 07:03.023
IS ACTUALLY AN UNDERSTATEMENT,

07:03.023 --> 07:04.958
IT IS CLOSER ACTUALLY TO ONE

07:04.958 --> 07:06.326
IN THREE AND THE WORST

07:06.326 --> 07:08.795
AFFECTED OF ALL ARE YOUNGER

07:08.795 --> 07:10.330
BLACK PEOPLE, WHERE SOME

07:10.330 --> 07:11.431
ESTIMATE HALF.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.232
>> Sreenivasan: THIS HAS

07:12.232 --> 07:13.500
ALSO PROMPTED A REACTION

07:13.500 --> 07:14.467
FROM SOUTH AFRICA'S

07:14.467 --> 07:15.068
NEIGHBORS.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.369
TELL ME A BIT ABOUT THAT.

07:16.369 --> 07:17.971
>> YES, THERE HAS BEEN

07:17.971 --> 07:19.072
DEMONSTRATIONS AT SEVERAL

07:19.072 --> 07:21.408
SOUTH AFRICAN EMBASSIES

07:21.408 --> 07:23.576
AROUND AFRICA, THERE HAS

07:23.576 --> 07:25.312
BEEN AN INCIDENT WHERE SOUTH

07:25.312 --> 07:27.080
AFRICAN VEHICLES WERE PELTED

07:27.080 --> 07:28.748
WITH STONES IN NEIGHBORING

07:28.748 --> 07:29.849
MOZAMBIQUE.

07:29.849 --> 07:31.584
THERE HAVE BEEN THREATS TO

07:31.584 --> 07:32.986
CLOSE SOUTH AFRICAN

07:32.986 --> 07:34.354
BUSINESSES.

07:34.354 --> 07:36.256
THIS SADLY HAS REALLY DRIVEN

07:36.256 --> 07:37.357
DIVISIONS BETWEEN SOUTH

07:37.357 --> 07:40.226
AFRICA AND THE REST OF THE

07:40.226 --> 07:41.161

THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE

07:55.175 --> 07:56.443
COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY

07:56.443 --> 07:57.711
SAID TODAY THE RECENT ARREST OF

07:57.711 --> 07:59.479
AN OHIO MAN FOR ALLEGEDLY

07:59.479 --> 08:00.914
PLOTTING A TERROR ATTACK

08:00.914 --> 08:02.515
ILLUSTRATES THE HEIGHTENED

08:02.515 --> 08:03.550
THREAT NOW FACING THE UNITED

08:03.550 --> 08:04.417

08:04.417 --> 08:06.319
>> IT'S THE FIRST FOREIGN

08:06.319 --> 08:07.620
FIGHTER CASE WE'VE SEEN OF AN

08:07.620 --> 08:09.356
AMERICAN CITIZEN TRAVELLING TO

08:09.356 --> 08:10.857
SYRIA, TRAINING WITH AL QAEDA,

08:19.265 --> 08:19.933
THAT IS WHAT'S HUGELY

08:19.933 --> 08:20.900
SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THIS CASE.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.669
>> Sreenivasan: IT'S BEEN A

08:22.669 --> 08:23.670
VIOLENT FEW DAYS IN PARTS OF

CHICAGO.

08:24.371 --> 08:25.372
AUTHORITIES THERE SAY AT LEAST

08:25.372 --> 08:26.673
TWO PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND AT

08:26.673 --> 08:28.007
LEAST 18 WOUNDED IN A SERIES OF

08:28.007 --> 08:29.008
SHOOTINGS SINCE FRIDAY

08:29.008 --> 08:29.542
AFTERNOON.

08:29.542 --> 08:31.144
THE NUMBER OF SHOOTINGS WERE UP

08:31.144 --> 08:32.178
40% DURING THE FIRST THREE

08:32.178 --> 08:33.279
MONTHS OF 2015 COMPARED TO LAST

08:33.279 --> 08:33.847
YEAR.

08:33.847 --> 08:34.614
THE NUMBER OF MURDERS IS UP 29%.

08:34.614 --> 08:36.149
AUTHORITIES IN NEIGHBORING

08:36.149 --> 08:37.784

08:38.618 --> 08:40.286
OUTBREAK FROM SHARED NEEDLE USE.

08:40.286 --> 08:41.921
THE STATE'S DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

08:41.921 --> 08:43.523

DOUG HUGHES'S NEXT SCHEDULE

09:02.809 --> 09:04.077
COURT APPEARANCE IN WASHINGTON

09:04.077 --> 09:05.512
IS THREE WEEKS FROM NOW.

09:05.512 --> 09:06.946
THE INCIDENT HAS PROMPTED A

09:06.946 --> 09:08.314
FULL-SCALE SECURITY REVIEW SINCE

09:08.314 --> 09:10.183
HUGHES WAS ABLE TO FLY UNDER THE

09:10.183 --> 09:11.484
RADAR NEAR SO MANY MONUMENTS

09:11.484 --> 09:13.219
THROUGH RESTRICTED AIRSPACE.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.054
THE NATION'S SECOND MOST

09:15.054 --> 09:16.823
POPULOUS STATE, TEXAS, IS ON THE

09:16.823 --> 09:18.858
VERGE OF PASSING LEGISLATION

09:18.858 --> 09:20.293
THAT WOULD ALLOW RESIDENTS THERE

09:20.293 --> 09:22.195
WITH CONCEALED HANDGUN LICENSES

09:22.195 --> 09:23.329
TO OPENLY CARRY THE GUNS IN

09:23.329 --> 09:24.798
HOLSTERS.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.199
THE BILL CLEARED THE TEXAS HOUSE

09:26.199 --> 09:27.534
FRIDAY.

09:27.534 --> 09:29.035
THE STATE SENATE HAD ALREADY

09:29.035 --> 09:30.336
PASSED A SIMILAR VERSION OF THE

09:30.336 --> 09:31.671
BILL.

09:31.671 --> 09:33.373
THE GOVERNOR HAS SAID HE WILL

09:33.373 --> 09:34.874
SIGN ANY LEGISLATION THAT

09:34.874 --> 09:35.942
EXPANDS SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS.

09:35.942 --> 09:37.377
AND IMAGINE TRAVELING FROM

09:37.377 --> 09:38.945
CHICAGO TO NEW YORK BY TRAIN IN

09:38.945 --> 09:41.581
JUST MORE THAN TWO HOURS.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.049
THAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE SOMETIME

09:43.049 --> 09:44.717
IN THE FUTURE IF A TRAIN NOW

09:44.717 --> 09:46.085
BEING TESTED IN JAPAN IS PUT TO

09:46.085 --> 09:48.321
USE IN THIS COUNTRY.

09:48.321 --> 09:50.457
THE MAGNETIC LEVITATION BULLET

09:50.457 --> 09:53.326
TRAIN HIT A RECORD 366 MILES AN

09:53.326 --> 09:54.661
HOUR DURING A TEST IN THAT

09:54.661 --> 09:55.962
COUNTRY A FEW DAYS AGO.

09:55.962 --> 09:57.564
ITS MANUFACTURER SAYS IT WANTS

09:57.564 --> 09:58.665
TO EXPORT THE TECHNOLOGY TO THE

09:58.665 --> 10:08.775
UNITED STATES.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.977
NEWS FROM WASHINGTON TONIGHT

10:10.977 --> 10:13.613
THAT FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES

10:13.613 --> 10:15.415
DURING THE 1980S AND 1990S, TOP

10:15.415 --> 10:17.917
FBI FORENSIC INVESTIGATORS

10:17.917 --> 10:19.385
ROUTINELY GAVE FLAWED TESTIMONY

10:19.385 --> 10:21.187
OVERSTATING THE EVIDENCE THEY

10:21.187 --> 10:22.789
HAD AGAINST CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.091
IN MORE THAN A DOZEN CASES, THE

10:25.091 --> 10:26.426
DEFENDANTS WERE LATER EXECUTED

10:26.426 --> 10:27.560
OR DIED IN PRISON.

10:27.560 --> 10:28.995
SPENCER HSU BROKE THE STORY IN

10:28.995 --> 10:30.063
TODAY'S WASHINGTON POST.

10:30.063 --> 10:34.200
HE JOINS US NOW FROM WASHINGTON.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.668
SO I SAY THIS IS A WATERSHED

10:35.668 --> 10:36.336
MOMENT IN ONE OF THE

10:36.336 --> 10:38.204
COUNTRY'S LARGEST FORENSIC

10:38.204 --> 10:39.239
SCANDALS AM BREAK THIS DOWN

10:39.239 --> 10:39.839
FOR US.

10:39.839 --> 10:41.040
>> WHAT HAS BEEN FOUND HAS

10:41.040 --> 10:42.075
BEEN AS YOU SAY THAT FOR

10:42.075 --> 10:44.010
MORE THAN TWO DECADES,

10:44.010 --> 10:45.612
NEARLY EVERY EXAMINER AND

10:45.612 --> 10:46.880
NEARLY EVERY CRIMINAL TRIAL

10:46.880 --> 10:49.549
IN WHICH FBI EXPERTS GAVE

10:49.549 --> 10:51.317
TESTIMONY AGAINST CRIMINAL

10:51.317 --> 10:53.653
DEFENDANTS, THEY OVERSTATED

10:53.653 --> 10:54.854
THE STRENGTH, THE THE

10:54.854 --> 10:57.357
SIGNIFICANCE OF A MATCH.

10:57.357 --> 10:58.324
>> Sreenivasan: SO YOU SAY

10:58.324 --> 10:59.526
SAID THAT ABOUT A QUARTER OF

10:59.526 --> 11:01.027
ALL THE WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS

11:01.027 --> 11:02.762
OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN

11:02.762 --> 11:04.163
EXONERATED LATER ON, THE

11:04.163 --> 11:05.565
TESTIMONY OF HAIR EXAMINERS

11:05.565 --> 11:06.966
OR BITE MARK COMPARISONS

11:06.966 --> 11:08.268
HAVE ACTUALLY HELPED SWAY

11:08.268 --> 11:09.802
JURIES AND JUDGES.

11:09.802 --> 11:10.637
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

11:10.637 --> 11:12.872
OUT OF ABOUT 329 DNA

11:12.872 --> 11:15.241
EXAMINATIONS, MORE THAN A

11:15.241 --> 11:17.610
QUARTER INVOLVED INVALID

11:17.610 --> 11:18.778
FORENSIC SCIENCE.

11:18.778 --> 11:20.246
ONE OF THE ISSUES HERE IS

11:20.246 --> 11:23.983
THAT UNLIKE DNA WITH

11:23.983 --> 11:25.652
DEVELOPED BY SCIENTISTS FOR

11:25.652 --> 11:27.253
SCIENTISTS, A LOT OF THE

11:27.253 --> 11:28.821
EARLIER PATTERN-BASED

11:28.821 --> 11:30.256
TECHNIQUES, COMPARING HAIR,

11:30.256 --> 11:33.493
FIBER, BITE MARKS, EVEN

11:33.493 --> 11:34.260
TRACING BULLETS TO BEING

11:34.260 --> 11:35.795
FIRED FROM SPECIFIC WEAPONS

11:35.795 --> 11:38.398
WERE DEVELOPED IN THE LAB BY

11:38.398 --> 11:39.933
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

11:39.933 --> 11:40.767
>> Sreenivasan: LET'S JUST

11:40.767 --> 11:42.635
SAY, FOR EXAMPLE, IF A

11:42.635 --> 11:44.170
DEFENSE ATTORNEY FIGURES OUT

11:44.170 --> 11:45.772
THAT SOME OF THE EVIDENCE

11:45.772 --> 11:47.640
USED IN A TRIAL FOR THEIR

11:47.640 --> 11:50.643
CLIENT INCLUDES TESTIMONY

11:50.643 --> 11:52.412
FROM THE FBI INSPECTORS,

11:52.412 --> 11:53.613
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR

11:53.613 --> 11:54.113
THEM.

11:54.113 --> 11:55.982
DOES THAT MEAN THE JUDGE

11:55.982 --> 11:56.916
AUTOMATICALLY GRANT A NEW

11:56.916 --> 11:58.685
INVESTIGATION OR RETRIAL?

11:58.685 --> 12:00.320
>> NOT NECESSARILY.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.655
THE FBI HAS OFFERED TO

12:02.655 --> 12:04.023
RETEST IN CASES WHERE AREAS

12:04.023 --> 12:05.491
WERE MADE, DNA.

12:05.491 --> 12:06.926
IF DNA EVIDENCE IS

12:06.926 --> 12:07.927
AVAILABLE.

12:07.927 --> 12:09.629
THEY HAVE OFFERED TO DROP

12:09.629 --> 12:10.997
PROCEDURAL BARS TO POST

12:10.997 --> 12:12.131
CONVICTION APPEALS AS WELL.

12:12.131 --> 12:15.435
BUT FOR STATES, MOST STATES

12:15.435 --> 12:18.304
MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO

12:18.304 --> 12:19.572
CHALLENGE OLD CONVICTIONS IN

12:19.572 --> 12:21.307
THE ABSENCE OF DNA.

12:21.307 --> 12:22.442
ONLY CALIFORNIA AND TEXAS

12:22.442 --> 12:25.311
HAVE LAWS THAT PERMIT IT IN

12:25.311 --> 12:27.213
CASES WHEN FORENSIC EVIDENCE

12:27.213 --> 12:30.683
IS RECANTED OR UNDERMINED BY

12:30.683 --> 12:31.784
SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES.

12:31.784 --> 12:32.752
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT IS THE

12:32.752 --> 12:34.454
FBI GOING TO DO TO FIX THIS?

12:34.454 --> 12:36.789
>> THEY HAVE SAID THAT THEY

12:36.789 --> 12:39.092
WILL DO A ROOT CAUSE

12:39.092 --> 12:40.860
ANALYSIS AFTER ALL THE

12:40.860 --> 12:41.661
REVIEWS ARE COMPLETED AM

12:41.661 --> 12:43.763
AGAIN, THEY HAVE OFFERED TO

12:43.763 --> 12:46.232
RETEST DNA WHEN DNA EVIDENCE

12:46.232 --> 12:48.201
IS AVAILABLE AND TO ALLOW

12:48.201 --> 12:50.870
FEDERAL CASES TO BE BROUGHT.

12:50.870 --> 12:54.974
THEY ARE AGREEING TO REVIEW

12:54.974 --> 12:56.909
SCIENTIFIC TESTIMONY AND LAB

12:56.909 --> 12:58.544
RESULTS, STANDARDS TO MAKE

12:58.544 --> 13:00.346
CLEAR WHAT IS ERRONEOUS AND

13:00.346 --> 13:02.415
WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE IN 19

13:02.415 --> 13:03.416
OTHER TECHNIQUES THEY SAY

13:03.416 --> 13:05.551
THEY DID THIS FOR HAIR IN

13:05.551 --> 13:06.753
2012 WHEN OUR REPORTS

13:06.753 --> 13:07.487
SURFACED.

13:07.487 --> 13:08.688
AND THEY LAUNCHED THIS

13:08.688 --> 13:10.590
REVIEW.

13:10.590 --> 13:13.126
THE BALL NOW GOES TO STATE

13:13.126 --> 13:13.993
AUTHORITIES AS WELL AS TO

13:13.993 --> 13:15.762
THE COURTS TO DETERMINE IF

13:15.762 --> 13:17.230
THEY WILL CHANGE THESE

13:17.230 --> 13:18.965
PRECEDENTS MORE RIGOROUSLY

13:18.965 --> 13:21.034
CHALLENGE THE ADMISSIBILITY

13:21.034 --> 13:23.903
OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE.

13:23.903 --> 13:25.104
>> Sreenivasan: SPENCER HSU

13:25.805 --> 13:26.673
THANKS SO MUCH.

13:26.673 --> 13:34.681

13:37.917 --> 13:39.786
YOU NO DOUBT HAVE HEARD ABOUT

19:17.990 --> 19:19.358
PAYING UP GETS YOUR DATA BACK.

19:19.358 --> 19:20.793

19:21.994 --> 19:23.629
SCHOOL OFFICIALS SAYS NO STUDENT

SUCH SEEMINGLY SMALL TARGETS

19:36.809 --> 19:38.010

HOWEVER, WASN'T OVER.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.581
INNA HAD PAID THE HACKERS $500,

20:48.581 --> 20:50.883
BUT RATHER THAN RELEASING HER

20:50.883 --> 20:53.419
FILES AS PROMISED, THEY SENT HER

20:53.419 --> 20:55.221
THIS MESSAGE.

20:55.221 --> 20:56.322
IT SAID, "YOU DID NOT PAY IN

20:56.322 --> 20:57.256
TIME FOR DECRYPTION."

20:57.256 --> 20:58.657
REMEMBER, SHE'D PAID TWO HOURS

20:58.657 --> 21:00.059
LATE, NOW THE HACKERS DOUBLED

21:00.059 --> 21:02.061
THE RANSOM TO $1,000, GAVE HER

21:02.061 --> 21:03.329
ANOTHER DEADLINE, AND SAID IF

21:03.329 --> 21:04.530
SHE MISSED THIS ONE, THEY'D

21:04.530 --> 21:06.532
DELETE EVERYTHING.

21:06.532 --> 21:08.934
>> IF YOU WON'T PAY BY THEN, ALL

21:08.934 --> 21:13.205
YOUR FILES ARE GONE FOREVER.

21:13.205 --> 21:14.707

ONLY TWO HOURS LATE!"

21:25.985 --> 21:27.987
>> SO FIRST I SENT THEM ABOUT

21:27.987 --> 21:30.356
ALL THESE OBSTACLES AND THE FACT

21:30.356 --> 21:31.957
THAT I WAS ONLY TWO HOURS LATE

>> Reporter: DID THIS FEEL

21:38.898 --> 21:40.366

21:41.634 --> 21:42.868
CRIMINALS, WHO KNOWS WHERE THEY

21:42.868 --> 21:44.203
ARE IN THE WORLD, SAYING "YOU

21:55.481 --> 21:56.916
IT'S EITHER THIS OR NOTHING.

21:56.916 --> 21:57.950

21:57.950 --> 21:59.718
WOULD WORK.

21:59.718 --> 22:01.053

22:01.053 --> 22:02.254
