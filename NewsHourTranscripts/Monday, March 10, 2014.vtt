SO THEY DO HAVE TO BE           
SELECTIVE.                      
BUT IT DOES RAISE QUESTIONS     

22:09.065 --> 22:10.463
SELECTIVE.                      
BUT IT DOES RAISE QUESTIONS

22:16.932 --> 22:17.896
THIS, THIS HUGE NUMBER SEEN     
IN THE PAST.                    
I REMEMBER SITTING HERE         

22:17.898 --> 22:19.297
IN THE PAST.                    
I REMEMBER SITTING HERE         
TALKING WITH YOU ABOUT THE      

22:19.299 --> 22:19.931
I REMEMBER SITTING HERE         
TALKING WITH YOU ABOUT THE      
TOYOTA SAFETY RECALL?           

22:19.933 --> 22:21.330
TALKING WITH YOU ABOUT THE      
TOYOTA SAFETY RECALL?           
>> IT DIFFERS FROM TOYOTA IN    

22:21.332 --> 22:22.098
TOYOTA SAFETY RECALL?           
>> IT DIFFERS FROM TOYOTA IN    
TWO MANY REASONS.               

22:22.100 --> 22:23.397
>> IT DIFFERS FROM TOYOTA IN    
TWO MANY REASONS.               
IT IS MUCH SMALLER.             

22:23.399 --> 22:24.730
TWO MANY REASONS.               
IT IS MUCH SMALLER.             
TOYOTA ULTIMATELY WAS OVER      

22:24.732 --> 22:26.130
IT IS MUCH SMALLER.             
TOYOTA ULTIMATELY WAS OVER      
10 MILLION VEHICLES             

22:26.133 --> 22:27.831
TOYOTA ULTIMATELY WAS OVER      
10 MILLION VEHICLES             
WORLDWIDE FOR TWO PEDAL         

22:27.833 --> 22:28.198
10 MILLION VEHICLES             
WORLDWIDE FOR TWO PEDAL         
PROBLEMS.                       

22:28.200 --> 22:29.531
WORLDWIDE FOR TWO PEDAL         
PROBLEMS.                       
AND THE DIFFERENCE WAS          

22:29.533 --> 22:30.465
PROBLEMS.                       
AND THE DIFFERENCE WAS          
TOYOTA'S RECALL AFFECTED A      

22:30.467 --> 22:31.565
AND THE DIFFERENCE WAS          
TOYOTA'S RECALL AFFECTED A      
LOT OF VEHICLES THAT WERE       

22:31.567 --> 22:32.631
TOYOTA'S RECALL AFFECTED A      
LOT OF VEHICLES THAT WERE       
STILL IN PRODUCTION, STILL      

22:32.633 --> 22:33.997
LOT OF VEHICLES THAT WERE       
STILL IN PRODUCTION, STILL      
IN DEALER SHOWROOMS.            

22:33.999 --> 22:37.064
STILL IN PRODUCTION, STILL      
IN DEALER SHOWROOMS.            
SO IN 2010, 1-- AT ONE          

22:37.066 --> 22:37.731
IN DEALER SHOWROOMS.            
SO IN 2010, 1-- AT ONE          
POINT-- .                       

22:37.733 --> 22:38.765
SO IN 2010, 1-- AT ONE          
POINT-- .                       
>> Ifill: WHICH IS NOT TRUE.    

22:38.767 --> 22:39.765
POINT-- .

22:41.800 --> 22:43.531
OF PRODUCTION ABOUT FIVE OR     
SIX YEARS AGO.                  
SO THE NEW, THE CURRENT GM      

22:43.533 --> 22:44.631
SIX YEARS AGO.                  
SO THE NEW, THE CURRENT GM      
MODELS ARE COMPLETELY           

22:44.633 --> 22:45.565
SO THE NEW, THE CURRENT GM      
MODELS ARE COMPLETELY           
DIFFERENT AS TO THE             

22:45.567 --> 22:45.932
MODELS ARE COMPLETELY           
DIFFERENT AS TO THE             
IGNITION.                       

22:45.934 --> 22:47.331
DIFFERENT AS TO THE             
IGNITION.                       
THE TOYOTA PROBLEM HAD ABOUT    

22:47.334 --> 22:48.865
IGNITION.                       
THE TOYOTA PROBLEM HAD ABOUT    
HALF THE VEHICLES AT ONE        

22:48.867 --> 22:50.199
THE TOYOTA PROBLEM HAD ABOUT    
HALF THE VEHICLES AT ONE        
POINT HAD TO BE, THEY COULD     

22:50.201 --> 22:51.699
HALF THE VEHICLES AT ONE        
POINT HAD TO BE, THEY COULD     
NO SELTL BECAUSE THEY HAD TO    

22:51.701 --> 22:52.766

22:52.768 --> 22:54.933
NO SELTL BECAUSE THEY HAD TO    
FIGURE THIS PROBLEM OUT.        
SO THAT, GM IS TRYING TO        

22:54.935 --> 22:56.499
FIGURE THIS PROBLEM OUT.        
SO THAT, GM IS TRYING TO        
EMPHASIZE THIS IS OLD GM,
