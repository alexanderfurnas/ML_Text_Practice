JUDY WOODRUFF: The United
Nations has called it the worst
humanitarian crisis since 1945,

00:04.900 --> 00:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, just today, the lead
editorial in The Washington
Post called it the worst crisis

00:10.633 --> 00:12.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you have never heard of.

00:12.700 --> 00:17.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Drought and famine threaten 20
million people in the war-torn
countries of Yemen, South

00:19.166 --> 00:22.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sudan, and Somalia, as
well as drought-stricken
neighbors, such as Ethiopia.

00:25.466 --> 00:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week, for the first
time, eight of the leading
U.S.-based international
relief organizations

00:29.633 --> 00:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are launching the Global
Emergency Response Coalition.

00:33.233 --> 00:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a joint fund-raising appeal
to the American public due to
the hunger crisis, which will

00:39.466 --> 00:42.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
use social media to
amplify its message.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent
Fred de Sam Lazaro
reports from the breakaway
region of Somalia known

00:47.433 --> 00:49.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as Somaliland.

00:49.533 --> 00:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: A glimpse
from our airplane window showed
the stark moonscape of drought

00:55.533 --> 00:59.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
stretching for miles on
end, where many regions
in East Africa are at
risk of famine for the

01:00.500 --> 01:04.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
third time in 25 years.

01:04.866 --> 01:09.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 360,000 children
are malnourished in Somalia;
70,000 of them are in critical

01:11.300 --> 01:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
condition, according to the
World Health Organization.

01:14.100 --> 01:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We traveled to Somaliland,
a region that declared
itself independent of
Somalia more than two

01:19.700 --> 01:21.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
decades ago.

01:21.666 --> 01:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Its capital, Hargeisa, has seen
an influx of mostly nomadic
livestock herders fleeing

01:27.066 --> 01:30.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the drought and in some
cases fighting in the
vast surrounding region.

01:30.666 --> 01:33.733 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
They now live in
temporary camps.

01:33.733 --> 01:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thirty-old-Year-old Hamda
Abdilahi Dhamac is the
mother of five children.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She came here after all of
her livestock, some 30 goats
and 50 sheep, died from the

01:44.333 --> 01:46.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
drought.

01:46.500 --> 01:48.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HAMDA ABDILAHI DHAMAC,
Somaliland (through
translator): I used
to be part of a family

01:48.033 --> 01:50.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of livestock herders.

01:50.133 --> 01:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But now I have been forced
to come to this camp, where I
don't have enough money to buy

01:52.700 --> 01:53.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
food and water.

01:53.966 --> 01:56.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I am really suffering.

01:56.066 --> 02:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: She gets
some money from relatives, but
says it's just enough to buy

02:01.400 --> 02:03.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rice and perhaps
an onion or tomato.

02:03.866 --> 02:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She can't afford beans or meat.

02:07.400 --> 02:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like Dhamac, a majority
of Somalis make their
living by grazing animals.

02:11.933 --> 02:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the drought has wiped out
70 percent of all livestock.

02:15.366 --> 02:18.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dhamac says she doesn't know how
she will survive in the future.

02:18.700 --> 02:22.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HAMDA ABDILAHI DHAMAC
(through translator): I
don't have any hope now.

02:22.166 --> 02:24.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't have a
plan for my future.

02:24.166 --> 02:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Humanitarian
organizations are distributing
emergency food to ease the

02:29.700 --> 02:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
crisis in the short-term.

02:31.900 --> 02:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeremiah Kibanya coordinates
relief efforts for World Vision.

02:34.866 --> 02:39.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEREMIAH KIBANYA, World
Vision: We are providing
food commodities to the
people who right now

02:40.900 --> 02:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not having anything to eat.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will need money to help
people get more animals into
their family and begin their

02:48.966 --> 02:51.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
livelihood.

02:51.033 --> 02:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: How
much do you need, and what
percentage are you getting?

02:53.133 --> 02:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEREMIAH KIBANYA: World Vision
has requested for about $37
million be able to respond.

02:57.633 --> 03:01.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, so far, we have
received $11 million.

03:01.233 --> 03:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Most of
that money, $10 million, has
come from the U.S. government.

03:08.300 --> 03:12.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Seattle-based agency is
helping deliver medical care
for those most vulnerable to

03:12.166 --> 03:15.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
drought: pregnant
women and children.

03:15.300 --> 03:18.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At this clinic in the
village of Gabiley, babies
are measured and weighed.

03:18.966 --> 03:23.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
A simple test with an
armband determines their
level of nutrition.

03:23.133 --> 03:25.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Yellow means moderate
malnutrition.

03:25.966 --> 03:28.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Red means severe.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If there's malnourishment,
the mothers are given packets
of peanut paste, along with

03:32.266 --> 03:37.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
guidance to administer it only
to the sickest children, says
clinic director Asha Abdi Ali.

03:39.166 --> 03:43.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's very difficult for a
mother if she has other children
who are hungry to not share

03:43.166 --> 03:44.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it?

03:44.866 --> 03:46.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ASHA ABDI ALI, Clinic
Director: We tell them
for the same reason.

03:46.333 --> 03:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's that these other
children are not in need.

03:48.300 --> 03:50.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is only for this child.

03:50.566 --> 03:53.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: But
it's still difficult?

03:53.233 --> 03:55.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ASHA ABDI ALI: It's
still difficult.

03:55.266 --> 03:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Keeping
people healthy is now made even
more difficult, ironically,

04:00.166 --> 04:02.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
by rain.

04:02.266 --> 04:05.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some rains have arrived this
year, and that's been enough
to green up the landscape.

04:05.466 --> 04:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the effects of the
drought are going to linger
for a much longer time.

04:08.800 --> 04:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, more immediately,
the threat to public
health is even greater.

04:13.066 --> 04:17.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's because there are
millions of livestock
carcasses strewn all
over the landscape, and

04:17.833 --> 04:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what the rains do is
wash contaminants into
sources of drinking water.

04:25.266 --> 04:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On a hillside just outside
Dilla, a village about
an hour's drive from
the capital, carcasses

04:29.666 --> 04:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have become an unmanageable
problem for Mayor
Ibrahim Abdi Haji.

04:31.933 --> 04:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IBRAHIM ABDI HAJI, Mayor of
Dilla (through translator):
It is a bigger problem than we

04:35.433 --> 04:36.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can handle alone.

04:36.966 --> 04:39.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have asked the government for
help to burn those dead animals.

04:39.766 --> 04:41.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But we haven't
received help yet.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're afraid the community
will get waterborne
diseases from the animals.

04:44.433 --> 04:46.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We are very scared.

04:46.466 --> 04:50.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Water
which has collected at a nearby
earthen dam, has been completely

04:50.600 --> 04:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
contaminated by both dead
and diseased animals.

04:53.666 --> 04:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEREMIAH KIBANYA: And if people
use that water because of
desperation, and they don't have

04:58.033 --> 05:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
any other water to drink, that
poses another threat again to
outbreak of waterborne diseases

05:04.833 --> 05:06.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the communities.

05:06.900 --> 05:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That can lead to outbreaks
of diseases like acute
water diarrhea or cholera.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I want to show you
the best way of making
your water clean and safe.

05:16.666 --> 05:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: As a
short-term solution, World
Vision has distributed
some 75,000 filters

05:23.033 --> 05:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and chlorine tablets, so
people can purify their water.

05:25.933 --> 05:30.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But World Vision's
Kibanya says the other
issues, food shortages,
limited medical services

05:32.100 --> 05:34.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and lack of jobs, are
tougher ones to tackle.

05:34.333 --> 05:39.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There's a tradition
in this region, where
droughts are localized,
that communities welcome

05:39.200 --> 05:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people temporarily displaced
by the dry conditions.

05:43.300 --> 05:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But one of Dilla's newcomers,
Roda Yusaf, a mother of seven,
isn't sure she can return

05:48.133 --> 05:50.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to her former livelihood
without animals.

05:50.933 --> 05:53.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She plans to stay in
Dilla indefinitely.

05:53.033 --> 05:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RODA YUSAF, Somaliland (through
translator): When you come from
another area, it's difficult

05:58.766 --> 06:00.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to get a job here.

06:00.100 --> 06:02.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the community has
been very supportive.

06:02.200 --> 06:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Six years
ago, Dilla was in a similar
position of hosting displaced

06:06.733 --> 06:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
persons from a severe famine
which ended up killing
260,000 people in Somalia.

06:13.300 --> 06:16.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mayor Haji hopes that
doesn't happen again.

06:16.833 --> 06:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It seems to be a tradition
here for sharing and helping
people who are in distress in

06:22.433 --> 06:23.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the tribe.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
After some time, does
that become difficult?

06:25.766 --> 06:30.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IBRAHIM ABDI HAJI (through
translator): We are starting
to reach that point.

06:33.033 --> 06:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The last time we supported
displaced people who
had come here, everybody
ended up suffering.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The repeated
cycles of drought over the
past 25 years is constantly

06:39.600 --> 06:43.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the minds of aid workers
and political leaders.

06:43.766 --> 06:46.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Saad Ali Shire is
Somaliland's foreign minister.

06:46.366 --> 06:50.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAAD ALI SHIRE, Somaliland
Foreign Minister: We need to
look into the future and build

06:50.766 --> 06:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
resilience, so when the drought
comes next time -- and it
will come, because these are

06:57.400 --> 06:59.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
now more severe and
more frequent, because
of the climate change.

06:59.900 --> 07:04.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He
says much greater long-term
investment must be made
to improve the region's

07:05.466 --> 07:07.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
viability.

07:07.566 --> 07:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAAD ALI SHIRE: We need
to change the way we raise
livestock in this country.

07:12.766 --> 07:16.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We very much follow --
we raise livestock as we
raised it 200 years ago.

07:18.166 --> 07:20.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a nomadic way.

07:20.366 --> 07:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think we need to settle
and grow food for livestock.

07:24.433 --> 07:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we also need, I think, to
orient part of our population
towards fishing and other

07:32.833 --> 07:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
activities, industry, services.

07:35.266 --> 07:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: However,
that seems unlikely,
at least in the short
term, given that urgent

07:41.366 --> 07:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
appeals to deal with the
immediate needs have fallen far
short of what the U.N. and aid

07:45.800 --> 07:47.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
agencies have requested.

07:47.900 --> 07:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Fred de Sam Lazaro reporting
from Dilla, Somaliland.

07:55.400 --> 07:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Fred's
reporting is a partnership
with the Under-Told
Stories Project at the

07:59.166 --> 08:00.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
University of St.
Thomas in Minnesota.
