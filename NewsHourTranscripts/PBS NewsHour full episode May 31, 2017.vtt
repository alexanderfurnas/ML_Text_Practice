JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.774 --> 00:13.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: A
massive blast
rocks Kabul, leaving at least 90
dead, hundreds

00:13.046 --> 00:18.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wounded, and an entire city
block in ruin
in the diplomatic hub of
Afghanistan's capital.

00:18.551 --> 00:20.353 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Then:

00:20.387 --> 00:24.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER WITTIG, German Ambassador
to the United
States: The U.S. would find
itself in an odd

00:24.190 --> 00:26.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
company, just with Syria and
Nicaragua.

00:26.960 --> 00:32.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: With reports the
Trump administration
may pull the U.S. out of the
Paris climate

00:32.132 --> 00:37.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
accord, I sit down with
Germany's ambassador
to talk about the growing rift
between Berlin

00:37.971 --> 00:39.472 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Washington.

00:39.506 --> 00:43.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And part two of our look at how
we treat premature
babies.

00:43.810 --> 00:49.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can the simplest emotional
connections help
combat the stress of premature
birth?

00:49.382 --> 00:51.051 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

00:51.084 --> 00:55.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARTHA WELCH, Columbia
University: The child
is bombarded with sounds and
light.

00:55.388 --> 01:00.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's antithetical to what the
brain needs
and the child needs for
development.

01:00.560 --> 01:04.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what we're doing is trying
to make up
for that.

01:04.531 --> 01:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:07.634 --> 01:11.871 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:11.905 --> 01:24.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The situation is
deteriorating
day by day.

01:24.084 --> 01:29.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those were the words of one of
Afghanistan's
lawmakers after a huge truck
bomb devastated

01:29.789 --> 01:31.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
part of Kabul today.

01:31.424 --> 01:35.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It killed at least 90 people,
and wounded
400 more.

01:35.995 --> 01:39.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret
Warner has our report.

01:39.499 --> 01:45.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: A pall of black
smoke, sirens
wailing, chaos in the streets.

01:45.839 --> 01:52.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A gigantic suicide bomb had
detonated in the
highly secured heart of the
Afghan capital.

01:52.479 --> 01:58.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The tremendous force of the
blast gouged out
a 15-foot crater and blew out
windows as far

01:58.418 --> 02:00.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as half-a-mile away.

02:00.220 --> 02:05.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAHIM, Afghanistan (through
translator): The
explosion took place the minute
we sat down.

02:05.158 --> 02:08.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After the explosion, we hurried
downstairs
and saw all the things damaged.

02:08.495 --> 02:10.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Many buildings were badly
destroyed.

02:10.363 --> 02:15.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Special
correspondent Jennifer
Glasse in Kabul, who spoke to us
via Skype,

02:15.602 --> 02:17.370 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
said the bombing came as a jolt.

02:17.403 --> 02:22.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: It's been quiet
here in the
Afghan capital for the last
couple of weeks,

02:22.642 --> 02:23.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
almost eerily quiet.

02:23.610 --> 02:24.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The weather's been beautiful.

02:24.911 --> 02:27.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People have been going out for
picnics.

02:27.213 --> 02:36.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The scale of this attack is
really unprecedented,
the worst we believe since 2001,
and that

02:36.222 --> 02:38.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is such a terrible, terrible
shock to people.

02:38.791 --> 02:43.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The bomb hidden
in a septic
tank cleaning truck rocked the
diplomatic

02:43.196 --> 02:45.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quarter at the height of morning
rush hour.

02:45.899 --> 02:51.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Despite its fortified blast
wall, Germany's
embassy suffered extensive
damage.

02:51.237 --> 02:56.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bomb site was also close to
the Afghan
presidential palace and defense
ministry.

02:56.476 --> 03:02.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. Embassy is about a mile
away, yet
11 American contractors were
hurt.

03:02.582 --> 03:06.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scores of the wounded were
rushed to nearby
hospitals, where some told of
surviving the

03:06.986 --> 03:08.321 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
blast.

03:08.354 --> 03:11.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
Everything was destroyed
in my location.

03:11.691 --> 03:12.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't know what happened.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There were lots of workers.

03:14.127 --> 03:15.562 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A lot of people were martyred.

03:15.595 --> 03:17.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All the people who were on the
street were
killed.

03:17.397 --> 03:21.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: In Nuremberg,
German Chancellor
Angela Merkel condemned the
attack.

03:21.834 --> 03:26.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA MERKEL, German Chancellor
(through
translator): In moments like
these, it is

03:26.940 --> 03:31.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
once again clear to us that
terrorism knows
no boundaries.

03:31.277 --> 03:37.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of us who believe in the
rights, the freedom
and the dignity of mankind in
Europe, America,

03:37.183 --> 03:43.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Africa, and of course also in
Afghanistan
will wage the battle against
terrorists and

03:43.189 --> 03:44.991 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we will win.

03:45.024 --> 03:48.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Today's bombing
is just the
latest in a string of attacks
that have racked

03:48.528 --> 03:50.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Afghan capital.

03:50.697 --> 03:53.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Security conditions have
deteriorated sharply.

03:53.533 --> 03:58.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And hundreds of Afghans have
been killed in
bombings from both a resurgent
Taliban and

03:58.638 --> 04:02.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a growing faction of the Islamic
State.

04:02.375 --> 04:08.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jennifer Glasse says the Afghan
security forces'
failure to protect them have
roiled the country's

04:08.281 --> 04:09.682 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
citizens.

04:09.716 --> 04:11.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: There's a lot
of anger here
among the Afghan people.

04:11.818 --> 04:16.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How this large truck got into
this part of
Kabul, heavily fortified --
you're not allowed

04:16.889 --> 04:18.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have big trucks in the center
of Kabul
during the daytime for security
reasons and

04:18.591 --> 04:20.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for traffic reasons.

04:20.393 --> 04:28.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so there are a lot of
questions among
the Afghan people how this could
have possibly

04:28.735 --> 04:30.670 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
happened.

04:30.703 --> 04:33.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The Taliban
denied responsibility
for today's blast, and in fact
condemned it.

04:33.539 --> 04:40.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: We have seen
this before,
especially in cases where there
have been

04:40.880 --> 04:47.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
large civilian causalities and a
potential
for a public backlash, that the
Taliban, sometimes,

04:47.620 --> 04:49.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even when they have carried out
the attack,
deny that the attack was theirs.

04:49.489 --> 04:52.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Afghan troops
have suffered
heavy losses over the past year,
as the Taliban

04:52.258 --> 04:55.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has made gains across the
countryside.

04:55.161 --> 05:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now the Trump administration has
signaled
it plans to take a more
aggressive role there.

05:01.134 --> 05:06.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reports surfaced earlier this
month that the
president is considering sending
5,000 more

05:06.105 --> 05:10.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. troops to support the 8,000
already on
the ground.

05:10.443 --> 05:12.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Again, Jennifer Glasse:

05:12.412 --> 05:15.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: The idea is to
get more international
forces a little closer to the
ground level

05:15.148 --> 05:18.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to guide the Afghan security
forces in the
field, to get them a little bit
more coordinated,

05:18.418 --> 05:27.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and to make them a little more
effective in
the fight against the Taliban.

05:27.894 --> 05:36.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They're right now taking
punishing casualties,
losing 15, sometimes 20 soldiers
a day across

05:36.202 --> 05:37.970 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the country.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The U.S. also
has stepped
up airstrikes and raids against
the Islamic

05:39.872 --> 05:44.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
State group that's now active in
Eastern Afghanistan.

05:44.110 --> 05:48.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Last month, in a highly
publicized move, the
U.S. dropped its most powerful
conventional

05:48.848 --> 05:51.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bomb on ISIS hideout there.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

05:54.721 --> 06:00.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
spoke by phone
today with Afghan President
Ashraf Ghani.

06:00.326 --> 06:03.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House said the U.S.
condemns the
attack.

06:03.663 --> 06:08.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: There's
word that
ousted FBI Director James Comey
will testify

06:09.001 --> 06:13.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the president pressured him
to drop the
investigation of Michael Flynn.

06:13.906 --> 06:19.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fired national security
adviser is under
scrutiny over his Russia ties.

06:19.212 --> 06:24.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CNN and The Wall Street Journal
report that
Comey is expected to tell that
to the Senate

06:24.150 --> 06:27.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Intelligence Committee as early
as next week.

06:27.453 --> 06:32.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the House Intelligence
Committee today
issued subpoenas for Flynn, the
president's

06:32.125 --> 06:36.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
personal lawyer, Michael Cohen,
and others.

06:36.095 --> 06:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump today promised a
decision
"very soon" on whether the U.S.
will quit

06:40.933 --> 06:43.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Paris accord on climate
change.

06:43.569 --> 06:48.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House wouldn't confirm
news reports
that he is likely to withdraw,
but will leave

06:48.808 --> 06:51.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
open the possibility of
reversing his decision.

06:51.544 --> 06:55.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will take a closer look at
this, and the
day's many reactions, later in
the program.

06:55.948 --> 07:02.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A tropical cyclone that tore
through Southern
Bangladesh has left thousands of
Rohingya

07:02.855 --> 07:05.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Muslim refugees in ruined camps.

07:06.025 --> 07:12.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They had fled persecution in
Myanmar and were
living in flimsy shelters when
the storm struck

07:12.198 --> 07:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tuesday, killing seven people.

07:14.634 --> 07:20.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Authorities evacuated 350,000
permanent coastal
residents, but most of the
refugees stayed

07:20.873 --> 07:21.841 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
behind.

07:21.874 --> 07:24.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, many have lost what little
they had.

07:24.844 --> 07:29.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
Yesterday, the storm
destroyed my house.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
My son and daughter were
injured.

07:30.416 --> 07:32.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are in a hospital.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was also injured.

07:33.219 --> 07:34.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The roof has fallen on my chest.

07:34.754 --> 07:37.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now I don't have any food and no
money to
repair my house.

07:37.957 --> 07:43.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The refugees
spent last night
exposed to the rain, waiting for
outside aid

07:43.329 --> 07:45.131 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to arrive.

07:45.164 --> 07:49.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's word that President
Trump has invited
other countries' leaders to call
him on his

07:49.902 --> 07:51.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
private cell phone.

07:51.804 --> 07:56.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Associated Press and others
report that
this is raising concerns about
holding sensitive

07:56.542 --> 07:59.645 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conversations on unsecured
lines.

07:59.679 --> 08:04.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reports say that Mr. Trump
has given his
cell number to the leaders of
Mexico, Canada

08:04.550 --> 08:06.285 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and France.

08:06.319 --> 08:13.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ivanka Trump's fashion line is
facing calls
to cut ties with a shoe supplier
in China.

08:13.125 --> 08:18.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's after the arrests of
three activists
who had investigated labor
abuses.

08:18.130 --> 08:23.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Democratic National
Committee and Amnesty
International both called today
for the Trump

08:23.336 --> 08:25.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
brand to respond.

08:25.104 --> 08:27.607 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The company declined comment.

08:27.640 --> 08:32.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Separately, China has delayed
enforcement
of a new cyber-security law.

08:32.478 --> 08:37.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It requires that foreign
companies face government
security checks and that they
store their

08:37.517 --> 08:39.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
data inside China.

08:39.418 --> 08:44.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That drew widespread complaints
that it violates
free trade agreements and opens
the door to

08:44.323 --> 08:46.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Chinese government snooping.

08:46.526 --> 08:52.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Wall Street today, the Dow
Jones industrial
average lost 20 points to close
at 21008.

08:53.032 --> 08:57.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell four points, and
the S&amp;P 500
slipped one.

08:58.004 --> 09:04.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And CNN has fired comedian Kathy
Griffin from
its New Year's Eve broadcast,
after she posed

09:04.777 --> 09:09.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with a prop resembling the
severed head of
President Trump.

09:09.148 --> 09:13.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The image drew widespread
condemnation, and
the president tweeted that it
was -- quote

09:14.020 --> 09:14.954 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
-- "sick."

09:14.987 --> 09:17.657 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Griffin has issued an apology.

09:17.690 --> 09:22.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Germany's
ambassador discusses Europe's
changing relationship

09:22.428 --> 09:27.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the White House; what
pulling out of
the Paris climate accord would
mean for the

09:27.600 --> 09:37.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. and the world; Minnesota
Senator Al Franken's
new memoir; and much more.

09:37.643 --> 09:44.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. and the world; Minnesota
Senator Al Franken's
new memoir; and much more.

09:44.817 --> 09:50.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump's first overseas
trip included
meetings last week at NATO and
European Union

09:50.122 --> 09:54.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
headquarters in Brussels, and
with other G7
nations in Sicily.

09:54.961 --> 09:58.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Germany is a key member of all
three bodies.

09:58.197 --> 10:03.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the aftermath of those
meetings, Chancellor
Angela Merkel sounded notes of
concern about

10:03.569 --> 10:09.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump's stance on some
key issues,
chief among them climate change
and the Paris

10:09.375 --> 10:11.110 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agreement.

10:11.143 --> 10:14.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To talk about this and other
matters, I spoke
a short time ago with Germany's
ambassador

10:14.847 --> 10:18.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the United States, Peter
Wittig.

10:18.918 --> 10:20.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ambassador Peter Wittig, thank
you for joining
us.

10:20.686 --> 10:22.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER WITTIG, German Ambassador
to the United
States: It's a pleasure to be
here.

10:22.488 --> 10:26.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me start with
the terrible
incident this morning in Kabul,
Afghanistan.

10:26.892 --> 10:30.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a normally considered
safe area, diplomatic
area.

10:30.730 --> 10:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the German Embassy was among
the many
places affected.

10:34.367 --> 10:37.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You had a German citizen who was
injured.

10:37.269 --> 10:40.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Others who work at the embassy,
one died,
another severely injured.

10:40.473 --> 10:46.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does this give your government
pause, does
it give you second thoughts
about the commitment

10:46.579 --> 10:48.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you have made to NATO in
Afghanistan?

10:48.447 --> 10:56.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER WITTIG: Well, this is an
atrocious and
horrible attack once again in
the center of

10:56.522 --> 11:03.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kabul, hurting not only German
citizens or
injuring or killing them, but
also a lot of

11:03.295 --> 11:04.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Afghan civilians.

11:04.964 --> 11:11.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this is no reason for us to
waver in our
commitment to stabilize
Afghanistan.

11:11.837 --> 11:15.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have been there together with
the U.S.
from the outset.

11:15.975 --> 11:18.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we are not quitting.

11:18.644 --> 11:24.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will remain there in the
north, basically
in the north of Afghanistan,
where we have

11:24.383 --> 11:26.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the largest force.

11:26.285 --> 11:32.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will stay there and do
the job to stabilize
Afghanistan, so that it doesn't
fall back

11:32.825 --> 11:35.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into conflict and turmoil.

11:35.394 --> 11:39.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Different
subject, the Paris
climate accord.

11:39.498 --> 11:44.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As I know you are aware, there
have been reports
today all day long that
President Trump is

11:45.004 --> 11:50.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
close to making a decision, and
that he is
leaning toward the United States
pulling out

11:50.810 --> 11:51.911 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the accord.

11:51.944 --> 11:53.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If that happened, what would the
repercussions
be?

11:54.013 --> 12:00.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER WITTIG: Well, first of
all, as we speak,
we don't know what the decision
will be.

12:00.953 --> 12:06.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's no secret we have been a
staunch advocate
of the Paris agreement.

12:06.826 --> 12:10.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We think it's a landmark
achievement.

12:10.996 --> 12:19.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's an almost universal
agreement containing
the global warming, fighting
climate change.

12:19.972 --> 12:26.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we think it's so important
that the U.S.
stays on board in a leadership
role.

12:26.112 --> 12:32.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Thanks to the U.S., this
agreement was possible
in the first place.

12:32.451 --> 12:38.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, if the U.S. would leave,
you know, it
would be a kind of
self-isolation, and the

12:38.724 --> 12:45.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. would find itself in odd
company, just
with Syria and Nicaragua, the
only countries

12:45.531 --> 12:48.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that are not part of the Paris
agreement.

12:48.734 --> 12:50.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we don't think that's a good
option.

12:50.536 --> 12:54.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me read you
something now
that we just learned.

12:54.440 --> 12:59.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the European Commission
president,
Jean-Claude Juncker.

12:59.145 --> 13:01.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He had a message for President
Trump.

13:01.413 --> 13:06.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said in Germany -- he said,
"Mr. Trump
believes that the U.S. can leave
the agreement"

13:07.019 --> 13:09.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- and I'm quoting him -- he
said, "because
he said he doesn't get close
enough to the

13:09.789 --> 13:12.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dossiers to fully understand
them."

13:12.558 --> 13:14.360 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He went on.

13:14.393 --> 13:18.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said: "We tried to explain
that to Mr.
Trump in Taormina," where the
meetings were,

13:18.264 --> 13:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"in clear German sentences.

13:20.566 --> 13:22.701 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It seems our attempt failed."

13:22.735 --> 13:25.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does the president understand
this issue,
do you believe?

13:25.638 --> 13:34.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER WITTIG: Well, I think he
has advisers
that explain that to him, and I
trust that

13:34.380 --> 13:40.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he will be fully briefed by his
advisers on
the importance of that
agreement.

13:40.252 --> 13:46.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't doubt that there is the
expertise
of the White House to judge on
the merits

13:46.692 --> 13:48.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of that Paris agreement.

13:48.928 --> 13:57.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We just hope that it will not
lead to major
repercussions for this global
achievement

13:57.970 --> 13:59.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that we think Paris is.

13:59.839 --> 14:05.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, of course,
it wasn't only
the Paris accord that came up
during the G7

14:05.244 --> 14:10.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
summit and even during the NATO
conversations,
but it looked as if to the
outside world that

14:10.883 --> 14:14.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this was a strained series of
meetings.

14:14.153 --> 14:18.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the aftermath of it, your own
chancellor
had remarks over the last few
days in which

14:18.624 --> 14:23.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she said -- and I'm quoting
again -- she said:
"The times in which we,"
referring to Europe,

14:24.029 --> 14:28.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"could completely rely on others
are over
to a certain extent."

14:28.300 --> 14:32.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She said, "This is what I
experienced in the
last few days."

14:32.137 --> 14:33.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is she saying?

14:33.906 --> 14:39.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER WITTIG: Well, Judy, I
think, you know,
Chancellor Merkel has a good and
productive

14:39.144 --> 14:42.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relationship with President
Trump.

14:42.348 --> 14:46.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have met in Washington and
now in Europe.

14:46.719 --> 14:53.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have been on the phone on a
whole range
of issues of the international
agenda.

14:53.158 --> 15:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the chancellor has been
committed to transatlantic
relations, to a friendship with
the U.S. right

15:01.634 --> 15:05.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the start of her career as
few other
leaders have been.

15:06.005 --> 15:11.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, she is a staunch believer in
close relations
with the U.S., and that doesn't
change with

15:12.011 --> 15:13.512 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the president.

15:13.545 --> 15:19.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What she said is -- and I think
that is, you
know, a call on the Europeans.

15:19.785 --> 15:22.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And she has said this before.

15:22.154 --> 15:26.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We cannot leave our fate in the
hand of others.

15:26.392 --> 15:29.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have to take it in our own
hands.

15:29.328 --> 15:38.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have got to push European
reform forward,
and it's us who have to
determine the future

15:38.103 --> 15:39.838 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Europe.

15:39.872 --> 15:42.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But she is saying
this as a
result of the new policies of
and approach

15:42.908 --> 15:44.576 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of President Trump, correct?

15:44.610 --> 15:49.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER WITTIG: We have excellent
relations
to the United States.

15:49.081 --> 15:50.716 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We always have.

15:50.749 --> 15:56.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And part of those relations is
precisely that
you can also discuss
divergences.

15:56.789 --> 16:05.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is what happened in
Europe where
they discussed points where they
diverge.

16:05.064 --> 16:06.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have differences of view.

16:06.532 --> 16:09.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Climate change was one of them.

16:09.668 --> 16:19.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think that's part of
good and dependable
relations that we can speak
openly about our

16:19.278 --> 16:21.080 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
differences.

16:21.113 --> 16:25.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does she believe
that the U.S.,
that this administration can
still be relied

16:25.684 --> 16:35.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on as a reliable partner to the
NATO nations
and to common values with the
European community?

16:35.427 --> 16:43.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER WITTIG: There are so many
trusted interlocutors
in this administration, minister
of defense,

16:43.869 --> 16:50.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary Mattis, Secretary
Tillerson, the
national security adviser,
McMaster.

16:50.309 --> 16:52.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have had a lot of contacts
with them.

16:52.945 --> 16:55.280 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They reassured us on NATO.

16:55.314 --> 17:01.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They reassured us on the close
alliance with
our country and with the
Europeans.

17:01.320 --> 17:05.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we have heard a lot of good
messages from
this administration.

17:05.557 --> 17:10.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So she absolutely
believes
the U.S. is committed to the
defense of NATO?

17:10.262 --> 17:16.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER WITTIG: This is what we
hear from many
important members of this
administration.

17:16.635 --> 17:18.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we believe it.

17:18.504 --> 17:22.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm asking, of
course, because
the president has hammered away
time and again

17:22.474 --> 17:27.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the amount of money the NATO
countries,
European countries are putting
into their

17:27.513 --> 17:28.547 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
own defense.

17:28.580 --> 17:31.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He tweeted again, President
Trump did yesterday.

17:31.316 --> 17:37.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said, "We have a" -- he
mentioned the quote
in large capital letters --
"massive trade

17:37.356 --> 17:39.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deficit," he wrote, "with
Germany.

17:39.124 --> 17:45.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, they pay far less," again,
all caps,
"than they should on NATO and
military.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Very bad for U.S."

17:46.932 --> 17:51.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER WITTIG: The president
raises two important
points.

17:51.236 --> 17:55.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fair burden-sharing in NATO, I
think that's
a valid point.

17:55.607 --> 18:02.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are fully subscribing to the
decision of
the leaders of NATO in 2016 to
increase our

18:02.848 --> 18:08.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spending, defense spending
incrementally in
a certain timeline.

18:08.720 --> 18:15.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we reject is that when
people tell us,
you're not paying your
membership dues.

18:15.461 --> 18:16.495 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Yes, we are.

18:16.528 --> 18:19.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are paying the common costs
for NATO.

18:19.932 --> 18:23.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But apart from that, there is
this pledge
to raise the defense spending.

18:23.435 --> 18:24.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we're doing that.

18:24.703 --> 18:27.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have raised our defense
budget by 9 percent
last year.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you very
much, Ambassador
Peter Wittig.

18:30.876 --> 18:31.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We appreciate it.

18:31.877 --> 18:32.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETER WITTIG: Thank you, Judy.

18:32.878 --> 18:36.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was a pleasure being here.

18:36.348 --> 18:48.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As we just heard,
there are
reports that President Trump may
not keep

18:48.694 --> 18:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United States in the Paris
climate accord,
the 2015 agreement signed by
nearly 200 nations

18:55.334 --> 18:59.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to reduce the carbon emissions
that are driving
climate change.

18:59.071 --> 19:03.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. is the second biggest
emitter of
those greenhouse gasses
globally.

19:03.909 --> 19:07.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the story
for our weekly
segment on the Leading Edge of
science.

19:07.913 --> 19:10.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
You're going to find out very
soon.

19:10.616 --> 19:13.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It's a
decision being awaited
around the world.

19:13.785 --> 19:18.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
President Trump, who's
repeatedly called climate
change a hoax perpetuated by
China, tweeted

19:18.724 --> 19:23.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that his decision on the Paris
accord will
come over the next few days.

19:23.428 --> 19:26.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For weeks, Mr. Trump has
signaled that he
would walk away from the deal.

19:26.732 --> 19:31.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He pledged to do so on the
campaign trail,
and has long argued that
environmental regulations

19:31.703 --> 19:33.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cost American jobs.

19:33.038 --> 19:36.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We're going to
cancel the Paris
climate agreement.

19:36.942 --> 19:41.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The president
also appointed
Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA, a
man who, in

19:41.547 --> 19:46.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the past, has sued to stop
environmental regulations
and who supports withdrawing
from Paris.

19:46.618 --> 19:48.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT PRUITT, Environmental
Protection Agency
Administrator: Paris is
something that we

19:48.787 --> 19:53.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need to really look at closely,
because it's
something we need to exit, in my
opinion.

19:53.225 --> 19:55.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a bad deal for America.

19:55.093 --> 19:59.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And in March,
the president
signed an executive order
undoing Obama-era

19:59.264 --> 20:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
climate change regulations.

20:01.166 --> 20:06.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week at the G7 summit, Mr.
Trump wouldn't
pledge to support the Paris
deal, a move that

20:06.071 --> 20:08.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
frustrated many European
leaders.

20:08.574 --> 20:13.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That sentiment was repeated
today by Jean-Claude
Juncker, the president of the
European Commission,

20:13.545 --> 20:17.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who strongly criticized the idea
of the U.S.
walking away from the agreement.

20:17.916 --> 20:21.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER, President,
European Commission
(through translator): The
Americans can't

20:21.286 --> 20:23.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
just leave the climate
protection agreement.

20:23.956 --> 20:28.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this notion, I am Trump, I
am American,
America first, and I'm going to
get out of

20:28.760 --> 20:30.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it, that won't happen.

20:30.596 --> 20:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The original
Paris accord
was signed by the Obama
administration, along

20:34.700 --> 20:38.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with 195 other countries, back
in 2015.

20:38.637 --> 20:43.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It voluntarily commits those
nations to decrease
their carbon emissions to try
and slow the

20:43.709 --> 20:45.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rate of global warming.

20:45.611 --> 20:51.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The goal was to keep additional
warming below
2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6
degrees Fahrenheit.

20:51.617 --> 20:56.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many scientists argue that
warming beyond
that level could have serious
consequences,

20:56.188 --> 21:02.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
global sea level rise, increased
storms, heat
waves and droughts, and
potentially massive

21:02.060 --> 21:05.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dislocation of people from
low-lying nations.

21:05.631 --> 21:09.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For months, President Trump has
been under
pressure from competing
interests.

21:09.167 --> 21:11.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I'm hearing from a
lot of people
both ways.

21:11.436 --> 21:15.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
president's daughter
and adviser Ivanka Trump emerged
as a supporter

21:15.674 --> 21:20.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the U.S. staying in the
agreement, the
same with Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson,

21:20.579 --> 21:24.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who argues withdrawing could
hurt U.S. negotiating
power.

21:24.416 --> 21:29.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tillerson's former company, oil
giant ExxonMobil,
joined a litany of other
companies who also

21:29.588 --> 21:32.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
urged the president to stay in
the deal.

21:32.090 --> 21:36.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Exxon described it as an
effective framework
to address the risks of climate
change.

21:36.995 --> 21:42.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But other voices urged
withdrawal, including
chief strategist Stephen Bannon,
as did 22

21:42.367 --> 21:46.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican senators, including
Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell, who said that
it was an important

21:46.938 --> 21:51.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
part of rescinding President
Obama's Clean
Power Plan, which has long been
the target

21:51.443 --> 21:53.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Republican lawmakers.

21:53.712 --> 21:58.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trump administration also
took aim today
at another rule covering
greenhouse gases,

21:58.417 --> 22:00.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
specifically emissions of
methane.

22:00.852 --> 22:05.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The EPA is now stopping an Obama
administration
rule that would cut down on
methane leaks

22:05.223 --> 22:08.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and pollution from oil and
natural gas wells.

22:08.660 --> 22:13.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But let's continue our look at
what's at stake
if the president opts out of the
Paris accord.

22:13.965 --> 22:18.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Michael Oppenheimer is a
professor of geosciences
and international affairs at the
Woodrow Wilson

22:18.670 --> 22:20.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
School at Princeton University.

22:20.472 --> 22:24.976 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He has been a longtime
participant in the
U.N. Panel on Climate Change,
which produces

22:25.010 --> 22:27.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reports on the subject and won a
Nobel Prize.

22:27.979 --> 22:33.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Phil Kerpen is the president
of American
Commitment, a conservative group
opposed to

22:33.118 --> 22:34.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Paris agreement.

22:34.219 --> 22:37.022 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Gentlemen, welcome to you both.

22:37.055 --> 22:40.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Phil Kerpen, I would like to
start with you
first.

22:40.359 --> 22:44.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We -- again, we still do not
know if the president
is going to walk away from this
agreement,

22:44.596 --> 22:46.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but it looks like he is going
to.

22:46.064 --> 22:47.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I know you agree with that.

22:47.332 --> 22:48.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So help me understand.

22:48.767 --> 22:51.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Make the best case why he should
leave Paris.

22:51.403 --> 22:54.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHIL KERPEN, President, American
Commitment:
Well, I think the key point to
understand

22:54.139 --> 22:58.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that the Paris treaty has no
discernible
impact on global average
temperature, and,

22:58.744 --> 23:01.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
therefore, the alleged climate
benefits are
illusory.

23:01.113 --> 23:05.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is an agreement that, if
every country
met its obligations, according
to the conventional

23:05.951 --> 23:09.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EPA model, it would reduce
global average
temperature less than two-tenths
of a degree

23:09.554 --> 23:11.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the year 2100.

23:11.056 --> 23:13.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, of course, these countries
are mostly
not meeting their obligations.

23:13.759 --> 23:17.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We just heard from Germany their
emissions
are up in each of the last two
years.

23:17.329 --> 23:19.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Philippines have already
withdrawn from
this agreement.

23:19.898 --> 23:23.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And India, which is allowed to
increase emissions
under this agreement, is
building too many

23:23.268 --> 23:24.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
coal plants to even meet their
target.

23:24.636 --> 23:26.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are going to go well above
it.

23:26.538 --> 23:32.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. commitment would only
avert an increase
in temperature of about 15/1,000
of a degree

23:32.210 --> 23:33.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by the year 2100.

23:33.945 --> 23:36.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there is really not much
upside here,
but there is tremendous
downside, because

23:36.715 --> 23:41.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this agreement locks in those
EPA regulations
you were just talking about in
the introduction,

23:41.453 --> 23:45.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Clean Power Plan, which
increase electricity
prices about 25 to 30 percent.

23:45.690 --> 23:49.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That has a very negative impact
on consumers
across this country with no
benefit to show

23:50.028 --> 23:51.863 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for it.

23:51.897 --> 23:56.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it also commits the American
taxpayer
to pay the lion's share of the
$100-billion-per-year

23:56.601 --> 24:00.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Green Climate Fund, a direct
wealth transfer
to the rest of the world.

24:00.038 --> 24:03.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think the reason the
rest of the
world likes this deal so much is
that the

24:03.275 --> 24:07.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States cripples itself
economically
with regulations, and then it
pays the rest

24:07.946 --> 24:10.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the world for the privilege
of doing so
in increased foreign aid.

24:10.749 --> 24:12.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
To me, that is not leadership.

24:12.150 --> 24:14.419 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That is American losership.

24:14.453 --> 24:15.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the president is right to...

24:15.754 --> 24:17.088 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

24:17.122 --> 24:18.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let me get
Michael Oppenheimer
here on this.

24:18.957 --> 24:23.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot to unpack there, but the
substantive
criticism that even people who
favor the Paris

24:23.228 --> 24:26.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agreement are, it is a voluntary
agreement.

24:26.531 --> 24:29.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are no real binding
commitments.

24:29.267 --> 24:31.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why do you think it is such a
greet deal that
we ought to stay in it?

24:32.003 --> 24:33.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL OPPENHEIMER, Professor
of Geosciences
and International Affairs,
Princeton University:

24:33.438 --> 24:36.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Paris agreement isn't
perfect, but it's
an important first step.

24:36.441 --> 24:40.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why the statements of
Mr. Kerpen
are totally out of context.

24:40.645 --> 24:46.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, what is happening is
global emissions
of carbon dioxide have not
increased, in fact,

24:46.518 --> 24:50.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decreased a little over the last
three years,
for the first time while the
global economy

24:50.655 --> 24:54.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was growing, because countries
are moving
to the new energy sources.

24:54.626 --> 24:59.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would be foolish to pull out
of this agreement,
because, number one, it would do
great harm

24:59.865 --> 25:03.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to our relations with our allies
around the
world.

25:03.535 --> 25:10.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, secondly, it would condemn
the U.S.,
the world and future
generations, our own

25:10.976 --> 25:14.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
children, to a world with an
unacceptable
level of climate change.

25:14.412 --> 25:20.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if is a real pity, because
the Paris agreement
is the first time that all
countries of the

25:20.552 --> 25:27.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world put plans on the table to
reduce emissions,
made commitments to reduce
emissions, including

25:27.125 --> 25:29.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
China, which is the world's
biggest emitter.

25:29.494 --> 25:30.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are moving forward.

25:30.996 --> 25:33.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Not only are they moving forward
to reduce
their emissions.

25:33.431 --> 25:37.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're moving forward to make
money off the
new technologies.

25:37.602 --> 25:40.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are the world's leading
producer of solar
photovoltaic cells.

25:40.772 --> 25:44.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are the world's leading
producer of wind
turbines.

25:44.109 --> 25:49.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. is going to be left in
the dust if
we don't cooperate with other
nations to bring

25:49.114 --> 25:50.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this threat under control.

25:50.882 --> 25:55.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm sure that President
Trump wants to
go down in history, but he
doesn't want to

25:55.287 --> 26:00.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go down in history as the
president that condemned
the world to a dangerous climate
change.

26:00.325 --> 26:02.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Phil Kerpen,
let me ask
you about this.

26:02.661 --> 26:08.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a very strong consensus
that if we
continue our current path of
fossil fuel use,

26:08.700 --> 26:12.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that there are going to be some
major implications
globally, not just here in the
United States,

26:13.004 --> 26:18.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
major economic blows, major
physical blows
to the planet we live on.

26:18.677 --> 26:20.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you argue we ought to do
about that?

26:20.879 --> 26:25.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHIL KERPEN: Well, I think the
policies that
we have been pursuing in terms
of the fracking

26:25.350 --> 26:29.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
boom in the United States, the
dramatic increase
in gas production that shifted a
lot of our

26:29.154 --> 26:32.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
electric generation is really
what has driven
global emissions lower.

26:32.824 --> 26:36.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is United States' emissions
dropping pretty
dramatically that is actually
making up for

26:36.995 --> 26:40.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other countries like Germany
that are increasing
with a heavy-handed regulatory
approach.

26:40.765 --> 26:46.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think that we can have
an approach
that is not central economic
planning through

26:46.504 --> 26:51.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the EPA and we can continue to
develop lower
carbon energy sources, including
continuing

26:51.743 --> 26:55.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the gas boom, which I think is
going to be
the major driver of lower
emissions for the

26:55.080 --> 26:56.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
foreseeable future.

26:56.815 --> 26:59.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I don't know that we have
to necessarily
choose between those two things,
but I do

26:59.150 --> 27:04.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know that an agreement that
imposes draconian
cuts on the United States, and
we take it

27:04.489 --> 27:09.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seriously and implement in a
legally binding
way, while other countries make
promises,

27:09.427 --> 27:12.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and then go ahead and do
whatever is in their
best economic interests, is not
one that serves

27:12.631 --> 27:17.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United States well or
accomplishes those
climate-related policy goals
that people may

27:17.535 --> 27:18.770 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
state.

27:18.803 --> 27:21.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL OPPENHEIMER: Part of
what Mr. Kerpen
says is correct.

27:21.139 --> 27:24.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There has been a decrease, a
significant one,
in U.S. emissions.

27:24.509 --> 27:28.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is partly due to the
penetration
of natural gas.

27:28.346 --> 27:32.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a lot of the reduction in
emissions that
has come in the last few years
and is expected

27:32.951 --> 27:38.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to come in the future actually
arises from
a set of regulations that the
EPA promulgated

27:38.790 --> 27:40.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and which it carefully
calibrated...

27:40.959 --> 27:42.794 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

27:42.827 --> 27:46.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL OPPENHEIMER: Excuse me
-- that are
less than the cost of the
damages that climate

27:46.531 --> 27:48.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
change will bring.

27:48.233 --> 27:54.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, part of the regulations are
held up while
the courts decide their
legality.

27:54.272 --> 28:02.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a critical aspect, the
regulation of motor
vehicle emissions -- which, by
the way, moving

28:02.080 --> 28:07.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to cars with high fuel economy,
helped saved
the industry during the
financial crisis -- those

28:07.952 --> 28:09.688 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
regulations are still in place.

28:09.721 --> 28:12.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so, in fact, is the Clean
Power Plan.

28:12.757 --> 28:15.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the law until the courts
say it isn't.

28:15.427 --> 28:18.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Phil Kerpen,
can I ask you
a question about this?

28:18.063 --> 28:22.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are a lot of major U.S.
manufacturing
companies and energy companies.

28:22.867 --> 28:27.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There's Exxon, Chevron,
Microsoft, Apple,
Johnson &amp; Johnson, Monsanto, Dow
Chemical

28:27.972 --> 28:31.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- I could go on and on -- they
all argue
that we should stay in the Paris
accord.

28:31.743 --> 28:35.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they make an economic
argument for staying
in there.

28:35.380 --> 28:39.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm just curious, don't you
find that
argument that they are making
persuasive?

28:39.084 --> 28:42.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are not companies that
want to see American
industry hobbled in any way, and
they think

28:42.954 --> 28:44.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it is a good idea.

28:44.723 --> 28:48.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHIL KERPEN: Well, I think large
incumbent
corporations always look full
advantage to

28:48.093 --> 28:49.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
protect themselves from new
innovative competitors.

28:49.894 --> 28:53.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that often comes in the form
of begging
for government regulation that
tends to lock

28:53.865 --> 28:58.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in market share by increasing
barriers to
entry and making it more
difficult for smaller

28:58.336 --> 29:02.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
companies that don't have armies
of compliance
officers and lawyers and
accountants to figure

29:02.340 --> 29:05.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out what I will pay, what the
thousands of
pages of paperwork that are
needed to be in

29:05.877 --> 29:07.612 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
compliance are.

29:07.645 --> 29:10.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so there is always this
incentive for
the largest companies that have
an army of

29:10.582 --> 29:13.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lobbyists who want to make
themselves important,
an army of compliance officers
who want to

29:13.852 --> 29:17.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
make themselves important to use
that to lock
in their incumbency advantage.

29:17.789 --> 29:20.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that is why you have
seen all
of these large companies pushing
for that.

29:20.492 --> 29:23.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Michael
Oppenheimer, last
quick question to you.

29:23.862 --> 29:26.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's say that President Trump
decides to
pull out.

29:26.397 --> 29:28.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is the impact?

29:28.199 --> 29:31.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you think that the other
countries will
continue with their pledges, or
do you think

29:31.569 --> 29:34.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they will look and say hey,
look, the
U.S. isn't living up to this,
why should we?

29:34.639 --> 29:39.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL OPPENHEIMER: I think
what will happen
is some of the countries that
have just recently

29:39.477 --> 29:44.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come around to making plans to
reduce emissions
will not pull out of the
agreement, but will

29:44.749 --> 29:49.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
peel off their commitments, and
it will reduce
the likelihood that the world
will move in

29:49.654 --> 29:52.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a safe direction on climate
change.

29:52.357 --> 29:55.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Furthermore -- but some
countries will keep
reducing their emissions,
because they're

29:55.326 --> 30:00.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doing it for a variety of
reasons, including
protecting their air, like
China, which has

30:01.032 --> 30:06.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a bad air pollution problem, and
because,
as I said before, they want to
sell the new

30:06.171 --> 30:11.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
renewable energy technologies,
the clean technologies
everywhere, including the United
States, where

30:11.876 --> 30:13.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they are starting to push out
coal.

30:13.978 --> 30:21.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's hard for me to believe that
the U.S.
would subject itself to a less
favorable position

30:21.586 --> 30:23.354 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
economically.

30:23.388 --> 30:30.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After all, renewable energy now
has four times
as much employment in the U.S.
economy as

30:30.061 --> 30:31.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
does coal production.

30:31.663 --> 30:34.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why are we looking to the past,
instead of
the future?

30:34.399 --> 30:35.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

30:35.500 --> 30:37.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We have to go,
I'm sorry
to say.

30:38.002 --> 30:42.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michael Oppenheimer, Phil
Kerpen, thank you
both very much.

30:42.607 --> 30:46.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PHIL KERPEN: Thank you.

30:46.544 --> 30:53.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL OPPENHEIMER: Thank you
for having
us.

30:53.451 --> 30:56.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

Coming up on the "NewsHour": can
simply changing

and some of the best graduation
speeches of

31:09.968 --> 31:11.202 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the season.

31:11.236 --> 31:13.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But first: Political satire
requires one sets
of skills.

31:13.938 --> 31:18.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Practicing politics requires
another, at least
according to one of the few
people who have

31:18.509 --> 31:20.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
professional experience doing
both.

31:20.845 --> 31:26.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A new memoir presents an
up-front account
about what it's really like to
go from entertainment

31:26.251 --> 31:27.685 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to government.

31:27.719 --> 31:31.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Al Franken, Giant of the
Senate," a book,
is officially out this week.

31:31.756 --> 31:36.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan sat down with
Democratic
senator from Minnesota earlier
today in our

31:36.261 --> 31:38.062 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
New York studio.

31:38.096 --> 31:41.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There's quite
a bit of news
recently about the president's
adviser and

31:41.099 --> 31:43.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
son-in-law Jared Kushner.

31:43.034 --> 31:46.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have heard that he wanted to
set up a back
channel of communication with
the Russians.

31:46.905 --> 31:51.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before that, we know that he
didn't declare
any of these contacts on his
security clearance

31:51.376 --> 31:52.343 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
form.

31:52.377 --> 31:53.344 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

31:53.378 --> 31:55.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AL FRANKEN (D), Minnesota: Sure.

31:55.179 --> 31:55.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, has he
already broken
the law by withholding
information on that

31:55.480 --> 31:56.414 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
form?

31:56.447 --> 31:58.116 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

31:58.149 --> 32:01.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AL FRANKEN: The special
prosecutor will look
at whether it's a violation of
the law.

32:01.586 --> 32:03.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You're supposed to.

32:03.388 --> 32:09.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's been a lot of these, not
disclosing
meetings with the Russians, by a
lot of members

32:09.527 --> 32:11.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the Trump team.

32:11.229 --> 32:15.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're not acting like a
group of people
that have nothing to hide.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.202 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Put it that way.

32:18.236 --> 32:24.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's hard for me to believe that
Jared Kushner
wasn't telling his father-in-law
that he was

32:24.842 --> 32:33.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- I mean, this is not a normal
back channel
they were talking about doing,
using Russian

32:33.651 --> 32:38.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
communications, so that U.S.
intelligence
couldn't hear it.

32:38.256 --> 32:45.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was naive, because if you do
something
out of a Russian Embassy, of
course we're

32:45.563 --> 32:46.531 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going hear it.

32:46.564 --> 32:48.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But he didn't know that.

32:48.266 --> 32:55.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's very hard to
believe that he
didn't tell his father-in-law.

32:55.173 --> 33:01.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We may get to a point where it
is, what did
the president know and when did
his son-in-law

33:01.145 --> 33:02.880 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tell him?

33:02.914 --> 33:05.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, you
are on the
Senate Committee on Health,
Education, Labor

33:05.383 --> 33:07.151 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Pensions.

33:07.185 --> 33:10.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, there is talk that
the senators
are meeting behind closed doors
on drafting

33:10.655 --> 33:11.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a health care plan.

33:11.656 --> 33:12.623 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AL FRANKEN: Republican senators.

33:14.425 --> 33:15.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Republican
senators are
meeting behind closed doors
about something.

33:15.827 --> 33:18.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Affordable Care Act had,
what, 44 different
hearings on this.

33:18.563 --> 33:19.530 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

33:19.564 --> 33:21.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AL FRANKEN: Yes.

33:21.499 --> 33:22.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And if this
process is happening
behind closed -- what do you
know about what

33:22.600 --> 33:24.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is happening and what that bill
could look
like?

33:24.202 --> 33:25.403 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

33:25.436 --> 33:26.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AL FRANKEN: I don't know a lot
about what
is happening.

33:26.671 --> 33:29.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I know they're having problems.

33:29.140 --> 33:30.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I don't -- it doesn't
surprise me.

33:31.009 --> 33:34.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mitch McConnell said they will
have trouble
getting to 50.

33:34.178 --> 33:38.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They need 50 if they do this
through the process
called reconciliation.

33:38.616 --> 33:48.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can't see, you know, someone
like Ted Cruz
signing on to the same bill that
Susan Collins

33:48.359 --> 33:53.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Lisa Murkowski and Will
Cassidy would
sign on to.

33:53.231 --> 33:59.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I -- the House bill is horrific.

33:59.737 --> 34:07.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have had people crying at
roundtables,
saying: My mom will lose her
home health care,

34:07.712 --> 34:10.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which she gets through Medicaid,
if this happens.

34:10.481 --> 34:12.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And my husband and I work
full-time.

34:12.050 --> 34:15.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we don't know what we're
going to do with
mom.

34:15.853 --> 34:18.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this will happen over and
over and over
again.

34:18.556 --> 34:25.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is actually hurts the
people who voted
for Trump more than anybody
else.

34:25.363 --> 34:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Your line of
questioning
of Jeff Sessions, he ended up
answering a

34:28.766 --> 34:29.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
question that you didn't ask.

34:29.767 --> 34:30.735 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

34:30.768 --> 34:32.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AL FRANKEN: Right.

34:32.670 --> 34:34.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And,
eventually, it led
to his own recusal from the
Russia investigation.

34:34.972 --> 34:40.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in the book, you say that
you have come
to befriend him, that his wife
made your grandson

34:40.845 --> 34:42.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his first baby blanket.

34:42.180 --> 34:43.147 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

34:43.181 --> 34:44.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AL FRANKEN: That's true.

34:44.182 --> 34:45.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That you're
friends.

34:45.183 --> 34:46.551 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

34:46.584 --> 34:47.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
AL FRANKEN: I think the
friendship happened
before those hearings.

34:47.185 --> 34:48.152 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

34:48.186 --> 34:49.153 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

34:49.187 --> 34:50.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AL FRANKEN: And I haven't talked
to him since.

34:50.922 --> 34:57.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, I -- Jeff and I served
together
on the -- Sessions -- Senator --
Attorney

34:57.762 --> 35:00.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
General Sessions and I -- and I
disagree with
him.

35:00.631 --> 35:02.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think he is a terrible
attorney general.

35:02.667 --> 35:04.135 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I will say that.

35:04.168 --> 35:08.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, yes, you have to get along
with your
colleagues.

35:08.539 --> 35:11.742 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's a -- we're a small town
of 100 people.

35:11.776 --> 35:15.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there is no sense making
enemies.

35:15.780 --> 35:19.851 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so, yes, Jeff and I had a
friendly relationship.

35:19.884 --> 35:26.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, yes, Mary Sessions made a
blue blanket
for my first grandson.

35:26.657 --> 35:28.559 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was his favorite blanket.

35:28.593 --> 35:32.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You talk a
little bit about
that relationship management and
how you actually

35:32.830 --> 35:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have different senators with
different levels
of senses of humor.

35:35.833 --> 35:37.068 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

35:37.101 --> 35:38.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But it also
seems like,
for the first...

35:38.169 --> 35:39.137 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

35:39.170 --> 35:40.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AL FRANKEN: Yes, that's for
sure.

35:40.171 --> 35:41.939 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

35:41.973 --> 35:44.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It seemed
like, the first
term, you were almost scared of
being funny,

35:44.275 --> 35:45.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because you wanted to be taken
seriously.

35:45.877 --> 35:48.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You won in a very, very tight
race.

35:48.412 --> 35:50.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And now you are kind of relaxed.

35:50.181 --> 35:55.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You are kind of joking with
whether Pat Robert
or Mitch McConnell, Lindsey
Graham.

35:55.286 --> 35:57.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You say these guys have funny
bones.

35:57.455 --> 35:58.422 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

35:58.456 --> 35:59.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AL FRANKEN: Well, Lindsey is
funny.

35:59.590 --> 36:00.558 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So is Pat.

36:00.591 --> 36:02.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mitch, not so much.

36:02.393 --> 36:07.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, no, when Lindsey was like
-- I remember
when he was running for
president, and he

36:07.231 --> 36:08.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was like 16th out of 17.

36:08.766 --> 36:10.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I went up to him.

36:10.535 --> 36:13.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I said "Lindsey, if I were
voting in the Republican
primaries, I would vote for
you."

36:13.471 --> 36:15.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And he said, "That's my
problem."

36:15.373 --> 36:19.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There is a
passage where
you recount how you apologized
to Mitch McConnell

36:19.243 --> 36:20.211 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
once...

36:20.244 --> 36:21.212 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

36:21.245 --> 36:22.580 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AL FRANKEN: Yes.

36:22.613 --> 36:23.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: ... because
you were presiding
over the Senate.

36:23.681 --> 36:24.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He rolled his eyes while he was
saying something.

36:24.248 --> 36:25.216 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

36:25.249 --> 36:26.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AL FRANKEN: I rolled my eyes,
yes.

36:26.250 --> 36:27.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You rolled
your eyes.

36:27.652 --> 36:28.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then he came up to you and
said, "This
isn't 'SNL,' Al," right?

36:28.252 --> 36:29.220 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

36:29.253 --> 36:31.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AL FRANKEN: Right.

36:31.155 --> 36:32.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And do you
ever feel like
now it's almost that this has
come full circle?

36:32.990 --> 36:38.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is actually a sketch on
"SNL" today
playing you as the sitting
senator, and also

36:38.129 --> 36:39.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sometimes a sort of...

36:39.130 --> 36:40.831 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

36:40.865 --> 36:46.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AL FRANKEN: That guy was just
playing straight
to Kate McKinnon's Sessions, and
-- but a

36:46.337 --> 36:52.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot of this book is answering
the question
that I get asked probably more
than any other

36:52.710 --> 36:59.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
question, which is, is it as
much fun being
a United States senator as
working on "Saturday

36:59.483 --> 37:00.451 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Night Live"?

37:00.484 --> 37:03.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the answer, of course, is
no.

37:03.187 --> 37:05.122 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Why would it be?

37:05.156 --> 37:07.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it's the best job I have
ever had.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You like
Melissa McCarthy's
Sean Spicer?

37:08.859 --> 37:10.595 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

37:10.628 --> 37:14.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AL FRANKEN: When I saw that, I
went, oh, my
goodness, this is hilarious and
an instant

37:14.165 --> 37:16.067 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
classic.

37:16.100 --> 37:18.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You say that
there are passages
in this book that are worthy of
a middle school

37:18.202 --> 37:19.303 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
writing contest.

37:19.337 --> 37:20.304 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

37:21.305 --> 37:22.473 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AL FRANKEN: Yes.

37:22.506 --> 37:26.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a couple of purple prose
descriptions
of things.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Senator Al Franken.

37:27.745 --> 37:29.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The book is called "Giant of the
Senate."

SEN.

37:30.781 --> 37:32.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

(LAUGHTER)

37:33.551 --> 37:34.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right.

37:34.552 --> 37:35.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

Thank you.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Yesterday, we
introduced you
to a long-term study aimed at
improving the

37:52.737 --> 37:57.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lives of some of the most
vulnerable patients,
premature babies.

37:57.541 --> 38:01.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is using what seems on
the surface
to be the simplest of
techniques.

38:01.445 --> 38:07.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We are back with William
Brangham, who, along
with producer Jason Kane,
reports on the results

38:07.251 --> 38:11.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the study, and the more
complex story of
the woman behind it.

38:11.422 --> 38:13.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KATE ILIE, Mother: Let's go to
the park.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Go ahead, hop in the stroller,
Charlotte.

38:14.925 --> 38:20.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It's hard to
believe, but,
nearly 10 months ago, Kate and
Tyler Ilie

38:20.498 --> 38:24.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were afraid to even touch their
youngest daughter,
Caroline.

38:24.068 --> 38:29.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kate's first pregnancy, with
3-year-old Charlotte,
was textbook perfect, but not so
with her

38:29.273 --> 38:31.008 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
second.

38:31.042 --> 38:36.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nearly five months in, her water
broke, and
Caroline was born eight chaotic
weeks later.

38:36.080 --> 38:41.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She was two pounds, five ounces,
and over
three months early.

38:41.118 --> 38:46.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like most premature babies
today, she was
soon living inside this plastic
isolette at

38:46.090 --> 38:50.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Morgan Stanley Children's
Hospital, connected
to the incredible medical
technology that

38:50.861 --> 38:52.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would save her life.

38:52.730 --> 38:58.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATE ILIE: It took us months
before I actually
even saw her face, because she
had so many

38:58.202 --> 39:00.037 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tubes in.

39:00.071 --> 39:04.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when your baby is in that
kind of situation,
it's almost like you can't let
your guard

39:04.308 --> 39:08.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down to really bond with them,
because you're
scared of losing them.

39:08.612 --> 39:13.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Despite the
advances that
keep younger and younger preterm
babies alive,

39:13.818 --> 39:18.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these kids are still at much
higher risk for
emotional, behavioral and
developmental problems

39:18.789 --> 39:20.725 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
later in life.

39:20.758 --> 39:25.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a long-term study here at
Columbia University
Medical Center and New York
Presbyterian is

39:25.863 --> 39:34.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
testing if the simplest of human
interactions,
being calmed by mom, taking in
her smell,

39:34.672 --> 39:39.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being soothed by her voice,
whether these
actions can somehow change the
development

39:39.777 --> 39:46.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of these children by
strengthening their emotional
connection.

39:46.584 --> 39:49.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The intervention is the
brainchild of Dr.
Martha Welch.

39:49.587 --> 39:51.422 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

39:51.455 --> 39:55.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARTHA WELCH, Columbia
University: The brain
is developing at a very rapid
rate, especially

39:55.526 --> 39:58.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at the end of pregnancy, in the
last trimester.

39:58.462 --> 40:05.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the baby is born early, the
baby doesn't
have the same environment that
promotes that

40:05.903 --> 40:06.971 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
growth.

40:07.004 --> 40:11.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, in fact, the baby has the
opposite: isolation.

40:11.175 --> 40:16.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The child is bombarded with
sounds and light.

40:16.514 --> 40:21.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's antithetical to what the
brain needs
and the child needs for
development.

40:21.318 --> 40:27.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what we're doing is trying
to make up
for that to the greatest extent
possible.

40:27.425 --> 40:30.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For the past
few months,
we have been following the Ilie
family and

40:30.961 --> 40:33.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
several others as they have gone
through this
study.

40:33.397 --> 40:37.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Elia Cardenas found it hard to
feel like a
mother in this clinical setting.

40:37.468 --> 40:43.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIA CARDENAS, Mother: How are
you supposed
to bond with the baby that's
behind a glass?

40:43.340 --> 40:48.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can only put your hand in
there and touch
them, but you can't hug them,
you can't hold

40:48.546 --> 40:50.247 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

40:50.281 --> 40:53.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But, in the
study, Cardenas
learned how to touch and connect
with her

40:53.884 --> 40:56.520 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sons.

40:56.554 --> 41:01.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Miguelina Tavarez was taught
that a simple
cloth, one that smelled like her
and another

41:01.258 --> 41:08.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that smelled like her
still-hospitalized daughter,
can calm both of them.

41:08.265 --> 41:13.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's called the family nurture
intervention,
and over 100 families have gone
through it.

41:13.737 --> 41:18.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During the baby's stay in the
NICU, mothers
learn very simple nurturing
techniques, while

41:18.242 --> 41:20.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
researchers monitor their
progress.

41:20.110 --> 41:23.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL MYERS, Columbia
Psychiatry: The intervention
itself, I believe, has face
validity.

41:23.714 --> 41:25.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It just does make...

41:25.049 --> 41:26.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It feels
right.

41:26.050 --> 41:27.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MYERS: It feels right.

41:27.885 --> 41:29.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But Michael
Myers' job is
to measure if these
interventions do more

41:29.687 --> 41:31.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than just feel right.

41:31.422 --> 41:36.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do they make any substantive
long-term difference
to these children or their
mothers?

41:36.494 --> 41:43.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL MYERS: I'm the
challenger in chief
of ideas, to constantly make
sure that we

41:43.467 --> 41:46.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't accept what is intuitive
always as being
fact.

41:46.036 --> 41:49.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For the past
five years,
the team has analyzed video
recordings of

41:50.007 --> 41:56.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mothers and their children at
various developmental
stages, right after birth, four
months, 12

41:56.080 --> 42:02.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
months, 18 months, five years.

42:02.987 --> 42:09.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Their first randomized
controlled trial, with
115 moms and 150 infants,
indicate statistically

42:09.793 --> 42:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
significant results, among them,
a 36 percent
increase in brain activity in
the frontal

42:16.066 --> 42:17.835 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
region.

42:17.868 --> 42:20.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MYERS: Those brain
waves, that difference,
of about 40 percent, is really
visible.

42:20.337 --> 42:22.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's something that you can
really wrap your
head around.

42:22.706 --> 42:28.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This activity
is in an area
associated with language,
thinking and emotional

42:28.345 --> 42:34.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regulation, and, at 18 months,
babies in the
intervention showed improvement
in those areas.

42:34.118 --> 42:42.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whether these changes last or
even continue
remains to be seen.

42:42.359 --> 42:46.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Results for mothers were also
significant,
improved caregiving in the NICU,
and, four

42:46.964 --> 42:52.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
months after giving birth, lower
levels of
anxiety and symptoms of
depression.

42:52.469 --> 42:57.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But convincing some about these
results may
have less to do with data than
with Martha

42:57.841 --> 42:59.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welch's past work.

42:59.877 --> 43:04.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the 1980s, Welch wrote a book
called "Holding
Time," which counseled parents
to employ a

43:04.615 --> 43:07.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very physical holding technique,
like you
see here.

43:07.818 --> 43:13.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The hope was that it would
increase communication
and emotional connection between
parent and

43:13.524 --> 43:15.392 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
child.

43:15.426 --> 43:20.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But some of Welch's ideas were
then co-opted
by other practitioners to
promote increasingly

43:20.431 --> 43:26.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
physical and coercive
techniques, similar
to this one seen in a CBS News
report.

43:26.203 --> 43:31.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: These earlier sessions were
designed
to force the rage out of him.

43:31.308 --> 43:35.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Another
session resulted
in the smothering death of a
10-year-old girl

43:35.279 --> 43:36.947 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 2000.

43:36.981 --> 43:41.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Welch says, even though her name
is still
associated with these
techniques, she had

43:41.652 --> 43:44.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nothing to do with them and that
they have
damaged her reputation.

43:44.588 --> 43:45.990 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

43:46.023 --> 43:50.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTHA WELCH: I was devastated
to be associated
in the press with them.

43:50.728 --> 43:57.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was very, very, very hurtful
to me, and
that upset lasted about 10
years.

43:57.801 --> 44:03.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Welch was also
criticized
for claiming that her nurturing
techniques

44:03.607 --> 44:09.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can reduce the risk of autism,
which is something
premature babies are at greater
risk of developing.

44:09.146 --> 44:15.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in the late 1980s, with
just anecdotal
evidence, she said her holding
time techniques

44:15.786 --> 44:17.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would reduce the risk.

44:17.788 --> 44:22.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now she says her NICU
intervention has
shown, by one scientific
measure, to do the

44:22.793 --> 44:23.761 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
same.

44:23.794 --> 44:25.429 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

44:25.462 --> 44:29.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTHA WELCH: About one out of
four babies
test positive for risk at 18
months.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have reduced that from one
out of four
to one out of 10.

44:33.937 --> 44:35.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is a big reduction.

44:35.873 --> 44:37.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But others
aren't so sure.

44:37.908 --> 44:41.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS FRAZIER, Autism Speaks:
My initial
reaction is really, I think it's
unlikely

44:41.845 --> 44:43.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that it protects children from
autism.

44:43.914 --> 44:47.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Thomas Frazier
is chief
science officer for Autism
Speaks, the national

44:47.985 --> 44:49.620 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
advocacy group.

44:49.653 --> 44:54.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says there's persuasive
evidence that,
in many cases, autism emerges in
utero or

44:54.825 --> 44:59.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very early in life, and he's
skeptical this
intervention could change that.

44:59.596 --> 45:04.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Frazier also worries this study
could inadvertently
cause some parents of autistic
children to

45:04.735 --> 45:06.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
blame themselves.

45:06.570 --> 45:10.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS FRAZIER: There's an early
history within
autism of saying that parents
were sort of

45:10.674 --> 45:15.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at fault, right, if they had
just been more
nurturing, if they had just done
more, particularly

45:15.112 --> 45:20.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moms, if they had just done more
to attach
to their children, that those
children somehow

45:20.384 --> 45:21.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wouldn't have had autism.

45:21.652 --> 45:23.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We now know that that is just
not true.

45:23.520 --> 45:25.355 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

45:25.389 --> 45:29.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTHA WELCH: The fact that
nurture is a remedy
doesn't mean that lack of
nurture was the

45:29.827 --> 45:31.929 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cause.

45:31.962 --> 45:35.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Parents cannot blame themselves
for having
autistic children.

45:35.666 --> 45:37.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Almost every mother blames
herself.

45:37.434 --> 45:38.869 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
This is wrong.

45:38.902 --> 45:40.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But nurture is a remedy.

45:41.004 --> 45:45.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Meanwhile,
some of Welch's
scientific peers who were
skeptical this study

45:45.442 --> 45:51.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would yield any positive,
lasting results
have been surprised by the
initial data, among

45:51.381 --> 45:52.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
them, Dr. Richard Polin.

45:52.816 --> 45:55.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He oversees the NICU where Welch
conducted
her trial.

45:55.452 --> 45:57.321 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

45:57.354 --> 45:59.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RICHARD POLIN, Columbia
University: I was
skeptical that this kind of
intervention involving

46:00.023 --> 46:08.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kangaroo, skin-to-skin care, and
smell and
other interventions would have
any long-term

46:08.632 --> 46:09.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
benefit.

46:09.633 --> 46:11.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I couldn't understand the
biological basis.

46:11.502 --> 46:14.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, the biological basis is
still a little
uncertain to me.

46:14.838 --> 46:21.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, clearly, those kinds of
interactions
and bonding episodes have a
biological effect

46:21.145 --> 46:22.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the baby's brain.

46:22.446 --> 46:25.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we hope it's a long-term
neurodevelopmental
change.

46:26.016 --> 46:29.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Additional
trials to see
if these results can be
replicated are now

46:29.653 --> 46:36.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
under way in New York and Texas,
with two
more in the works in New Jersey
and Florida.

46:36.126 --> 46:42.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Caroline Ilie, who was born at
just two-and-a-half
pounds, is now a year-and-a-half
old, and

46:42.065 --> 46:43.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
seems to be thriving.

46:43.500 --> 46:48.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back home, all these mothers say
their families
are better off.

46:48.372 --> 46:53.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While the science behind it
remains a mystery
to them, they think this
intervention strengthened

46:53.544 --> 46:58.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their relationships during a
very fraught
period, with impacts they hope
will continue

46:58.949 --> 47:00.217 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with time.

47:00.250 --> 47:07.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour" in New
York, I'm William
Brangham.

47:07.224 --> 47:19.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to our
"NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught our eye,
that may be

47:19.970 --> 47:21.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of interest to you, too.

47:21.839 --> 47:27.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's graduation season, and that
means politicians,
actors and industry leaders are
imparting

47:27.744 --> 47:32.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sage advice and some humor to
college graduates
around the country.

47:32.416 --> 47:34.151 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Take a look.

47:34.184 --> 47:38.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILL FERRELL, Actor: I would
like to say thank
you, graduates, for that warm
welcome.

47:38.889 --> 47:46.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would also like to apologize
to all the
parents who are sitting there,
saying, Will

47:46.797 --> 47:47.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ferrell, why Will Ferrell?

47:47.965 --> 47:48.932 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:48.966 --> 47:52.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILL FERRELL: I hate Will
Ferrell.

47:52.169 --> 47:53.136 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:53.170 --> 47:56.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAZ JOBRANI, Comedian: Tip one,
always tip.

47:56.406 --> 47:57.507 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:57.541 --> 48:02.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAZ JOBRANI: Preferably 20
percent, if you
can.

48:02.346 --> 48:05.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I believe in karma and that what
you put out
in the world will come back to
you, but it

48:05.983 --> 48:07.851 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
also feels good.

48:07.885 --> 48:10.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, besides, being stingy sucks
and nobody
likes you.

48:10.754 --> 48:17.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE, Vice President of
the United States:
Write your own story, right now,
in your mind.

48:17.895 --> 48:21.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
See it and go live it.

48:21.999 --> 48:30.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Write a historic and heroic
story of service
and selflessness and leadership,
and then

48:30.207 --> 48:32.042 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
make it happen.

48:32.075 --> 48:35.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OCTAVIA SPENCER, Actress: When
you're starting
out in your career, it is
important that you

48:35.045 --> 48:37.881 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
say yes more than you say no.

48:37.915 --> 48:42.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It lets you uncover new
opportunities and
it reveals new relationships.

48:42.853 --> 48:48.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when it's time to say no,
say it loudly
and firmly.

48:48.926 --> 48:55.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There will be occasions when
saying no is
necessary to maintaining your
values and your

48:55.832 --> 48:57.534 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
self-worth.

48:57.567 --> 49:01.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Following your convictions means
you must

49:01.038 --> 49:08.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be willing to face criticism
from those who
lack the same courage to do what
is right.

49:09.012 --> 49:17.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they know what is right, but
they don't
have the courage or the guts or
the stamina

49:17.521 --> 49:19.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to take it and to do it.

49:19.456 --> 49:23.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HELEN MIRREN, Actress: For the
moments when
you are challenged by other
fears, like, oh,

49:23.627 --> 49:29.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
am I good enough, am I smart
enough, will
I fail, throw caution to the
winds.

49:29.533 --> 49:34.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look fear straight away in its
ugly face,
and barge forward.

49:34.838 --> 49:39.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when you get past it, turn
around, give
it a good swift kick in the ass.

49:39.142 --> 49:43.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN, Former Vice
President of the
United States: Treat people with
dignity.

49:43.313 --> 49:45.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You demand it for yourself.

49:45.549 --> 49:48.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You demand that you be treated
that way.

49:48.251 --> 49:55.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all of us, all of us have to
do better
when it comes to building the
bonds of empathy,

49:55.125 --> 50:03.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that folks who aren't like us,
aren't like
us, can know we understand them.

50:03.200 --> 50:06.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVEED DIGGS, Actor: The best
advice that
I can give to those of you who
are worried

50:06.770 --> 50:11.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the when of the rest of
your life is
stop tripping.

50:11.875 --> 50:16.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm sure you will all have long
lists of accomplishments
and multiple rebirths.

50:16.880 --> 50:20.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Some of you will have
accomplishments that
are asked to speak at colleges
or other prestigious

50:20.350 --> 50:21.318 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
institutions.

50:21.351 --> 50:22.319 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Dope.

50:22.352 --> 50:23.320 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Do that.

50:23.353 --> 50:25.222 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

50:25.255 --> 50:28.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, Former
U.S. Secretary
of State: So, whatever your
dreams are today,

50:28.125 --> 50:30.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
dream even bigger.

50:30.227 --> 50:35.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wherever you have set your
sights, raise them
even higher.

50:35.265 --> 50:38.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And, above all, keep going.

50:38.869 --> 50:41.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Don't do it because I asked you
to.

50:41.838 --> 50:43.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do it for yourselves.

50:43.573 --> 50:47.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHRYN THORNTON, Former NASA
Astronaut: And
to our graduates, to whom we are
trusting

50:47.577 --> 50:52.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nothing less than the future of
the human
race, I will share with you the
astronaut's

50:52.149 --> 50:53.483 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
prayer.

50:53.517 --> 50:58.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It goes: Dear lord, please don't
let me mess
up.

50:58.288 --> 50:59.656 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Amen.

50:59.689 --> 51:01.058 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

51:01.091 --> 51:06.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHRYN THORNTON: Good luck and
Godspeed,
class of 2017.

51:06.997 --> 51:07.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

51:07.998 --> 51:09.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Great advice, all
of that.

51:09.900 --> 51:13.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, later this evening on PBS,
"NOVA" is presenting
a film that takes a hard look at
the water

51:13.670 --> 51:15.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
crisis in Flint, Michigan.

51:15.772 --> 51:20.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Poisoned Water" uses the lens
of science
to reveal how the water disaster
in Flint

51:20.577 --> 51:25.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
brought to light the many
vulnerabilities
of water systems across the
country, including

51:25.515 --> 51:29.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the amount of lead in pipes
leading to individual
homes.

51:29.553 --> 51:37.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: If there is so much
lead in our
plumbing, why aren't we all
lead-poisoned?

51:37.194 --> 51:44.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The answer lies in the complex
chemical reactions
that go on between the pipe
itself and the

51:44.101 --> 51:46.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
water flowing through it.

51:46.136 --> 51:49.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Inside the pipe, as the
water goes through,
it reacts.

51:49.973 --> 51:53.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chemical reactions take place
with the plumbing
material.

51:53.376 --> 51:59.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this begins to build up kind
of a protective
coating, what we call a scale.

51:59.382 --> 52:02.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NARRATOR: This protective scale
is crucial.

52:02.953 --> 52:14.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It becomes a barrier that
prevents lead from
leaching into the water.

52:14.264 --> 52:19.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As scientists at the EPA's
Office of Research
and Development reveal, this
protective scale

52:19.803 --> 52:24.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can be made of up to 90 percent
lead.

52:24.207 --> 52:30.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Most people don't expect
that there's
actually a lot of lead in the
scale.

52:30.447 --> 52:36.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not a very good joke, but
we often say
that you are drinking water
through lead-painted

52:36.086 --> 52:40.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
straws, because these are the
minerals that
were in lead paint, and yet
they're lining

52:40.190 --> 52:41.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
your drinking water pipe.

52:41.925 --> 52:46.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're using lead to protect
yourself from
lead.

52:46.663 --> 52:54.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: To control pipe
corrosion, water
utilities often add a chemical
that helps

52:54.771 --> 53:03.046 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
build up the scale and protect
the water.

53:03.079 --> 53:09.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is so critical that EPA's
lead and copper
rule requires cities with over
50,000 people

53:09.452 --> 53:16.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to have what's called
corrosion-control treatment
in place.

53:16.793 --> 53:24.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The question is, has the city of
Flint been
using corrosion control?

53:24.534 --> 53:30.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: "NOVA"'s
"Poisoned Water" airs
