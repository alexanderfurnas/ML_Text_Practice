JUDY WOODRUFF: But first:
President Trump continues to
repeat the unsubstantiated claim

00:05.166 --> 00:09.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that millions of illegal votes
were cast in the 2016 election.

00:09.866 --> 00:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The commission he set
up to look into this has
sparked its own controversy.

00:14.366 --> 00:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham reports.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of
the United States: Every time
voter fraud occurs, it cancels

00:18.633 --> 00:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out the vote of a lawful citizen
and undermines democracy.

00:22.700 --> 00:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The first
meeting of the Commission on
Election Integrity convened

00:27.000 --> 00:29.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with a presidential
defense of its mission.

00:29.033 --> 00:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Throughout the
campaign, and even after,
people would come up to me and

00:36.233 --> 00:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
express their concerns
about voter inconsistencies
and irregularities
which they saw, in some

00:42.633 --> 00:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cases having to do with
very large numbers of
people in certain states.

00:46.533 --> 00:51.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So far, those
allegations remain unproven,
but the commission is pressing

00:51.300 --> 00:53.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ahead.

00:53.466 --> 00:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last month, it sent letters to
every state, asking for voter
information, including names,

00:58.500 --> 01:01.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
birthdays and partial
Social Security numbers.

01:01.200 --> 01:05.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Seventeen states, governed
by Republicans and Democrats,
as well as the District of

01:05.366 --> 01:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Columbia, refused to comply.

01:07.933 --> 01:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many others said they
will provide only limited
information that's already
publicly available.

01:12.533 --> 01:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the president
criticized those states
who've refused to go along.

01:16.333 --> 01:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: One has to wonder
what they're worried about.

01:20.966 --> 01:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I ask the vice president
and I ask the commission,
what are they worried about?

01:25.833 --> 01:27.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's something.

01:27.300 --> 01:29.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
There always is.

01:29.400 --> 01:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Just after
the election, when Hillary
Clinton won the popular vote

01:32.933 --> 01:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by 2.8 million votes, Mr. Trump
tweeted, again, with no evidence
whatsoever, that the vote

01:40.000 --> 01:43.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
count was skewed -- quote --
"I won the popular vote if you
deduct the millions of people

01:44.533 --> 01:46.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who voted illegally."

01:46.566 --> 01:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The commission co-chair,
Kansas Secretary of State Kris
Kobach, who is a Republican,

01:50.233 --> 01:53.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says the country deserves
a hard, dispassionate
look at the issue.

01:53.466 --> 01:55.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KRIS KOBACH (R), Kansas
Secretary of State: For a long
time, there has been lingering

01:55.466 --> 01:59.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doubt among many Americans
about integrity and
fairness of elections.

01:59.466 --> 02:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's not a new issue at all.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you look at polling
data, it goes back decades.

02:04.333 --> 02:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The panel is
chaired by Vice President Pence,
and in addition to Kobach,

02:09.033 --> 02:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
members include current and
former secretaries of state from
Indiana, New Hampshire, Maine

02:14.766 --> 02:16.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Ohio, among others.

02:16.766 --> 02:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But critics of the commission
warn that stoking fears of
alleged fraud will be used later

02:22.733 --> 02:24.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to justify a crackdown
on voting rights.

02:24.766 --> 02:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rick Hasen is a law professor
at the University of California,
Irvine, and an election law

02:29.000 --> 02:31.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
expert.

02:31.100 --> 02:33.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RICK HASEN, University
of California, Irvine:
I'm concerned that it's
going to be something

02:33.700 --> 02:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is just going to try
to support the president's
agenda, claiming that
there's a lot of voter

02:35.966 --> 02:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fraud, and use that to make
it harder for people to be
able to register to vote.

02:39.866 --> 02:44.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Already, the
commission is facing at least
seven lawsuits questioning

02:44.100 --> 02:48.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
its transparency, conduct
and even its existence.

02:48.866 --> 02:52.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We turn now to two
officials who actually run
elections in their states.

02:52.933 --> 02:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Matthew Dunlap is the
secretary of state for Maine.

02:55.033 --> 02:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is a Democrat, and
he's also a member of the
president's commission.

02:58.566 --> 03:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he was at today's meeting.

03:00.366 --> 03:02.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're also joined
by Michele Reagan.

03:02.266 --> 03:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She is a Republican and she is
Arizona's secretary of state.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW DUNLAP (D),
Maine Secretary of State:
Thank you for having us.

03:09.433 --> 03:11.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHELE REAGAN (R),
Arizona Secretary of State:
Thank you for having us.

03:11.033 --> 03:13.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Matthew, I would love
to start with you first.

03:13.100 --> 03:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is your general hope that
this commission - - what do
you hope it will accomplish?

03:15.066 --> 03:18.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW DUNLAP: Well, my general
hope is that actually we do
something to bolster voter

03:18.366 --> 03:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
confidence in how we conduct
elections in this country.

03:20.633 --> 03:22.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think we have an awful
lot to be proud of.

03:22.766 --> 03:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No one is questioning the
legitimacy of the outcome
of the 2016 election.

03:26.233 --> 03:30.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are some lingering
questions about how
elections have been
conducted, who was able

03:30.833 --> 03:32.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to vote legally or not.

03:32.800 --> 03:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, and based on my
experience in the state of
Maine, I think we can very, very

03:36.833 --> 03:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
proud of what our local election
officials have done to make
sure that their neighbors

03:40.933 --> 03:43.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get to exercise their democratic
right of self-governance.

03:43.966 --> 03:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Michele
Reagan, I know you are
a supporter broadly
of this commission

03:49.566 --> 03:51.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and its aims.

03:51.633 --> 03:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you know, the commission
was set up in part because of
the president's concern that

03:54.166 --> 03:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there had been some voter
fraud in the past election.

03:58.333 --> 03:59.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm curious.

03:59.800 --> 04:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You were running the election
in Arizona back in 2016.

04:02.900 --> 04:05.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Did you have any instances
of fraud in your state?

04:05.900 --> 04:09.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHELE REAGAN: Well, I can't
speak, obviously, for other
states, but I know, in Arizona,

04:09.866 --> 04:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we have a number of measures
that we use to prevent fraud.

04:13.833 --> 04:16.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's not to say
fraud never happens.

04:16.066 --> 04:20.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Certainly, when we hear
allegations of that, we
take it very seriously.

04:20.933 --> 04:25.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But it's important to
note Arizona has some
laws on the books that
keep it very safe from

04:26.666 --> 04:28.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fraud, massive fraud.

04:28.666 --> 04:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One is the showing proof of
I.D. at the polling places.

04:32.566 --> 04:36.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Another is proof of citizenship
when registering to vote.

04:36.466 --> 04:38.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A lot of states don't
have these laws.

04:38.566 --> 04:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, speaking from Arizona's
point of view, coupled with the
fact that we also participate,

04:45.466 --> 04:49.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
already, in interstate
cross-check systems,
for instances, of
double voting or double

04:51.766 --> 04:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
registration, we're pretty
confident in Arizona that we
run a really good election.

04:55.066 --> 05:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Matthew
Dunlap, as I mentioned
in the report prior to
this, the commission

05:01.566 --> 05:03.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
asked all the states for some
types of voter information.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And there was a lot of concern.

05:05.400 --> 05:06.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Many states pushed back.

05:06.866 --> 05:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I understand Maine didn't
share its information.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Explain to me, what
is the concern?

05:11.200 --> 05:12.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are you worried about?

05:12.700 --> 05:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATTHEW DUNLAP: Well, we're not
really worried about anything.

05:13.866 --> 05:15.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We just follow the law.

05:15.866 --> 05:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The request that came from the
commission, which, as commission
members, we did not review

05:19.100 --> 05:21.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the full text of the
letter that went out.

05:21.666 --> 05:25.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We did agree that the
information that should
be requested should be
requested, not demanded,

05:25.933 --> 05:30.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it should only be that
information that would
be publicly available
to anyone legally

05:30.066 --> 05:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
entitled to obtain it under
those particular state laws.

05:33.133 --> 05:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When we got the request, the
letter said that be advised that
any information that you provide

05:39.433 --> 05:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will be made publicly available
for anyone to inspect.

05:42.533 --> 05:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maine election law specifies
that anyone who is qualified
to access the voter file must

05:47.533 --> 05:49.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
keep it confidential.

05:49.266 --> 05:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that is directory language.

05:51.600 --> 05:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Making the list available is
discretionary under the law.

05:54.666 --> 05:58.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, with that direction, it was
a mathematical equation for us.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We simply could not provide
it under those circumstances.

06:00.100 --> 06:02.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And so we didn't.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Michele
Reagan, do you have
concerns about this
database being compiled

06:04.833 --> 06:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
here in Washington, D.C.?

06:06.266 --> 06:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHELE REAGAN: Well,
absolutely we have concerns.

06:08.366 --> 06:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, again, in Arizona, we
just looked to the statutes
and the law to tell us exactly

06:12.866 --> 06:16.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what we were going to
have to do or not do.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the law is pretty clear
that, again, just like in Maine,
you can't take the information

06:23.500 --> 06:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
via a public records
request with the intent of
sharing it or posting it
publicly or disseminate,

06:28.833 --> 06:31.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you know, giving it out.

06:31.200 --> 06:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Matthew
Dunlap, what about this larger
concern that has been raised by

06:34.900 --> 06:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some people that this commission
and its mission is going to be
used to justify further national

06:42.233 --> 06:43.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
crackdown on voting rights?

06:43.633 --> 06:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you make of that?

06:45.700 --> 06:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW DUNLAP: That's one of
my favorite questions to get
out of all of this, is that

06:47.566 --> 06:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
somehow we're trying to
undo the electoral process.

06:52.233 --> 06:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My position is, is that you have
these lingering questions that
have been around for a while

06:55.966 --> 06:58.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now about illegal
activity around elections.

06:58.800 --> 07:01.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Sunshine is the
greatest disinfectant.

07:01.366 --> 07:06.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have full confidence
that everything that's
been claimed will probably
be largely debunked.

07:08.100 --> 07:11.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And what we will find
will probably be the
product of mistakes and
errors and unintended

07:12.566 --> 07:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
actions that were never
meant to become felonies.

07:15.533 --> 07:19.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think, you know, with that
understanding, I think we're
going to find that we have a

07:19.066 --> 07:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really pretty good system
that's very, very decentralized,
which actually adds to its

07:23.133 --> 07:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
level of security against some
of the allegations that we have
heard about, like the Russian

07:26.833 --> 07:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Federation getting involved
in hacking our elections.

07:29.900 --> 07:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the systems that we
have in place, which are run
by local election officials,

07:33.900 --> 07:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually will be found to
work very, very well, and that
American voters should feel

07:37.733 --> 07:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pretty good about the systems
that help us elect our
leadership and decide issues.

07:41.833 --> 07:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Michele Reagan, you heard
Matthew here say that he
believes the commission

07:48.000 --> 07:50.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will largely debunk
many of these claims.

07:50.100 --> 07:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But just today, the co-chairman
of the commission, Kris Kobach,
said on MSNBC that he says, we

07:55.900 --> 08:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may never know whether
or not Hillary Clinton in
fact won the popular vote.

08:00.433 --> 08:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is an implication that is
very likely the potential that
three million illegal votes

08:06.000 --> 08:08.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were cast.

08:08.033 --> 08:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is the head of the commission
is making that kind of a
statement, does that concern you

08:12.133 --> 08:15.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at all about the thrust
of this commission?

08:15.166 --> 08:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHELE REAGAN: What really
concerns me is the good work
that the commission could be

08:20.633 --> 08:23.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
doing.

08:23.133 --> 08:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I hope -- and I have
high hopes that they
will look forward to
some of these suggestions

08:26.933 --> 08:29.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that states are making.

08:29.433 --> 08:33.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would hope that this
commission takes what
states are doing and
determines what is working

08:35.100 --> 08:37.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
best, so they can share
it with other states.

08:37.066 --> 08:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Michele Reagan, Matthew Dunlap,
thank you both very much.

08:39.866 --> 08:41.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MATTHEW DUNLAP: Thank
you for having us.
