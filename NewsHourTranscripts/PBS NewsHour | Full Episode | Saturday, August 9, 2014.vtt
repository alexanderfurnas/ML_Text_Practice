00:10.677 --> 00:10.677
>> Sreenivasan: ON THIS EDITION

00:10.677 --> 00:11.845
FOR SATURDAY, AUGUST 9:

00:11.845 --> 00:13.614
RESCUE EFFORTS CONTINUE IN

00:13.614 --> 00:14.848
NORTHERN IRAQ AFTER TENS OF

00:14.848 --> 00:16.617
THOUSANDS OF CIVILIANS FLEEING

00:16.617 --> 00:16.884
ISLAMIC STATE MILITANTS END UP

00:16.884 --> 00:18.986
STRANDED.

00:18.986 --> 00:20.854
PRESIDENT OBAMA ACKNOWLEDGES

00:20.854 --> 00:22.322
THAT AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE

00:22.322 --> 00:23.257
UNDERESTIMATED THE THREAT POSED

00:23.257 --> 00:25.292
BY THE JIHADISTS.

00:25.292 --> 00:27.060
AND IN THIS COUNTRY, A

00:27.060 --> 00:27.895
POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT COURT

00:27.895 --> 00:29.162
RULING ABOUT WHETHER PROSECUTORS

00:29.162 --> 00:31.031
CAN USE VIOLENT RAP LYRICS

00:31.031 --> 00:31.832
AGAINST THE DEFENDANTS WHO WROTE

00:31.832 --> 00:33.934
THEM.

00:33.934 --> 00:34.868
>> WHEN THEY STARTED DOING THE

00:34.868 --> 00:35.202
LYRICS, PEOPLE STARTED FROWNING

00:35.202 --> 00:37.638
THEIR FACES.

00:37.638 --> 00:38.005
BUT IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH

00:38.005 --> 00:38.505
THE CASE AT ALL.

00:38.505 --> 00:38.939
>> Sreenivasan: NEXT ON PBS

00:38.939 --> 00:42.943
NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:42.943 --> 00:44.077
FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS IN

00:44.077 --> 00:46.179
LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:46.179 --> 00:48.315
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:48.315 --> 00:49.249
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING.

00:49.249 --> 00:50.717
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:50.717 --> 00:51.785
BEFORE LEAVING FOR VACATION ON

00:51.785 --> 00:53.353
MARTHA’S VINEYARD TODAY,

00:53.353 --> 00:55.522
PRESIDENT OBAMA WARNED THAT HE

00:55.522 --> 00:56.723
COULD NOT PUT A TIMETABLE ON THE

00:56.723 --> 00:58.425
LATEST AMERICAN MILITARY

00:58.425 --> 01:00.794
INTERVENTION IN NORTHERN IRAQ.

01:00.794 --> 01:02.562
ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS THERE HAVE

01:02.562 --> 01:04.665
CLOSED TO WITHIN ABOUT 25 MILES

01:04.665 --> 01:05.866
OF THE KURDISH CAPITAL OF ERBIL,

01:05.866 --> 01:06.199
WHERE MANY AMERICANS ARE SAID TO

01:06.199 --> 01:09.169
BE.

01:09.169 --> 01:09.536
THE MILITANTS’ ADVANCE HAS ALSO

01:09.536 --> 01:11.471
PROMPTED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

01:11.471 --> 01:12.906
OTHERS TO FLEE THE CITY AND TAKE

01:12.906 --> 01:13.407
REFUGE ON A MOUNTAIN, WHERE THEY

01:13.407 --> 01:16.143
ARE NOW TRAPPED.

01:16.143 --> 01:18.345
>> AND AMERICAN AIRCRAFT ARE

01:18.345 --> 01:19.279
POSITIONED TO STRIKE ISIL

01:19.279 --> 01:21.548
TERRORISTS AROUND THE MOUNTAIN,

01:21.548 --> 01:23.850
TO HELP FORCES IN IRAQ BREAK THE

01:23.850 --> 01:24.217
SIEGE AND RESCUE THOSE WHO ARE

01:24.217 --> 01:26.420
TRAPPED THERE.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.388
NOW, EVEN AS WE DEAL WITH THESE

01:28.388 --> 01:30.757
IMMEDIATE SITUATIONS, WE WILL

01:30.757 --> 01:31.358
CONTINUE TO PURSUE A BROADER

01:31.358 --> 01:35.028
STRATEGY IN IRAQ.

01:35.028 --> 01:36.763
WE WILL PROTECT OUR AMERICAN

01:36.763 --> 01:38.298
CITIZENS IN IRAQ, WHETHER

01:38.298 --> 01:38.665
THEY’RE DIPLOMATS, CIVILIANS OR

01:38.665 --> 01:42.035
MILITARY.

01:42.035 --> 01:44.004
IF THESE TERRORISTS THREATEN OUR

01:44.004 --> 01:45.939
FACILITIES OR OUR PERSONNEL, WE

01:45.939 --> 01:46.306
WILL TAKE ACTION TO PROTECT OUR

01:46.306 --> 01:47.774
PEOPLE.

01:47.774 --> 01:48.942
>> Sreenivasan: FOR MORE ABOUT

01:48.942 --> 01:50.010
THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND IN

01:50.010 --> 01:51.144
IRAQ, WE ARE JOINED ONCE AGAIN

01:51.144 --> 01:51.912
TONIGHT BY NOUR MALAS OF THE

01:51.912 --> 01:54.014
"WALL STREET JOURNAL."

01:54.014 --> 01:54.614
SHE JOINS US VIA SKYPE FROM

01:54.614 --> 01:57.784
ERBIL.

01:57.784 --> 01:58.685
SO, IN THE PAST WEEK, WE SAW

01:58.685 --> 02:01.054
THIS MASSIVE ASSAULT BY THE

02:01.054 --> 02:02.556
ISLAMIC STATE, THEY TOOK OVER

02:02.556 --> 02:04.024
THREE TOWNS AND THEN JUST IN THE

02:04.024 --> 02:05.559
LAST 24 TO 48 HOURS THEY TOOK

02:05.559 --> 02:06.860
OVER ANOTHER, WHAT IS THE LATEST

02:06.860 --> 02:08.495
WE KNOW ABOUT HOW THEY ARE

02:08.495 --> 02:08.662
ADVANCING?

02:08.662 --> 02:10.030
>> THEY HAVE MOVED EVEN CLOSER

02:10.030 --> 02:13.667
OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS TO ERBIL,

02:13.667 --> 02:16.069
THE CAPITAL OF THE IRAQI

02:16.069 --> 02:17.104
KURDISTAN AND THAT IS REALLY

02:17.104 --> 02:18.538
WHAT SENT OFFICIALS HERE,

02:18.538 --> 02:19.606
RESIDENTS OF THE KURDISH REGION

02:19.606 --> 02:22.109
INTO A PANIC, AND PROMPTED

02:22.109 --> 02:23.777
ULTIMATELY THE U.S.

02:23.777 --> 02:26.246
INTERVENTION, THERE IS A LARGE

02:26.246 --> 02:27.681
AMERICAN CONSULATE PRESENCE

02:27.681 --> 02:29.149
HERE, THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF

02:29.149 --> 02:31.251
U.S. CITIZENS AND ON THE IRAQI

02:31.251 --> 02:34.955
SIDE THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF

02:34.955 --> 02:36.056
YAZIDIS ON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE

02:36.056 --> 02:37.724
THAT THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT HASN’T

02:37.724 --> 02:40.460
BEEN ABLE TO HELP THEM SO THIS

02:40.460 --> 02:43.063
HAS BEEN, CAUSED U.S.

02:43.063 --> 02:43.497
INVOLVEMENT INTO IRAQ.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.865
>> YOU GOT THERE RIGHT BEFORE

02:44.865 --> 02:46.366
THE U.S. AIR STRIKES HAPPENED,

02:46.366 --> 02:48.502
WHAT WAS THE AFTERMATH? WHAT

02:48.502 --> 02:49.002
WERE THE CONSEQUENCES.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.537
>> WHEN I GOT HERE, PEOPLE WERE

02:50.537 --> 02:56.176
IN A PANIC, THE ISLAMIC STATE

02:56.176 --> 02:57.144
ENCROACHMENT ON THE CAPITAL, IT

02:57.144 --> 02:58.245
IS NOT CLEAR THESE ARE ACTUALLY

02:58.245 --> 03:00.714
THE GOALS OF THESE MILITANTS,

03:00.714 --> 03:02.249
THEY ARE DEFINITELY MAKING A

03:02.249 --> 03:04.117
PUSH ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE

03:04.117 --> 03:06.820
IRAQI KURDISH BORDER WHICH IS

03:06.820 --> 03:08.355
620 MILES, THEY ARE TRYING TO

03:08.355 --> 03:09.689
CONSOLIDATE THE AREAS AND THE

03:09.689 --> 03:11.758
TOWNS THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN,

03:11.758 --> 03:13.927
MOVING UP TO THE BORDER, BUT

03:13.927 --> 03:15.829
JUST GETTING CLOSE ENOUGH TO

03:15.829 --> 03:17.264
ERBIL HAS SENT SO MANY PEOPLE

03:17.264 --> 03:20.167
INTO A PANIC ALREADY, U.S. AIR

03:20.167 --> 03:21.401
STRIKES, THAT STARTED ON

03:21.401 --> 03:23.103
THURSDAY APPEAR TO HAVE CALMED

03:23.103 --> 03:25.238
THINGS DOWN, PEOPLE FEEL MORE

03:25.238 --> 03:27.541
COMFORTABLE THAT THERE IS

03:27.541 --> 03:28.708
PRECISION AND TARGETED STRIKES

03:28.708 --> 03:30.544
THAT TRY TO PUSH BACK SOME OF

03:30.544 --> 03:32.479
THESE INSURGENT POSITIONS,

03:32.479 --> 03:34.014
THOUGH IT IS NOT CLEAR YET

03:34.014 --> 03:34.915
EXACTLY WHAT EFFECT THEY HAVE

03:34.915 --> 03:35.082
HAD.

03:35.082 --> 03:36.917
>> WHAT IS LIFE LIKE IN THE

03:36.917 --> 03:37.217
CAPITAL?

03:37.217 --> 03:38.585
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING

03:38.585 --> 03:38.752
TODAY?

03:38.752 --> 03:41.488
>> THE CAPITAL IS RELATIVELY

03:41.488 --> 03:44.091
NORMAL AND CALM, IT IS TENSE,

03:44.091 --> 03:46.560
BECAUSE, THE KURDISH FORCES HAVE

03:46.560 --> 03:48.495
SPREAD OUT, GOING IN AND OUT OF

03:48.495 --> 03:52.099
ERBIL, THERE IS A HEAVY SECURITY

03:52.099 --> 03:53.433
PRESENCE, THERE IS A BIT OF

03:53.433 --> 03:56.670
SUSPICION WITH THE NON-CURDS, SO

03:56.670 --> 03:59.906
KURDISH OFFICIALS ARE TENSE

03:59.906 --> 04:04.044
ABOUT THE THOUSANDS OF SUNNI

04:04.044 --> 04:07.581
NON-KURDISH IRAQIS FLOODING

04:07.581 --> 04:08.782
INTO THEIR TERRITORY FROM

04:08.782 --> 04:09.816
ELSEWHERE, SOME PEOPLE FEAR

04:09.816 --> 04:12.853
THAT, YOU KNOW, THIS COULD BE I

04:12.853 --> 04:14.020
INFILTRATED BY THE ISLAMIC

04:14.020 --> 04:14.154
STATE.

04:14.154 --> 04:16.423
>> LET’S GET TO WHAT IS

04:16.423 --> 04:17.257
HAPPENING ON THE MOUNTAIN, WHAT

04:17.257 --> 04:18.792
IS THE LATEST ON THE

04:18.792 --> 04:19.726
HUMANITARIAN AIR DROPS?

04:19.726 --> 04:21.261
>> THERE WAS A SMALL

04:21.261 --> 04:23.697
BREAKTHROUGH WITH AN EVACUATION

04:23.697 --> 04:25.866
ACTUALLY, THE UNITED STATES

04:25.866 --> 04:26.600
CONDUCTED TWO AIRDROPS, EARLY

04:26.600 --> 04:27.868
THIS MORNING AND THEY HAVE BEEN

04:27.868 --> 04:29.436
ABLE TO REACH SOMETHING LIKE

04:29.436 --> 04:30.770
10,000 OR MAYBE A LITTLE BIT

04:30.770 --> 04:34.274
MORE THAN THAT PEOPLE, THERE ARE

04:34.274 --> 04:36.409
ABOUT 40,000 YAZIDI STRANDING ON

04:36.409 --> 04:37.744
THE MOUNTAIN SIDE SORRY MANY ARE

04:37.744 --> 04:39.246
IN NEED, THE U.N. IS TALKING

04:39.246 --> 04:41.648
ABOUT TRYING TO HELP FURTHER

04:41.648 --> 04:43.183
HUMANITARIAN AID ITSELF BUT ALL

04:43.183 --> 04:45.118
IT SPEAKS TO HOW TRULY STRANDED

04:45.118 --> 04:46.553
THEY ARE AND HOW TERRIBLE THEIR

04:46.553 --> 04:47.654
CONDITIONS ARE.

04:47.654 --> 04:51.057
I WAS ABLE TO MEET WITH A DOZEN

04:51.057 --> 04:53.960
FAMILIES UP NORTH IN THE

04:53.960 --> 04:56.062
PROVINCE, AND ALL OF THEM REALLY

04:56.062 --> 04:57.964
RECOUNTED THE SAME TERRIBLE

04:57.964 --> 04:58.965
FLEEING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

04:58.965 --> 05:00.567
NIGHT, GRABBING WHATEVER THEY

05:00.567 --> 05:02.169
COULD, IN MOST CASE JUST THEIR

05:02.169 --> 05:03.470
KIDS, A LOT OF THEM DIDN’T HAVE

05:03.470 --> 05:04.905
CLOTHES OR THE ROADS WERE TOO

05:04.905 --> 05:06.506
JAMMED WITH CARS AND THEY HAD TO

05:06.506 --> 05:09.042
JUST WALK FOR HOURS, SOMETIMES

05:09.042 --> 05:10.911
DAYS TO GET TO SAFETY, AND EVEN

05:10.911 --> 05:13.113
HERE IN IRAQI KURDISTAN THEY ARE

05:13.113 --> 05:16.183
JUST CONSUMED WITH NEWS FROM

05:16.183 --> 05:17.517
HUNDREDS OF THEIR RELATIVES

05:17.517 --> 05:18.185
STRANDED ON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE.

05:18.185 --> 05:20.086
>> AND WHAT IS TRAVEL LIKE

05:20.086 --> 05:21.288
INSIDE IRAQ NOW? THE LAST TIME

05:21.288 --> 05:23.056
WE SPOKE WITH YOU IN A DIFFERENT

05:23.056 --> 05:25.325
CITY DID YOU TO TAKE EXTRA

05:25.325 --> 05:25.525
PRECAUTIONS?

05:25.525 --> 05:28.562
>> ACTUALLY, I TOOK A FLIGHT

05:28.562 --> 05:30.530
OVER HERE RIGHT IN TIME BEFORE A

05:30.530 --> 05:32.465
BUNCH OF INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES

05:32.465 --> 05:34.267
CANCELED FLIGHTS TO ERBIL, SOME

05:34.267 --> 05:36.203
OF THEM SINCE THEN HAVE

05:36.203 --> 05:39.706
REINSTATED THEM, IT IS A GAUGE

05:39.706 --> 05:41.141
WHAT AIRSPACE EXPURT IS GOING TO

05:41.141 --> 05:45.512
BE LIKE AND ALSO JUST TO SEE HOW

05:45.512 --> 05:47.080
CLEAR HOW LONG IT TAKES THE U.S.

05:47.080 --> 05:47.914
AIR STRIKE OPERATIONS ARE GOING

05:47.914 --> 05:48.081
TO BE.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.650
>> THE HIGHWAYS

05:50.650 --> 05:52.852
CONNECTING MAJOR CITIES STILL

05:52.852 --> 05:55.622
ARE ANYTHING LEADING, YOU KNOW,

05:55.622 --> 05:58.792
TO MOSUL OR OFFSHOOT, YOU BOUND

05:58.792 --> 06:01.728
TO RUN INTO OR RUN THE RISK OF

06:01.728 --> 06:03.363
RUNNING INTO AN INSURGENT

06:03.363 --> 06:05.065
PRESENCE, SO THERE IS A FEAR

06:05.065 --> 06:06.666
THAT THE ROAD TRAVEL OPTION IS

06:06.666 --> 06:10.971
NOT GOING TO BE SAFE FOR MUCH

06:10.971 --> 06:11.171
LONGER.

06:11.171 --> 06:13.039
>> NOUR MALAS OF THE "WALL

06:21.514 --> 06:22.515

06:22.515 --> 06:23.216
ANOTHER ROUND OF VIOLENCE TODAY

06:23.216 --> 06:24.217
BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS

06:24.217 --> 06:25.218
FOLLOWING THE COLLAPSE YESTERDAY

06:25.218 --> 06:27.020
OF THE LATEST HUMANITARIAN CEASE

06:27.020 --> 06:27.621

LAUNCHED MORE THAN 30 AERIAL

06:31.458 --> 06:32.459
SECURITY COMPLEX.

06:32.459 --> 06:33.426
AT LEAST FIVE PALESTINIANS WERE

06:33.426 --> 06:34.361
KILLED.

06:34.361 --> 06:35.462
ACCORDING TO ISRAELI OFFICIALS,

06:35.462 --> 06:36.796
PALESTINIAN MILITANTS HAVE FIRED

06:36.796 --> 06:38.365
MORE THAN 65 ROCKETS INTO ISRAEL

06:38.365 --> 06:39.966
SINCE THE END OF THE CEASE FIRE.

06:39.966 --> 06:42.669
NO INJURIES WERE REPORTED TODAY.

06:42.669 --> 06:43.937
IN UKRAINE TODAY, A PRO-RUSSIAN

06:43.937 --> 06:45.205
REBEL LEADER SAID HE WOULD

06:45.205 --> 06:46.473
ACCEPT A CEASE FIRE TO HELP

06:46.473 --> 06:46.973
PREVENT A HUMANITARIAN DISASTER

06:46.973 --> 06:49.142
THERE.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.577
THIS AFTER UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT

06:50.577 --> 06:52.178
TROOPS REPORTEDLY SURROUNDED THE

06:52.178 --> 06:52.846
CITY OF DONETSK, WHERE THE

06:52.846 --> 06:54.447
REBELS HAVE RETREATED.

06:54.447 --> 06:56.016
SHELLING HAS DAMAGED MANY

06:56.016 --> 06:56.516
BUILDINGS IN THAT CITY OF NEARLY

06:56.516 --> 06:58.885
A MILLION PEOPLE.

06:58.885 --> 06:59.886
MOST STORES ARE CLOSED AND

06:59.886 --> 07:01.421
THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS ARE

07:01.421 --> 07:03.790
MAKING DO WITHOUT ELECTRICITY.

07:03.790 --> 07:05.659
FROM WEST AFRICA TONIGHT, WORD

07:05.659 --> 07:07.360
THAT SEVERAL MAJOR CORPORATIONS

07:07.360 --> 07:09.129

07:09.129 --> 07:11.331
OVERSEAS PETROLEUM AND TAWANA

07:11.331 --> 07:12.766
RESOURCES OF AUSTRALIA ARE

07:12.766 --> 07:14.968
STARTING TO SCALE BACK THEIR

07:14.968 --> 07:16.002
OPERATIONS IN COUNTRIES AFFECTED

07:16.002 --> 07:17.771
BY THE OUTBREAK OF EBOLA.

07:17.771 --> 07:18.705
CATERPILLAR SAID IT HAS

07:18.705 --> 07:20.073
EVACUATED FEWER THAN TEN PEOPLE

07:20.073 --> 07:21.107
SO FAR BUT IS STILL CLOSELY

07:21.107 --> 07:23.376
MONITORING THE SITUATION.

07:23.376 --> 07:25.011
NEARLY 1,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED,

07:25.011 --> 07:26.613
PRIMARILY IN SIERRA LEONE,

07:26.613 --> 07:28.415
GUINEA AND LIBERIA.

07:28.415 --> 07:29.582
IN THE EASTERN AFRICAN NATION OF

07:29.582 --> 07:29.916
UGANDA TODAY, A GAY PRIDE

07:29.916 --> 07:32.385
PARADE.

07:32.385 --> 07:33.853
THE EVENT OCCURRED JUST DAYS

07:33.853 --> 07:35.522
AFTER A COURT RULED THAT THE

07:35.522 --> 07:35.955
NATION’S STRINGENT ANTI-GAY LAW

07:35.955 --> 07:38.625
WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

07:38.625 --> 07:39.426
THE LAW HAD SPARKED

07:39.426 --> 07:40.727
INTERNATIONAL CONDEMNATION AND

07:40.727 --> 07:41.561
PROMPTED CUTS IN INTERNATIONAL

07:41.561 --> 07:43.763
AID TO THAT NATION.

07:43.763 --> 07:44.864
BACK IN THIS COUNTRY, A DISTRICT

07:44.864 --> 07:46.199
COURT JUDGE IN CALIFORNIA HAS

07:46.199 --> 07:48.268
THROWN OUT A SETTLEMENT REACHED

07:48.268 --> 07:49.436
LAST SPRING BETWEEN TECHNOLOGY

07:49.436 --> 07:51.504
COMPANIES GOOGLE, APPLE, INTEL,

07:51.504 --> 07:52.372
ADOBE AND MORE THAN 60,000 OF

07:52.372 --> 07:54.974
THEIR EMPLOYEES.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.243
JUDGE LUCY KOH SAID THE $324

07:57.243 --> 07:59.479
MILLION DEAL WAS INSUFFICIENT.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.281
THE COMPANIES ALLEGEDLY COLLUDED

08:01.281 --> 08:02.716
NOT TO HIRE EACH OTHERS’

08:02.716 --> 08:03.950
EMPLOYEES, A DEAL THAT THE

08:03.950 --> 08:05.385
EMPLOYEES CLAIM ARTIFICIALLY

08:05.385 --> 08:07.287
SUPPRESSED THEIR SALARIES.

08:07.287 --> 08:08.455
IN HER RULING, THE JUDGE WROTE

08:08.455 --> 08:10.090
THAT THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL AND

08:10.090 --> 08:13.360
COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT STEVE

08:13.360 --> 08:14.127
JOBS WAS A, IF NOT THE, CENTRAL

08:14.127 --> 08:14.661
FIGURE IN THE ALLEGED

08:14.661 --> 08:16.429
CONSPIRACY.

08:16.429 --> 08:17.464
THERE’S BEEN A FATAL OUTBREAK OF

08:17.464 --> 08:17.897
TUBERCULOSIS AT HOMELESS

08:17.897 --> 08:20.533
SHELTERS IN ATLANTA.

08:20.533 --> 08:21.601
NEARLY 50 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

08:21.601 --> 08:22.869
INFECTED, INCLUDING TWO

08:22.869 --> 08:23.403
VOLUNTEERS, AND THREE PEOPLE

08:23.403 --> 08:25.038
HAVE DIED.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.606
HEALTH OFFICIALS SAY TRANSIENTS

08:26.606 --> 08:28.308
ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO THE

08:28.308 --> 08:30.110
DISEASE.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.644
THERE WERE JUST UNDER 10,000

08:31.644 --> 08:32.746
CASES OF TUBERCULOSIS REPORTED

08:32.746 --> 08:35.115
IN THE UNITED STATES LAST YEAR.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.549
THE DISEASE SPREADS THROUGH THE

08:36.549 --> 08:36.883
AIR FROM CLOSE PROXIMITY TO AN

08:36.883 --> 08:39.452
INFECTED PERSON.

08:39.452 --> 08:40.487
AND VOLKSWAGEN ANNOUNCED TODAY

08:40.487 --> 08:43.256
THAT IT IS RECALLING NEARLY

08:43.256 --> 08:44.824
200,000 OF ITS TIGUAN SMALL

08:44.824 --> 08:46.159
SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES.

08:46.159 --> 08:48.094
THE COMPANY SAYS THEY MIGHT

08:48.094 --> 08:48.795
UNEXPECTEDLY STALL, LEADING TO

08:48.795 --> 08:50.430
ACCIDENTS.

08:50.430 --> 08:52.532
THE VEHICLES AFFECTED ARE THE

08:52.532 --> 09:05.145
MODEL YEARS 2009 THROUGH 2014.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.513
>> Sreenivasan: RETURNING NOW TO

09:06.513 --> 09:07.981
THE DAY’S TOP STORY, AMERICAN

09:07.981 --> 09:09.883
EFFORTS TO SLOW ADVANCES BY

09:09.883 --> 09:11.684
ISLAMIC STATE JIHADISTS IN

09:11.684 --> 09:13.553
NORTHERN IRAQ AND TO RESCUE

09:13.553 --> 09:14.387
THOUSANDS OF CIVILIANS WHO HAVE

09:14.387 --> 09:15.989
FLED FROM THEM.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.557
FOR MORE, WE ARE JOINED NOW FROM

09:17.557 --> 09:18.925
WASHINGTON BY DOUGLAS OLLIVANT.

09:18.925 --> 09:20.160
HE IS A SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY

09:20.160 --> 09:21.394
FELLOW AT THE NEW AMERICA

09:21.394 --> 09:22.462
FOUNDATION AND A PARTNER AT

09:22.462 --> 09:26.032
MANTID INTERNATIONAL.

09:26.032 --> 09:26.733
SO, THIS MORNING, WE HEARD THE

09:26.733 --> 09:27.834
PRESIDENT SAY THAT THIS IS ABOUT

09:27.834 --> 09:29.803
TWO THINGS, PROTECTION OF

09:29.803 --> 09:31.304
AMERICANS, AND ABOUT

09:31.304 --> 09:32.906
HUMANITARIAN AID, THIS WASN’T SO

09:32.906 --> 09:34.974
MUCH ABOUT DISLODGING ISLAMIC

09:34.974 --> 09:36.176
STATE GROUP FROM THE POWER THAT

09:36.176 --> 09:37.777
THEY ARE ALREADY WIELDING IN

09:37.777 --> 09:39.712
LARGE PORTIONS OF IRAQ.

09:39.712 --> 09:41.648
>> I THINK THAT IS EXACTLY

09:41.648 --> 09:41.815
RIGHT.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.983
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO USE AIR

09:43.983 --> 09:45.485
FORCE, AIR POWER AND NOT U.S.

09:45.485 --> 09:46.786
BOOT ON THE GROUND IN ANY

09:46.786 --> 09:48.221
ENGAGEMENT WITH THE ISLAMIC

09:48.221 --> 09:50.223
STATE, WHAT HE HAS DONE IS SET A

09:50.223 --> 09:51.658
CONDITION WHERE HE CAN FULFILL

09:51.658 --> 09:53.493
THIS PROMISE, AIR POWER IS VERY,

09:53.493 --> 09:55.862
VERY GOOD AT DEALING WITH

09:55.862 --> 09:57.197
ATTACKING TROOPS, YOU KNOW, YOU

09:57.197 --> 09:58.998
ARE MOVING, YOU SHOOTING, YOU

09:58.998 --> 09:59.899
ARE CREATING A SIGNATURE THAT

09:59.899 --> 10:02.202
CAN BE SEEN FROM THE AIR, AND IT

10:02.202 --> 10:04.137
IS PRETTY EASY FOR AIR POWER TO

10:04.137 --> 10:05.538
ENGAGE TARTS LIKE THAT, THAT IS

10:05.538 --> 10:06.639
THEIR ELEMENT, THAT’S WHAT THEY

10:06.639 --> 10:07.207
DO BEST.

10:07.207 --> 10:08.975
WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT

10:08.975 --> 10:09.943
PUSHING THEM OUT OF CITIES WHERE

10:09.943 --> 10:11.911
THEY ARE DUG IN OR HIDDEN IN

10:11.911 --> 10:13.780
BUILDINGS, THEIR POWER HAS SOME

10:13.780 --> 10:16.583
REAL, AIR POWER HAS REAM REAL

10:16.583 --> 10:19.018
LIMITATIONS AND THAT WILL TAKE

10:19.018 --> 10:20.353
BOOTS ON THE GROUND AT I DON’T

10:20.353 --> 10:21.721
THINK THE PRESIDENT WILL GO

10:21.721 --> 10:21.888
THERE.

10:21.888 --> 10:24.090
>> SO MUCH OF THIS IS DEPENDENT

10:24.090 --> 10:24.858
ON IRAQ FORMING A GOVERNMENT.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.593
>> THE BEST CARE SCENARIO IRAQ

10:26.593 --> 10:27.594
FORMS A GOVERNMENT, ARE THEY

10:27.594 --> 10:28.862
STRONG ENOUGH TO COMBAT THIS ON

10:28.862 --> 10:31.498
THEIR OWN?

10:31.498 --> 10:33.366
>> IT REALLY DEPEND ON THE TYPE

10:33.366 --> 10:34.667
OF GOVERNMENT THAT COMES

10:34.667 --> 10:36.035
TOGETHER AND WHETHER THEY CAN

10:36.035 --> 10:37.470
REALLY GET ALL THREE SIDES.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.571
ALL THREE SIDES HAVE SOMETHING

10:38.571 --> 10:40.173
TO GIVE HERE.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.308
THE CURDS HAVE SOME VERY, VERY

10:42.308 --> 10:43.409
DEDICATED FIGHTERS IN THE NORTH,

10:43.409 --> 10:45.111
THEY HAVE A SECURE BASE THERE IN

10:45.111 --> 10:46.212
THE MOUNTAIN THAT THEY CAN

10:46.212 --> 10:48.648
REALLY PUSH OUT OF, AND WE HAVE

10:48.648 --> 10:50.083
ASSETS WORKING OUT OF THE

10:50.083 --> 10:51.518
AMERICAN CONSULATE THERE, THE

10:51.518 --> 10:53.853
SOUTH HAS THE BULK OF THE

10:53.853 --> 10:55.955
AMERICAN EQUIPMENT THAT REMAINS,

10:55.955 --> 10:57.724
THE ARTILLERY PIECES, THE TANKS,

10:57.724 --> 10:59.359
THE ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS

10:59.359 --> 11:01.628
AND A LARGE MANPOWER PULL FROM

11:01.628 --> 11:03.162
THE SOUTH THEY COULD USE TO PUSH

11:03.162 --> 11:04.397
NORTH AND THEN OF COURSE THE

11:04.397 --> 11:05.798
SUNNI GROUPS ARE IN THE MIDST OF

11:05.798 --> 11:07.500
THIS AND THEY COULD REALLY

11:07.500 --> 11:09.702
BECOME A FIFTH COLUMN FOR ICE

11:09.702 --> 11:11.137
SISTER, ISIS INTERNALLY SO YOU

11:11.137 --> 11:12.939
CAN GET ALL THREE OF THESE

11:12.939 --> 11:13.773
GROUPS WORKING TOGETHER THAT

11:13.773 --> 11:15.308
WOULD BE THE KEY BUT THE IRAQIS

11:15.308 --> 11:16.843
NEED TO MOVE QUICKLY TO TAKE THE

11:16.843 --> 11:18.177
NEXT STEPS TO FORM THEIR

11:18.177 --> 11:18.411
GOVERNMENT.

11:18.411 --> 11:19.879
>> TODAY THE PRESIDENT SAID THIS

11:19.879 --> 11:21.247
COULD BE SOMETHING THAT

11:21.247 --> 11:23.082
CERTAINLY IS NOT SOLVED IN BOOK

11:23.082 --> 11:24.651
WEEKS, IT COULD BE A LONG-TERM

11:24.651 --> 11:24.884
SITUATION.

11:24.884 --> 11:26.419
>> WHAT KIND OF TIMELINE IS

11:26.419 --> 11:28.087
LIKELY AND IN THE MEANTIME IS

11:28.087 --> 11:30.690
THE ISLAMIC STRENGTH GROUP

11:30.690 --> 11:32.892
STRENGTHEN THEIR HOLD ON THE

11:32.892 --> 11:35.495
PLACES THEY ALREADY HAVE?

11:35.495 --> 11:36.896
>> THAT MAY BE THE CASE. THE

11:36.896 --> 11:37.730
IRAQI PRESIDENT WHO HAS BEEN

11:37.730 --> 11:40.166
ELECTED THERE IS A NEW

11:40.166 --> 11:41.634
PRESIDENT, SHOULD BE APPOINTING

11:41.634 --> 11:42.869
A, OR DESIGNATING SOMEONE TO

11:42.869 --> 11:44.270
FORM A GOVERNMENT HERE IN THE

11:44.270 --> 11:46.105
NEAR FUTURE.

11:46.105 --> 11:48.508
THEY ARE STILL YANG LING OVER

11:48.508 --> 11:50.109
THAT BUT TAKING EVERY DAY OF THE

11:50.109 --> 11:52.745
15 DAY OF THE CONSTITUTION

11:52.745 --> 11:54.280
ALLOTS, DEPENDING ON HOW YOU

11:54.280 --> 11:55.982
COUNT HOLIDAYS OR SUNDAY HE IS

11:55.982 --> 11:58.384
JUST OVER OR JUST UNDER THAT

11:58.384 --> 11:59.953
DEADLINE, HOPEFULLY WE WILL SEE

11:59.953 --> 12:00.954
SOME ANNOUNCEMENT IN THE NEXT

12:00.954 --> 12:01.287
DAY OR TWO.

12:01.287 --> 12:03.590
>> IN THE HUMANITARIAN FRONT,

12:03.590 --> 12:05.792
HOW COMPLICATED IS IT TO CREATE

12:05.792 --> 12:09.028
THAT CORRIDOR OF SAFETY IF WE

12:09.028 --> 12:11.297
ARE PROTECTING IT IN FROM THE

12:11.297 --> 12:12.599
SKIES? HOW DO WE GET THE PEOPLE

12:12.599 --> 12:14.267
OFF THE MOUNTAIN AND INTO A SAFE

12:14.267 --> 12:14.601
AREA?

12:14.601 --> 12:15.568
>> I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE A

12:15.568 --> 12:18.338
STRETCH TO CALL IT A SAFE EXOR

12:18.338 --> 12:20.740
DOOR, IT MAY BE A SAFER

12:20.740 --> 12:21.608
CORRIDOR, WHEN PROTECTED FROM

12:21.608 --> 12:22.675
THE AIR.

12:22.675 --> 12:24.310
THAT AIR POWER CAN ONLY DO SO

12:24.310 --> 12:26.613
MUCH, AND TO SAY THAT THEY WILL

12:26.613 --> 12:28.214
HAVE TOTAL SAFETY MOVING FROM

12:28.214 --> 12:30.750
THE MOUNTAIN INTO, EVIDENTLY THE

12:30.750 --> 12:32.986
KURDISH AREA OF SYRIA IS NOT

12:32.986 --> 12:34.087
SOMETHING I THINK WE CAN

12:34.087 --> 12:35.321
GUARANTEE, SAFER BUT NOT SAFE.

12:35.321 --> 12:37.991
>> AND ON THE HUMANITARIAN FRONT

12:37.991 --> 12:39.425
WE HAVE HAD SOME PARTNERS FROM

12:39.425 --> 12:41.027
EUROPE SAY THEY ARE WILLING TO

12:41.027 --> 12:42.562
HELP, ON THE MILITARY FRONT, IS

12:42.562 --> 12:45.264
THAT UNLIKELY OR THE SAME?

12:45.264 --> 12:47.467
>> I THINK VERY UNLIKELY,

12:47.467 --> 12:48.768
CERTAINLY ON THE HUMANITARIAN

12:48.768 --> 12:50.470
FRONT WE WILL GET ASSISTANCE,

12:50.470 --> 12:52.171
BUT I DON’T SEE ANYONE WILLING

12:52.171 --> 12:56.075
TO STEP UP AND HELP WITH THE

12:56.075 --> 12:57.577
JUSTIFICATION THAT WE HAVE RIGHT

12:57.577 --> 12:57.910
NOW.

12:57.910 --> 12:59.946
OUR JUSTIFICATION FOR THE AIR

12:59.946 --> 13:02.048
STRIKES IS PROTECTING AMERICAN

13:02.048 --> 13:04.517
FORCES IN BAGHDAD AND IRBIL,

13:04.517 --> 13:06.653
OTHER GOVERNMENTS MAY NOT HAVE

13:06.653 --> 13:07.754
THAT EXCUSE.

13:07.754 --> 13:09.622
>> DOUG OLLIVANT, THANKS SO

13:09.622 --> 13:09.722
MUCH.

13:09.722 --> 13:22.535
>> THANK YOU.

13:22.535 --> 13:22.835
>> Sreenivasan: NOW TO OUR

13:22.835 --> 13:23.436
SIGNATURE SEGMENT.

13:23.436 --> 13:24.637
EARLIER THIS WEEK, THE NEW

13:24.637 --> 13:25.304
JERSEY STATE SUPREME COURT

13:25.304 --> 13:26.406
WEIGHED IN ON A CONTROVERSIAL

13:26.406 --> 13:27.940
NEW TECHNIQUE IN THE FIGHT

13:27.940 --> 13:29.809
AGAINST CRIME: THE GROWING USE

13:29.809 --> 13:30.510
OF RAP LYRICS AS EVIDENCE IN

13:30.510 --> 13:32.612
CRIMINAL CASES.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.781
PROSECUTORS SAY THOSE LYRICS CAN

13:34.781 --> 13:36.382
HELP PROVE A SUSPECT’S MOTIVE OR

13:36.382 --> 13:38.151
EVEN CONTAIN A CONFESSION;

13:38.151 --> 13:39.852
CRITICS ARGUE RAP LYRICS ARE

13:39.852 --> 13:40.787
LARGELY FICTION, AND PLAYING

13:40.787 --> 13:41.721
GRAPHIC LYRICS IN COURT

13:41.721 --> 13:43.589
PREJUDICES JURIES.

13:43.589 --> 13:44.857
THE NEWSHOUR’S WILLIAM BRANGHAM

13:44.857 --> 13:46.492
HAS THE LATEST ON A TOPIC HE

13:46.492 --> 13:49.495
FIRST REPORTED ABOUT IN JUNE.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.297
>> Reporter: BACK IN 2005,

13:51.297 --> 13:53.166
OUTSIDE THIS NEW JERSEY HOUSE, A

13:53.166 --> 13:55.034
SMALL-TIME DRUG DEALER WAS SHOT

13:55.034 --> 13:55.802
MULTIPLE TIMES AND LEFT NEAR

13:55.802 --> 13:57.937
DEATH BY THE CURB.

13:57.937 --> 13:59.605
WHILE HIS STORY CHANGED A FEW

13:59.605 --> 14:01.140
TIMES, HE’D LATER TELL POLICE

14:01.140 --> 14:03.276
THAT THE MAN WHO SHOT HIM WAS

14:03.276 --> 14:05.044
THIS MAN: ASPIRING RAPPER AND

14:05.044 --> 14:05.611
FELLOW DRUG DEALER VONTE

14:05.611 --> 14:06.846
SKINNER.

14:06.846 --> 14:10.049
THOUGH SKINNER SAYS HE’S

14:10.049 --> 14:10.883
INNOCENT-- HE ADMITS HE WAS

14:10.883 --> 14:11.651
THERE THAT NIGHT BUT SAYS HE

14:11.651 --> 14:12.919
DIDN’T PULL THE TRIGGER AND

14:12.919 --> 14:14.120
DOESN’T KNOW WHO DID-- HE WAS

14:14.120 --> 14:14.654
ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH

14:14.654 --> 14:18.725
ATTEMPTED MURDER.

14:18.725 --> 14:20.993
AT HIS TRIAL, PROSECUTORS HAD 13

14:20.993 --> 14:23.596
PAGES OF SKINNER’S EXTREMELY

14:23.596 --> 14:24.597
GRAPHIC, VIOLENT RAP LYRICS READ

14:24.597 --> 14:26.432
ALOUD TO THE JURY.

14:26.432 --> 14:27.967
THEY WERE FROM NOTEBOOKS FOUND

14:27.967 --> 14:28.367
IN THE BACK OF A CAR SKINNER WAS

14:28.367 --> 14:29.869
DRIVING.

14:29.869 --> 14:30.436
HERE’S JUST A TASTE OF WHAT THE

14:30.436 --> 14:39.445
JURY HEARD:

14:39.445 --> 14:40.546
IT WENT ON LIKE THAT FOR MORE

14:40.546 --> 14:43.015
THAN 15 MINUTES.

14:43.015 --> 14:44.784
THE LYRICS DON’T MENTION

14:44.784 --> 14:46.385
ANYTHING ABOUT THE SPECIFIC

14:46.385 --> 14:50.123
SHOOTING OR THE ACTUAL VICTIM--

14:50.123 --> 14:51.591
THEY WERE, IN FACT, WRITTEN

14:51.591 --> 14:54.127
MONTHS AND YEARS BEFORE THE

14:54.127 --> 14:54.794
CRIME OCCURRED-- BUT PROSECUTORS

14:54.794 --> 14:55.728
INTRODUCED THEM AND A JUDGE

14:55.728 --> 14:56.429
ALLOWED THEM IN ORDER TO

14:56.429 --> 14:57.330
DEMONSTRATE SKINNER’S ALLEGED

14:57.330 --> 14:57.864
MOTIVE AND INTENT TO COMMIT

14:57.864 --> 15:02.769
VIOLENT ACTS.

15:02.769 --> 15:04.871
AMAR DEAN IS A PHILADELPHIA-

15:04.871 --> 15:05.204
BASED RAP PRODUCER AND VONTE

15:05.204 --> 15:07.340
SKINNER’S BROTHER.

15:07.340 --> 15:08.941
HE SAYS HE WAS IN THE COURTROOM

15:08.941 --> 15:10.209
WHEN THE LYRICS WERE READ TO THE

15:10.209 --> 15:11.911
JURY, AND, JUST BY WATCHING

15:11.911 --> 15:13.780
THEIR REACTION TO THOSE LYRICS,

15:13.780 --> 15:14.547
HE KNEW HIS BROTHER WAS GOING TO

15:14.547 --> 15:16.649
BE CONVICTED.

15:16.649 --> 15:17.650
>> WHEN THEY STARTED DOING THE

15:17.650 --> 15:17.950
LYRICS, PEOPLE STARTED FROWNING

15:17.950 --> 15:22.989
THEIR FACES.

15:22.989 --> 15:23.322
YOU KNOW, BODY LANGUAGE SPEAKS

15:23.322 --> 15:25.057
VOLUMES.

15:25.057 --> 15:26.092
A LOT OF THEIR FACES WERE IN

15:26.092 --> 15:27.794
SHOCK-- "WHOA, DID HE SAY THAT?

15:27.794 --> 15:28.795
DID HE DO THAT?"-- BUT IT HAD

15:28.795 --> 15:29.395
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CASE AT

15:29.395 --> 15:30.363
ALL.

15:30.363 --> 15:31.464
>> Reporter: SKINNER WAS FOUND

15:31.464 --> 15:33.065
GUILTY OF ATTEMPTED MURDER AND

15:33.065 --> 15:37.136
SENTENCED TO 30 YEARS IN PRISON.

15:37.136 --> 15:38.938
THIS TREND OF INTRODUCING RAP

15:38.938 --> 15:40.373
LYRICS AS EVIDENCE IN CRIMINAL

15:40.373 --> 15:40.706
PROCEEDINGS IS SPREADING

15:40.706 --> 15:43.676
NATIONWIDE.

15:43.676 --> 15:46.813
THERE ARE SOME CASES, LIKE

15:46.813 --> 15:47.680
DENNIS GREENE’S CASE, WHERE THE

15:47.680 --> 15:48.114
CONNECTION BETWEEN A RAP AND A

15:48.114 --> 15:50.216
CRIME IS CLEAR.

15:50.216 --> 15:51.384
IN 2003, GREENE BRUTALLY KILLED

15:51.384 --> 15:53.519
HIS WIFE AND THEN RAPPED

15:53.519 --> 15:53.920
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT COMMITTING

15:53.920 --> 15:55.922
THE MURDER.

15:55.922 --> 15:56.756
THE LYRICS WERE INTRODUCED AT

15:56.756 --> 15:57.490
TRIAL, AND HE WAS SENTENCED TO

15:57.490 --> 16:01.661
LIFE IN PRISON

16:01.661 --> 16:02.328
BUT OTHER CASES AREN’T AS CLEAR

16:02.328 --> 16:04.030
CUT.

16:04.030 --> 16:05.198
>> THREE SPECIFIC WORDS ARE WHAT

16:05.198 --> 16:06.299
PROSECUTORS HOPE WILL LINK

16:06.299 --> 16:09.101
TORRENCE HATCH...

16:09.101 --> 16:10.236

16:12.271 --> 16:14.140
TERRANCE HATCH-- KNOWN AS LIL

16:14.140 --> 16:14.974

16:14.974 --> 16:17.076
DEGREE MURDER.

16:17.076 --> 16:19.145
PROSECUTORS ARGUED THAT A FEW

16:19.145 --> 16:20.580
CRYPTIC WORDS OF ONE RAP SONG

16:20.580 --> 16:22.448
WERE IN FACT A CONFESSION.

16:22.448 --> 16:27.620
HATCH WAS FOUND NOT GUILTY.

16:27.620 --> 16:28.788
TO CRITICS LIKE ERIK NIELSON OF

16:28.788 --> 16:29.922
THE UNIVERSITY OF RICHMOND,

16:29.922 --> 16:30.756
PROSECUTORS SHOULD RARELY, IF

16:30.756 --> 16:31.023
EVER, USE RAP AS EVIDENCE IN

16:31.023 --> 16:33.059
COURT.

16:33.059 --> 16:35.027
NIELSON SAYS RAP IS AN ART FORM

16:35.027 --> 16:36.195
THAT INTENTIONALLY USES

16:36.195 --> 16:37.496
ELABORATE WORDPLAY AND

16:37.496 --> 16:39.765
EXAGGERATION AND BOASTING.

16:39.765 --> 16:41.067
AND YES, WHILE RAP MAY SOMETIMES

16:41.067 --> 16:43.102
CONTAIN GRAPHIC VIOLENCE,

16:43.102 --> 16:44.370
NIELSON ARGUES THAT’S A

16:44.370 --> 16:45.905
REFLECTION OF THE COMMUNITIES

16:45.905 --> 16:48.074
WHERE MANY YOUNG BLACK MEN LIVE.

16:48.074 --> 16:49.976
HE SAYS RAPPERS ARE CREATING

16:49.976 --> 16:52.278
CHARACTERS, NOT WRITING DIARIES.

16:52.278 --> 16:53.746
>> THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT

16:53.746 --> 16:56.048
DISTINCTION THAT CONSTANTLY GETS

16:56.048 --> 16:57.350
MISSED IS THAT THERE IS AN

16:57.350 --> 16:58.851
AUTHOR AND A NARRATOR.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.120
WE SEEM TO BE ABLE TO GRASP THAT

17:01.120 --> 17:03.522
CONCEPT WITH EVERY OTHER ART

17:03.522 --> 17:06.259
FORM THAT USES THE FIRST PERSON

17:06.259 --> 17:07.960
NARRATIVE, BUT RAPPERS WHO GO

17:07.960 --> 17:10.663
THE EXTRA MILE TO SIGNAL THAT

17:10.663 --> 17:11.931
THEY ARE INVENTING A NARRATOR

17:11.931 --> 17:13.866
WITH THEIR USE OF A STAGE NAME,

17:13.866 --> 17:15.234
WE STILL REVERT BACK TO THIS

17:15.234 --> 17:16.168
IDEA THAT THEY’RE THE SAME.

17:16.168 --> 17:19.038
WE CONFLATE THE TWO.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.273
>> Reporter: DAVID LABAHN, A

17:25.278 --> 17:26.879

17:26.879 --> 17:28.848
APPROPRIATE TOOL FOR LAW

17:28.848 --> 17:29.515
ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE HE SAYS

17:29.515 --> 17:30.783
THEY’RE NOT ALWAYS "MADE-UP"

17:30.783 --> 17:32.485
STORIES.

17:32.485 --> 17:33.152
>> I WOULD SAY YOU CAN’T HAVE IT

17:33.152 --> 17:35.121
BOTH WAYS.

17:35.121 --> 17:36.889
YOU CANNOT SAY THAT "I’M RAPPING

17:36.889 --> 17:38.524
ABOUT STUFF BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT

17:38.524 --> 17:41.794
I LIVE IN, THIS IS WHAT I SEE

17:41.794 --> 17:43.195
EVERY DAY" AND THEN COME INTO

17:43.195 --> 17:44.430
COURT AND SAY "EVERYTHING THAT I

17:44.430 --> 17:45.564
SAID IN THAT RAP IS COMPLETELY

17:45.564 --> 17:46.933
UNTRUE."

17:46.933 --> 17:48.334
>> Reporter: WHAT ABOUT THE

17:48.334 --> 17:51.070
ARGUMENT THAT THE CONTENT OF

17:51.070 --> 17:52.838
SOME KINDS OF RAP MUSIC IS SO

17:52.838 --> 17:54.807
VIOLENT THAT IF YOU PUT THAT IN

17:54.807 --> 17:57.009
FRONT OF A JURY, AND IF THE

17:57.009 --> 17:59.211
PROSECUTION SAYS "THIS GUY RAPS

17:59.211 --> 18:01.514
LIKE THIS, AND WE THINK HE’S

18:01.514 --> 18:03.082
GUILTY OF X," THEN THE JURY WILL

18:03.082 --> 18:05.384
BELIEVE ANYTHING?

18:05.384 --> 18:06.085
>> I DON’T THINK THAT MATCHES

18:06.085 --> 18:07.353
THE REALITY OF WHAT HAPPENS IN A

18:07.353 --> 18:08.020
COURTROOM.

18:08.020 --> 18:08.688
WE MUST GET A UNANIMOUS JURY

18:08.688 --> 18:10.056
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT, AND

18:10.056 --> 18:12.191
PLAYING A RAP IS NOT GOING TO

18:12.191 --> 18:14.293
CONVICT SOMEBODY.

18:14.293 --> 18:14.894
IF IT WAS, THEN YOU’D HAVE RAP

18:14.894 --> 18:19.498
BEING PLAYED EVERY DAY AND WE

18:19.498 --> 18:19.899
WOULDN’T EVEN NEED TO WORRY

18:24.570 --> 18:26.772
THAT THE EXTENSIVE READING OF

18:28.741 --> 18:29.942
PREJUDICE THE JURY AND MADE IT
