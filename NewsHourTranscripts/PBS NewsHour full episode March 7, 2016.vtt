HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.
Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff are
away.

00:08.275 --> 00:12.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Democrats sparred
in the troubled town of Flint,
Michigan, while

00:12.179 --> 00:16.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ted Cruz plays catchup, winning
the same amount
of states as front-runner Donald
Trump over

00:16.416 --> 00:18.218 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the weekend.

00:18.252 --> 00:21.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead, we remember Nancy
Reagan. Judy
Woodruff sat down with the
former first lady

00:21.622 --> 00:23.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in one of her last interviews.

00:23.390 --> 00:28.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY REAGAN, Former First Lady:
I think I
was a little bit more realistic
about people

00:28.729 --> 00:32.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than -- than he was. And that
was my contribution.

00:32.366 --> 00:36.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And how
security agencies
are screening the thousands of
refugees pouring

00:36.870 --> 00:38.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into Europe after the Paris
attacks.

00:38.906 --> 00:43.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BERNDT KORNER, Frontex: We are
just trying
to investigate whoever is
apprehended, whoever

00:43.911 --> 00:48.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is brought to the offices, check
them through
the databases, perform the
necessary security

00:48.515 --> 00:51.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
checks in order to prevent that
anything slips
through.

00:51.618 --> 00:54.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:54.187 --> 00:58.492 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:58.525 --> 01:10.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
presidential hopefuls
are pointing to a new round of
voting tomorrow,

01:10.938 --> 01:15.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the leaders hoping to pad
their leads,
and rivals hoping to close the
gap.

01:15.142 --> 01:18.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With that in mind, all of the
candidates were
on the road today.

01:18.211 --> 01:23.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Who is going to win North
Carolina?

01:23.350 --> 01:25.452 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AUDIENCE: Trump!

01:25.485 --> 01:27.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: Right?

01:27.287 --> 01:28.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Donald Trump
spent his day
down South, where he's won eight
states and

01:28.588 --> 01:31.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the bulk of his 384 delegates so
far.

01:31.591 --> 01:34.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Uh-oh. We have
another one.
Get him out of here.

01:34.695 --> 01:38.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Along with big
crowds, the
Republican front-runner again
faced protesters.

01:38.532 --> 01:45.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Go home to mommy.
Tell her to
tuck you in bed.

01:45.539 --> 01:50.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And he still
has to contend
with Ted Cruz as well. The Texas
senator is

01:50.377 --> 01:55.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now within 100 delegates of
Trump, after scoring
weekend wins in Kansas and in
Maine.

01:55.215 --> 01:58.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
In this race, it is clear. A
vote for any

01:58.986 --> 02:06.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other candidate, a vote for
Marco Rubio or
a vote for John Kasich is a vote
for Donald

02:06.793 --> 02:12.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump, because there is only one
who has repeatedly
beaten Donald Trump.

02:12.432 --> 02:17.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Marco Rubio
managed to win
Puerto Rico yesterday, but his
real hopes

02:17.170 --> 02:19.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now rest on his home state of
Florida next
week.

02:19.573 --> 02:21.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
We knew this would be the
roughest period

02:21.608 --> 02:24.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the campaign, given the
makeup of the electoral
map.

02:24.611 --> 02:25.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER (R),
Former Governor
of California: Welcome my very
good friend

02:25.812 --> 02:27.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Governor John Kasich!

02:27.714 --> 02:31.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Ditto John
Kasich, the Ohio
governor who hopes to fare
better in neighboring

02:31.685 --> 02:36.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michigan, one of four states
holding Republican
contests tomorrow.

02:36.156 --> 02:41.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Democrats Hillary
Clinton and Bernie
Sanders held their testiest
debate yet last

02:41.595 --> 02:46.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night. They faced off in Flint,
Michigan,
the town where lead poisoned the
drinking

02:46.133 --> 02:49.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
water, and both of them laid
into Republican
Governor Rick Snyder.

02:49.269 --> 02:51.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
He should resign.

02:51.171 --> 02:54.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I agree. The governor should
resign or be

02:54.975 --> 02:56.843 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
recalled.

02:56.877 --> 03:00.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: After that,
the pair agreed
on little else. Sanders hit
Clinton on trade.

03:00.080 --> 03:04.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Secretary
Clinton supported
virtually every one of these
disastrous trade

03:04.918 --> 03:07.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agreements written by corporate
America.

03:07.454 --> 03:11.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In turn,
Clinton played
up her support for President
Obama's auto

03:11.425 --> 03:13.160 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
rescue plan.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well, I
will tell
you something else that Senator
Sanders was

03:15.028 --> 03:22.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against. He was against the auto
bailout.
I voted to save the auto
industry.

03:22.469 --> 03:26.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:26.206 --> 03:36.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: He voted
against the
money that ended up saving the
auto industry.

03:36.483 --> 03:40.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that is a pretty big
difference.

03:40.454 --> 03:41.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Whoa. Well,
I -- if you
are talking about the Wall
Street bailout,

03:41.955 --> 03:42.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where some of your friends
destroyed this
economy...

03:42.789 --> 03:43.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: You
know...

03:44.024 --> 03:44.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: ... through
-- excuse
me, I'm talking.

03:44.991 --> 03:46.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANDERSON COOPER, CNN Anchor: Let
him respond.

03:46.760 --> 03:47.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: If
you're going to
talk, tell the whole story,
Senator Sanders.

03:47.994 --> 03:51.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Let me tell
my story.
You tell yours.

03:51.298 --> 03:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I will.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The two also
sparred on
gun control and Wall Street.
Today, Sanders

03:55.969 --> 03:58.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
charged Clinton misstated his
position on
the auto bailout.

03:58.905 --> 04:05.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: I voted for
that bailout
and support of the workers in
the automobile

04:05.479 --> 04:06.012 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
industry.

04:06.046 --> 04:07.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

04:07.981 --> 04:11.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Clinton also
stayed in Michigan,
appearing to strike a
conciliatory stance

04:11.151 --> 04:12.886 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Grand Rapids.

04:12.919 --> 04:16.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I would
hope to be
able to enlist Bernie in helping
me to reach

04:16.356 --> 04:19.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out to his supporters if I am so
fortunate
enough to be the nominee.

04:19.826 --> 04:23.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Clinton won
one state to
Sanders' three over the weekend,
but she's

04:23.563 --> 04:29.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still well ahead in delegates,
with 1,130,
nearly half of what's needed.
Democrats hold

04:29.536 --> 04:31.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
contests tomorrow in Michigan
and Mississippi.

04:31.872 --> 04:36.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And late today, former New York
City Mayor
Michael Bloomberg said he will
not run for

04:36.576 --> 04:40.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president after all. He told The
New York
Times that he fears a three-way
race would

04:40.647 --> 04:44.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
guarantee Donald Trump's
election.

04:44.151 --> 04:48.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the day's other news,
tributes poured in
today for former first lady
Nancy Reagan,

04:48.555 --> 04:53.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after her death Sunday in Los
Angeles. President
Obama ordered flags flown at
half-staff, and,

04:53.493 --> 04:56.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at a meeting, he took a moment
to offer praise.

04:56.229 --> 04:58.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
As somebody who has been lucky
enough to have

04:58.765 --> 05:07.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an extraordinary partner in my
life as well,
I know how much she meant, not
just to President

05:07.707 --> 05:16.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reagan, but to the country as a
whole. He
was lucky to have her. And I'm
sure he'd be

05:16.650 --> 05:18.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the first to acknowledge that.
So, she will
be missed.

05:18.752 --> 05:22.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mrs. Reagan
will lie in
repose on Wednesday at the
Reagan Presidential

05:22.522 --> 05:27.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Library in Simi Valley,
California. The funeral
will be Friday. We will have
more on Nancy

05:27.160 --> 05:30.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Reagan, in her own words, later
in the program.

05:30.397 --> 05:35.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The news of Mrs. Reagan's death
came as former
President Jimmy Carter announced
he no longer

05:35.168 --> 05:41.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
needs treatment for cancer. He
said his latest
MRI showed no signs of melanoma
that had spread

05:41.274 --> 05:46.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to his brain at one point. The
former president
is 91. He's been on a newly
approved drug

05:46.479 --> 05:49.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that helps the body target
cancer cells.

05:49.583 --> 05:53.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Pentagon now says a U.S.
drone strike
killed more than 150 Islamist
militants in

05:53.687 --> 05:58.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Somalia. Saturday's attack hit a
training
camp for Al-Shabaab fighters,
about 120 miles

05:58.925 --> 06:04.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
north of Mogadishu. A U.S.
military spokesman
says they were getting ready to
launch a large-scale

06:04.664 --> 06:06.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
operation.

06:06.466 --> 06:10.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Heavy fighting broke out today
along Tunisia's
frontier with Libya, when dozens
of gunmen

06:10.737 --> 06:17.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
stormed a border town.
Authorities reported
53 dead in Ben Gardane near
beach towns popular

06:17.911 --> 06:22.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with tourists. Battles raged
into the night
before the army regained
control. Tunisia's

06:22.182 --> 06:26.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president said it was the work
of Islamic
State extremists out of Libya.

06:26.253 --> 06:30.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEJI CAID ESSEBSI, President of
Tunisia (through
translator): This is an
unprecedented attack,

06:30.890 --> 06:35.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
planned and organized, and whose
goal was
probably to take control of this
area and

06:35.495 --> 06:37.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to announce a new emirate.

06:37.430 --> 06:41.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Extremist
attacks in Tunisia
killed dozens of tourists last
year.

06:41.735 --> 06:45.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in Pakistan, a suicide
bomber killed
11 people and wounded 15 in the
northwest

06:45.972 --> 06:51.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
town of Shabqadar. The bomber
blew himself
up after guards stopped him from
entering

06:51.411 --> 06:56.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a court. A Pakistani Taliban
group said it
was revenge for the execution of
a man who

06:56.516 --> 06:58.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
killed a provincial governor.

06:58.852 --> 07:03.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
European leaders convened in
Brussels today,
searching for a way to shut off
the flow of

07:03.423 --> 07:08.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
migrants. As they did, hundreds
more kept
arriving in Greece, but they're
now blocked

07:08.295 --> 07:10.497 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from advancing any farther.

07:10.530 --> 07:12.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
James Mates of independent news
reports from
Brussels

07:12.766 --> 07:18.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATES: They came to Europe
in search
of safety and a better life.
What they found

07:18.805 --> 07:25.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a tent city on a bleak
hillside, with hostility
and razor-wire fences now
springing up across

07:25.278 --> 07:29.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a continent that they believed
was the promised
land.

07:29.215 --> 07:34.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as they shiver on Greece's
northern border,
the continent's leaders are
meeting 1,500

07:34.654 --> 07:39.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
miles away, in turn threatening
and haggling
over how to stop anymore from
coming.

07:39.826 --> 07:43.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA MERKEL, German Chancellor
(through
translator): I just want to
respond to how

07:43.063 --> 07:48.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we can reduce migrants for not
only a few
countries, but for all
countries, including

07:48.101 --> 07:53.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Greece. It can't just be about
closing something.
We need to find a sustainable
solution together

07:53.440 --> 07:58.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Turkey, as well as putting
an end to
illegal immigration and
improving the living

07:58.478 --> 08:00.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
conditions of the refugees.

08:00.447 --> 08:05.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATES: It is this man who
appears to
now hold the keys to Europe, the
prime minister

08:05.285 --> 08:11.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Turkey, who can stop migrants
coming or
can agree to take them back, but
at a price,

08:11.891 --> 08:15.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
six billion euros and a promise
his country
can soon join the E.U.

08:15.929 --> 08:19.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AHMET DAVUTOGLU, Turkish Prime
Minister: And
Turkey is ready to work with the
E.U. Turkey

08:19.065 --> 08:27.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is ready to be a member of the
E.U. as well.
And, today, I hope this summit,
which we will

08:27.207 --> 08:32.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not focus on the irregular
migration, but
also Turkey's accession process
to E.U.

08:32.479 --> 08:38.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATES: But these were the
scenes just
this weekend in Istanbul after
an opposition

08:38.118 --> 08:43.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
newspaper was shut down by an
increasingly
authoritarian government.
Without the bargaining

08:43.990 --> 08:49.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chip of refugees, Turkey would
be nowhere
near E.U. membership.

08:49.562 --> 08:54.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But here they are today seated
around the
E.U.'s top table, the Turkish
flag on the

08:54.401 --> 08:58.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wall, an ever-growing list of
demands being
presented, knowing that, for as
long as the

08:58.738 --> 09:02.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
refugees keep coming, they hold
the whip hand.

09:02.175 --> 09:06.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Late today,
Hungary said
it will veto any plan to
resettle asylum-seekers

09:06.813 --> 09:08.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
directly from Turkey.

09:08.782 --> 09:12.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, the
average bonus on
Wall Street fell 9 percent last
year, to just

09:12.419 --> 09:18.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over $146,000. The New York
Comptroller's
Office says it's because profits
in the securities

09:18.224 --> 09:23.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
industry were down sharply, and
bonuses are
tied to those profits. Overall
compensation

09:23.329 --> 09:28.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for Wall Street workers,
including salary,
actually rose 14 percent. It's
now nearly

09:28.301 --> 09:31.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
$405,000, a record.

09:31.237 --> 09:35.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Wall Street today, the Dow
Jones industrial
average gained 67 points to
close at 17074.

09:36.009 --> 09:41.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell eight points,
and the S&amp;P
500 added a little less than two
points.

09:41.948 --> 09:46.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
our Politics
Monday duo on the increasingly
controversial

09:46.219 --> 09:51.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
race for the White House;
remembrances of
a first lady, the legacy of the
late Nancy

09:51.558 --> 10:01.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reagan; European leaders seeking
a new solution
to the migrant crisis; and much
more.

10:01.601 --> 10:09.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reagan; European leaders seeking
a new solution
to the migrant crisis; and much
more.

10:09.509 --> 10:13.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From a tough Democratic debate
in Flint, and
strong showing by Ted Cruz in
weekend voting,

10:13.680 --> 10:17.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's a perfect time for Politics
Monday, with
Tamara Keith of NPR and Amy
Walter of The

10:17.917 --> 10:19.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Cook Political Report.

10:19.752 --> 10:23.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I happened to do a little
program on the
weekend. There was some
politics. There was

10:23.623 --> 10:25.391 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
some news.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's start with the debate last
night. This
was probably the first time I
have really

10:27.427 --> 10:31.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seen Bernie Sanders and Hillary
Clinton go
at each other as directly.

10:31.164 --> 10:34.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Yes,
it was an intense debate. They
came armed

10:34.267 --> 10:36.069 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and ready.

10:36.102 --> 10:40.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders is -- he has a
lot at stake.
There is a primary in Michigan
on Tuesday,

10:40.406 --> 10:45.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and if he can't win and win big,
he's going
to have a tough time. And so he
came ready

10:45.712 --> 10:52.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to hit Hillary Clinton hard on
trade. He believes
that that's a really strong area
for him,

10:52.185 --> 10:57.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because she supported trade
deals when her
husband was president. And those
trade deals,

10:57.590 --> 10:59.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he says, led to the loss of
jobs.

10:59.492 --> 11:05.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, she was ready, too, and
she came ready
to hit him on the auto bailout.
She had sort

11:05.765 --> 11:11.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a narrow argument, but
basically said he
voted against the bailout bills
that included

11:11.571 --> 11:17.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a bailout for the auto industry.
Bernie Sanders
takes issue with it. But it led
to some fireworks,

11:17.777 --> 11:23.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it led to Sanders -- during
the debate,
Clinton interrupted him, and he
said, wait,

11:23.316 --> 11:25.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
no, I have got to finish.

11:25.718 --> 11:29.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that happened a couple of
times, and Twitter
blew up over it.

11:29.789 --> 11:31.424 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right.

11:31.457 --> 11:36.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, Amy, besides trying to
score points
on social media and correct each
other on

11:36.396 --> 11:41.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what actually happened on social
media, they're
trying to court blue-collar
workers in places

11:41.734 --> 11:46.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Rust Belt. They're also
trying to go
after African-American votes.
Are they effective

11:46.105 --> 11:47.340 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about this?

11:47.373 --> 11:49.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Well,
it's funny.

11:49.108 --> 11:52.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Compared to the Republican
debates, which
you have no idea what's going to
happen any

11:52.912 --> 11:56.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time you tune in, the Democratic
debates have
become somewhat predictable. We
know which

11:56.583 --> 12:01.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lines each candidate is going to
use. Hillary
Clinton is going to go after
Bernie Sanders

12:01.421 --> 12:05.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on guns. Yes, it was a little
different that
she went after him on the auto
bailout.

12:05.224 --> 12:08.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders is going to talk
about Wall
Street and attack her from the
left on those

12:08.795 --> 12:14.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issues. And the results in state
after state
are somewhat predictable, too,
Bernie Sanders

12:14.567 --> 12:19.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doing well among white voters,
doing well
among independent voters, not as
well as among

12:19.872 --> 12:22.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
African-Americans, not as well
as among Democrats.

12:22.542 --> 12:27.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're seeing that. The
latest poll out
of Michigan shows the same lines
being drawn.

12:27.280 --> 12:31.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I would be very surprised if
Bernie Sanders
was able to do well in Michigan,
and if he

12:32.018 --> 12:38.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
does lose, it will be for the
same reasons
that he's been unsuccessful in
states going

12:38.825 --> 12:41.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- well, pretty much every
state, except for
New Hampshire.

12:41.961 --> 12:48.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Let's talk a
little bit
about this notion that Ted Cruz
has made a

12:48.234 --> 12:50.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
surge over this last weekend.

12:50.637 --> 12:54.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He picked up two states. Donald
Trump had
two states. Not all states are
created equal.

12:54.540 --> 13:00.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not all voting processes are the
same, right?
But is this the Republican
establishment pushing

13:00.113 --> 13:05.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back against Donald Trump in any
sort of concerted
manner? And there is also some
question on,

13:05.852 --> 13:11.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is Ted Cruz the counterweight
for those Republicans
who are on the sideline right
now?

13:11.491 --> 13:15.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You would be
hard-pressed to
say that the Republican
establishment is rooting

13:15.395 --> 13:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz is not a
friend of
the Republican establishment.

13:21.234 --> 13:26.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what does appear to have
maybe happened,
and we will know more after more
voting has

13:26.639 --> 13:33.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happened, is that Donald Trump's
momentum,
Donald Trump's, like, there is
no way anybody

13:33.079 --> 13:36.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is ever going to be able to stop
him kind
of momentum has possibly slowed.

13:37.016 --> 13:44.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, really, we need some more
data points,
and especially with Donald
Trump, the landscape

13:44.157 --> 13:47.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is littered with people who have
made predictions
about Donald Trump slowing down.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Including some
people sitting
here.

13:49.629 --> 13:50.430 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

13:50.463 --> 13:52.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: So, I will take
that.

13:52.298 --> 13:54.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have had a lot of the
theories about this
race. We have had a lot of the
theories. There

13:54.500 --> 13:58.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was the Marco Rubio theory, that
he was the
one who are going to be able to
stop Donald

13:58.905 --> 14:00.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump, and he had a terrible
weekend.

14:00.673 --> 14:04.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Actually, it started as the Ted
Cruz theory
from -- in the beginning because
of the way

14:04.343 --> 14:08.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the calendar was situated. Those
Southern
states were supposed to help Ted
Cruz. South

14:08.848 --> 14:12.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carolina was going to be his
launching pad.
That didn't work. We have had a
lot of theories.

14:12.719 --> 14:16.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They haven't really come true.
Michigan is
going to be important, not just
for Bernie

14:16.389 --> 14:21.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders and Hillary Clinton, but
also to see
if somebody can stop Trump in a
state like

14:21.494 --> 14:23.229 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

14:23.262 --> 14:28.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The warning, though, is, the
establishment
candidate in 2012, Mitt Romney,
barely won

14:28.267 --> 14:33.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michigan. Rick Santorum came up
very close,
Rick Santorum running as a
populist that year.

14:33.806 --> 14:38.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think we're going to see a
very being
challenge going forward.

14:38.745 --> 14:43.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, Donald Trump has momentum
right now.
He doesn't have all the
delegates that he

14:43.282 --> 14:46.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
needs, but the stronger he
looks, the harder
it is to beat him.

14:46.819 --> 14:50.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There is also
this tension
that is playing out of the
parties vs. the

14:50.556 --> 14:53.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people. And it's on both sides
and it's kind
of inverted. Right?

14:53.426 --> 14:57.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Democratic side, you see
supporters
of Bernie Sanders saying, what's
all this

14:57.630 --> 15:02.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
business with superdelegates? We
have this
popular candidate and really he
should be

15:02.769 --> 15:06.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the one that is in the lead
right now, not
Hillary. On the other side, you
have got talk

15:06.873 --> 15:13.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the possibility of the
Republican Party
maybe adjusting the rules a bit
that could

15:13.780 --> 15:16.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
increase the chances for a rival
of Donald
Trump. Right?

15:16.149 --> 15:21.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there is this idea from both
sides that
maybe the parties don't
represent us in the

15:21.521 --> 15:23.289 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
process.

15:23.322 --> 15:27.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And let's just say
that if the
Republican Party were to step in
and somehow

15:27.894 --> 15:33.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
magically make an establishment
candidate
come out, or if superdelegates
decided the

15:33.533 --> 15:37.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
race on the Democratic side,
people would
go nuts.

15:37.703 --> 15:43.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This election is all about the
anti-establishment.
It's all about telling party
elites that they

15:43.309 --> 15:50.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
haven't been listening. And so
it wouldn't
be pretty for either party if
that happened.

15:50.116 --> 15:55.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the superdelegates with
Bernie Sanders,
we have to note that he is also
trailing in

15:55.555 --> 16:01.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
pledged delegates. The
superdelegates, he's
way behind, but if you throw out
the superdelegates

16:01.360 --> 16:06.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and just look at the pledged
delegates, he's
down by almost 200 delegates.

16:06.766 --> 16:11.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Delegates are awarded
proportionally on the
Democrat side, which means you
get roughly

16:11.204 --> 16:18.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a percentage based on the
percentage you get
in the polls. And as a result of
that, it

16:18.411 --> 16:21.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will be very hard for him to
make that up.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.882 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

16:22.915 --> 16:28.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No, he's done very well in
caucus states and
in states that are more
homogeneous. Again,

16:28.221 --> 16:32.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
breaking out of that mold is
going to be very
important for him, and thus far
we haven't

16:32.892 --> 16:34.560 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
seen it.

16:34.594 --> 16:38.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Republican side, this is
frustrating
to many in the Republican Party,
the idea

16:38.898 --> 16:45.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Donald Trump could be their
nominee.
But to thwart the process by
changing rules

16:45.404 --> 16:51.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and trying to come at the last
minute during
the convention with literally a
change in

16:51.377 --> 16:57.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the rules that says you don't
need to get
X-number of states in order to
get the nomination,

16:57.383 --> 16:59.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think, would cause way too
much havoc.

16:59.785 --> 17:06.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, there is enough stress
right now among
Republicans that if they do
disassociate or

17:06.492 --> 17:11.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
distance themselves from Trump,
that his supporters,
his voters are going to go away,
they are

17:11.197 --> 17:15.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to lose that energy and
enthusiasm.
Balancing those things, people
who dislike

17:15.902 --> 17:20.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump immensely with the ones
who are turning
out in rallies for him has been
something

17:20.072 --> 17:23.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the Republicans have
struggled with,
they will continue to struggle
witness.

17:23.476 --> 17:27.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As I have said before, I think
this is a tipping
point for the Republican Party,
who they're

17:27.280 --> 17:30.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
going to be, what their
standard-bearer is
going to look like, who is going
to line up

17:30.816 --> 17:34.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
behind Donald Trump, who is
going to be opposed
to him. It is going to be messy
for a very

17:34.887 --> 17:38.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
long time, and I don't think
that the nomination
fight is going to make it any
easier.

17:38.925 --> 17:41.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Amy
Walter of
The Cook Political Report,
Tamara Keith of

17:41.928 --> 17:43.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NPR, thanks so much.

17:43.362 --> 17:47.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Thank you.

17:47.733 --> 17:52.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

17:52.138 --> 17:58.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now we
remember a first
lady who kept a high profile and
was an influential

17:58.945 --> 18:00.813 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
force.

18:00.846 --> 18:05.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nancy Reagan long said her sole
mission was
to back her Ronnie, and
strengthen his presidency.

18:05.918 --> 18:11.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In one of her last interviews,
she spoke to
Judy Woodruff for a 2011 PBS
documentary.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She discussed her role balancing
out her husband.

18:13.926 --> 18:19.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY REAGAN, Former First Lady:
I think I
was a little bit more realistic
about people

18:19.131 --> 18:25.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than -- than he was. And that
was my contribution.

18:25.137 --> 18:32.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was just being aware of
people and what
they were doing.

18:32.078 --> 18:36.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you think that
you were
more intuitive, that you could
read people

18:36.716 --> 18:38.617 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
better than your husband could?

18:38.651 --> 18:41.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NANCY REAGAN: Sometimes, yes.

18:41.754 --> 18:46.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Just three
months into the
presidency, the assassination
attempt on President

18:46.325 --> 18:49.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reagan shook the fiercely
protective first
lady.

18:49.362 --> 18:55.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY REAGAN: My Secret Service
guy said,
"There's been a shooting, but
don't worry.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The president is all right."

18:57.770 --> 19:08.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, I'm starting for the
elevator and they
said, "But he's all right. He
hasn't been

19:08.681 --> 19:10.016 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hit."

19:10.049 --> 19:15.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I say to them, "You either
find me or
a car, or I will walk."

19:15.788 --> 19:19.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As you said, they
didn't know
at first he had been hit. And
even when they

19:19.959 --> 19:23.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
knew he had been hit, they
couldn't find the
bullet. Isn't that right?

19:23.262 --> 19:29.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY REAGAN: Yes, they -- no,
they couldn't.
The bullet had lodged so close
to his heart,

19:29.668 --> 19:34.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it was just a miracle that it
didn't go into
his heart.

19:34.573 --> 19:40.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I remember one nurse came to me
and said,
"We may just have to leave it in
there." Well,

19:40.279 --> 19:45.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that didn't sound like a very
good idea to
me. But they finally got it, but
the whole

19:45.918 --> 19:49.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thing was a miracle.

19:49.188 --> 19:55.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You have
commented a number
of times that that had a huge
effect on you

19:55.094 --> 19:58.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and it changed you in some ways.

19:58.464 --> 20:06.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY REAGAN: Oh, yes, of course
it did. Every
time he went out the door, I
don't think I

20:06.906 --> 20:09.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
took a deep breath until he got
back.

20:09.041 --> 20:13.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Nancy Reagan
also served
as a political partner. She
influenced and

20:13.446 --> 20:18.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supported her husband's policy
towards the
Soviet Union, including some of
his most famous

20:18.350 --> 20:20.219 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
words.

20:20.252 --> 20:24.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY REAGAN: When he gave the
speech, "Tear
down this wall," there were
many, many people

20:24.957 --> 20:28.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the administration who didn't
think that
he should say that.

20:28.494 --> 20:34.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It must have been
impossible
for you to just kind of sit back
and watch

20:34.900 --> 20:36.502 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all that happen.

20:36.535 --> 20:42.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY REAGAN: Well, I didn't
just sit back.
You know, I was talking to
people.

20:42.108 --> 20:47.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Because you felt
that this
was something that was going to
be part of

20:47.613 --> 20:49.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
your husband's legacy as
president.

20:49.782 --> 20:52.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NANCY REAGAN: Well, he believed
in it strongly,
as did I.

20:52.718 --> 20:56.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Years later,
President Reagan
developed Alzheimer's, and the
first lady

20:56.722 --> 21:00.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
became his primary caregiver,
until his death
in 2004.

21:00.426 --> 21:05.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Did you feel you
had the chance
to say goodbye to him?

21:05.364 --> 21:15.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY REAGAN: Yes. As a matter
of fact, he
gave me a wonderful gift at that
time. He

21:15.141 --> 21:18.110 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was in bed.

21:18.144 --> 21:31.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, suddenly, he turned his
hand and opened
his eyes and looked at me. And
then he closed

21:31.090 --> 21:36.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his eyes and went. And that was
a wonderful
gift.

21:36.162 --> 21:41.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We take a
closer look at
the remarkable life of Nancy
Reagan with James

21:41.967 --> 21:45.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rosebush, who served in a
variety of roles
at the Reagan White House,
including chief

21:46.005 --> 21:50.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of staff to the first lady, and
presidential
historian and "NewsHour" regular
Michael Beschloss.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
James, I want to start with you.

21:52.511 --> 21:57.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You saw the first lady in a way
that most
of us could never imagine.
That's really starting

21:57.416 --> 22:02.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at 7:00 a.m. And you have said
before that
she's done more work before 7:00
in the morning

22:02.121 --> 22:03.656 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than you expected anyone to.

22:03.689 --> 22:05.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
®MD-BO /JAMES ROSEBUSH, Former
Nancy Reagan
Chief of Staff: That's right.

22:05.491 --> 22:08.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By the time I got to the office
and went to
the senior staff meeting, she'd
read all the

22:08.227 --> 22:12.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
morning papers, she had seen all
the morning
shows, she had the advanced
copies of the

22:12.231 --> 22:15.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
newsweeklies, and she knew
exactly what she
thought.

22:15.901 --> 22:20.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So she was a highly intelligent
woman. I think
that was lost on a lot of
people. They didn't

22:20.406 --> 22:27.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recognize that. And she was
engaged not only
in her own program and schedule,
but very

22:27.279 --> 22:33.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
observant of what the president
was doing.
And she was a person who,
therefore, was easy

22:33.852 --> 22:38.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to work for, because she knew
what she wanted
and she communicated it well.

22:38.257 --> 22:43.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it was obviously an
extraordinary honor
to work for her, to work for
both of them.

22:43.963 --> 22:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Michael, what
he's describing
is almost what you would expect
from a chief

22:48.234 --> 22:51.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of staff, not necessarily just a
first lady.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS, Presidential
Historian:
That's what I have always
thought.

22:53.639 --> 22:57.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You might have, for instance,
Hillary Clinton,
who at the beginning of her
husband's administration

22:57.376 --> 23:03.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was given this health care
project, but Nancy
Reagan without any title other
than first

23:03.649 --> 23:08.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lady really was sort of an
alternative chief
of staff, because she roamed the
whole lot

23:08.988 --> 23:13.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and also particularly kept an
guy on who in
the entourage was helping her
husband and

23:13.892 --> 23:15.527 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who wasn't.

23:15.561 --> 23:19.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it worked well in the first
term, when
Jim Baker was chief of staff. He
saw that

23:19.198 --> 23:24.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as an asset to be able to tap
her skills and
expertise and, you know, what
she could tell

23:24.703 --> 23:29.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him about what the president
wanted and didn't
want. Didn't work so well second
term, when

23:29.408 --> 23:34.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there was a chief of staff named
Don Regan,
who had a very exalted idea of
his own place

23:34.346 --> 23:38.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the universe, finally hung up
on the first
lady after they had words.

23:38.884 --> 23:40.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He did not last for long.

23:40.719 --> 23:42.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

23:42.521 --> 23:47.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
James, how -- paint us a
picture, if you can,
of what sort of power or
influence she held.

23:47.526 --> 23:52.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she made sure that she
stayed out of policy
decisions, but when it came to
personnel,

23:52.231 --> 23:57.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ultimately, she, I guess, is the
last word
that influences the president's
ear.

23:57.469 --> 24:01.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES ROSEBUSH: I also want to
quickly add,
though, that she was acutely
aware of the

24:01.674 --> 24:06.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fact that she wasn't elected,
she wasn't an
employee of the federal
government, and she

24:06.645 --> 24:13.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't enjoy the recognition of
an official
position in the federal
government.

24:13.485 --> 24:18.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So there were times, for
example, when I was
lobbied to have Nancy Reagan
come up to Capitol

24:18.457 --> 24:26.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hill and to testify on issues
related to her
programs, in particular trying
to arrest the

24:26.865 --> 24:33.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
advance of youthful drug abuse
and the ravages
that that causes in individual
lives.

24:33.138 --> 24:37.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they were genuine requests:
Come up and
tell us about what you're doing,
what we should

24:37.176 --> 24:43.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be doing on Capitol Hill. I was
all for that.
She was completely against it,
which shows

24:43.215 --> 24:50.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you what I knew. She didn't want
to appear
in any way to be influencing
policy or government

24:50.923 --> 24:52.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
spending in any way.

24:52.858 --> 25:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in terms of her impact on
what her husband's
policies were, I would say she
was observant,

25:01.133 --> 25:05.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but she wasn't a participant,
she wasn't a
direct participant.

25:05.204 --> 25:10.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: And always
when she was
first lady and afterwards wanted
this idea

25:10.743 --> 25:16.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of her as sort of the eminence
grise, she
didn't want people to think
that.

25:16.215 --> 25:21.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I knew her a tiny bit in later
years. And
I once talked to her about that.
And she said:

25:21.086 --> 25:25.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"It was all Ronnie. Don't pay
attention to
me. I really didn't have a large
role in that

25:25.991 --> 25:27.726 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration."

25:27.760 --> 25:30.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I knew at the time that that
wasn't quite
true. I think, as time goes on,
we will find

25:30.963 --> 25:32.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that her role was very large.

25:32.765 --> 25:36.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: When you think
about, Michael,
in historical contact, the
previous two or

25:36.602 --> 25:41.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
three first ladies before her
and what kind
of a departure that was, maybe
even the tone

25:41.140 --> 25:42.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that it set for the country, it
was different.

25:42.975 --> 25:46.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: It was,
although Rosalynn
Carter had attended Cabinet
meetings, got

25:46.712 --> 25:51.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of flak for that. Nancy
Reagan wouldn't
have dreamt of doing that.

25:51.350 --> 25:55.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when you think about it,
Hari, in the
1980s, Nancy Reagan was
criticized in many

25:55.954 --> 26:03.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
circles for being overly adoring
and uncritical
of her husband and also for
acting as his

26:03.695 --> 26:06.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
political partner, especially on
key occasions.

26:06.965 --> 26:11.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nowadays, I think things have
changed enough
that we would celebrate her for
doing most

26:11.603 --> 26:16.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those things. And it is amazing
to look back
and think that those were two of
the things

26:16.809 --> 26:18.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
she caught the most flak for.

26:18.644 --> 26:21.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: James, when
you worked with
her, what did you think her
legacy was going

26:21.513 --> 26:25.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be, vs. now, decades later,
knowing what
she's accomplished?

26:25.417 --> 26:27.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES ROSEBUSH: Yes, it's
interesting.

26:27.186 --> 26:31.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The whole concept of legacy is
interesting,
and I will comment on that. But
to pick up

26:31.323 --> 26:37.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on something Michael brought up,
I think that
one thing that's lost on the
public is that

26:37.129 --> 26:46.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people go through these extreme
situations,
these high -- I would say
high-wattage leadership

26:46.605 --> 26:50.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
positions, particularly in
American politics.

26:50.108 --> 26:55.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They evolve over time. They
change. They develop.
Hopefully, they deepen as a
result of the

26:55.747 --> 27:00.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
experiences they go through. And
Nancy Reagan
wasn't immune to that. I saw her
grow as a

27:00.919 --> 27:03.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
person. I saw her develop
additional skills.

27:03.622 --> 27:09.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I remember among the things
that she did
as a first among first ladies
was to speak

27:09.528 --> 27:14.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the General Assembly of the
United Nations
on the issue drugs. And I
remember, when she

27:14.233 --> 27:21.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
went to New York to do that
talk, she was
asked about this very issue.
What was she

27:21.373 --> 27:23.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really doing? Was she having an
impact on
policy?

27:23.642 --> 27:28.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she said, "Well, do you
expect me to sit
at home sorting out my husband's
sock drawer?"

27:28.747 --> 27:29.715 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

27:29.748 --> 27:33.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES ROSEBUSH: And that drew a
lot of laughter.

27:33.051 --> 27:39.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she grew in her role. I
think she grew
in her confidence. She grew in
understanding

27:39.091 --> 27:45.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the issues, and naturally. She
was well-educated
and she was a very bright
person. And she

27:45.330 --> 27:50.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't -- I think at that point
she probably
came into her own with a higher
degree of

27:50.035 --> 27:52.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
confidence that, yes, she did
have something
to say.

27:52.971 --> 27:57.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think she has a dual
legacy and I think
it's interesting. She has -- and
she gets

27:57.442 --> 28:02.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a lot of credit for and
sympathy, particularly
in the later years, of taking
care of her

28:02.714 --> 28:07.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
husband, and which she did
throughout their
marriage, but in an official
capacity, and

28:07.586 --> 28:10.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then during the 10 years of his
disability.

28:10.322 --> 28:17.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I would like to think that
she will also
get credit for being an
intelligent, independent

28:17.563 --> 28:23.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
woman, leader who was devoted to
her country
and worked hard to promote the
American ideal

28:23.235 --> 28:25.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as best she could on her own as
well.

28:25.904 --> 28:27.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Michael, a
legacy for her?

28:27.739 --> 28:31.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: I think she
made it possible
for Ronald Reagan to become
president and

28:31.209 --> 28:33.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to become a major president.

28:33.779 --> 28:38.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had many qualities. One of
them wasn't
an ability to see through people
who might

28:38.083 --> 28:43.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do him harm or not serve him
well. Nancy Reagan
did that so well. And the other
thing is that

28:43.255 --> 28:45.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
she wasn't ideological.

28:45.123 --> 28:49.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe the biggest thing she did
during that
presidency was, in the middle
1980s, she went

28:49.895 --> 28:55.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to her husband and said, too
many people think
you're being too energetic in
pursuing the

28:55.734 --> 28:58.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cold War. Show them that you're
a peacemaker.

28:58.270 --> 29:03.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he began with symbolism,
finally wound
up working with Gorbachev to do
a lot to end

29:03.375 --> 29:09.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Cold War. That began with
her. Her big
goal was always, how can I help
my husband,

29:09.881 --> 29:12.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not, how can I pursue an
ideological agenda?

29:12.084 --> 29:17.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Michael Beschloss,
James Rosebush, thanks so much.

29:17.589 --> 29:30.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES ROSEBUSH: Pleasure, Hari.

29:30.369 --> 29:37.409 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

29:37.442 --> 29:42.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
true story
of a modern-day Romeo and Juliet
set in rural

29:42.214 --> 29:44.016 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Afghanistan.

29:44.049 --> 29:48.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, as we reported
earlier, European
leaders met today on the refugee
crisis. One

29:48.387 --> 29:54.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
major ongoing issue, how to
screen such a
huge volume of people for a
small number of

29:54.126 --> 29:55.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
possible terrorists.

29:55.961 --> 30:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant tells
us now, it's not an easy job.

30:00.799 --> 30:10.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Here is a
genuinely innocent
and uplifting scene from
Europe's refugees

30:10.542 --> 30:11.476 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
crisis.

30:11.510 --> 30:13.211 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(SINGING)

30:13.245 --> 30:19.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Jerome Kaluta
from Congo
is providing a few moments' joy
for Afghan

30:19.051 --> 30:26.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children stranded in Greece
after Macedonia
sealed the migrant trail at the
border.

30:26.391 --> 30:30.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what worries Europe's
military, intelligence
and police agencies are the
large numbers

30:30.996 --> 30:36.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of fit young men entering the
E.U. Many threw
away their documents on the
instructions of

30:36.234 --> 30:41.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
smugglers and so the authorities
often have
no idea who they really are.

30:41.740 --> 30:46.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATO's supreme commander in
Europe, U.S. Air
Force General Philip Breedlove,
left the Senate

30:46.244 --> 30:50.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Armed Services Committee in no
doubt about
his fears in testimony last
week.

30:50.716 --> 30:55.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEN. PHILIP BREEDLOVE, NATO
Supreme Allied
Commander: Europe faces mass
migration spurred

30:55.220 --> 31:02.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by state instability and state
collapse and
masking the movements of
criminals, terrorists

31:02.928 --> 31:09.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and foreign fighters. Within
this mix, ISIL,
or Da'esh, is spreading like a
cancer, taking

31:09.501 --> 31:16.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
advantage of paths of least
resistance, threatening
European nations and our own
with terrorist

31:16.775 --> 31:18.510 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
attacks.

31:18.543 --> 31:21.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This is Athens'
Victoria
Square, where hundreds of
refugees congregate

31:21.113 --> 31:26.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every day, as they realized
their preferred
destinations in Northern Europe
are no longer

31:26.218 --> 31:27.953 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
attainable.

31:27.986 --> 31:32.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Human rights activists worry
that Europe's
humanitarian response is being
endangered

31:32.090 --> 31:33.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by what they regard as
scare-mongering.

31:33.959 --> 31:39.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
George Kosmopoulos of Amnesty
International
is disturbed that the refugee
crisis and the

31:39.364 --> 31:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
perceived terrorist threat are
being conflated.

31:41.867 --> 31:44.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE KOSMOPOULOS, Director,
Amnesty International
Greece: The way we see it, these
people are

31:44.069 --> 31:48.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
genuine refugees. And what
they're fleeing
for is actually terror and very,
very great

31:48.940 --> 31:53.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
human rights violations. They're
leaving behind
war. They're leaving behind
destruction. And

31:53.879 --> 31:58.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is the lens we should
apply, and not
put the blame to a whole group
of people who

31:58.116 --> 32:01.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are simply looking for safety
and a better
future in Europe.

32:01.119 --> 32:05.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: General
Breedlove's comments
are at odds with the analysis of
senior E.U.

32:05.423 --> 32:10.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officials. They believe that
he's exaggerated.
But, recently, Rob Wainwright,
who is the

32:10.195 --> 32:14.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
director of Europol, the
European politics
agency, said that he believed
that there were

32:14.232 --> 32:20.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as many as 5,000 I.S.-trained
jihadis wandering
free in Europe with the
intention of causing

32:20.305 --> 32:23.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mass casualties amongst the
civilian population.

32:23.508 --> 32:27.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Wainwright added, however,
that he didn't
think that there was any
concrete evidence

32:27.312 --> 32:34.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to suggest that terrorists were
using the
migration flow as cover to
infiltrate Europe.

32:34.920 --> 32:39.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Mary Bossi, one of Greece's
leading terrorism
experts, believes that European
officials

32:39.524 --> 32:42.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are downplaying the potential
threat from
I.S.

32:42.761 --> 32:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY BOSSI, Terrorism Expert: It
comes to
the number of 30,000 foreign
fighters into

32:48.166 --> 32:54.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the ISIS. These foreign fighters
come from
Europe and Russia. They come
from Western

32:55.006 --> 33:02.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
countries and Russia and all
over the place.
So, a number of fighters who are
entering,

33:02.414 --> 33:09.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only to travel up and forth from
tension areas
to the Western countries is much
greater than

33:09.187 --> 33:11.022 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the number that are given to us.

33:11.056 --> 33:15.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think they are giving us a
smaller number
in order to keep the threat
level lower.

33:16.027 --> 33:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Patrolling
Greece's long
and porous maritime with Turkey
are a flotilla

33:22.033 --> 33:29.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of fast-response vessels from
various E.U.
countries.

33:29.207 --> 33:35.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're attached to the border
agency Frontex.
It's reinforcing Greece, whose
financial crisis

33:35.046 --> 33:40.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has hobbled its ability to
protect Europe's
eastern flank. Frontex boats are
rescuing

33:40.452 --> 33:45.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
migrants in the thousands.
Information obtained
on the front line is fed back to
the Frontex

33:45.957 --> 33:49.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
situation room in the Polish
capital, Warsaw.

33:49.261 --> 33:51.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Communications chief Izabella
Cooper:

33:51.062 --> 33:55.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IZABELLA COOPER, Frontex: The
green dots here
that we are seeing are --
represent boats

33:55.300 --> 34:01.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with migrants and refugees
coming from Turkey
towards Greece since the
beginning of this

34:01.740 --> 34:06.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year. And the white ones that we
see here
on different islands, we can see
three of

34:06.711 --> 34:09.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them, are ongoing search and
rescue.

34:09.047 --> 34:13.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Critics accuse
the agency
of being little more than a taxi
service.

34:13.251 --> 34:18.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Berndt Korner, Frontex's
deputy director,
insists that the new improved
screening of

34:18.056 --> 34:23.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
migrants is providing crucial
information
for Europol, the agency
responsible for dealing

34:23.495 --> 34:25.297 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with terrorism.

34:25.330 --> 34:29.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BERNDT KORNER, Frontex: ISIS, as
you mentioned
it, is one of the core issues
that we are

34:29.467 --> 34:36.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
devoting our attention to, but
this is only
one part. We are just trying to
investigate

34:36.207 --> 34:41.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whoever is apprehended, whoever
is brought
to the offices, check them
through the databases,

34:41.179 --> 34:45.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
perform the necessary security
checks, in
order to prevent that anything
slips through.

34:45.583 --> 34:49.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But do you
think General
Breedlove is correct when he
says that it

34:49.654 --> 34:51.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is spreading like a cancer?

34:51.556 --> 34:55.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BERNDT KORNER: We have made
detections. Those
detections have been forwarded
to the national

34:55.126 --> 35:00.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
authorities for proper
decision-taking. We
have strengthened our
capabilities in anti-terrorism

35:00.732 --> 35:02.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
measures.

35:02.434 --> 35:07.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for the time being, whatever
we could
detect was done. The sharing of
intelligence

35:07.505 --> 35:11.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and so the cooperation has been
greatly enhanced.

35:11.042 --> 35:15.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This used to be
Athens' main
airport. Now disused and almost
derelict,

35:15.981 --> 35:21.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it is providing the most basic
shelter for
migrants thwarted by the new
travel restrictions.

35:21.586 --> 35:30.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Greek states and agencies are
nowhere to be
seen, residents relying on the
kindness of

35:30.128 --> 35:36.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ordinary citizens.

35:36.034 --> 35:40.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among those stuck here is Edriss
Bayat, who
shows his certificate of
employment as an

35:40.071 --> 35:46.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administrator for NATO in
Afghanistan. We
met Bayat three weeks ago in
Lesbos after

35:46.044 --> 35:51.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was brought ashore by Greek
coast guards.
He was turned back by the
Macedonian authorities,

35:51.483 --> 35:56.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
despite being a Taliban target,
because of
his relationship with NATO,
underscored by

35:56.087 --> 35:58.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this photograph with General
David Petraeus.

35:58.523 --> 36:02.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDRISS BAYAT, Refugee: More than
90 percent
or 80 percent of the people,
they are traveling

36:02.727 --> 36:09.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a small child, with wives
and mothers
and families. So, a terrorist is
not going

36:09.167 --> 36:13.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to travel with their family or a
small child.
If it's terrorists, they should
come alone.

36:13.772 --> 36:19.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't know how it's
possible for a terrorist
to come and stay in the
compounds.

36:19.544 --> 36:25.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Back at
Victoria Square,
musician Jerome Kaluta has a
message for Europe,

36:25.717 --> 36:27.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as it prepares to shatter the
refugees' hopes.

36:27.852 --> 36:36.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEROME KALUTA, Musician: I think
it's in our
best interest to be together, to
live with

36:36.461 --> 36:43.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everyone and anybody, because we
are all human
beings, and we all have rights.
We all are

36:43.735 --> 36:45.503 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
God's children.

36:45.537 --> 36:50.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Although that
sentiment is
enshrined in European treaties,
the reality

36:50.275 --> 36:53.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is that the E.U. is delivering
the following
edict: Stay away.

36:53.511 --> 36:59.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Athens.

36:59.250 --> 37:13.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Cody,
Nebraska, has a population
of 156 people, normally not
enough to sustain

37:13.798 --> 37:18.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a grocery store. But thanks to a
unique educational
opportunity, residents of the
town don't have

37:18.703 --> 37:21.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to drive 30 minutes to the next
town to buy
food.

37:21.973 --> 37:27.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Mike Tobias from our PBS
partners at NET News
and Harvest Public Media has the
story.

37:27.345 --> 37:34.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE TOBIAS: Sitting atop a
sparsely populated
county the size of Connecticut,
Cody is not

37:34.219 --> 37:39.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a prime location for any retail
business.
So how's the Circle C Market
been able to

37:39.891 --> 37:46.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
survive and thrive here for
almost three years?
Because it's mostly run by the
students of

37:46.297 --> 37:48.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Cody-Kilgore School.

37:48.233 --> 37:53.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TODD CHESSMORE, Cody-Kilgore
Unified Schools:
We have adults that are
involved, but, essentially,

37:53.371 --> 37:56.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we try and get the kids to do
pretty much
everything, yes.

37:56.307 --> 37:58.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Tell me what you're doing.

37:58.276 --> 38:01.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUDENT: I'm just ordering for
next week.

38:01.913 --> 38:04.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: I'm entering all the
daily work in
QuickBooks.

38:04.415 --> 38:07.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: I'm doing the produce
order. I'm
the produce coordinator.

38:07.819 --> 38:13.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE TOBIAS: Here's how it
works. A community
board oversees the nonprofit
operation. During

38:13.358 --> 38:17.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the school day, students take on
tasks here,
as part of different classes,
with a paid

38:17.962 --> 38:21.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
adult employee on hand to help
train and supervise.

38:21.332 --> 38:26.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The rest of the time, students
are paid to
work at Circle C. Almost all of
Cody-Kilgore's

38:27.005 --> 38:34.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
165 K-12 students are involved,
from elementary
school students creating
decorations, to high

38:34.379 --> 38:36.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
schoolers deciding to stock a
new cereal.

38:37.015 --> 38:41.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: A Cocoa Krisp rice bag,
so we could
do that one.

38:41.553 --> 38:50.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE TOBIAS: The store does
enough business
to run in the black, but not by
much, Chessmore

38:50.428 --> 38:53.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
says, and primarily because of
how it's run.

38:53.498 --> 38:57.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TODD CHESSMORE: Without the
school being this
as intimately involved as it is,
I don't think

38:57.402 --> 39:05.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it could be done. It cannot
generate enough
funds and still be competitive
to stay open.

39:05.310 --> 39:09.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE TOBIAS: What doesn't show
up on the Circle
C ledger is how the village and
its people

39:09.547 --> 39:15.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
benefit from not having a
one-hour round-trip
to get to the next closest
grocery store,

39:15.119 --> 39:20.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but also how students benefit
from having
a place to market products they
have created,

39:20.258 --> 39:26.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a place to earn a little money,
and maybe
most importantly, a place to
gain real-world

39:26.064 --> 39:27.865 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
experience.

39:27.899 --> 39:32.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIZZY HOOPER, Student: If I ever
want to run
a business, I know what to put
on the shelves,

39:32.237 --> 39:38.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how to put it on the shelves,
how to finance,
how to get grants, marketing and
advertising.

39:38.109 --> 39:43.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE TOBIAS: An effort that
benefits students
and others who live in a town
that calls itself

39:43.815 --> 39:45.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
too tough to die.

39:45.850 --> 39:52.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Mike
Tobias in
Cody, Nebraska.

39:52.924 --> 40:02.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We will be
back with an
addition to our "NewsHour"
Bookshelf: the

40:02.767 --> 40:05.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
story of the Romeo and Juliet of
Afghanistan.

40:05.970 --> 40:10.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, take this moment to
hear from
your local PBS station. It's a
chance to offer

40:10.842 --> 40:15.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your support, which helps keep
programs like
ours on the air.

40:16.014 --> 40:17.815 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

40:17.849 --> 40:27.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Finally tonight, love and
tragedy in Afghanistan.

40:27.692 --> 40:31.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the latest
edition to the
"NewsHour" Bookshelf.

40:31.429 --> 40:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Zakia and Ali
first came to
the world's attention in the
pages of The

40:35.333 --> 40:38.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New York Times in 2014. Later,
the paper would
capture their story on video.

40:38.670 --> 40:40.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They had grown up on adjacent
potato farms
in Afghanistan's remote mountain
province

40:40.605 --> 40:43.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Bamiyan, playing together as
children,
and, as teenagers, falling in
love.

40:43.808 --> 40:47.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZAKIA, Afghanistan (through
translator): At
first, I wasn't aware of my
feelings, because

40:47.578 --> 40:52.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I didn't know him. I was very
young and didn't
understand these things. When I
was out in

40:52.850 --> 40:58.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the farm fields, he wrote his
cell phone number
and gave it to me. Then we
talked on the phone

40:58.823 --> 41:03.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and he said, "I love you," and
we got to know
each other and started to love
each other.

41:03.695 --> 41:07.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALI, Afghanistan (through
translator): It
looked to me that it wasn't
possible for us

41:07.565 --> 41:09.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to get together.

41:09.434 --> 41:12.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Indeed, it was
prohibited because
of the Afghan custom of arranged
marriages

41:12.570 --> 41:16.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and by Islamic law. The two were
separated
by religion and ethnicity, she a
Sunni and

41:16.140 --> 41:17.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tajik, he a Shiite and Hazara.

41:17.975 --> 41:20.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When their love became known,
the couple,
especially Zakia, faced
condemnation, beatings

41:20.878 --> 41:22.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and later the threat of death
from her family.

41:22.880 --> 41:25.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROD NORDLAND, Author, "The
Lovers: Afghanistan's
Romeo and Juliet": Her family
were not wealthy,

41:25.316 --> 41:28.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but they were big and they were
numerous.
And they -- on their side, in
their quest

41:28.419 --> 41:33.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to kill her, they had a very
powerful weapon,
and that was the knowledge that
nobody has

41:33.758 --> 41:37.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ever been successfully
prosecuted for an honor
killing in Afghanistan.

41:37.128 --> 41:40.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A new book tells
the story.

41:40.298 --> 41:46.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's called "The Lovers:
Afghanistan's Romeo
and Juliet," by New York Times
Kabul bureau

41:46.537 --> 41:49.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chief Rod Nordland. Nordland
wrote the original
article and a number of
follow-ups.

41:49.907 --> 41:53.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We met recently at the Sackler
Gallery in
Washington, D.C., as a new
exhibition on Afghanistan

41:53.778 --> 41:55.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
art, Turquoise Mountain, was
being installed.

41:55.613 --> 41:59.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nordland told me he'd been
looking for a way
to report on so-called honor
killings, the

41:59.717 --> 42:02.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
murder of young women by their
own families
for causing them shame.

42:02.820 --> 42:07.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROD NORDLAND: We would hear
about honor killings
from time to time, but there'd
be a real paucity

42:07.191 --> 42:14.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of information about them,
because nobody
would talk about them. And we
knew probably

42:14.532 --> 42:17.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there were many more honor
killings than anybody
ever hears of.

42:17.168 --> 42:23.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In Zakia and Ali,
you found
two young people who in some
ways seem very

42:23.574 --> 42:30.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
normal to their time and place,
but clearly
in other ways were not, right?
They were willing

42:30.381 --> 42:35.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do something that went well
beyond the
bounds of their culture. Did you
ever figure

42:35.787 --> 42:39.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out what it was in them that
made them that
way?

42:39.223 --> 42:54.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROD NORDLAND: It's hard to say,
but I think,
if I had to identify one thing,
it would be

42:54.205 --> 43:05.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Zakia has a real spark of
independence
and a real strength of
character. And she

43:05.650 --> 43:12.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decided that she wanted to do
this and she
was going to do it.

43:12.123 --> 43:15.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Falling in love is not an
unusual thing in
Afghanistan, like it isn't in
any country,

43:15.460 --> 43:19.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any place. It's just forbidden,
and it's frowned
upon by mullahs. It's actually
preached against.

43:20.031 --> 43:26.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Zakia first went
to a women's
shelter. Then, upping the stakes
dramatically,

43:26.737 --> 43:32.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the two eloped. Sought by police
and her family,
they went into hiding in rural
caves and in

43:32.577 --> 43:34.378 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Kabul.

43:34.412 --> 43:36.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROD NORDLAND: It didn't occur to
me even that
she would have the courage to
run on her own,

43:36.113 --> 43:41.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
18-year-old girl, never been
outside her own
village. I was the first man she
had ever

43:41.352 --> 43:47.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sat in the same room with that
wasn't a brother
or father or Ali.

43:47.658 --> 43:52.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And many times, even the first
interview I
had with them, they said that
they would -- they

43:52.330 --> 43:57.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would be happy if they were just
together
for a day. And if the other
person were killed,

43:57.602 --> 43:59.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they would gladly kill
themselves.

43:59.537 --> 44:04.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Nordland, working
with a video
crew, was able to follow Zakia
and Ali periodically

44:04.041 --> 44:06.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the next year, as they had
a daughter
named Ruqia.

44:06.777 --> 44:11.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But his stories, picked up by
Afghan media,
also made it harder for them to
hide. And

44:11.249 --> 44:15.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nordland himself became part of
the story,
at one point providing the
couple a getaway

car and some money.

44:16.988 --> 44:21.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROD NORDLAND: I stepped over the
line between
being a journalist and being a
participant.

44:21.058 --> 44:26.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I admit I did that, and
probably by the
precepts of my profession, that
was the wrong

44:26.097 --> 44:31.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thing to do. But rules sometimes
need to be
broken in the interest of doing
what's right.

44:31.102 --> 44:38.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are times, as a
journalist, I mean,
you know, if you come across a
car crash,

44:38.476 --> 44:51.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do you take the picture first or
help the
victim inside the car?

44:51.589 --> 45:04.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you obviously help the
victim inside the
car. I mean, most of us would.
And it was

45:04.335 --> 45:06.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a little bit like that in a way.

45:07.004 --> 45:16.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The largest
context here, of
course, is the status of women
in Afghanistan.

45:16.047 --> 45:19.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And after 2001 -- you write
about this -- so
much hope there was. But,
according to this

45:19.183 --> 45:22.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
story, the story you tell, not
much has changed.

45:22.853 --> 45:30.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROD NORDLAND: Yes. When it comes
to a lot
of these abusive customary
practices, that's

45:30.094 --> 45:32.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
right. They're still as
prevalent as they
once were.

45:32.964 --> 45:43.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Honor killing, child brides, the
practice
of baad, when a little girl is
sold to pay

45:43.007 --> 45:48.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Honor killing, child brides, the
practice
of baad, when a little girl is
sold to pay

45:48.646 --> 45:58.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a family debt, often a debt for
some moral
crime that a male relative has
carried out.

45:58.522 --> 46:07.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would be unfair to say there
hasn't been
improvement, because there are
millions of

46:07.331 --> 46:17.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
girls in schools that didn't
exist during
the Taliban time.

46:17.508 --> 46:26.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, when you look at the
metrics, Afghanistan
still remains the worst place in
the world

46:26.751 --> 46:36.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be born a woman, in life
expectancy, maternal
mortality, anything. And you
look at it, and

46:36.961 --> 46:43.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that's pretty shocking,
considering the investment
that we have tried to make in
bettering women's

46:43.868 --> 46:46.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that's pretty shocking,
considering the investment
that we have tried to make in
bettering women's

47:19.637 --> 47:21.405 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lives.

47:21.439 --> 47:28.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Nordland remains
in touch with
Zakia and Ali, who are still in
hiding. In

47:28.546 --> 47:40.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a video he and his team made of
the couple's
life today with their daughter,
they said

47:40.257 --> 47:42.126 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this:

47:42.159 --> 47:52.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZAKIA (through translator): If I
were killed
and not here with her, I hope
that our daughter

47:52.203 --> 47:56.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZAKIA (through translator): If I
were killed
and not here with her, I hope
that our daughter

47:56.340 --> 48:10.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will grow up to learn where to
go and where
not to go, and will be educated.

48:10.154 --> 48:17.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALI (through translator): My
advice to someone
who falls in love is that he
should do something

48:17.027 --> 48:20.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALI (through translator): My
advice to someone
who falls in love is that he
should do something

50:06.470 --> 50:12.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to win her heart and have
a
happy life.

50:12.376 --> 50:16.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to win her heart and have
a
happy life.

51:35.492 --> 51:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The couple
decided against
fleeing for Europe, at least for
now, but

JEFFREY BROWN: The couple
decided against
fleeing for Europe, at least for
now, but

53:15.659 --> 53:17.761 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hope to find asylum somewhere.

Long before they made luxury
cars and SUVs,

BMW made airplane engines that
helped power
Germany's fleet of fighter
planes during World
