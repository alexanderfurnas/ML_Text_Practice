Woodruff: GOOD AFTERNOON
I'M JUDY WOODRUFF.

00:15.800 --> 00:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WELCOME TO "THE SESSIONS
HEARING" SPECIAL PBS NEWSHOUR

00:22.266 --> 00:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COVERAGE OF ATTORNEY GENERAL
JEFF SESSIONS' TESTIMONY BEFORE

00:25.866 --> 00:28.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE.

00:28.600 --> 00:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THIS IS A RARE MOMENT--
A MEMBER OF PRESIDENT DONALD

00:31.733 --> 00:35.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP'S CABINET-- TESTIFYING
BEFORE HIS FORMER SENATE

00:35.766 --> 00:38.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COLLEAGUES.
REPORTING FROM THE CLOSED

00:38.600 --> 00:42.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SESSION OF FORMER F.B.I.
DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY'S TESTIMONY

00:42.466 --> 00:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUGGEST THAT THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL MAY HAVE HAD AN

00:45.433 --> 00:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ADDITIONAL MEETING WITH RUSSIAN
OFFICIALS THAT HE DID NOT

00:49.366 --> 00:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DISCLOSE DURING THE CONFIRMATION
PROCESS.

00:51.900 --> 00:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THIS IS LIKELY TO BE ONE LINE OF
QUESTIONING THIS AFTERNOON.

00:56.833 --> 01:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HAVING RECUSED HIMSELF FROM THE
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION, WHY WAS

01:01.400 --> 01:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL INVOLVED IN
THE FIRING OF THE FORMER FBI

01:05.933 --> 01:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY.
SO JOINING ME WITH ANALYSIS OF

01:09.266 --> 01:14.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TODAY'S HEARING IS WALTER
DELLINGER, HE SERVED IN BILL

01:15.733 --> 01:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON'S ADMINISTRATION AS
ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL.

01:23.433 --> 01:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HE IS CURRENTLY AN ATTORNEY IN
PRIVATE PRACTICE.

01:27.333 --> 01:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO

01:30.500 --> 01:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE TESTIMONY FROM THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL.

01:32.566 --> 01:35.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WE WEREN'T CLEAR EXACTLY WHETHER
IT WAS GOING TO BE OPEN OR

01:35.166 --> 01:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLOSED SESSION.
BUT WHAT IS IT WE ARE MAINLY

01:38.700 --> 01:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LOOKING FOR THESE SENATORS TO
SPEAK TO HIM ABOUT?

01:41.200 --> 01:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> I THINK WHAT THE SENATORS
WANT TO KNOW IS, IS THIS

01:45.933 --> 01:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVESTIGATION GOING FORWARD,
FULLY AND FREELY AND WITHOUT

01:52.200 --> 01:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INTERFERENCE?
IT IS IRONIC THAT SINCE THE

01:54.366 --> 01:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ATTORNEY GENERAL RECUSED HIMSELF
FROM MATTERS INVOLVING THE

01:58.133 --> 02:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAMPAIGN, RUSSIAN INVOLVEMENT OR
ANY OTHER CAMPAIGN ISSUES THAT

02:01.933 --> 02:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WE'RE INTERESTED WHAT HE HAS TO
SAY ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION.

02:04.700 --> 02:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BECAUSE PRESUMABLY HE'S RECUSED
FROM IT.

02:07.400 --> 02:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> Woodruff: THERE ARE STILL
QUESTIONS ABOUT IT.

02:09.733 --> 02:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AS WE ARE TALKING IN THE STUDIO,
WE HAVE THE LIVE CAMERA IN THE

02:15.933 --> 02:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE
HEARING ROOM.

02:17.366 --> 02:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THEY ARE WAITING FOR THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL TO JOIN THEM AT

02:20.666 --> 02:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANY MOMENT.
SEEMS TO ME THERE ARE SEVERAL

02:22.666 --> 02:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LINES OF QUESTIONING.
ONE DOES AS YOU JUST SAID, HAS

02:26.200 --> 02:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TO DO WITH WHAT WAS HIS ROLE
REPRESENTING THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN

02:30.533 --> 02:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OR DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD
BEFORE DONALD TRUMP, BEFORE THE

02:33.900 --> 02:38.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELECTION AND THE DAY DONALD
TRUMP WAS INAUGURATED.

02:40.366 --> 02:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WHY WERE THOSE SESSIONS HEMMED?
IN I THINK THE SENATORS GOING TO

02:47.033 --> 02:52.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WANT TO KNOW, WHAT DID HE
TESTIFY ABOUT, HOW WAS THIS

02:56.333 --> 03:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVESTIGATION SET UP, AND WHAT
ROLE HE PLAYED IN THE FIRING OF

03:02.800 --> 03:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY.
AND SOME SENATORS WILL ASK

03:06.533 --> 03:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WHETHER IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR
HIM TO HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN

03:09.333 --> 03:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FIRING COMEY SINCE HE'S
REACCUSED FROM THAT PARTICULAR

03:12.966 --> 03:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVESTIGATION.
>> Woodruff: WE SHOULD SAY

03:14.633 --> 03:19.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LAST THURSDAY FIVE DAYS AGO WHEN
THE FIRED FBI DIRECTOR JAMES

03:19.466 --> 03:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COMEY SAT IN THAT SAME CHAIR
PRESUMABLY THAT THE ATTORNEY

03:23.733 --> 03:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS IS GOING
TO BE SITTINGS IN THIS

03:26.233 --> 03:28.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AFTERNOON.
AS WE JUST SAID WALTER

03:28.966 --> 03:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DELLINGER, HE IS PUZZLED, WITH
THE ROLE HE PLAYED, I DON'T KNOW

03:39.800 --> 03:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WHAT ROLE HE PLAYED.
>> I THINK THE DISEEFTION OF

03:42.233 --> 03:45.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS WOULD
BE THAT HE IS RECUSED FROM A

03:45.600 --> 03:48.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PARTICULAR MATTER WHICH IS THIS
INVESTIGATION, OR ANY

03:48.800 --> 03:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAMPAIGN
AND THE DISMISSAL OF THE FBI

03:52.433 --> 03:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DIRECTOR, HE WILL ARGUE I WOULD
ASSUME IS A MATTER OF THE

03:57.033 --> 03:58.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GENERAL ASSESSMENT OF HIS
PERFORMANCE.

03:58.966 --> 04:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT IS, HE IS STILL THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL, RESPONSIBLE

04:01.666 --> 04:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FOR WHO REPORTS TO THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL.

04:05.333 --> 04:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IT IS SLICING THINGS FAIRLY
NARROWLY AS SAYING IT'S NOT THE

04:08.500 --> 04:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAME THING AS THE INVESTIGATION,
THE FIRING OF COMEY.

04:12.600 --> 04:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT'S THE LINE I THINK THAT
ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS WILL

04:15.033 --> 04:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HAVE TO ARGUE.
>> Woodruff: WHAT'S MADE THIS

04:17.033 --> 04:19.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OF COURSE A GREATER NEWS
INTEREST IS THE FACT THAT

04:19.600 --> 04:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ORIGINALLY THE STATEMENTS THAT
WERE PUT OUT BY THE JUSTICE

04:24.366 --> 04:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEPARTMENT BY THE WHITE HOUSE
HAD TO DO WITH THE DIRECTOR,

04:30.833 --> 04:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THEN DIRECTOR COMEY'S RUNNING OF
THE FBI, HOW HE RAN THE FBI, HOW

04:34.200 --> 04:38.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HE MANAGED THE FBI AND HOW HE
HANDLED THE HILLARY CLINTON

04:38.066 --> 04:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
E-MAIL INVESTIGATION.
THAT'S WHAT THEY ORIGINALLY

04:40.566 --> 04:43.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REFERRED TO.
BUT THEN, IN THE DAYS AFTER

04:43.566 --> 04:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT, IT CAME OUT THAT THE
PRESIDENT, AND THE PRESIDENT

04:46.933 --> 04:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HIMSELF IT TURNED OUT, TO THE
RUSSIAN DIPLOMATS HE HAD THE

04:53.333 --> 04:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FOREIGN MINTS FROM RUSSIA,
FOREIGN MINISTER OF RUSSIA AND

04:56.100 --> 04:58.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED
STATES FROM RUSSIA, HE TOLD THEM

04:58.500 --> 05:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DIRECTLY ONE OF THE REASONS HE
FIRED THE FBI DIRECTOR HAD TO DO

05:04.933 --> 05:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WITH THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION
AND NOT THE HILLARY CLINTON

05:06.866 --> 05:10.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVESTIGATION.
>> I THINK THEY WILL HAVE HIM

05:10.866 --> 05:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLARIFY, PERHAPS HE WILL
DIRECTLY DISAGREE WITH FORMER

05:17.033 --> 05:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FBI DIRECTOR COMEY ON SOME
MATTERS.

05:19.133 --> 05:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I HOPE THAT THE SENATORS DON'T
USE HOLD OF THE FACT THAT

05:25.566 --> 05:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OVERARCHING THIS IS A HOSTILE
MILITARY POWER TO INFLUENCE OUR

05:30.300 --> 05:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELECTIONS.
WE SOMETIMES GET LOST IN THE

05:31.533 --> 05:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MINUTIAE.
AND RATHER THAN THE ASSAULT ON

05:37.866 --> 05:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OUR STATE BY A FOREIGN POWER.
>> Woodruff: EXACTLY.

05:48.133 --> 05:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TIES BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN,
PEOPLE AROUND DONALD TRUMP ANDRE

05:54.466 --> 05:58.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP ANDRUSSIAN
OFFICIALS. YOU NOT ONLY HAVE THE

06:01.900 --> 06:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVESTIGATION, WHAT WAS THE
INVESTIGATION BY THE FBI THAT'S

06:04.266 --> 06:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NOW BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE
SPECIAL COUNSEL RUN BY ROBERT

06:07.866 --> 06:10.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MUELLER, THE FORMER FBI
DIRECTOR, AND BY THE WAY WE'VE

06:10.966 --> 06:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HAD NEWS OVER THE LAST DAY OR SO
INCLUDING AN INTERVIEW RIGHT

06:14.933 --> 06:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HERE ON THE NewsHOUR, WITH THE
FRIEND OF THE PRESIDENT, THE

06:17.800 --> 06:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRESIDENT IS THINKING ABOUT
WHETHER TO TERMINATE ROBERT

06:22.133 --> 06:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MUELLER.
>> YOU MADE SOME NEWS ON THE

06:24.400 --> 06:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NewsHOUR WITH THAT INTERVIEW.
>> IN ADDITION TO THAT YOU HAD

06:30.833 --> 06:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TWO SENATE COMMITTEES LOOKING
INTO THIS RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.

06:34.500 --> 06:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND THEN SEPARATELY FROM ALL
THAT WALTER DELLINGER, THERE ARE

06:37.333 --> 06:41.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NEWS REPORTS COMING OUT ALMOST
DAILY, I KNOW BLOOMBERG NEWS HAD

06:41.866 --> 06:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ONE THIS MORNING, EVIDENCE THAT
THE REITERATIONS WERE NOT ONLY

06:45.366 --> 06:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HACK INTO E-MAILS OF THE
DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE

06:48.233 --> 06:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND HILLARY CLINTON, BUT THEY
WERE ACTIVELY, IT TURNS OUT

06:53.233 --> 06:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRYING TO INTERFERE WITH THE
ELECTION MACHINERY IN DOZENS OF

06:56.700 --> 07:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY.
>> I THINK THEY MIGHT TAKE

07:03.133 --> 07:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS BEYOND
HIS PARTICULAR OWN IETIONS AND

07:04.633 --> 07:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ASK HIM AS ATTORNEY GENERAL, AS
CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER

07:08.433 --> 07:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOW HE THINKS HE OUGHT TO
RESPOND WITH WHAT MAY BE A

07:11.300 --> 07:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CONTINUING RUSSIAN ASSAULT ON
OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES.

07:15.766 --> 07:18.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THIS IS NOT A REPUBLICAN OR
DEMOCRATIC ISSUE.

07:18.066 --> 07:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THEY COULD EASILY TURN ON A
DIFFERENTLY PARTY, DEPENDING ON

07:22.766 --> 07:26.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IF THE RUSSIANS THOUGHT THERE
WAS A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE THAT

07:26.166 --> 07:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WAS GOING TO TAKE US BACK TO THE
ERA OF REAGAN, I CAN SEE THE

07:29.066 --> 07:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUSSIANS GOING AFTER THAT
CANDIDATE AS WELL.

07:31.666 --> 07:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER.
>> Woodruff: IT IS AND AGAIN,

07:38.133 --> 07:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALL SORTS OF DOORS HAVE BEEN
OPENED AS THIS STORY, AS IT

07:40.766 --> 07:44.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BECAME -- AS MORE BECAME KNOWN.
WE HEARD DIRECTOR COMEY WHO

07:44.933 --> 07:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FIRED -- FIRED FBI DIRECTOR
COMEY TESTIFY LAST WEEK TESTIFY

07:49.900 --> 07:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ABOUT HOW THIS ALL FIRST EVOLVED
LAST SUMMER OR EVEN LAST SPRING

07:54.366 --> 07:59.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WHEN THEY FIRST GOT FORECAST
ABOUT POSSIBLE CONNECTION,

08:00.866 --> 08:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN OFFICIALS,
PEOPLE AROUND DONALD TRUMP AND

08:03.733 --> 08:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUSSIAN OFFICIALS.
SO THIS IS NOW BEEN GOING ON FOR

08:07.233 --> 08:08.900 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
ALMOST A YEAR.
>> RIGHT.

08:08.900 --> 08:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WE DON'T KNOW HOW FAR ALONG THIS
INVESTIGATION IS.

08:12.200 --> 08:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I THINK THAT WE -- THE SPECIAL
COUNSEL WILL KEEP A VERY TIGHT

08:16.500 --> 08:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LID ON.
HE HAS A VERY PROFESSIONAL GROUP

08:18.800 --> 08:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OF PEOPLE WORKING FOR HIM.
I DON'T THINK THERE WILL BE AS

08:21.966 --> 08:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MANY LEAKS IN THE FUTURE.
>> Woodruff: SO WALTER

08:24.066 --> 08:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DELLINGER, I'M TALKING TO WALTER
DELLINGER, FORMER OFFICIAL, IT

08:32.300 --> 08:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LOOKS LIKE STAFF IS BEING SEATED
BEHIND THE SENATORS.

08:41.666 --> 08:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WHAT WE'RE GETTING READY TO
LISTEN TO IS TESTIMONY FROM THE

08:44.000 --> 08:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED
STATES.

08:46.733 --> 08:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS, HIS FIRST
TESTIMONY BEFORE FELLOW SENATORS

08:50.733 --> 08:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SINCE HIS CONFIRMATION HEARINGS
BACK SEVERAL MONTHS AGO.

08:55.166 --> 08:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LET'S TALK ABOUT HIM FOR A
MINUTE.

08:56.700 --> 09:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HE WAS THE FIRST AND FOR A LONG
TIME WALTER DELLINGER, THE ONLY

09:00.933 --> 09:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MEMBER OF THE UNITED STATES
SENATE TO EMBRACE DONALD TRUMP'S

09:04.800 --> 09:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CANDIDACY.
>> THE CONNECTION WAS VERY DEEP

09:06.533 --> 09:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND I'M SURE THE PRESIDENT WAS
VERY UPSET WHEN ATTORNEY GENERAL

09:12.933 --> 09:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SESSIONS RECUSED HIMSELF FROM
THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION.

09:15.933 --> 09:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT SET IN MOTION WHEREBY THE
PRESIDENT'S NOMINEE FOR DEPUTY

09:23.066 --> 09:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ATTORNEY GENERAL, ROD ROSENSTEIN
DECIDED TO APPOINT A SPECIAL

09:29.166 --> 09:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COUNSEL.
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THE

09:37.000 --> 09:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SENATE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MAY
WELL FOCUS ON IS THAT

09:41.700 --> 09:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CONVERSATION ALONE BETWEEN THE
PRESIDENT AND THEN FBI DIRECTOR

09:46.233 --> 09:51.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COMEY IN THE OVAL OFFICE FROM
WHICH SESSIONS WAS -- WHERE WAS

09:51.166 --> 09:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EXCUSED.
>> WAS ABSENT FROM THE ROOM.

09:53.866 --> 09:58.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT WAS A CONVERSATION IN WHICH
THE PRESIDENT HOPED THE FBI

10:00.300 --> 10:03.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DIRECTOR WOULD FIND A WAY TO END
THE INVESTIGATION AND GENERAL

10:03.266 --> 10:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE FLYNN'S CONNECTIONS TO THE
RUSSIANS.

10:05.333 --> 10:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> Woodruff: I WOULD EXPECT
THAT SOME OF THESE SENATORS ARE

10:08.333 --> 10:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GOING TO ASK THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL WHY HE LEFT THE ROOM,

10:12.866 --> 10:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KNOWING IT WAS THE FBI DIRECTOR.
IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE GETTING

10:16.633 --> 10:19.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLOSER.
>> I BELIEVE THERE IS ATTORNEY

10:19.200 --> 10:24.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GENERAL SESSIONS NOW SHAKE HANDS
WITH VARIOUS FAMILY MEMBERS OF

10:25.500 --> 10:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HIS.
>> AND WALKING TOWARDS THE SEAT

10:27.800 --> 10:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND THE PHOTOGRAPHERS OF COURSE
SNAPPING AWAY.

10:29.700 --> 10:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> THIS IS A VERY TENSE MOMENT
FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> Woodruff: IT IS, IT IS.
A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS

10:36.300 --> 10:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FIRED FBI
DIRECTOR, THE ROLE HE PLAYED, IF

10:40.900 --> 10:43.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ANY, IN THAT FIRING, HIS
CONNECTION WITH RUSSIAN

10:43.966 --> 10:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OFFICIALS AND WE SHOULD POINT
OUT WAWRT DELLINGER, THE

10:47.366 --> 10:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ATTORNEY GENERAL ASKED THAT HE
TESTIFY IN THE OPEN IN THE

10:50.633 --> 10:53.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PUBLIC THAT IT NOT BE BEHIND
CLOSED DOORS.

10:53.500 --> 10:57.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SO I GUESS THE SENSE THE FROM
THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THEY DID

10:57.366 --> 11:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NOT WANT -- HE'S REGRETTING
RICHARD BURR, WHO IS THE

11:00.766 --> 11:04.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE SELECT
COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE, BURR

11:04.066 --> 11:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BEING THE SENATOR FROM NORTH
CAROLINA AND REPUBLICAN SENATOR

11:07.700 --> 11:12.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND THE VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE
COMMITTEE, MARK WARNER, THEY

11:14.533 --> 11:18.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WERE THE LEADERS OF THE THIS
COMMITTEE AS FBI DIRECTOR, THE

11:18.400 --> 11:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FIRED FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY
TESTIFIED LAST WEEK.

11:21.500 --> 11:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WE ARE LOOKING AT SEVERAL LINES
OF QUESTIONING HERE.

11:24.066 --> 11:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CONNECTIONS WITH RUSSIAN HE,
POSSIBLE ROLE IN THE FIRING OF

11:27.133 --> 11:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES COMEY, HIS ROLE, HIS
RELATIONSHIP TO DONALD TRUMP,

11:31.400 --> 11:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE FACT THAT HE LEFT THE ROOM,
THAT THE OVAL OFFICE THE DAY --

11:34.966 --> 11:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> I THINK THE GENERAL AREA OF
RELATION, THE PROPER

11:39.900 --> 11:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE
POLITICAL FORCES IN THE WHITE

11:43.000 --> 11:44.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HOUSE AND THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT.

11:44.933 --> 11:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> Woodruff: I'M TOLD WALTER
DELLINGER, THE REASON FOR THIS

11:48.433 --> 11:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DELAY, THIS COMMITTEE WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE GETTING UNDERWAY

11:51.133 --> 11:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AT 2:30 SHARP, THERE WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE A VOTE ON THE

11:57.433 --> 12:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FLOOR OF THE SENATE.
THEY NOW CAN GET UNDERWAY, THEIR

12:01.500 --> 12:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRINCIPAL WITNESS, SINGLE
WITNESS TODAY TO TESTIFY BEFORE

12:07.933 --> 12:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THEM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE
UNITED STATES, FORMER SENATOR

12:10.300 --> 12:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FROM THE STATE OF ALABAMA JEFF
SESSIONS, WHO KNOWS MANY OF

12:13.466 --> 12:16.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THESE SENATORS VERY WELL.
THIS IS THE CHAIRMAN GAVELING TO

12:16.566 --> 12:18.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ORDER.
NORTH CAROLINA REPUBLICAN

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SENATOR RICHARD BURR.
>> ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS,

12:37.400 --> 12:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO
APPEAR BEFORE THE COMMITTEE

12:39.566 --> 12:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TODAY.
I THANK YOU FOR YOUR YEARS OF

12:42.200 --> 12:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEDICATED SERVICES AS A MEMBER
OF THIS BODY, AND YOUR RECENT

12:46.300 --> 12:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LEADERSHIP AT THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE.

12:49.133 --> 12:52.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AS I MENTIONED, WHEN DIRECTOR
COMEY APPEARED BEFORE US LAST

12:52.366 --> 12:56.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WEEK, THIS COMMITTEE'S ROLE IS
TO BE THE EYES AND EARS FOR THE

12:56.766 --> 13:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OTHER 85 MEMBERS OF THE UNITED
STATES SENATE AND FOR THE

13:00.166 --> 13:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMERICAN PEOPLE, ENSURING THAT
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IS

13:04.200 --> 13:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OPERATING LAWFULLY, AND HAS THE
NECESSARY TOOLS TO KEEP AMERICA

13:08.500 --> 13:11.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAFE.
THE COMMUNITY IS LARGE AND

13:11.833 --> 13:15.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DIVERSE PLACE.
WE RECOGNIZE THE GRAVITY OF OUR

13:15.166 --> 13:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIA'S
INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016 U.S.

13:19.400 --> 13:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELECTIONS.
BUT I REMIND OUR CONSTITUENTS

13:22.633 --> 13:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT WHILE WE INVESTIGATE
RUSSIA, WE ARE SCRUTINIZING

13:26.700 --> 13:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CIA'S BUDGET, WHILE WE'RE
INVESTIGATING RUSSIA, WE'RE

13:31.700 --> 13:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STILL SCRUTINIZING CIA'S BUDGET,
NSA'S 702 PROGRAM OUR NATION'S

13:38.166 --> 13:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SATELLITE PROGRAM AND THE ENTIRE
IC EFFORT TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN

13:41.600 --> 13:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE BEST TALENT WE CAN FIND IN
THE WORLD.

13:44.533 --> 13:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, THE
COMMITTEE CONDUCTS ITS WORK

13:47.233 --> 13:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS.
A NECESSARY STEP TO ENSURE THAT

13:51.033 --> 13:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE MOST NECESSARY SOURCES AND
METHODS ARE PROTECTED.

13:54.733 --> 13:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE SANCTITY OF THESE SOURCES
AND METHODS ARE AT THE HEART OF

13:58.033 --> 14:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY'S
ABILITY TO KEEP US SAFE AND TO

14:01.833 --> 14:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KEEP OUR ALLIES SAFE FROM THOSE
WHO SEEK TO HARM US.

14:05.633 --> 14:10.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'VE SAID REPEATEDLY THAT I DO
NOT BELIEVE ANY COMMITTEE, THAT

14:11.900 --> 14:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE COMMITTEE DOES SHOULD BE
DONE IN PUBLIC.

14:14.366 --> 14:18.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THE GRAVITY
OF THE COMMITTEE'S CURRENT

14:18.466 --> 14:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVESTIGATION, AND THE NEED FOR
AMERICAN PEOPLE TO BE PRESENTED

14:21.966 --> 14:26.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE FACTS SO THAT THEY MIGHT
MAKE THEIR OWN JUDGMENTS.

14:28.333 --> 14:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IT IS FOR THAT REASON THAT THIS
COMMITTEE HAS NOW HELD ITS

14:34.100 --> 14:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
10th OPEN HEARING OF 2017.
MORE THAN DOUBLE THAT OF THE

14:39.433 --> 14:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COMMITTEE IN RECENT YEARS, AND
THE FIFTH ON THE TOPIC EVER

14:42.866 --> 14:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE.
- - OF RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE.

14:45.366 --> 14:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS THIS
IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO SEPARATE

14:48.900 --> 14:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FACT FROM FICTION AND TO SET THE
RECORD STRAIGHT ON A NUMBER OF

14:52.733 --> 14:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALLEGATIONS REPORTED IN THE
PRESS.

14:55.500 --> 14:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FOR EXAMPLE, THERE ARE SEVERAL
ISSUES THAT I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE

14:58.533 --> 15:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILL ADDRESS TODAY.
ONE, DID YOU HAVE ANY MEETINGS

15:02.500 --> 15:05.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WITH RUSSIAN OFFICIALS OR THEIR
PROXIES ON BEHALF OF THE TRUMP

15:05.166 --> 15:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAMPAIGN OR DURING YOUR TIME AS
ATTORNEY GENERAL?

15:08.733 --> 15:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TWO?
WHAT WAS YOUR INVOLVEMENT WITH

15:11.100 --> 15:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CANDIDATE TRUMP'S FOREIGN POLICY
TEAM AND WHAT WERE THEIR

15:14.666 --> 15:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
POSSIBLE INTERACTION HE WITH
RUSSIANS?

15:17.533 --> 15:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THREE, WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO
RECUSE YOURSELF FROM THE

15:21.000 --> 15:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GOVERNMENT'S RUSSIA
INVESTIGATION AND FOURTH, WHAT

15:24.266 --> 15:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROLE IF ANY DID YOU PLAY IN THE
REMOVAL OF THEN FBI DIRECTOR

15:28.333 --> 15:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COMEY?
I LOOK FORWARD TO A CANDID AND

15:31.000 --> 15:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HONEST DISCUSSION AS WE CONTINUE
TO PURSUE THE TRUTH BEHIND

15:34.566 --> 15:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUSSIA'S INTERFERENCE IN THE
2016 ELECTIONS.

15:38.133 --> 15:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE COMMITTEE'S EXPERIENCED
STAFF IS INTERVIEWING THE

15:40.266 --> 15:45.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RELEVANT PARTIES, HAVING SPOKEN
TO MORE THAN 35 INDIVIDUALS TO

15:45.266 --> 15:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAYLIGHT.
TO INCLUDE JUST YESTERDAY, AN

15:48.000 --> 15:52.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INTERVIEW OF FORMER HOMELAND
SECURITY SECRETARY JEH JOHNSON.

15:52.300 --> 15:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND THE MOST SENSITIVE
INTELLIGENCE IN OUR COUNTRY'S

15:57.133 --> 16:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
POSSESSION.
AS I SAID PREVIOUSLY WE WILL

16:00.633 --> 16:05.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ESTABLISH THE FACTS, SEPARATE
FROM RAMPANT SPECULATION AND LAY

16:05.533 --> 16:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THEM OUT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
TO MAKE THEIR OWN JUDGMENT.

16:09.066 --> 16:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ONLY THEN WILL WE AS A NATION BE
ABLE TO PUT THIS EPISODE TO REST

16:13.866 --> 16:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND LOOK TO THE FUTURE.
I'M HOPEFUL THAT MEMBERS WILL

16:16.800 --> 16:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FOCUS THEIR QUESTIONS TODAY ON
THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION AND NOT

16:21.200 --> 16:25.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SQUANDER THE OPPORTUNITY BY
STAYING POLITICAL OR PARTISAN

16:25.066 --> 16:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHOTS.
THE VICE CHAIRMAN AND I CONTINUE

16:27.200 --> 16:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TO LEAD THIS INVESTIGATION
TOGETHER, ON WHAT IS A HIGHLY

16:31.400 --> 16:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARGED POLITICAL ISSUE.
WE MAY DISAGREE AT TIMES BUT WE

16:35.566 --> 16:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REMAIN A UNIFIED TEAM WITH A

AMERICAN PEOPLE TO FIND THE
TRUTH.

16:47.166 --> 16:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE COMMITEE HAS MADE MUCH
PROGRESS AS THE POLITICAL WINDS

16:49.933 --> 16:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BLOW AROUND US, AND THE PUBLIC
WILL AGREES DESPITE A TORRENT OF

16:56.366 --> 17:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEBATE ON WHO AND WHAT MAY BE
BEST SUITED TO LEAD ON THIS

17:02.366 --> 17:05.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISSUE, THE INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEE HAS LED UP TO ITS

17:05.666 --> 17:10.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OBLIGATION TO MOVE FORWARD WITH
PURPOSE AND ABOVE POLITICS.

17:11.900 --> 17:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL, IT'S GOOD

17:33.433 --> 17:36.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I DO THOUGH WANT TO TAKE A
MOMENT AT THE OUTSET AND FIRST

17:36.566 --> 17:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EXPRESS SOME CONCERN WITH THE

17:51.533 --> 17:54.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

INSTEAD.

17:54.300 --> 17:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

COLLEAGUES THAT I BELIEVE HE

18:04.633 --> 18:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FROM MEMBERS OF THOSE COMMITTEES
AND THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AS

18:07.400 --> 18:09.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WELL.
MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL IT IS MY

18:09.800 --> 18:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOPE THAT YOU WILL RESCHEDULE
THOSE APPEARANCES AS SOON AS

18:13.166 --> 18:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
POSSIBLE.
IN ADDITION, I WANT TO SAY AT

18:15.733 --> 18:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE OUTSET WHILE WE CONSIDER
YOUR APPEARANCE HERE AS THE

18:20.233 --> 18:24.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BEGINNING OF OUR INTERACTION
BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR DEPARTMENT,

18:24.633 --> 18:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL WE ALWAYS
EXPECTED TO TALK TO YOU AS PART

18:28.100 --> 18:31.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OF OUR INVESTIGATION.
WE BELIEVED IT WOULD BE ACTUALLY

18:31.466 --> 18:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LATER IN THE PROCESS.
WE'RE GLAD TO ACCOMMODATE YOUR

18:34.766 --> 18:38.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REQUEST TO SPEAK TO US TODAY.
BUT WE ALSO EXPECT TO HAVE YOUR

18:38.600 --> 18:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COMMITMENT TO COOPERATE WITH ALL
FUTURE REQUESTS AND MAKE

18:42.600 --> 18:46.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOURSELF AVAILABLE AS NECESSARY
TO THIS COMMITTEE FOR, AS THE

18:46.566 --> 18:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHAIRMAN HAS INDICATED THIS VERY
IMPORTANT INVESTIGATION.

18:49.800 --> 18:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NOW LET'S MOVE TO THE SUBJECT OF
TODAY'S DISCUSSION.

18:53.366 --> 18:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LET'S START WITH THE CAMPAIGN.
YOU WERE AN EARLY AND ARDENT

18:57.400 --> 19:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUPPORTER OF MR. TRUMP.
AS MARCH YOU WERE NAMED AS

19:00.833 --> 19:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHAIRMAN OF MR. TRUMP'S NATIONAL
SECURITY ADVISORY COMMITTEE.

19:04.800 --> 19:07.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU WERE MUCH MORE THAN A
SURROGATE, YOU WERE AN ADVISOR

19:07.966 --> 19:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT HELPED SHAPE THE NATIONAL
SECURITY STRATEGY.

19:14.366 --> 19:17.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NO DOUBT YOU WILL HAVE KEY
INSIGHTS ABOUT SOME OF THE KEY

19:17.066 --> 19:21.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP ASSOCIATES THAT WE'RE
SEEKING TO HEAR FROM IN THE

19:21.766 --> 19:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WEEKS AHEAD. QUESTIONS
HAVE ALSO BEEN RAVED RAISED

19:25.000 --> 19:27.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ABOUT SOME YOUR OWN INTERACTIONS
WITH RUSSIAN OFFICIALS DURING

19:27.966 --> 19:31.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE CAMPAIGN.
DURING THE CAMPAIGN IN JANUARY

19:31.166 --> 19:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU SAID, QUOTE YOU DID NOT HAVE
COMMUNICATIONS WITH RUSSIANS,

19:35.133 --> 19:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SENATOR LEAHY ASKED YOU IF YOU
WERE IN CONTACT WITH THE RUSSIAN

19:41.866 --> 19:46.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GOVERNMENT, YOU ANSWERED A
DEFINITIVE NO.

19:48.333 --> 19:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DESPITE THAT THE FACT IS AS WE
DISCOVERED LATER THAT YOU DID

19:53.833 --> 19:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HAVE INTERACTIONS WITH RUSSIAN
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DURING THE

19:55.400 --> 19:59.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COURSE OF THE CAMPAIGN.
IN MARCH YOU ACKNOWLEDGED TWO

19:59.000 --> 20:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MEETINGS WITH THE RUSSIAN
AMBASSADOR YET THERE'S ALSO BEEN

20:02.600 --> 20:06.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOME PUBLIC REPORTS OF A
POSSIBLE THIRD MEETING AT THE

20:06.100 --> 20:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAYFLOWER HOTEL ON MAIZE 27th.
I HOPE TODAY YOU WILL HELP CLEAR

20:12.466 --> 20:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UP THOSE DISCREPANCIES.
WE HOPE THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT

20:15.766 --> 20:19.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU WILL BE WILLING TO PROVIDE
THE COMMITTEE WITH ANY DOCUMENTS

20:19.266 --> 20:23.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WE WOULD NEED TO SHED LIGHT ON
THIS ISSUE SUCH AS E-MAILS OR

20:23.266 --> 20:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CALENDAR.
THEN THERE'S TOP OF THE FIERKS

20:26.200 --> 20:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OF FORMER FBI DIRECTOR COMEY.
LAST WEEK WE RECEIVED TESTIMONY

20:32.666 --> 20:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FROM MR. COMEY UNDER OATH, HE
YOINLTED HIS VERY -- OUTLINED

20:35.733 --> 20:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HIS VERY TROUBLING INTERACTIONS
WITH THE PRESIDENT AS WELL AS

20:39.633 --> 20:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS FIRING.
A PHI DISTURBING POINTS STOOD --

20:42.333 --> 20:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A FEW DISTURBING POINTS STOOD
OUT.

20:45.133 --> 20:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FIRST MR. COMEY WHO HAS DECADES
OF EXPERIENCE AT THE DEPARTMENT

20:51.533 --> 20:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OF JUSTICE AND AT THE FBI
SERVING UNDER PRESIDENTS OF BOTH

20:54.066 --> 20:58.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PARTIES, WAS SO UNNERVED BY THE
ACTIONS OF THE PRESIDENT THAT HE

20:58.700 --> 21:03.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
FELT, QUOTE, COMPELLED
TOFULLY TO FULLYDOCUMENT
EVERY INTERACTION THEY

21:04.766 --> 21:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HAD.
MR. COMEY SAT WHERE YOU ARE

21:07.200 --> 21:12.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SITTING TODAY AND SAID THAT HE
WAS CONCERNED THAT THE PRESIDENT

21:12.166 --> 21:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OF THE UNITED STATES MIGHT LIE
ABOUT THE NATURE OF THEIR

21:15.766 --> 21:18.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MEETINGS.
THAT'S A SHOCKING STATEMENT FROM

21:18.466 --> 21:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ONE OF OUR NATION'S TOP LAW
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.

21:22.100 --> 21:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WE ALSO HEARD THAT DIRECTOR
COMEY TOOK IT AS A DIRECTION

21:25.533 --> 21:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FROM THE PRESIDENT THAT HE WAS
TO DROP THE FBI'S INVESTIGATION

21:28.533 --> 21:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INTO FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY
ADVISOR GENERAL MIKE FLYNN.

21:32.833 --> 21:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FINALLY WE HEARD FROM MR. COMEY
THAT HE BELIEVES HE WAS FIRED

21:36.533 --> 21:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OVER HIS HANDLING OF THE RUSSIA
INVESTIGATION.

21:39.500 --> 21:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF CONFIRMED
THIS IN STATEMENTS TO THE MEDIA.

21:44.233 --> 21:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THIS IS DEEPLY TROUBLING, FOR
ALL OF US, WHO BELIEVE ON BOTH

21:47.433 --> 21:50.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SIDES OF THE AISLE IN PRESERVING
THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE FBI.

21:50.366 --> 21:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK IN ORDER
TO FOLLOW UP ON THESE ALARMING

21:56.633 --> 21:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DISCLOSURES.
MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL, YOUR

21:58.233 --> 22:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TESTIMONY TODAY IS AN
OPPORTUNITY TO BEGIN THE PROCESS

22:01.533 --> 22:05.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OF ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS.
FOR INSTANCE, AGAIN, I KNOW

22:05.233 --> 22:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OTHERS WILL ASK ABOUT THIS, YOU
RECUSED YOURSELF FROM THE

22:08.100 --> 22:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION, YET YOU
PARTICIPATED IN THE COMEY FIRING

22:12.833 --> 22:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OVER THE HANDLING OF THAT VERY
INVESTIGATION.

22:15.033 --> 22:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WE WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU COMPLIED
FULLY AND IN ADDITION WE HEARD

22:22.900 --> 22:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FROM MR. COMEY LAST WEEKLY THAT
THE PRESIDENT ASKED YOU TO LEAVE

22:25.433 --> 22:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE OVAL OFFICE SO HE COULD
SPEAK ONE ON ONE WITH MR. COMEY.

22:31.866 --> 22:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AGAIN, A VERY CONCERNING ACTION.
WE WILL NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU

22:35.133 --> 22:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ABOUT HOW YOU REVIEWED -- HOW
YOU VIEWED THE PRESIDENT'S

22:38.100 --> 22:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REQUEST AND WHETHER YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS APPROPRIATE.

22:41.600 --> 22:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WE'LL ALSO WANT TO KNOW IF YOU
ARE AWARE OF ANY ATTEMPTS BY THE

22:45.533 --> 22:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRESIDENT TO ENLIST LEADERS IN
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY TO

22:48.466 --> 22:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNDERMINE THIS VERY SAME RUSSIA
INVESTIGATION.

22:52.333 --> 22:56.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MOST IMPORTANTLY, OUR COMMITTEE
WILL WANT TO HEAR WHAT YOU ARE

22:56.366 --> 22:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DOING TO ENSURE THAT THE RUSSIAN
HE OR ANY OTHER FOREIGN

22:59.700 --> 23:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ADVERSARIES CANNOT ATTACK OUR
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS LIKE THIS

23:03.733 --> 23:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EVER AGAIN.
I'M CONCERNED THAT THE PRESIDENT

23:07.633 --> 23:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STILL DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE
SEVERITY OF THE THREAT.

23:11.633 --> 23:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HE TO DATE I BELIEVE HAS NOT
EVEN ACKNOWLEDGED THE UNANIMOUS

23:14.633 --> 23:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CONCLUSIONS OF THE U.S.
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY THAT

23:17.400 --> 23:21.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUSSIA MASSIVELY INTERVENED IN
OUR ELECTIONS.

23:21.766 --> 23:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE THREAT WE FACE IS REAL.
AND IT'S NOT LIMITED TO US.

23:25.333 --> 23:29.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE RECENT EVENTS IN FRANCE ARE
AGAIN A STORK REMINDER THAT ALL

23:29.666 --> 23:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WESTERN DEMOCRACIES MUST TAKE
STEPS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES.

23:33.033 --> 23:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I BELIEVE THE UNITED STATES CAN
AND MUST BE A LEADER IN THIS

23:37.200 --> 23:39.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
EFFORT.
BUT ALL REQUIRE OUR

23:39.200 --> 23:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION TO GET SERIOUS
ABOUT THIS MATTER.

23:42.333 --> 23:44.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FINALLY IN THE PAST SEVERAL
WEEKS WE'VE SEEN A CONCERNING

23:44.366 --> 23:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PATTERN OF ADMINISTRATION
OFFICIALS REFUSING TO ANSWER

23:48.700 --> 23:53.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PUBLIC UNCLASSIFIED QUESTIONS,
ABOUT ALLEGATIONS ABOUT THE

23:55.100 --> 23:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRESIDENT IN THIS INVESTIGATION.

23:56.933 --> 23:59.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUBJECT LAST WEEK.
I WANT TO COMMEND THE CHAIRMAN

23:59.100 --> 24:03.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WHO, AT THE END OF THAT HEARING,
MADE VERY CLEAR THAT OUR

24:03.266 --> 24:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WITNESSES, IT WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE
FOR OUR WITNESSES TO COME BEFORE

24:06.633 --> 24:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CONGRESS WITHOUT ANSWERS.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO

24:09.900 --> 24:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN, I LOOK

24:32.233 --> 24:36.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SESSIONS.

24:36.133 --> 24:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

ALLOWING ME TO APPEAR BEFORE THE
COMMITTEE TODAY.

24:43.766 --> 24:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT EFFORTS TO

24:48.033 --> 24:52.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVESTIGATE RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE
WITH OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.

24:52.966 --> 24:57.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUCH INTERFERENCE CAN NEVER BE
TOLERATED AND I ENCOURAGE ANY

24:59.266 --> 25:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EFFORTS TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF
ANY SUCH ALLEGATIONS.

25:02.166 --> 25:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AS YOU KNOW THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY
GENERAL HAS APPOINTED A SPECIAL

25:06.433 --> 25:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE THE

25:09.900 --> 25:13.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016
ELECTION.

25:13.400 --> 25:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'M HERE TODAY TO ADDRESS
SEVERAL ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN

25:16.300 --> 25:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SPECIFICALLY RAISED BEFORE THIS

BUT AS I ADVISE YOU,

MR. CHAIRMAN AND CONSISTENT WITH

25:37.333 --> 25:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIAL
COMMUNICATIONS I HAVE WITH THE

25:40.466 --> 25:43.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRESIDENT.
NOW LET ME ADDRESS SOME ISSUES

25:43.800 --> 25:45.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DIRECTLY.
I DID NOT HAVE ANY PRIVATE

25:45.833 --> 25:50.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MEETINGS, NOR DO I RECALL ANY
CONVERSATIONS WITH ANY RUSSIAN

25:51.966 --> 25:53.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OFFICIALS AT THE MAYFLOWER
HOTEL.

25:53.466 --> 25:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I DID NOT ATTEND ANY MEETINGS AT
THAT EVENT SEPARATE, PRIOR TO

25:57.333 --> 26:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE SPEECH I ATTENDED BY THE
PRESIDENT, TODAY, I ATTENDED A

26:03.800 --> 26:06.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RECEPTION WITH MY STAFF THAT
INCLUDED AT LEAST TWO DOZEN

26:06.700 --> 26:10.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PEOPLE AND PRESIDENT TRUMP.
THOUGH I DO RECALL SEVERAL

26:10.466 --> 26:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CONVERSATIONS THAT I HAD DURING
THAT PRE-SPEECH RECEPTION, I DO

26:15.233 --> 26:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NOT HAVE ANY RECOLLECTION OF
MEETING OR TALKING TO THE

26:18.533 --> 26:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR OR ANY OTHER
RUSSIAN OFFICIALS.

26:22.766 --> 26:25.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IF ANY BRIEF INTERACTION
OCCURRED IN PASSING WITH THE

26:25.966 --> 26:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR DURING THAT
RECEPTION, I DO NOT REMEMBER IT.

26:29.600 --> 26:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AFTER THE SPEECH I WAS
INTERVIEWED BY THE NEWS MEDIA,

26:32.800 --> 26:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THERE WAS AN AREA FOR THAT.
IN A DIFFERENT ROOM.

26:35.933 --> 26:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND THEN I LEFT THE HOTEL.
BUT WHETHER I EVER ATTENDED A

26:39.400 --> 26:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EXCEPTION WHERE THE RUSSIAN
AMBASSADOR WAS ALSO PRESENT IS

26:45.800 --> 26:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ENTIRETY BESIDE THE POINT OF
THIS INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIAN

26:49.333 --> 26:53.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016
CAMPAIGN.

26:53.066 --> 26:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LET ME STATE THIS CLEARLY,
COLLEAGUES: I HAVE NEVER MET

26:57.333 --> 27:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WITH OR HAD ANY CONVERSATION
WITH ANY RUSSIANS OR ANY FOREIGN

27:02.233 --> 27:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OFFICIALS CONCERNING ANY TYPE OF
INTERFERENCE WITH ANY CAMPAIGN

27:06.966 --> 27:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OR ELECTION IN THE UNITED
STATES.

27:08.900 --> 27:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FURTHER, I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF
ANY SUCH CONVERSATIONS BY ANYONE

27:13.566 --> 27:18.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CONNECTED TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
I WAS YOUR COLLEAGUE IN THIS

27:18.266 --> 27:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BODY FOR 20 YEARS, AT LEAST SOME
OF YOU.

27:22.000 --> 27:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND I -- AND THE SUGGEST THAT I
PARTICIPATED IN ANY CONCLUSION

27:29.133 --> 27:32.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT I WAS AWARE OF ANY
CONCLUSION WITH THE RUSSIAN

27:32.000 --> 27:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GOVERNMENT, TO HURT THIS
COUNTRY, WHICH I HAVE SERVED

27:35.833 --> 27:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WITH HONOR FOR 35 YEARS, OR TO
UNDERMINE THE INTEGRITY OF OUR

27:42.233 --> 27:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, IS AN
APPALLING AND DETESTABLE LIE.

27:46.833 --> 27:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RELATHEED -- RELATEDLY, THERE IS
AN ASSERTION THAT I DID NOT

27:51.033 --> 27:55.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ANSWER SENATOR FRANKEN'S
QUESTION.

27:55.233 --> 28:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COLLEAGUES, THAT IS FALSE.
I CAN'T SAY COLLEAGUES, I'M NO

28:01.800 --> 28:05.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LONGER A PART OF THIS BODY BUT
FORMER COLLEAGUES, THAT IS

28:05.900 --> 28:09.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
FALSE.
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED.

28:09.566 --> 28:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SENATOR FRANKEN ASKED ME A
RAMBLING QUESTION AFTER SOME SIX

28:13.233 --> 28:18.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOURS OF TESTIMONY THAT INCLUDED
DRAMATIC NEW ALLEGATIONS THAT

28:19.666 --> 28:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE UNITED STATES INTELLIGENCE
COMMUNITY, THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE

28:24.066 --> 28:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COMMUNITY, HAD ADVISED PRESIDENT
ELECT TRUMP, QUOTE, THAT THERE

28:28.633 --> 28:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WAS A CONTINUING EXCHANGE OF
INFORMATION DURING THE CAMPAIGN

28:35.100 --> 28:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BETWEEN TRUMP'S SURROGATES AND
INTERMEDIARIES FOR THE RUSSIAN

28:38.000 --> 28:39.933 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
GOVERNMENT.
CLOSE QUOTE.

28:39.933 --> 28:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I WAS TAKEN ABACK BY THAT
EXPLOSIVE ALLEGATION.

28:44.733 --> 28:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WHICH HE SAID WAS BEING REPORTED
AS BREAKING NEWS THAT VERY DAY.

28:49.200 --> 28:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND WHICH I HAD NOT HEARD.
I WANTED TO REFUTE THAT,

28:53.900 --> 28:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IMMEDIATELY.
ANY SUGGESTION THAT I WAS PART

28:56.333 --> 29:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OF SUCH AN ACTIVITY, I APPLIED,
QUOTE, I APPLIED TO SENATOR

29:02.333 --> 29:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRANKEN THIS WAY, I REPLIED THIS
WAY.

29:03.733 --> 29:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SENATOR FRANKEN I'M NOT AWARE OF
ANY OF THOSE ACTIVITIES.

29:07.400 --> 29:10.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I HAVE BEEN CALLED A SURROGATE A
TIME OR WOULD IN THAT CAMPAIGN

29:10.800 --> 29:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND I DID NOT HAVE
COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE RUSSIAN

29:16.933 --> 29:19.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND I'M UNABLE TO COMMENT ON IT.
CLOAT QUOTE.

29:19.200 --> 29:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLOSE QUOTE.
THAT WAS THE CONTEXT IN WHICH I

29:22.900 --> 29:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WAS ASKED THE QUESTION AND IN
THAT CONTEXT MY ANSWER WAS A

29:26.900 --> 29:31.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FAIR AND CORRECT RESPONSE TO THE
CHARGE AS I UNDERSTOOD IT.

29:31.466 --> 29:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I WAS RESPONDING TO THIS
ALLEGATION THAT WE HAD MET --

29:36.000 --> 29:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SURROGATES HAD BEEN MEETING WITH
THE RUSSIANS ON A REGULAR BASIS.

29:39.233 --> 29:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IT SIMPLY DID NOT OCCUR TO ME
THAN GO FURTHER THAN THE CONTEXT

29:43.233 --> 29:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OF THE QUESTION AND TO LIST ANY
CONVERSATIONS THAT I MAY HAVE

29:47.233 --> 29:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HAD WITH RUSSIANS IN ROUTINE
SITUATIONS, AS I HAD HAD MANY

29:53.700 --> 29:58.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROUTINE SITUATIONS -- MEETINGS
WITH OTHER FOREIGN OFFICIALS.

29:58.400 --> 30:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SO PLEASE HEAR ME NOW.
AND IT WAS ONLY IN MARCH, AFTER

30:02.666 --> 30:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MY CONFIRMATION HEARING, THAT A
REPORTER ASKED MY SPOKESPERSON

30:07.566 --> 30:11.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WHETHER I HAD EVER MET WITH ANY
RUSSIAN OFFICIALS.

30:11.766 --> 30:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT
QUESTION HAD SQUARELY BEEN POSED

30:15.066 --> 30:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TO ME.
ON THE SAME DAY WE PROVIDED THAT

30:17.933 --> 30:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REPORTER WITH THE INFORMATION
RELATED TO THE MEETING THAT I

30:21.500 --> 30:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND MY STAFF HAD HELD IN MY
SENATE OFFICE WITH AMBASSADOR

30:25.200 --> 30:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KISLYAK, AS WELL AS THE BRIEF
ENCOUNTER IN JULY AFTER A BRIEF

30:30.033 --> 30:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SPEECH I HAD GIVEN IN CLEVELAND,
OHIO.

30:36.500 --> 30:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I ALSO PROVIDED THE REPORTER
WITH A LIST OF 25 FOREIGN

30:42.633 --> 30:46.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMBASSADOR MEETINGS THAT I'D HAD
DURING 2016.

30:46.100 --> 30:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IN ADDITION, I PROVIDED
SUPPLEMENTAL TESTIMONY TO THE

30:49.833 --> 30:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO
EXPLAIN THIS EVENT.

30:54.533 --> 30:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SO I READILY ACKNOWLEDGE THESE
TWO MEETINGS AND CERTAINLY NOT

30:59.166 --> 31:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ONE THING HAPPENED THAT WAS
IMPROPER IN ANY ONE OF THOSE

31:03.500 --> 31:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MEETINGS.
LET ME ALSO EXPLAIN CLEARLY THE

31:06.366 --> 31:11.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CIRCUMSTANCES OF MY RECUSAL FROM
THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE

31:11.033 --> 31:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE WITH THE
2016 ELECTION.

31:14.200 --> 31:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PLEASE, COLLEAGUES, HEAR ME ON
THIS.

31:16.800 --> 31:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I WAS SWORN IN AS ATTORNEY
GENERAL ON THURSDAY, FEBRUARY

31:20.700 --> 31:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
9th.
THE VERY NEXT DAY, AS I HAD

31:23.933 --> 31:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PROMISED TO THE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE I WOULD DO, AT LEAST

31:28.333 --> 31:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AT AN EARLY DATE, I MET WITH
CAREER DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS

31:31.633 --> 31:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INCLUDING A SENIOR ETHICS
OFFICIAL, TO DISCUSS SOME THINGS

31:36.633 --> 31:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PUBLICLY REPORTED IN THE PRESS
THAT MIGHT HAVE SOME BEARING ON

31:40.566 --> 31:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WHETHER OR NOT I SHOULD RECUSE
MYSELF IN THIS CASE.

31:44.900 --> 31:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FROM THAT POINT, FEBRUARY
10th, UNTIL I ANNOUNCED MY

31:48.033 --> 31:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FORMAL RECUSAL ON MARCH 2nd, I
WAS NEVER BRIEFED ON ANY

31:54.500 --> 31:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVESTIGATIVE DETAILS, DID NOT
ACCESS ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE

31:58.133 --> 32:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVESTIGATION.
I RECEIVED ONLY THE LIMITED

32:01.633 --> 32:05.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INFORMATION THAT THE
DEPARTMENT'S CAREER OFFICIALS

32:05.100 --> 32:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DETERMINED WAS NECESSARY FOR ME
TO FORMAT AND MAKE A RECUSAL

32:09.766 --> 32:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DECISION.
AS SUCH, I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE

32:12.566 --> 32:17.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ABOUT THIS INVESTIGATION, AS IT
IS ONGOING TODAY, BEYOND WHAT

32:18.933 --> 32:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HAS BEEN PUBLICLY REPORTED.
I DON'T EVEN READ THAT

32:20.266 --> 32:23.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAREFULLY.
AND I HAVE TAKEN NO ACTION

32:23.500 --> 32:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WHATSOEVER WITH REGARD TO ANY
SUCH INVESTIGATION.

32:28.333 --> 32:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ON THE DATE OF MY FORMAL RECUSAL
MY CHIEF OF STAFF SENT AN E-MAIL

32:33.033 --> 32:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TO THE HEADS OF RELEVANT
DEPARTMENTS, INCLUDING BY NAME

32:36.600 --> 32:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TO DIRECTOR COMEY OF THE FBI, TO
INSTRUCT THEM TO INFORM THEIR

32:43.066 --> 32:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STAFFS OF THIS RECUSAL AND TO
ADVISE THEM NOT TO BRIEF ME OR

32:48.433 --> 32:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVOLVE ME IN ANY WAY IN ANY
SUCH MATTERS.

32:51.433 --> 32:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND IN FACT THEY HAVE NOT.
IMPORTANTLY: I RECUSED MYSELF

32:58.366 --> 33:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NOT BECAUSE OF ANY ASSERTED
WRONGDOING, OR ANY BELIEF THAT I

33:03.333 --> 33:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN ANY
WRONGDOING IN THE CAMPAIGN, BUT

33:07.600 --> 33:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BECAUSE A DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
REGULATION, 28 CFR 45.2, I FELT

33:15.500 --> 33:18.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REQUIRED IT.
THAT REGULATION STATES IN EFFECT

33:18.766 --> 33:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES SHOULD
NOT PARTICIPATE IN

33:22.233 --> 33:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVESTIGATIONS OF A CAMPAIGN IF
THEY SERVED AS A CAMPAIGN

33:28.366 --> 33:32.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ADVISOR.
SO THE SCOPE OF MY RECUSAL,

33:32.066 --> 33:37.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOWEVER, DOES NOT AND CANNOT
INTERFERE WITH MY ABILITY TO

33:38.500 --> 33:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OVERSEE THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE, INCLUDING THE FBI,

33:43.866 --> 33:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WHICH HAS AN $8 BILLION BUDGET,
AND 35,000 EMPLOYEES.

33:49.633 --> 33:53.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I PRESENTED TO THE PRESIDENT MY
CONCERNS, AND THOSE OF DEPUTY

33:53.500 --> 33:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN

33:57.866 --> 34:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

34:02.800 --> 34:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

MEMORANDUM ON THAT ISSUE WHICH
HAD BEEN RELEASED PUBLICLY BY

34:11.166 --> 34:16.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE WHITE HOUSE, THOSE REPRESENT
A CLEAR STATEMENT OF MY VIEWS.

34:17.533 --> 34:21.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I ADOPTED DEPUTY ATTORNEY
GENERAL ROSENSTEIN'S POSITIONS.

34:23.666 --> 34:28.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
IT IS
RENDER THE ATTORNEY

34:34.066 --> 34:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GENERAL UNABLE TO MANAGE THE
LEADERSHIP OF THE VARIOUS

34:37.300 --> 34:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICER LAW
ENFORCEMENT COMPONENTS THAT

34:41.166 --> 34:43.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CONDUCTION THOUSANDS OF
INVESTIGATIONS.

34:43.800 --> 34:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FINALLY, DURING HIS TESTIMONY,
MR. COMEY DISCUSSED A

34:47.833 --> 34:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CONVERSATION THAT HE AND I HAD
ABOUT THE MEETING MR. COMEY HAD

34:52.233 --> 34:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WITH THE PRESIDENT.
I'M HAPPY TO SHARE WITH THE

34:56.433 --> 34:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

35:25.433 --> 35:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I RESPONDED, HE DIDN'T RECALL
THIS, BUT I RESPONDED TO HIS

35:31.833 --> 35:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COMMENT, BY AGREEING THAT THE
FBI AND THE DEPARTMENT OF

35:35.533 --> 35:38.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUSTICE NEEDED TO BE CAREFUL TO
FOLLOW DEPARTMENT POLICIES

35:38.900 --> 35:43.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REGARDING APPROPRIATE CONTACTS
WITH THE WHITE HOUSE.

35:43.166 --> 35:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MR. COMEY HAD SERVED IN THE
DEPARTMENT FOR BETTER THAN TWO

35:46.500 --> 35:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DECADES AND I WAS CONFIDENT THAT
HE UNDERSTOOD AND WOULD ABIDE BY

35:51.333 --> 35:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE WELL-ESTABLISHED RULES
LIMITING COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE

35:55.066 --> 35:58.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WHITE HOUSE, ESPECIALLY ABOUT
ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS.

35:58.966 --> 36:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT'S WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT TO
CONTROL.

36:01.600 --> 36:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MY COMMENTS ENCOURAGED HIM TO DO
JUST THAT, AND INDEED AS I

36:05.600 --> 36:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNDERSTAND IT, HE DID IN FACT
DID THAT.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OUR DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE RULES
ON PROPER COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN

36:11.666 --> 36:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE DEPARTMENT AND THE WHITE
HOUSE HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR

36:14.766 --> 36:16.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YEARS.
MR. COMEY WELL KNEW THEM.

36:16.966 --> 36:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I THOUGHT AND ASSUMED CORRECTLY
THAT HE COMPLIED WITH THEM.

36:23.366 --> 36:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SO I'LL FINISH WITH THIS: I
RECUSED MYSELF FROM ANY

36:26.933 --> 36:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAMPAIGN
FOR PRESIDENT, BUT I DID NOT

36:31.700 --> 36:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RECUSE MYSELF FROM DEFENDING MY
HONOR AGAINST SCURRILOUS AND

36:36.233 --> 36:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FALSE ALLEGATIONS.
AT ALL TIMES THROUGHOUT THE

BECOMING ATTORNEY GENERAL, I
HAVE DEDICATED MYSELF TO THE

36:48.900 --> 36:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HIGHEST STANDARDS.
I'VE EARNED A REPUTATION FOR

36:53.033 --> 36:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT.
AT HOME AND IN THIS BODY, I

36:55.600 --> 36:59.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BELIEVE, OVER DECADES OF
PERFORMANCE.

36:59.566 --> 37:03.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY
EXPECT AN HONEST AND TRANSPARENT

WE'RE GIVING THEM.

37:06.933 --> 37:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THIS PRESIDENT WANTS TO FOCUS ON
THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY TO

37:10.300 --> 37:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ENSURE THEY ARE TREATED FAIRLY,

THE LIVES OF THE AMERICAN

37:16.866 --> 37:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

37:19.900 --> 37:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

AGENDAS, BUT THAT IS HIS AGENDA

37:23.733 --> 37:27.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AND IT'S ONE I SHARE.

THE PRESIDENT GAVE HIS FIRST
FOREIGN POLICY SPEECH AND IT'S

YOU DON'T REMEMBER WHETHER
AMBASSADOR KISLYAK WAS THERE,

FIRST MAJOR FOREIGN POLICY

43:57.133 --> 44:01.300 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
READ FROM IT.
28 CFR 45.2.

44:01.300 --> 44:05.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNLESS AUTHORIZED, NO EMPLOYEE
SHALL PARTICIPATE IN A CRIMINAL

44:05.166 --> 44:10.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVESTIGATION OR PROSECUTION IF
HE HAS A PERSONAL OR POLITICAL

44:11.600 --> 44:15.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RELATIONSHIP WITH ANY PERSON
INVOLVED IN THE CONDUCT OF AN

44:16.600 --> 44:20.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
INVESTIGATION.
IT GOES ON TO SAY FOR

44:20.000 --> 44:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
POLITICAL -- IN A POLITICAL
CAMPAIGN, AND IT SAYS IF YOU

44:27.100 --> 44:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HAVE A CLOSE IDENTIFICATION WITH
AN ELECTED OFFICIAL, OR

44:31.333 --> 44:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CANDIDATE, ARISING FROM SERVICE
AS A PRINCIPAL ADVISOR, YOU

44:37.733 --> 44:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHOULD NOT -- YOU SHOULD NOT
PARTICIPATE IN AN INVESTIGATION

44:42.833 --> 44:46.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OF THAT CAMPAIGN.
SO MANY HAVE SUGGESTED THAT MY

44:46.866 --> 44:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RECUSAL IS BECAUSE I FELT I WAS
A SUBJECT OF THE INVESTIGATION

44:51.533 --> 44:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MYSELF.
THAT I MAY HAVE DONE SOMETHING

44:54.800 --> 44:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WRONG.
BUT THIS IS THE REASON I RECUSED

44:57.233 --> 45:00.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MYSELF.
I FELT I WAS REQUIRED TO UNDER

45:00.000 --> 45:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE RULES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE, AND AS A LEADER OF THE

45:03.833 --> 45:07.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE I SHOULD
COMPLY WITH THE RULES OBVIOUSLY.

45:07.366 --> 45:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> SO DID YOUR LEGAL COUNSEL
BASICALLY KNOW FROM DAY ONE THAT

45:11.133 --> 45:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU WOULD HAVE TO RECUSE
YOURSELF BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT

45:14.300 --> 45:17.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STATUTE?
>> I DO HAVE A TIME LINE OF WHAT

45:17.766 --> 45:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OCCURRED.
I WAS SWORN IN ON THE 9th I

45:22.300 --> 45:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BELIEVE OF FEBRUARY.
I THEN -- ON THE 10th HAD MY

45:28.700 --> 45:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FIRST MEETING TO GENERALLY
DISCUSS THIS ISSUE, WHERE THE

45:31.733 --> 45:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CFR WAS NOT DISCUSSED.
WE HAD SEVERAL OTHER MEETINGS,

45:38.133 --> 45:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND IT BECAME CLEAR TO ME OVER
TIME THAT I QUALIFIED AS A

45:43.400 --> 45:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SIGNIFICANT -- A PRINCIPAL
ADVISOR-TYPE PERSON TO THE

45:50.100 --> 45:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAMPAIGN, AND IT WAS THE
APPROPRIATE AND RIGHT THING FOR

45:52.100 --> 45:55.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ME TO RECUSE MYSELF.
>> SO THIS COULD EXPLAIN

45:55.233 --> 45:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DIRECTOR COMEY'S COMMENTS THAT
HE KNEW THERE WAS A LIKELIHOOD

45:59.933 --> 46:02.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT YOU WERE TO RECUSE YOURSELF
BECAUSE HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE

46:02.366 --> 46:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAME STATUTORY?
>> I THINK PROBABLY -- STATUTE?

46:06.133 --> 46:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> I THINK PROBABLY SO.
I THINK THE ATTORNEYS IN THE

46:09.400 --> 46:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE PROBABLY
COMMUNICATED WITH HIM.

46:12.600 --> 46:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BECAUSE MR. CHAIRMAN, LET ME SAY
THIS TO YOU CLEARLY: IN EFFECT,

46:18.933 --> 46:22.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I REACCUSED
RECUSEEDMYSELF THAT DAY.

46:22.366 --> 46:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I NEVER RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION
ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN.

46:26.733 --> 46:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I THOUGHT THERE WAS A PROBLEM
WITH ME SERVE IS AS ATTORNEY

46:33.200 --> 46:36.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GENERAL OVER THIS ISSUE AND I
THOUGHT I MIGHT HAVE TO RECUSE

46:36.166 --> 46:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MYSELF AND I TOOK THE POSITION
CORRECTLY I BELIEVE, NOT TO

46:42.566 --> 46:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVOLVE MYSELF IN THE CAMPAIGN
IN ANY WAY AND I DID NOT.

46:45.533 --> 46:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> YOU MADE REFERENCE TO YOUR
CHIEF OF STAFF SENDING OUT AN

46:50.233 --> 46:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
E-MAIL IMMEDIATELY NOTIFYING
INTERNALLY OF YOUR DECISION TO

46:54.533 --> 46:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RECUSE.
WOULD YOU MAKE -- WOULD YOU ASK

46:55.933 --> 46:58.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOUR CHIEF OF STAFF TO MAKE THAT
E-MAIL AVAILABLE?

46:58.800 --> 47:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> I WILL AND I THINK I HAVE IT
WITH ME TODAY.

47:02.133 --> 47:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> THANK YOU GENERAL SESSIONS.
HAVE YOU HAD ANY CONTACT WITH

47:05.300 --> 47:10.300 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
MR. MUELLER?
>> I HAVE NOT.

47:11.700 --> 47:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DIRECTOR COMEY INDICATED THAT HE
DID NOT KNOW WHEN I RECUSED

47:19.200 --> 47:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MYSELF OR DIDN'T RECEIVE NOTICE,
ONE OF THOSE E-MAILS WENT TO HIM

47:23.333 --> 47:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BY NAME.
A LOT OF THINGS HAPPEN IN OUR

47:26.566 --> 47:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OFFICES, I'M NOT ACCUSING HIM OF
ANY WRONGDOING BUT IN FACT IT

47:30.433 --> 47:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WAS SENT TO HIM AND TO HIS NAME.
>> GENERAL SESSIONS AS YOU SAID

47:37.333 --> 47:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MR. COMEY TESTIFIED AT LENGTH
BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ABOUT HIS

47:40.500 --> 47:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INTERINTERACTIONS WITH THE
PRESIDENT, HIGHLIGHTING YOUR

47:43.533 --> 47:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PART OF THE SESSION.
YOU HIGHLIGHTED THAT ALL WERE

47:48.500 --> 47:52.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ASKED EXCEPT MR. COMEY AND HE
HAD A PRIVATE MEETING WITH THE

47:52.966 --> 47:57.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRESIDENT AND YOU SAID THAT HE
DID INFORM YOU OF HOW

47:57.366 --> 48:02.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNCOMFORTABLE THAT WAS, AND YOUR
RECOMMENDATION WAS THAT THE FBI

48:03.733 --> 48:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND DOJ NEEDED TO FOLLOW THE
RULES LIMITED FURTHER

48:07.233 --> 48:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CORRESPONDENCE.
DID DIRECTOR COMEY EVER EXPRESS

48:11.733 --> 48:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ADDITIONAL DISCOMFORT WITH
CONVERSATIONS THAT THE PRESIDENT

48:16.466 --> 48:18.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIGHT HAVE HAD WITH HIM?
BECAUSE HE HAD TWO ADDITIONAL

48:18.600 --> 48:23.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MEETINGS AND I THINK A TOTAL OF
SIX PHONE CALLS.

48:24.900 --> 48:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> THAT IS CORRECT.
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THE

48:28.766 --> 48:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRESIDENT HAVING A COMMUNICATION
WITH THE FBI DIRECTOR.

48:32.733 --> 48:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WHAT IS PROBLEMATIC FOR ANY
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE EMPLOYEE

48:37.200 --> 48:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IS TO TALK TO ANY CABINET
PERSONS OR WHITE HOUSE

48:40.933 --> 48:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OFFICIALS, HIGH OFFICIALS ABOUT
ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE

48:47.400 --> 48:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NOT PROPERLY CLEARED THROUGH THE
TOP LEVELS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

48:50.733 --> 48:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUSTICE.
AND SO IT WAS A REGULATION I THY

48:57.166 --> 48:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IS -- I THINK IS HEALTHY, I
THINK WE STRONGLY BELIEVED WE

48:59.966 --> 49:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NEEDED TO RESTORE DISCIPLINE
WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT TO ADHERE

49:04.033 --> 49:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TO THOSE JUST THOSE KIND OF
RULES PLUS LEAKING RULES THAT

49:08.033 --> 49:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARE A BIT I THINK LAX AND NEED
TO BE RESTORED.

49:14.400 --> 49:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> YOU COULDN'T HAVE HAD A
CONVERSATION WITH THE PRESIDENT

49:15.900 --> 49:18.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION BECAUSE
YOU WERE NEVER BRIEFED ON THE

49:18.600 --> 49:20.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
INVESTIGATION?
>> THAT IS CORRECT.

49:20.766 --> 49:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE -- I DO -- WOULD NOTE THAT
WITH REGARD TO THE PRIVATE

49:25.233 --> 49:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MEETING THAT DIRECTOR COMEY HAD,
BY HIS OWN ADMISSION, I BELIEVE,

49:29.866 --> 49:32.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THERE ARE AS MANY AS SIX SUCH
MEETINGS.

49:32.600 --> 49:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEVERAL OF THEM HE HAD WITH
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

49:34.600 --> 49:37.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I THINK HE HAD TWO WITH
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

49:37.200 --> 49:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SO IT IS NOT IMPROPER PER SE BUT
IT WOULD NOT BE JUSTIFIED FOR A

49:43.666 --> 49:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TO SHARE
INFORMATION ABOUT AN ONGOING

49:46.633 --> 49:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVESTIGATION WITHOUT PRIOR
REVIEW AND CLEARANCE FROM ABOVE.

49:50.533 --> 49:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> GENERAL SESSIONS JUST ONE
LAST QUESTION.

49:53.133 --> 49:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU WERE THE CHAIR OF THIS
FOREIGN POLICY TEAM FOR TRUMP

49:59.266 --> 50:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAMPAIGN.
TO THE BEST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE,

50:01.833 --> 50:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DID THAT TEAM EVER MEET?
>> WE MET A COUPLE OF TIMES,

50:09.466 --> 50:11.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAYBE.
SOME OF THE PEOPLE DID.

50:11.300 --> 50:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BUT WE NEVER FUNCTIONED,
FRANKLY, MR. CHAIRMAN, AS A

50:14.733 --> 50:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COHERENT TEAM.
WE HAD VARIOUS MEETINGS --

50:19.300 --> 50:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> WERE THERE ANY MEMBERS OF
THAT TEAM YOU NEVER MET?

50:22.033 --> 50:23.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:86.67% size:62.5%
>> YES.
>> OKAY.

50:23.966 --> 50:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VICE CHAIRMAN.
>> THANK YOU, GENERAL SESSIONS.

50:26.700 --> 50:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING
STATEMENT WE APPRECIATE YOUR

50:29.700 --> 50:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
APPEARANCE HERE BUT WE DO SEE
THIS AS THE FIRST STEP.

50:33.533 --> 50:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO GET
YOUR COMMITMENT THAT YOU AGREE

50:36.533 --> 50:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TO MAKE YOURSELF AVAILABLE, AS
THE COMMITTEE NEEDS, IN THE

50:39.633 --> 50:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WEEKS AND MONTHS AHEAD?
>> SENATOR WARNER, I WILL COMMIT

50:46.000 --> 50:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TO APPEAR BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE
AND OTHER COMMITTEES AS

50:49.233 --> 50:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
APPROPRIATE.
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD POLICY

50:51.800 --> 50:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TO CONTINUALLY BRING CABINET
MEMBERS OR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

50:55.133 --> 50:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THROUGH MULTIPLE COMMITTEES
GOING OVER THE SAME THINGS OVER

50:58.233 --> 51:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND OVER AGAIN.
>> THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE

51:00.633 --> 51:04.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAY WANT -- I'M SURE --
>> LET ME ASK ENTHUSE --

51:04.233 --> 51:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> I JUST GAVE YOU MY ANSWER.
>> LEGALITY ME ASK YOU, BECAUSE

51:07.633 --> 51:12.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THERE MAY BE QUESTIONS ABOUT
THESE MEETINGS OR NOT, THAT WE

51:12.500 --> 51:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COULD GET ACCESS TO MEMORANDUM
OR YOUR DAY BOOK OR --

51:17.033 --> 51:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> MR. CHAIRMAN WE WOULD BE GLAD
TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE RESPONSES

51:23.500 --> 51:26.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TO YOUR QUESTIONS AND REVIEW
THEM CAREFULLY AND TRY TO BE

51:26.300 --> 51:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RESPONSIVE.
>> YESTERDAY A SPOKESMAN FOR THE

51:29.900 --> 51:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRESIDENT WAS CONCERNED ABOUT
REMOVING DIRECTOR MUELLER, DO

51:37.733 --> 51:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU HAVE CONFIDENCE IN DIRECTOR
MUELLER'S REVIEW OF THESE

51:46.166 --> 51:51.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATTERS RESPONSIBLY?
>> AS FAR AS THEIR VALIDITY, I

51:52.933 --> 51:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HAVE KNOWN MR. MUELLER OVER THE
YEARS, HE SERVED 12 YEARS AS FBI

51:57.833 --> 52:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DIRECTOR, I KNEW HIM BEFORE
THAT.

52:01.600 --> 52:04.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AND I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN
MR. NEURL.

52:04.100 --> 52:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> YOU HAVE CONFIDENCE HE
COULD --

HYPOTHETICALS OR WHAT MAY BE A

52:09.200 --> 52:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FACTUAL SITUATION IN THE FUTURE.
>> I HAVE A SEARS OF QUESTIONS.

52:15.733 --> 52:20.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DO YOU BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT HAS
CONFIDENCE IN DR. E-DIRECTOR

52:20.400 --> 52:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MUELLER?
>> I DON'T KNOW, I HAVEN'T

52:21.866 --> 52:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TALKED TO HIM ABOUT IT.
>> IF WE COMMIT NOT TO TAKE ANY

52:28.500 --> 52:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DIRECT ACTION THAT WOULD LEAD TO
MR. MUELLER'S FIRING OR

52:35.966 --> 52:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DISMISSAL?
>> THE WAY ITS WORKS SENATOR

52:42.333 --> 52:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARNER IS THAT THE ACTING

TO TRY TO HAVE SPECIAL

52:56.266 --> 52:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVESTIGATOR MUELLER REMOVED?
>> I WOULDN'T THINK THAT WOULD

52:59.533 --> 53:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BE APPROPRIATE FOR ME TO DO.

53:02.300 --> 53:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE HAVE ANY
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OFFICIALS

53:05.966 --> 53:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BEEN INVOLVED WITH CONVERSATIONS
ABOUT ANY POSSIBILITY OF

PRESIDENTIAL PARDONS ABOUT ANY
OF THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED WITH

53:13.100 --> 53:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION?
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I'M NOT ABLE TO

53:17.233 --> 53:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COMMENT ON CONVERSATIONS WITH
HIGH OFFICIALS, WITHIN THE WHITE

53:23.700 --> 53:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOUSE, THAT WOULD BE A VIOLATION
OF THE COMMUNICATIONS RULE THAT

53:27.400 --> 53:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I HAVE TO --
>> IS THAT -- JUST SO I CAN

53:30.400 --> 53:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNDERSTAND IS THE BASIS OF THAT
UNWILLINGNESS TO ANSWER BASED ON

53:34.166 --> 53:39.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE OR WHAT --
>> IT'S A LONG STANDING POLICY

53:40.600 --> 53:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,
NOT TO COMMENT ON CONVERSATIONS

53:46.066 --> 53:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS
HAD WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE

53:49.800 --> 53:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNITED STATES FOR CONFIDENTIAL
REASONS THAT REALLY ARE FOUNDED

53:56.233 --> 53:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IN THE CO-EQUAL BRANCH, POWERS
AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE

53:59.400 --> 54:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNITED STATES.
>> BUT THAT -- SO JUST SO I'M

54:02.833 --> 54:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNDERSTANDING, DOES THAT MEAN
ARE YOU CLAIMING EXECUTIVE

54:05.333 --> 54:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRIVILEGE TODAY SIR?
>> I'M NOT CLAIMING EXECUTIVE

54:07.933 --> 54:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRIVILEGE BECAUSE THAT'S THE
PRESIDENT'S POWER AND I HAVE NO

54:10.533 --> 54:12.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
POWER TO CLAIM EXECUTIVE
PRIVILEGE.

54:12.000 --> 54:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> WHAT ABOUT PRIVILEGE OF OTHER
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS ABOUT

54:18.000 --> 54:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
POTENTIAL PARDONS, NOT THE
PRESIDENT SIR.

54:20.733 --> 54:25.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> MR. CHAIRMAN WITHOUT ANY
SUGGESTION THAT I'VE HAD ANY

54:25.600 --> 54:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CONVERSATIONS CONCERNING
PARDONS, TOTALLY PARDON FROM

54:28.500 --> 54:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT, THERE ARE COMMUNICATIONS
WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

54:34.900 --> 54:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT WE THEIR ALL OF US DO.
WE HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE FULL AND

54:37.633 --> 54:40.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ROBUST DEBATE WITHIN THE
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

54:40.466 --> 54:44.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO SPEAK UP
AND ARGUE CASES ON DIFFERENT

54:44.166 --> 54:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SIDES AND THOSE ARGUMENTS ARE
NOT REVEALED HISTORICALLY, WE

54:48.433 --> 54:50.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HAVE SEEN THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE
REVEALED.

54:50.800 --> 54:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU WOULD
AGREE THAT SINCE YOU HAVE

54:57.233 --> 55:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RECUSED YOURSELF, DURING OUR
INVESTIGATION OR DIRECTOR

55:03.700 --> 55:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION THAT
WOULD BE I THINK PROBLEMATIC.

55:06.933 --> 55:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LET ME, ONE OF THE COMMENTS YOU
MADE IN YOUR TESTIMONY WAS, THAT

55:13.266 --> 55:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU HAD REACHED THIS CONCLUSION
ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE OF

55:17.000 --> 55:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THEN-DIRECTOR COMEY'S ABILITY TO
LIED THE FBI, THAT YOU AGREED

55:21.900 --> 55:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WITH DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL
ROSEN STEIN'S MEMO, THE FACT

55:28.266 --> 55:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT YOU HAD WORKED WITH
DIRECTOR AT THE TIME, HAVE YOU

55:29.733 --> 55:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EVER HAD A CONVERSATION AS A
SUPERIOR TO DIRECTOR COMEY, THAT

55:38.300 --> 55:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HE WASN'T RUNNING THE FBI IN A
GOOD WAY OR THAT SOMEHOW THE FBI

55:42.700 --> 55:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IS IN TURMOIL, DID YOU HAVE ANY
CONVERSATIONS WITH DIRECTOR

55:46.166 --> 55:51.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COMEY ABOUT THOSE SUBJECTS?
>> I DID NOT.

55:52.566 --> 55:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> SO YOU WERE HIS SUPERIOR, AND
THERE WERE SOME FAIRLY HARSH

55:57.433 --> 56:00.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THINGS SAID ABOUT DIRECTOR
COMEY.

56:00.400 --> 56:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU NEVER THOUGHT IT WAS
APPROPRIATE TO RAISE THOSE

56:02.600 --> 56:05.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CONCERNS BEFORE HE WAS
ABSOLUTELY TERMINATED BY THE

56:05.700 --> 56:08.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PRESIDENT?
>> I DID NOT DO SO.

56:08.100 --> 56:13.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A MEMORANDUM WAS PREPARED 50
DISPUTE ATTORNEY GENERAL, WHO

56:14.666 --> 56:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EVALUATED HIS PERFORMANCE, NOTED
SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH IT.

56:20.900 --> 56:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ONE OF THEM --
>> AND YOU AGREED WITH THOSE

56:21.966 --> 56:23.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CONCLUSIONS?
>> I AGREED WITH THOSE.

56:23.500 --> 56:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IN FACT SENATOR WARNER, WE HAD
TALKED ABOUT IT EVEN BEFORE I

56:27.233 --> 56:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WAS CONFIRMED AND BEFORE HE WAS
CONFIRMED.

56:30.200 --> 56:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE BOTH
AGREED TO, THAT A FRESH START AT

56:33.433 --> 56:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE FBI WAS PROBABLY THE BEST
THING.

56:36.133 --> 56:39.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> THIS JUST AGAIN SEEMS A
LITTLE -- I COULD UNDERSTAND IF

56:39.100 --> 56:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT BEFORE YOU
CAME ON YOU HAD A CHANCE FOR A

56:42.733 --> 56:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRESH START, THERE WAS NO FRESH
START.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUDDENLY WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF
THE INVESTIGATION AND WITH

56:47.900 --> 56:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TIMING THAT SEEM A LITTLE
PECULAR, WHAT AT LEAST TO ME WAS

56:52.200 --> 56:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OUT OF THE BLUE THE PRESIDENT
FIRES THE FBI DIRECTOR AND IF

56:56.133 --> 57:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THERE ARE ALL THESE PROBLEMS OF
DISARRAY AND A LACK OF COURT THE

57:02.733 --> 57:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FBI ALL THE THINGS THAT THE
ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE FBI

57:05.433 --> 57:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DENIED IS THE CASE I WOULD HAVE
THOUGHT THAT SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE

57:08.166 --> 57:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HAD THAT CONVERSATION WITH
DIRECTOR COMEY.

57:09.833 --> 57:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN AT LEAST OWED
THAT.

57:11.466 --> 57:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LET'S GO TO THE APRIL 27th
MEETING.

57:14.133 --> 57:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IT HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP, I THINK
CHAIRMAN BROUGHT IT UP, BY THE

57:17.000 --> 57:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TIME APRIL 27th CAME UP YOU
HAD BEEN NAMED THE CHAIR OF

57:20.166 --> 57:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NATIONAL
SECURITY ADVISORY.

57:24.433 --> 57:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> THAT WAS THE MAYFLOWER HOTEL?
>> YES, SIR.

57:28.966 --> 57:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YES, SIR.
MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT THE

57:33.166 --> 57:37.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRESIDENT'S SON-IN-LAW JARED
KUSHNER WAS AT THAT MEETING AS

57:37.000 --> 57:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WELL?
>> I BELIEVE HE WAS, YES.

57:39.333 --> 57:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> AND YOU DON'T RECOLLECT
WHETHER MR. KUSHNER HAD ANY

57:42.766 --> 57:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CONVERSATIONS WITH AMBASSADOR
KISLYAK AT THAT SESSION?

57:44.633 --> 57:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> I DO NOT.
>> TO THE BEST OF YOUR MEMORY

57:47.533 --> 57:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU HAD NO CONVERSATIONS WITH
AMBASSADOR KISLYAK AT THAT

57:51.600 --> 57:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MEETING?
>> I DON'T RECALL, I CAN ASSURE

57:56.100 --> 57:58.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU NOTHING IMPROPER IF I HAD A
CONVERSATION.

57:58.800 --> 58:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT I HAD A
CONVERSATION BUT I JUST DON'T

58:02.133 --> 58:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REMEMBER IT.
>> THERE IS NOTHING IN YOUR

58:04.833 --> 58:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NOTES OR MEMORY THAT WHEN YOU
HAD A CHANCE, AND I APPRECIATE,

58:09.066 --> 58:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CORRECT THE RECORD ABOUT THE
OTHER TWO SESSIONS IN RESPONSE

58:12.433 --> 58:16.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TO SENATOR FRANKEN AND SENATOR
LEAHY, THAT THIS DIDN'T POP INTO

58:16.066 --> 58:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOUR MEMORY THAT IN THE
OVERABUNDANCE OF CAUTION YOU

58:20.433 --> 58:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OUGHT TO REPORT THAT SESSION AS
WELL?

58:23.233 --> 58:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> WELL I GUESS I COULD SAY THAT
POSSIBLY AT A MEETING BUT I

58:27.666 --> 58:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STILL TO NOT RECALL IT.
AND I DID NOT IN ANY WAY FAIL TO

58:34.100 --> 58:37.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RECORD SOMETHING ON -- IN MY
TESTIMONY OR IN MY SUBSEQUENT

58:37.966 --> 58:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LETTER INTENTIONALLY FALSE.
>> I UNDERSTAND.

58:40.966 --> 58:44.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I UNDERSTAND THAT SIR.
I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND,

58:44.200 --> 58:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WHEN YOU CORRECTED THE RECORD
AND CLEARLY, BY THE TIME YOU HAD

58:48.033 --> 58:49.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A CHANCE TO CORRECT THE RECORD,
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU WROTE

58:49.866 --> 58:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HAVE KNOWN THAT AMBASSADOR
KISLYAK WAS AT THAT APRIL 27th

58:54.066 --> 58:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SESSION, IT RECEIVED SOME --
QUITE A BIT OF PRESS NOTORIETY,

58:58.566 --> 59:03.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND AGAIN, ECHOING WHAT THE
CHAIRMAN HAS SAID, JUST AGAIN

59:05.000 --> 59:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FOR RECORD, THERE WAS NO OTHER
MEETING WITH ANY OTHER OFFICIALS

59:10.366 --> 59:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OF THE WASHINGTON GOVERNMENT
DURING CAMPAIGN SEASON?

59:12.466 --> 59:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> NOT TO MY RECOLLECTION.
AND WOULD I JUST SAY WITH REGARD

59:14.533 --> 59:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TO -- I WOULD JUST SAY WITH
REGARD TO THE TWO ENCOUNTERS,

59:20.966 --> 59:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ONE AT THE MAYFLOWER HOTEL THAT
YOU REFERRED TO, I CAME THERE

59:25.833 --> 59:27.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NOT KNOWING HE WAS GOING TO BE
THERE.

59:27.766 --> 59:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I DON'T HAVE ANY RECOLLECTION OF
EVEN KNOWING HE WOULD BE THERE.

59:30.800 --> 59:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY COMMUNICATIONS
WITH HIM BEFORE OR AFTER THAT

59:34.633 --> 59:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EVENT.
AND LIKEWISE, AT THE EVENT AT

59:38.733 --> 59:42.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE CONVENTION, I WENT OFF THE
CONVENTION GROUNDS TO A COLLEGE

59:42.666 --> 59:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAMPUS FOR AN EVENT THAT HAD
BEEN SET UP AND --

59:45.733 --> 59:48.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> AT THE MAYFLOWER --
>> LET ME JUST FOLLOW UP ON THAT

59:48.566 --> 59:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ONE.
I DIDN'T KNOW HE WOULD BE IN THE

59:50.433 --> 59:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AUDIENCE AND HAD NO BRIEFLY --
>> AT THE MAYFLOWER --

59:53.533 --> 59:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> OKAY.
>> -- THERE WAS THIS KIND OF I

59:55.566 --> 59:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GUESS VIP RECEPTION AT FIRST AND
THEN THEY WENT INTO THE --

59:59.800 --> 1:00:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> THAT'S MY RECOLLECTION.
>> AND YOU WERE PART OF THE VIP

1:00:04.233 --> 1:00:07.333 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
RECEPTION?
>> YES, SIR.

1:00:07.333 --> 1:00:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> GENERAL SESSIONS ONE OF THE
AGAIN, TROUBLING THINGS AI NEED

1:00:12.233 --> 1:00:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TO SORT THROUGH IS -- THAT I
NEED TO SORT THROUGH IS,

1:00:18.666 --> 1:00:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MR. COMEY'S TESTIMONY LAST WEEK
WAS THAT HE FELT UNCOMFORTABLE

1:00:21.800 --> 1:00:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WHEN THE PRESIDENT ASKED
EVERYONE ELSE TO LEAVE THE ROOM,

1:00:28.266 --> 1:00:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HE LEFT THE IMPRESSION THAT YOU
LINGERED PERHAPS THE SENSE THAT

1:00:29.800 --> 1:00:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU FELT UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT IT
AS WELL, I'M GOING TO ALLOW YOU

1:00:33.500 --> 1:00:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TO OBVIOUSLY ANSWER AND CORRECT
IF THAT IS NOT THE IMPRESSION.

1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLEARLY, DIRECTOR COMEY HAD
SOMEWHAT OF UNCOMFORTABLENESS,

1:00:45.300 --> 1:00:49.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU NEVER ASKED DIRECTOR COMEY
WHAT TOOK PLACE IN THAT MEETING?

1:00:49.966 --> 1:00:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> I WOULD JUST SAY IT THIS WAY.
WE WERE THERE, I WAS STANDING

1:00:54.400 --> 1:00:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THERE, AND WITHOUT REVEALING ANY
CONVERSATION THAT TOOK PLACE,

1:00:59.233 --> 1:01:03.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WHAT I DO RECALL IS, THAT I DID
DEPART, I BELIEVE EVERYONE ELSE

1:01:03.300 --> 1:01:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DID DEPART, AND DIRECTOR COMEY
WAS SITTING IN FRONT OF THE

1:01:07.033 --> 1:01:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRESIDENT'S DESK, AND THEY WERE
TALKING.

1:01:08.966 --> 1:01:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SO THAT'S WHAT I DO REMEMBER.
I BELIEVE IT WAS THE NEXT DAY

1:01:12.600 --> 1:01:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT HEREMEMBER.
I BELIEVE IT WAS THE NEXT DAY

1:01:14.100 --> 1:01:16.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT HE SAID SOMETHING EXPRESSED
CONCERN ABOUT BEING LEFT ALONE

1:01:16.966 --> 1:01:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WITH THE PRESIDENT.
BUT THAT, IN ITSELF, IS NOT

1:01:21.033 --> 1:01:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PROBLEMATIC.
HE DID NOT TELL ME AT THAT TIME

1:01:24.900 --> 1:01:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANY DETAILS ABOUT ANYTHING THAT
WAS SAID THAT WAS IMPROPER.

1:01:29.566 --> 1:01:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I AFFIRMED HIS CONCERN THAT WE
SHOULD BE FOLLOWING THE PROPER

1:01:35.900 --> 1:01:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GUIDELINES AND BASICALLY BACKED
HIM UP IN HIS CONCERNS.

1:01:41.166 --> 1:01:44.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND THAT HE SHOULD NOT CARRY ON
ANY CONVERSATION WITH THE

1:01:44.766 --> 1:01:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRESIDENT OR ANYONE ELSE ABOUT
AN INVESTIGATION IN THE WAY THAT

1:01:48.900 --> 1:01:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IT WAS NOT PROPER.
I FELT HE SO LONG IN THE END

1:01:53.833 --> 1:01:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FORMER DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL,
AS I RECALL KNEW THOSE A GOOD

1:01:58.733 --> 1:02:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEAL BETTER THAN I DID.
>> BUT IT DID APPEAR THAT MR.

1:02:04.733 --> 1:02:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COMEY FELT THAT THE CONVERSATION
WAS.

1:02:06.633 --> 1:02:09.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> HE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT
IT.

1:02:09.566 --> 1:02:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND WHAT HE SAID TO ME ABOUT HIS
CONCERN, IS CONSISTENT WITH MY

1:02:16.333 --> 1:02:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RECOLLECTION.
>> ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS,

1:02:23.066 --> 1:02:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GOOD TO HEAR YOU TALK ABOUT HOW
IMPORTANT THIS RUSSIAN

1:02:26.833 --> 1:02:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INTERFERENCE AND MEASURES IN OUR
CAMPAIGN IS.

1:02:29.333 --> 1:02:32.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY
AMERICAN WHO WOULD DISAGREE WITH

1:02:32.600 --> 1:02:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO DRILL
DOWN TO THINK KNOW WHAT

1:02:36.100 --> 1:02:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HAPPENED, GET IT OUT IN FRONT OF
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND DO WHAT

1:02:38.733 --> 1:02:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WE CAN TO STOP IT.
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS COMMITTEE

1:02:41.233 --> 1:02:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WAS CHARGED TO DO.
AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW, A "NEW

1:02:47.633 --> 1:02:51.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YORK TIMES" PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE
ALLEGING THERE WAS CONSTANT

1:02:52.700 --> 1:02:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIANS AND

1:02:55.800 --> 1:02:58.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COLLUSION REGARDING THE
ELECTIONS.

1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:02.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DO YOU RECALL THAT ARTICLE WHEN
IT CAME OUT?

1:03:02.366 --> 1:03:07.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
>> IN THE EXACTLY.
>> GENERALLY?

1:03:08.800 --> 1:03:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> MR. COMEY TOLD US WHEN HE WAS
HERE THAT HE HAD VERY SPECIFIC

1:03:11.600 --> 1:03:14.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RECOLLECTION.
HE CAME DOWN THROUGH THE

1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND WAS
NOT ABLE TO FIND A SCINTILLA OF

1:03:17.200 --> 1:03:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EVIDENCE IN THAT EFFECT.
THEN HE SAW THE REPUBLICANS AND

1:03:20.100 --> 1:03:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEMOCRATS APPEAR TO THEM THEM
THAT THIS WAS FALSE.

1:03:23.566 --> 1:03:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT THERE WAS NO, NO --
ANYWHERE THAT CORROBORATED WITH

1:03:29.533 --> 1:03:31.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" HAD
REPORTED.

1:03:31.133 --> 1:03:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NONETHELESS, AFTER THAT, THIS
COMMITTEE TOOK THAT ON IS ONE OF

1:03:37.500 --> 1:03:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE THINGS WE SPENT REALLY
SUBSTANTIALLY MORE TIME ON THAT

1:03:39.333 --> 1:03:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAN WE HAVE ON THE RUSSIAN
ACTIVE MEASURE, WE'VE BEEN

1:03:42.433 --> 1:03:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THROUGH THOUSANDS OF PAGES OF
INFORMATION, INTERVIEWED

1:03:45.866 --> 1:03:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WITNESSES AND EVERYTHING ELSE.
REALLY NO DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE

1:03:49.433 --> 1:03:51.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WERE WHEN THIS WHOLE THING
STARTED.

1:03:51.766 --> 1:03:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BUT AND THERE'S BEEN NO REPORTS
THAT I KNOW OF ANY FACTUAL

1:03:55.333 --> 1:03:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INFORMATION REGARDING.
OF ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY SUCH

1:03:57.500 --> 1:04:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INFORMATION?
>> THAT ROSE FROM THE SO CALLEDS

1:04:03.533 --> 1:04:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DOIER?
I BELIEVE THAT'S THE REPORT THAT

1:04:07.100 --> 1:04:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CENTER FRANK HIT ME WITH WHEN I
WAS TESTIFYING; AND I THINK IT'S

1:04:13.500 --> 1:04:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BEEN PRETTY SUBSTANTIALLY
DISCREDITED BUT YOU KNOW KNOW

1:04:15.566 --> 1:04:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MORE THAN I ABOUT WHAT WAS SAID
THAT WOULD SUGGEST I

1:04:19.900 --> 1:04:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PARTICIPATED IN A CONTINUING
COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE RUSSIANS

1:04:24.133 --> 1:04:28.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
OVER AS A SURROGATE IS
ABSOLUTELY FALSE.

1:04:28.766 --> 1:04:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> MR. SESSIONS, THERE'S BEEN
ALL THIS TALK ABOUT

1:04:50.900 --> 1:04:53.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
IS THAT A FAIR STATEMENT
>> I THINK IT IS, YES.

1:04:53.366 --> 1:04:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> IF YOU RUN INTO ANYONE IN THE

>> VERY WELL HAPPEN.
NOTHING IMPROPER.

IT COMES TO YOU ARE OUR

1:05:08.966 --> 1:05:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

IMPROPER AND ILLEGAL.

1:05:12.200 --> 1:05:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOULD THAT BE A FAIR STATEMENT.

- - THIS IS A SERIOUS MATTER,

1:06:19.500 --> 1:06:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

IF THAT ACTUALLY OCCURRED.

1:09:42.566 --> 1:09:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> AND HOW DO YOU VIEW THAT
SINCE YOU IS DISCUSSED HIS

1:09:47.733 --> 1:09:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TERMINATION, WHY WOULDN'T YOU
DISCUSS THE REASONS?

1:09:51.800 --> 1:09:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> WELL, THAT WAS PUT IN WRITING
AND SENT TO THE PRESIDENT.

1:09:57.933 --> 1:10:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HE MADE THOSE PUBLIC, SO HE MADE
THAT PUBLIC.

1:10:02.066 --> 1:10:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> YOU NO VERBAL CONVERSATION
WITH HIM ABOUT THE FIRING OF MR.

COMEY
>> I'M NOT ABLE TO DISCUSS WITH

1:10:09.733 --> 1:10:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU OR CONFIRM OR DENY THE
NATURE OF PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS

1:10:16.200 --> 1:10:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT I MAY HAVE HAD WITH THE
PRESIDENT ON THIS SUBJECT OR

1:10:19.133 --> 1:10:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OTHERS.
AND I KNOW THAT HOW THIS WILL BE

1:10:23.100 --> 1:10:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DISCUSSED BUT THAT'S THE RULES
ALL ALONG ADHERED TO BY THE

1:10:27.466 --> 1:10:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, AS YOU
KNOW, SENATOR FEINSTEIN

1:10:29.933 --> 1:10:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> WE HEARD MR. COATS AND WE
HEARD ADMIRAL ROGERS SAY

1:10:38.333 --> 1:10:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THING, WHEN
IT WAS EASY, JUSTS AT THE ANSWER

1:10:42.733 --> 1:10:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WAS NO, NO.
>> WOULD IT HAVE BEEN EASY TO

1:10:46.800 --> 1:10:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAY IT WAS YES, YES, BUT BOTH
WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPROPER.

1:10:53.300 --> 1:10:57.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> OK, SO HOW EXACTLY WERE YOU
INVOLVED IN THE TERMINATION OF

1:11:02.100 --> 1:11:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DIRECTOR COMEY?
I'M LOOKING AT YOUR LETTER AND

1:11:09.733 --> 1:11:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU SAY THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI
MUST BE SOMEONE AM I FOLLOWS

1:11:12.933 --> 1:11:16.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FAITHFULLY THE RULES AND
PRINCIPLES, WHO SETS THE RIGHT

1:11:16.266 --> 1:11:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EXAMPLE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICIALS.

1:11:20.966 --> 1:11:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THEREFORE I MUST RECOMMEND THAT
YOU REMOVE DIRECTOR COMEY AND

1:11:25.700 --> 1:11:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IDENTIFY AN EXPERIENCED AND
QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL TO LEAD THE

1:11:29.933 --> 1:11:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GREAT MEN AND WOMEN OF THE FBI.
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS

1:11:36.766 --> 1:11:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HAD TO DO WITH DIRECTOR COMEY,
THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE FBI?

1:11:43.633 --> 1:11:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> THAT WAS A CLEAR VIEW OF MINE
AND OF DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL

1:11:51.066 --> 1:11:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROSEN STEIN AS HE SET OUT AT
SOME LENGTH IN HIS MEMORANDA

1:11:54.800 --> 1:11:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT I ADOPTED AND SENT TO THE
PRESIDENT AND WE HAD PROBLEMS

1:12:01.233 --> 1:12:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THERE AND IT WAS MY BEST
JUDGMENT THAT A FRESH START AT

1:12:06.800 --> 1:12:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE FBI WAS THE APPROPRIATE
THING TO DO.

1:12:10.433 --> 1:12:14.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND WHEN I ASKED SAID THAT TO
THE PRESIDENT, IT'S SOMETHING I

1:12:14.466 --> 1:12:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HAD ADHERE TO, DEPUTY ROSEN
STEIN'S LETTER DEALT WITH A

1:12:18.200 --> 1:12:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NUMBER OF THINGS.
WHEN MR. COMEY DECLINED THE

1:12:24.500 --> 1:12:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON PROSECUTION.
THAT WAS REALLY A USER PATIENT

1:12:30.400 --> 1:12:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE FEDERAL
PROSECUTORS IN DEPARTMENT OF

1:12:35.833 --> 1:12:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUSTICE.
IT WAS A STUNNING DEVELOPMENT.

1:12:37.600 --> 1:12:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE FBI IS THE INVESTIGATIVE
TEAM.

1:12:41.133 --> 1:12:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THEY DON'T DECIDE PROSECUTION
POLICIES.

1:12:47.866 --> 1:12:52.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HE ALSO COMMENTED AT SOME LENGTH
ON THE DECLINATION OF THE

1:12:52.266 --> 1:12:57.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON PROSECUTION, WHICH YOU
SHOULD NOT -- YOU SHOULDN'T DO.

1:12:58.700 --> 1:13:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
POLICIES IF YOU DECLINE, YOU
DECLINE AND YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT

1:13:02.533 --> 1:13:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IT.
THAT WERE OTHER THINGS THAT HAD

1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HAPPENED THAT INDICATED TO ME A
LACK OF DISCIPLINE AND CAUSED

1:13:10.400 --> 1:13:14.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CONTROVERSY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE
AISLE, AND I HAD COME TO THE

1:13:14.466 --> 1:13:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CONCLUSION THAT A FRESH START
WAS APPROPRIATE, AND DID NOT

1:13:18.200 --> 1:13:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIND PUTTING THAT IN WRITING
>> MY TIME IS UP.

1:13:25.066 --> 1:13:26.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>>> MR. RUBIO.

1:13:26.433 --> 1:13:27.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE,
ATTORNEY GENERAL.

1:13:27.966 --> 1:13:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I WANT TO GO BACK TO FEBRUARY
14TH AND CLOSE THE LOOP ON THE

1:13:29.633 --> 1:13:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DETAILS.
DIRECTOR COMEY WAS HERE AND

1:13:31.133 --> 1:13:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PROVIDED GREAT DETAIL ABOUT THAT
DAY.

1:13:33.066 --> 1:13:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WHAT I'M DOING SO FAR THERE WAS
A MEETING IN THE OVAL OFFICE ON

1:13:36.333 --> 1:13:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE 14TH.
AT SOME POINT THE MEETING

1:13:39.433 --> 1:13:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CONCLUDED EVERYONE GOT UP TO
LEAVE.

1:13:42.233 --> 1:13:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE PRESIDENT ASKED DIRECTOR
COMEY TO STAY BEHIND; CORRECT?

1:13:46.033 --> 1:13:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> THAT'S A COMMUNICATION IN THE
WHITE HOUSE THAT I WOULD NOT

1:13:49.033 --> 1:13:51.533 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
COMMENT ON.
I DO

1:13:51.533 --> 1:13:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> DO YOU REMEMBER SEEING HIM
STAY BEHIND, YES?

1:13:55.166 --> 1:13:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HIS VIEW IT OF IT WAS THAT YOU
LINGERED BECAUSE YOU KNEW YOU

1:13:59.900 --> 1:14:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NEEDED TO STAY?
DO YOU REMEMBER LINGERING

1:14:04.600 --> 1:14:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FEELING LIKE YOU NEEDED TO STAY,
I DO RECALL BEING ONE OF THE

1:14:09.200 --> 1:14:13.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LAST ONES TO LEAVE
>> DID YOU DECIDE TO BE.

1:14:13.933 --> 1:14:15.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT
OCCURRED.

1:14:15.833 --> 1:14:20.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WE FINISHED I THINK A TERRORISM,
COUNTER TERRORISM BRIEFING AND

1:14:22.300 --> 1:14:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PEOPLE WERE FILTERING OUT AND I
EVENTUALLY LEFT AND I DO RECALL

1:14:27.933 --> 1:14:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I THINK I WAS ONE OF THE LAST
TWO OR THREE TO LEAVE

1:14:31.900 --> 1:14:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY THAT
YOU FELT LIKE YOU PERHAPS YOU

1:14:34.633 --> 1:14:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NEEDED TO STAY BECAUSE IT
INVOLVED THE FBI DIRECTOR

1:14:37.133 --> 1:14:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW I WOULD
CHARACTERIZE THAT, SENATOR

1:14:41.766 --> 1:14:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUBIO.
I LEFT, IT DIDN'T SEEM TO ME TO

1:14:44.733 --> 1:14:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BE A MAJOR PROBLEM.
I KNEW THAT DIRECTOR COMEY LONG

1:14:51.133 --> 1:14:52.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TIME EXPERIENCED IN THE
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE COULD

1:14:52.566 --> 1:14:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HANDLE HIMSELF WELL.
>> SO YOU SAW HIM AFTER THAT.

1:14:55.433 --> 1:14:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HE CHARACTERIZED IT AS HE WENT
UP TO YOU AND SAID NEVER LEAVE

1:14:58.833 --> 1:15:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ME ALONE WITH THE PRESIDENT.
IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE AND HE SAID

1:15:01.733 --> 1:15:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND THIS IS HIS CHARACTERIZATION
YOU JUST KIND OF SHRUGGED AS IF

1:15:05.133 --> 1:15:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TO SAY WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
ABOUT IT

1:15:07.833 --> 1:15:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> I THINK I DESCRIBED IT MORE
COMPLETELY CORRECTLY.

1:15:11.100 --> 1:15:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HE RAISED THAT ISSUE WITH ME.
I BELIEVE THE NEXT DAY.

1:15:17.566 --> 1:15:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I THINK I WAS CORRECT, AND HE
EXPRESSED CONCERN TO ME ABOUT

1:15:23.766 --> 1:15:27.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT PRIVATE CONVERSATION, AND I
AGREED WITH HIM ESSENTIALLY THAT

1:15:30.533 --> 1:15:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THERE ARE RULES ON PRIVATE
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

1:15:33.433 --> 1:15:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRESIDENT.
BUT IT'S NOT A PROHIBITION ON A

1:15:36.733 --> 1:15:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRIVATE DISCUSSION WITH THE
PRESIDENT AS I BELIEVE HE

1:15:41.500 --> 1:15:45.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACKNOWLEDGED SIX OR MORE HIMSELF
WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA AND

1:15:45.333 --> 1:15:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, SO I
DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THAT'S -- AND

1:15:49.266 --> 1:15:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HE GAVE ME NO DETAIL ABOUT WHAT
IT WAS THAT HE WAS CONCERNED

1:15:54.033 --> 1:15:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ABOUT.
SO I DIDN'T SAY I WOULDN'T BE

1:15:58.833 --> 1:16:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ABLE TO RESPOND IF HE CALLED ME.
HE CERTAINLY KNEW THAT WITH

1:16:02.900 --> 1:16:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REGARD THAT HE COULD CALL HIS
DIRECT SUPERVISOR, WHICH, IN THE

1:16:07.700 --> 1:16:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THE
INSPECTOR IS THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY

1:16:12.633 --> 1:16:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GENERAL, HE COULD HAVE
COMPLAINED TO THE DEPUTY OR TO

1:16:15.066 --> 1:16:19.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ME AT ANY TIME IF HE FELT
PRESSURED BUT I HAD NO DOUBT

1:16:19.166 --> 1:16:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT HE WOULD NOT YIELD TO ANY
PRESSURE

1:16:21.066 --> 1:16:23.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>>,J.

1:16:26.333 --> 1:16:28.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
IN THE WHITE HOUSE
>> I DO NOT.

1:16:28.733 --> 1:16:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> IF FACT, IN ANY PRESIDENT WAS
TO RECORD CONVERSATIONS IN THE

1:16:33.366 --> 1:16:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OFFICIAL DUTIES OF THE WHITE
HOUSE, WOULD THERE BE AN

1:16:35.833 --> 1:16:37.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OBLIGATION TO PRESERVE THOSE
RECORDS

1:16:37.466 --> 1:16:42.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

PROBABLY SO.

I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE, IT'S BEEN
WIDELY REPORTED IN RUSSIAN

ANYONE WHO IN HINDSIGHT YOU LOOK

TO INFLUENCE ME OR GAIN INSIGHT,
THAT YOU LOOK AT AND WONDER

A LOT OF FOREIGN OFFICIALS WHO

1:17:25.933 --> 1:17:30.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WANTED TO ARGUE THEIR CASE FOR
THEIR COUNTRY AND TO POINT OUT

THINGS THAT THEY THOUGHT WERE
IMPORTANT FOR THEIR COUNTRIES.

1:17:37.700 --> 1:17:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

1:18:07.366 --> 1:18:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAKING THAT CHANGE.
>> I WAS NOT ACTIVE IN PLATFORM

1:18:12.233 --> 1:18:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COMMITTEE.
DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THAT AND

1:18:15.233 --> 1:18:18.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DON'T THINK I HAD ANY DIRECT
INVOLVEMENT

1:18:18.066 --> 1:18:21.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> DO YOU KNOW WHO DID?
YOU HAVE NO RECOLLECTION OF A

1:18:21.733 --> 1:18:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEBATE ABOUT THAT ISSUE INTERNAL
UNTIL THE CAMPAIGN

1:18:23.733 --> 1:18:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> I NEVER WATCHED THE DEBATE.
IF IT OCCURRED ON THE PLATFORM

1:18:29.733 --> 1:18:32.400 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
COMMITTEE.
I THINK IT DID.

1:18:32.400 --> 1:18:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SO I'D HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT.
>> MR. CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK

1:18:40.333 --> 1:18:44.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING IN
THE OPEN IN FULL VIEW OF THE

1:18:44.166 --> 1:18:46.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMERICAN PEOPLE WHERE IT
BELONGS.

1:18:46.600 --> 1:18:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I BELIEVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
HAVE HAD IT WITH STONE WALKING,

1:18:53.033 --> 1:18:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ANSWERS TO RELEVANT QUESTIONS

1:18:55.633 --> 1:18:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARE PRIVILEGED AND OFF LIMITS OR
THAT THEY CAN'T BE PROVIDED IN

1:18:59.633 --> 1:19:04.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PUBLIC OR THAT IT WOULD BE QUOTE
INAPPROPRIATE FOR WITNESSES TO

1:19:04.166 --> 1:19:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TELL US WHAT THEY KNOW.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN ATTACK ON

1:19:08.266 --> 1:19:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, AND
STONE WALKING OF ANY IS

1:19:14.366 --> 1:19:16.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
UNACCEPTABLE.
AND GENERAL SESSIONS

1:19:16.500 --> 1:19:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE IS NO
LEGAL BASIS FOR THIS STONE

1:19:20.900 --> 1:19:23.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALKING.
IT'S NOT A QUESTION.

1:19:23.700 --> 1:19:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LAST THURSDAY, I ASKED FORMER
DIRECTOR COMEY ABOUT THE FBI'S

1:19:28.533 --> 1:19:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INTERACTIONS WITH YOU, GENERAL
SESSIONS, PRIOR TO YOUR STEPPING

1:19:32.033 --> 1:19:34.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ASIDE FROM THE RUSSIAN
INVESTIGATION.

1:19:34.933 --> 1:19:39.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MR. COMEY SAID THAT YOUR
CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT WITH THE

1:19:39.300 --> 1:19:44.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION WAS,
QUOTE, PROBLEMATIC, AND HE, MR.

1:19:44.100 --> 1:19:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COMEY, COULD NOT DISCUSS IT IN
PUBLIC.

1:19:46.933 --> 1:19:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MR. COMEY ALSO SAID THAT FBI
PERSONNEL HAD BEEN CALLING FOR

1:19:50.700 --> 1:19:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU TO STEP ASIDE FROM THE
INVESTIGATION, AT LEAST TWO

1:19:54.633 --> 1:19:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WEEKS BEFORE YOU FINALLY DID SO.
NOW, IN YOUR PREPARED STATEMENT

1:20:01.133 --> 1:20:05.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU STATED YOU RECEIVED ONLY,
QUOTE, LIMITED INFORMATION

1:20:05.233 --> 1:20:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NECESSARY TO INFORM YOUR RECUSAL
DECISION.

1:20:08.800 --> 1:20:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BUT GIVEN DIRECTOR COMEY'S
STATEMENT, WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT

1:20:14.933 --> 1:20:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT WAS.
WERE YOU AWARE OF ANY CONCERNS

1:20:17.733 --> 1:20:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT THE FBI OR ELSEWHERE IN
GOVERNMENT ABOUT YOUR CONTACTS

1:20:20.466 --> 1:20:24.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WITH THE RUSSIANS OR ANY OTHER
MATTERS RELEVANT TO WHETHER YOU

1:20:24.533 --> 1:20:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHOULD STEP ASIDE FROM THE
RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION?

1:20:28.333 --> 1:20:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> SENATOR WYDEN, I AM NOT STONE
WALKING, I'M FOLLOWING THE

1:20:36.333 --> 1:20:39.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HISTORIC POLICIES OF THE
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

1:20:39.833 --> 1:20:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU DON'T WALK IN TO ANY HEARING
OR COMMITTEE MEETING AND REVEAL

CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS IN

YOUR BEST JUDGMENT ABOUT A LOT
OF OF ISSUES AND BE ACCUSED OF

1:20:59.566 --> 1:21:04.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STONE WALKING FOR NOT ANSWERING.
I WOULD PUSH BACK ON THAT.

1:21:06.233 --> 1:21:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I BASICALLY RECUSED MYSELF THE
FIRST DAY I GOT INTO THE OFFICE

1:21:13.266 --> 1:21:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BECAUSE I NEVER ACCESSED FILES,
I NEVER LEARNED THE NAMES OF

1:21:17.400 --> 1:21:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVESTIGATORS.
I NEVER MET WITH THEM, NEVER

1:21:20.066 --> 1:21:23.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ASKED FOR DOCUMENTATION.
THE DOCUMENTATION WHAT LITTLE I

1:21:23.966 --> 1:21:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RECEIVED WAS MOSTLY ALREADY IN
THE MEDIA.

1:21:27.633 --> 1:21:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND WAS PRESENTED BY THE SENIOR

INVESTIGATIONS ABOUT HIS

1:23:50.900 --> 1:23:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ASSOCIATES IN RUSSIA.
THE DAY BEFORE YOU WROTE YOUR

1:23:55.766 --> 1:24:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LETTER HE TWEETED THE COLLUSION
STORY WAS A TOTAL HOAXED AND

1:24:00.366 --> 1:24:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ASKED WHEN WILL THIS TAX-PAYER
FUNDED CHARADE END.

1:24:04.433 --> 1:24:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I DON'T THINK YOUR ANSWER PASSES
IS SMELL TEST.

1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

ALLOWED TO BRIEFLY RESPOND AT

1:24:09.766 --> 1:24:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LEAST AND WOULD SAY THE LETTER,
THE MEMORANDUM THAT SENATOR,

1:24:16.200 --> 1:24:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT DEPUTY ROSENSTEIN WROTE AND
MY LETTER THAT ACCOMPANIED IT,

1:24:22.300 --> 1:24:25.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REPRESENTED MY VIEWS OF THE
SITUATION.

ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS, I

1:24:36.566 --> 1:24:41.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WANT TO CLARIFY WHO DID WHAT
WITH REGARD TO THE FIRING OF

1:24:43.300 --> 1:24:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MR. COMEY.
FIRST OF ALL, LET ME ASK YOU,

1:24:47.100 --> 1:24:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WHEN DID YOU HAVE YOUR FIRST
CONVERSATION WITH ROSENSTEIN

1:24:54.433 --> 1:24:58.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ABOUT MR. COMEY?
>> WE TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE

1:24:58.700 --> 1:25:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EITHER ONE OF US WAS CONFIRMED.
IT WAS A TONIC OF CONVERSATION

1:25:05.133 --> 1:25:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO SERVED IN
THE DEPARTMENT A LONG TIME.

1:25:07.766 --> 1:25:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THEY KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED THAT
FALL WAS PRETTY DRAMATICALLY

1:25:13.866 --> 1:25:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNUSUAL.
PEOPLE FELT IT WAS VERY WRONG,

1:25:16.700 --> 1:25:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND SO IT WAS IN THAT CONTEXT
THAT WE DISCUSSED IT.

1:25:20.433 --> 1:25:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WE BOTH FOUND WE SHAREHOLDER
COMMON -- SCHAIRD COMMON VIEW --

1:25:22.633 --> 1:25:27.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHARED COMMON VIEW THAT A
PRESSURE START WAS APPROPRIATE.

1:25:27.366 --> 1:25:32.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> THIS WAS BASED ON MR. COMEY'S
HANDLING OF THE INVESTIGATION

1:25:33.800 --> 1:25:37.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVOLVING HILLARY CLINTON IN
WHICH YOU SAID THAT HE SERVED

1:25:37.366 --> 1:25:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE AUTHORITY OF PROSECUTORS AT
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

1:25:42.200 --> 1:25:45.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
>> YES.
THAT WAS PART OF IT.

1:25:45.133 --> 1:25:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND COMMENTING ON THE
INVESTIGATION IN WAYS THAT GO

1:25:48.833 --> 1:25:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BEYOND THE PROPER POLICY.
WE NEED TO RESTORE SENATOR

1:25:53.133 --> 1:25:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COLLINS.
I THINK THE CLASSIC DISCIPLINE

1:25:55.300 --> 1:25:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IN THE DEPARTMENT, MY TEAM,
WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS, HAS BEEN

1:25:59.400 --> 1:26:04.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TOO MUCH LEAKING AND TOO MUCH
TALKING PUBLICLY ABOUT

1:26:05.600 --> 1:26:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVESTIGATIONS.
IN THE LONG RUN, THE DEPARTMENT

1:26:07.100 --> 1:26:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HISTORIC RULE THAT YOU REMAIN
MUM ABOUT ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS

1:26:11.666 --> 1:26:15.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
IS THE BETTER POLICY.
>> NOW SUBSEQUENTLY THE

1:26:15.733 --> 1:26:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRESIDENT ASKED FOR YOU TO PUT
YOUR VIEWS IN WRITING YOU

1:26:19.733 --> 1:26:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TESTIFIED TODAY.
AND I BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE RIGHT

1:26:26.166 --> 1:26:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TO RECUSE YOURSELF FROM THE
ONGOING RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION.

1:26:29.533 --> 1:26:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BUT THEN ON MAY 9TH, YOU WROTE
TO THE PRESIDENT RECOMMENDING

1:26:34.533 --> 1:26:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT MR. COMEY BE DISMISSED.
AND OBVIOUSLY THIS WENT BACK

1:26:39.400 --> 1:26:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MANY MONTHS TO THE EARLIER
CONVERSATIONS YOU HAD HAD WITH

1:26:45.700 --> 1:26:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MR. ROSENSTEIN.
MY QUESTION IS, WHY DO YOU

1:26:49.366 --> 1:26:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BELIEVE THAT YOUR RECOMMENDATION
TO FIRE DIRECTOR COMEY WAS NOT

1:26:55.433 --> 1:26:59.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INCONSISTENT WITH YOUR MARCH 2ND
RECUSAL?

1:26:59.300 --> 1:27:04.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> THANK YOU.
THE RECUSAL INVOLVED ONE CASE

1:27:05.400 --> 1:27:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVOLVED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE.

1:27:07.666 --> 1:27:10.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:86.67% size:62.5%
AND?
THE FBI.

1:27:10.666 --> 1:27:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THEY CONDUCT THOUSANDS OF
INVESTIGATIONS.

1:27:13.500 --> 1:27:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'M THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE
UNITED STATES.

1:27:15.633 --> 1:27:16.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVESTIGATIONS.
I'M THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE

1:27:16.900 --> 1:27:18.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNITED STATES.
IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR

1:27:18.700 --> 1:27:23.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND OTHER
COMMITTEES TO ENSURE THAT

1:27:23.266 --> 1:27:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEPARTMENT IS RUN PROPERLY.
I HAVE TO MAKE DIFFICULT

1:27:26.833 --> 1:27:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DECISIONS.
AND I DO NOT BELIEVE IN IT IS A

1:27:33.300 --> 1:27:37.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOUND POSITION TO SAY THAT IF
YOU RECUSED FOR A SINGLE CASE

1:27:38.700 --> 1:27:43.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVOLVING ANYONE OF THE GREAT
AGENCIES LIKE DEA OR USMARSHALS

1:27:44.866 --> 1:27:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OR ATF THAT ARE PART OF THE
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, YOU CAN'T

1:27:46.766 --> 1:27:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAKE A DECISION ABOUT THE
LEADERSHIP IN THAT AGENCY.

1:27:50.200 --> 1:27:55.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
>> NOW, IF YOU HAD
KNOWN THATZÑZÑ THE
SUBSEQUENT COMPLAINT WAS

1:27:55.133 --> 1:28:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GOING TO GO ON TV AND IN AN
INTERVIEW WITH LESTER HOLTZ OF

1:28:01.600 --> 1:28:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NBC WOULD SAY THAT THIS RUSSIAN
THING WAS THE REASON FOR HIS

1:28:07.800 --> 1:28:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DECISION TO DISMISS THE FBI'S
DIRECTOR, WOULD YOU HAVE FELT

1:28:14.033 --> 1:28:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT THE TIMING
OF THE DECISION?

1:28:17.733 --> 1:28:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> WELL, I WOULD JUST SAY
SENATOR COLLINS, I DON'T THINK

1:28:21.133 --> 1:28:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IT'S APPROPRIATE TO DEAL WITH
THOSE TYPE OF HYPOTHETICALS.

1:28:24.333 --> 1:28:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I HAVE TO DEAL IN ACTUAL ISSUES
AND I WOULD RESPECTFUL NOT

COMMENT ON THAT.
>> LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

1:28:33.900 --> 1:28:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IN RETROSPECT, DO YOU BELIEVE
THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER

1:28:38.733 --> 1:28:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FOR YOU TO HAVE STAYED OUT OF
THE DECISION TO FIRE DIRECTOR

RESPONSIBILITY, I MEAN, I WAS
APPOINTED TO BE ATTORNEY

1:28:51.266 --> 1:28:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GENERAL, SUPERVISING ALL THE
FEDERAL AGENCIES IS MY

1:28:54.500 --> 1:28:58.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

THINK I HAD A DUTY TO DO SO.
>> NOW, DIRECTOR COMEY TESTIFIED

1:29:08.966 --> 1:29:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT HE WAS NOT COMFORTABLE
TELLING YOU ABOUT HIS ONE-ON-ONE

1:29:14.066 --> 1:29:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CONVERSATION WITH THE PRESIDENT
ON FEBRUARY 14TH BECAUSE HE

1:29:17.400 --> 1:29:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BELIEVED THAT YOU WOULD SHORTLY
RECUSE YOURSELF FROM THE RUSSIAN

1:29:21.566 --> 1:29:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVESTIGATION, WHICH YOU DID.
YET DIRECTOR COMEY TESTIFIED

1:29:26.366 --> 1:29:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT HE TOLD NO ONE ELSE AT THE
DEPARTMENT OUTSIDE OF THE SENIOR

1:29:32.766 --> 1:29:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LEADERSHIP TEAM AT THE FBI.
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE DIRECTOR

1:29:38.033 --> 1:29:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HAD AN OBLIGATION TO BRING THE
INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRESIDENT

1:29:43.166 --> 1:29:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAYING THAT HE HOPED HE COULD
LET MICHAEL FLYNN GO TO SOMEONE

1:29:48.566 --> 1:29:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELSE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE?

1:29:56.666 --> 1:30:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> I THINK THE APPROPRIATE THING
WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR DIRECT COMEY

1:30:01.400 --> 1:30:05.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TO TALK WITH THE ACTING DEPUTY
ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO IS HIS

1:30:05.766 --> 1:30:10.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DIRECT SUPERVISOR.
THAT WAS DANA BINTAY, WHO HAD 33

1:30:12.133 --> 1:30:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YEARS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE, AND WAS EVEN THEN STILL

1:30:14.966 --> 1:30:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SERVING FOR SIX YEARS AND
CONTINUE TO SERVE AS TOUCH

1:30:21.333 --> 1:30:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA.
SO HE'S A MAIN OF GREAT

1:30:24.400 --> 1:30:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INTEGRITY.
IF HE HAD CONCERNS HE SHOULD

1:30:30.800 --> 1:30:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HAVE RAISED IT TO DEPUTY
ATTORNEY GENERAL VINTAY WHO

1:30:33.933 --> 1:30:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOULD HAVE BEEN THE APPROPRIATE
PERSON IN ANY CASE REALLY, BUT

1:30:37.300 --> 1:30:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IF HE HAD CONCERN THAT MIGHT BE
RECUSING MYSELF, THAT WOULD BE A

1:30:41.033 --> 1:30:43.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DOUBLE REASON FOR HIM TO SHARE
IT WITH BINTAY.

1:30:43.500 --> 1:30:48.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
>> THANK YOU.
>> ATTORNEY GENERAL

1:30:50.800 --> 1:30:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

THE PRESIDENT EVER EXPRESSED

1:30:53.100 --> 1:30:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRUSTRATION TO YOU REGARDING
YOUR DECISION TO RECUSE

YOURSELF?
>> I'M NOT ABLE TO SHARE WITH

1:31:02.733 --> 1:31:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THIS COMMITTEE.
>> INVOKING EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE

1:31:05.800 --> 1:31:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> I'M NOT ABLE TO INVOKE
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE, THAT'S THE

1:31:08.800 --> 1:31:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRESIDENT'S PREROGATIVE.
>> MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU

1:31:12.666 --> 1:31:17.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TOOK AN OATH, RAISED YOUR RIGHT
HAND HERE TODAY AND SAID THAT

1:31:17.133 --> 1:31:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU WOULD SOLEMNLY SWEAR TO TELL
THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH AND

1:31:21.233 --> 1:31:24.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH.
NOW YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING

1:31:24.600 --> 1:31:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTIONS, YOU'RE IMPEDING THIS
INVESTIGATION.

1:31:27.433 --> 1:31:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SO MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE LEGAL
STANDARD IS THAT YOU EITHER

1:31:30.966 --> 1:31:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANSWER THE QUESTION, THAT'S THE
BEST OUTCOME.

1:31:35.266 --> 1:31:38.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU SAY, THIS IS CLASSIFIED,
CAN'T ANSWER IT HERE.

1:31:38.366 --> 1:31:40.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'LL ANSWER IT IN CLOSED
SESSION.

1:31:40.100 --> 1:31:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT'S BUCK NUMBER TWO.
BUCKET NUMBER THREE IS TO SAY

1:31:43.333 --> 1:31:45.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'M INVOKING EXECUTIVE
PRIVILEGE.

1:31:45.833 --> 1:31:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THERE IS NO APPROPRIATENESS
BUCKET.

1:31:48.533 --> 1:31:52.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IT IS NOT A LEGAL STANDARD.
CAN YOU TELL THE WHAT ARE THESE

1:31:52.033 --> 1:31:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STANDING DOJ RULES THAT PROTECT

BY NOT GIVING IT AWAY BEFORE HE

1:32:09.200 --> 1:32:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HAS A CHANCE TO DEAL.
AND SECONDLY I AM TELLING THE

PRESIDENT HAS FULL OPPORTUNITY

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

QUESTIONS AND TO MAKE A DECISION

INVOKED.

QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT
INVESTIGATION.

1:33:15.066 --> 1:33:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IF I WANTED TO ASK QUESTIONS
ABOUT THAT INVESTIGATION, I'D

1:33:19.133 --> 1:33:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ASK THOSE OF ROD ROSEN STEIN.
I'M ASKING ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL

1:33:24.066 --> 1:33:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KNOWLEDGE FROM THIS COMMITTEE,
WHICH HAS A CONSTITUTIONAL

1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:30.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OBLIGATION TO GET TO THE BOTTOM
OF THIS.

1:33:30.566 --> 1:33:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THERE ARE TWO INVESTIGATIONS
HERE.

1:33:32.233 --> 1:33:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THERE'S A SPECIAL COUNCIL
INVESTIGATION AND ALSO A

1:33:35.333 --> 1:33:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION.
AND YOU ARE OBSTRUCTING THAT

1:33:38.833 --> 1:33:43.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION BY
NOT ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS.

1:33:43.400 --> 1:33:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND I THINK YOUR SILENCE, LIKE
THE SILENCE OF DIRECTOR COATS,

1:33:47.766 --> 1:33:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LIKE SILENCE OF ROGER, SPEAKS
VOLUMES.

1:33:52.100 --> 1:33:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> I WOULD SAY THAT I HAVE
CONSULTED WITH SENIOR CAREER

THEY BELIEVE THIS IS CONSISTENT

1:33:59.366 --> 1:34:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WITH MY DUTIES.
>> SENATOR RISCH ASKED YOU A

1:34:02.933 --> 1:34:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION ABOUT APPROPRIATENESS
IF YOU HAD KNOWN THAT THERE HAD

1:34:07.333 --> 1:34:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BEEN ANYTHING UNTOWARD WITH
REGARD TO RUSSIA AND THE

1:34:12.033 --> 1:34:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAMPAIGN, WOULD YOU HAVE HEADED
FOR THE EXIT?

1:34:14.966 --> 1:34:19.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOUR RESPONSE WAS MAYBE.
WHY WASN'T IT A SIMPLE YES?

1:34:19.166 --> 1:34:24.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> WELL, THERE WAS AN IMPROPER
ILLEGAL RELATIONSHIP IN AN

1:34:26.533 --> 1:34:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EFFORT TO IMPEDE OR INFLUENCE
THIS CAMPAIGN, I ABSOLUTELY

1:34:30.733 --> 1:34:34.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOULD HAVE DEPARTED.
>> THAT'S A GOOD ANSWER.

1:34:34.533 --> 1:34:38.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'M NOT SURE WHY IT WASN'T THE
ANSWER IN THE FIRST PLACE.

1:34:38.966 --> 1:34:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> I THOUGHT I DID
>> I THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT

1:34:40.466 --> 1:34:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NEITHER YOU OR DEPUTY ATTORNEY
ROD ROSEN STEIN BROUGHT UP

1:34:44.633 --> 1:34:47.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PERFORMANCE ISSUES WITH DIRECTOR
COMEY.

1:34:47.166 --> 1:34:52.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IN FACT, DEPUTY FBI DIRECTOR
McCABE HAS DIRECTLY REFUTED ANY

1:34:53.533 --> 1:34:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ASSERTION THAT THERE WERE
PERFORMANCE ISSUES.

1:34:55.166 --> 1:34:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THIS IS TROUBLING BECAUSE IT
APPEARS THAT THE PRESIDENT

1:34:58.566 --> 1:35:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DECIDED TO FIRE DIRECTOR COMEY
BECAUSE HE WAS PURSUING THE

1:35:02.566 --> 1:35:07.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION AND HAD
ASKED YOU TO COME UP WITH AN

1:35:07.166 --> 1:35:10.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EXCUSE.
WHEN YOUR ASSESSMENT OF DIRECTOR

1:35:10.366 --> 1:35:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COMEY DIDN'T HOLD UP TO PUBLIC
SCRUTINY, THE PRESIDENT FINALLY

1:35:13.700 --> 1:35:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ADMITTED THAT HE HAD FIRED
DIRECTOR COMEY BECAUSE HE WAS

1:35:16.233 --> 1:35:18.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PURSUING THE RUSSIAN
INVESTIGATION.

1:35:18.333 --> 1:35:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I THE LESTER HOLT INTERVIEW.
YOU CLAIM THAT DAY YOU DID NOT

1:35:22.733 --> 1:35:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BREAK RECUSAL WHEN PARTICIPATING
IN THE FIRING BUT APPEARS THAT

1:35:26.933 --> 1:35:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HIS FIRING WAS DIRECTLY RELATED
TO RUSSIA, NOT DEPARTMENT TALL

1:35:31.733 --> 1:35:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MISMANAGEMENT.
HOW DO YOU SQUARE THOSE TWO

1:35:33.700 --> 1:35:37.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
THINGS.
>> THERE'S A LOT IN THAT

1:35:37.233 --> 1:35:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION.
LET ME SAY FIRST, A WEEK AGO, I

1:35:43.666 --> 1:35:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BELIEVE MAY 3RD, DIRECTOR COMEY
TESTIFIED THAT HE BELIEVED THE

1:35:50.033 --> 1:35:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HANDLING OF THE CLINTON
DECLINATION WAS PROPER AND

1:35:56.766 --> 1:36:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
APPROPRIATE AND HE WOULD DO IT.
THAT WAS OF GREAT CONCERN TO

1:36:00.966 --> 1:36:04.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BOTH OF US.
BECAUSE IT DID NOT THAT

1:36:04.533 --> 1:36:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REPRESENTED SOMETHING THAT I
THINK MOST PROFESSIONALS IN THE

1:36:09.166 --> 1:36:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WOULD
TOTALLY AGREE THAT THE FBI

1:36:14.133 --> 1:36:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVESTIGATED AGENCY DOES NOT
DECIDE WHETHER TO PROSECUTE OR

1:36:17.800 --> 1:36:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DECLINE CRIMINAL CASES.
BREATH TAKING USE OF PATIENT OF

1:36:22.666 --> 1:36:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL.

1:36:26.533 --> 1:36:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SO THAT'S HOW WE FELT, THAT WAS
SORT OF ADDITIONAL CONCERN THAT

1:36:34.266 --> 1:36:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WE HAD HEADING THE FBI, SOMEONE
WHO BOLD'S ASSERTED THE RIGHT TO

1:36:40.700 --> 1:36:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CONTINUE TO MAKE SUCH DECISIONS.
THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS WE

1:36:43.300 --> 1:36:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DISCUSSED.
THAT WAS IN THE MEMORANDUM I

1:36:45.866 --> 1:36:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THINK, AND IT WAS ALSO A FACTOR
FOR US.

1:36:50.433 --> 1:36:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> BEFORE I RECOGNIZE SENATOR, I
WOULD LIKE THE RECORD TO SHOW

1:36:56.900 --> 1:37:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT LAST NIGHT, ADMIRAL ROGERS
SPENT ALMOST TWO HOURS IN CLOSE

1:37:02.900 --> 1:37:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SESSION WITH -- ALMOST THE FULL
COMMITTEE REFILLING HIS

1:37:09.633 --> 1:37:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COMMITMENT TO HIS IN THE HEARING
THAT IN CLOSED SESSION HE WOULD

1:37:13.733 --> 1:37:18.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANSWER THE QUESTION AND I THINK
IT WAS THOROUGHLY ANSWERED AND

1:37:18.100 --> 1:37:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALL MEMBERS WERE GIVEN AN
OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS.

1:37:20.100 --> 1:37:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I JUST WANT THE RECORD TO SHOW
THAT WAS WHAT HE STATED.

1:37:23.633 --> 1:37:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> THANK YOU, CHAIRMAN.
ATTORNEY GENERAL, GOTS TO SEE

YOU HERE, AND MARY, I KNOW THAT
PROBABLY THERE ARE OTHER PLACES

1:37:32.500 --> 1:37:36.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU'D BOTH RATHER BE BUT YOU
ALWAYS LOOKED AT PUBLIC SERVICE

1:37:36.466 --> 1:37:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU DID TOGETHER AND KNOW THAT
YOUR FAMILY CONTINUES TO BE

1:37:42.466 --> 1:37:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PROUD AND SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT YOU
DO.

1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> THANK YOU, I'M BLESSED
INDEED.

1:37:47.933 --> 1:37:50.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
>> I AGREE WITH THAT.
I AGREE WITH THAT.

1:37:50.433 --> 1:37:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LET ME JUST GET A COUPLE OF
THINGS CLEAR OF NOTES I'VE TAKEN

1:37:54.033 --> 1:37:57.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WHILE PEOPLE WERE ASKING
QUESTIONS.

1:37:57.466 --> 1:38:02.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ON APRIL 27TH, 2016 EVENT, I
BELIEVE THAT'S THE MAY FLOWER

1:38:03.800 --> 1:38:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOTEL SPEECH THAT THE
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE GAVE ON

1:38:08.800 --> 1:38:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FOREIGN POLICY.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE A ROOM AT THAT

1:38:11.500 --> 1:38:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EVENT WHERE YOU HAD PRIVATE
MEETINGS.

1:38:13.533 --> 1:38:15.033 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
DID YOU?
>> NO, I DID NOT

1:38:15.033 --> 1:38:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> AS I UNDERSTAND YOU WENT TO A
RECEPTION ATTENDED BY HOW MANY

1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PEOPLE?
>> I THINK TWO TO THREE DOZEN.

1:38:23.533 --> 1:38:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> TWO TO THREE DOZEN PEOPLE.
YOU WENT IN HEARD HIS SPEECH AND

1:38:26.233 --> 1:38:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THEN MAY HAVE SEEN PEOPLE ON
YOUR WAY OUT?

1:38:29.633 --> 1:38:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CORRECT
>> WHEN YOU SAID YOU POSSIBLY

1:38:32.400 --> 1:38:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HAD A MEETING WITH MR. KISLIAK,
DID YOU MEAN YOU POSSIBLY MET

1:38:38.900 --> 1:38:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HIM?
>> I DIDN'T HAVE ANY FORMER

1:38:42.566 --> 1:38:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MEETING WITH HIM.
I MAY HAVE HAD AN ENCOUNTER

1:38:45.500 --> 1:38:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DURING THE RECEPTION.
THAT'S THE ONLY THING I CAN.

1:38:48.500 --> 1:38:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'M SAY WITH CERTAINTY I DID
NOT.

1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT YOU
WERE SAYING BUT SOMETIMES I HEAR

1:38:54.800 --> 1:38:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A MEETING THAT WOULD MEAN MORE
TO ME THAN I MET SOMEBODY.

1:38:58.533 --> 1:39:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU MIGHT HAVE MET HIM AT THE
RECEPTION.

1:39:01.233 --> 1:39:03.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COULD YOU HAVE MET OTHER
AMBASSADORS AT THAT RECEPTION AS

1:39:03.933 --> 1:39:05.133 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
WELL?
EITHER COULD.

1:39:05.133 --> 1:39:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> I COULD.
OF I REMEMBER ONE IN PARTICULAR

1:39:08.766 --> 1:39:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT WE HAD A COUNTRY WITH.
HE HAD AN INVESTMENT IN ALABAMA

1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND WE TALKED A LITTLE LENGTH
ABOUT THAT BUT OTHERWISE, NO

1:39:20.166 --> 1:39:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RECOLLECTION OF A DISCUSSION
WITH THE SHOULD GO AMBASSADOR.

1:39:24.700 --> 1:39:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> SO YOU WERE THERE, YOU READ
SINCE HE WAS THERE, YOU MAY HAVE

1:39:27.633 --> 1:39:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEEN HIM BUT YOU HAD NO ROOM
WHERE YOU WERE HAVING MEETINGS

1:39:31.633 --> 1:39:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WITH INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE
DISCUSSIONS AT THE MAY FLOWER

1:39:34.800 --> 1:39:37.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HOTEL THAT DAY.
>> NO, THAT IS CORRECT.

1:39:37.633 --> 1:39:42.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> ON WHENEVER YOU TALKED TO MR.
COMEY, AFTER HE HAD HAD HIS

1:39:42.466 --> 1:39:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT, YOU
THINK THAT WAS PROBABLY THE NEXT

1:39:47.433 --> 1:39:50.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAY, YOU DIDN'T STAY AFTERWARDS
AND SEE HIM AFTER HE LEFT THE

1:39:50.766 --> 1:39:52.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
OVAL OFFICE THAT NIGHT?
>> NO.

1:39:52.233 --> 1:39:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AS I UNDERSTAND THE TESTIMONY
MAY HAVE SUGGESTED THAT IT

1:39:58.533 --> 1:40:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HAPPENED RIGHT AFTERWARDS, BUT
IT WAS EITHER THE NEXT MORNING,

1:40:01.233 --> 1:40:04.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WHICH I THINK IT WAS, OR MAYBE
THE MORNING AFTER THAT.

1:40:04.666 --> 1:40:09.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WE HAD A THREE TIMES A WEEK
NATIONAL SECURITY BRIEFING WITH

1:40:11.100 --> 1:40:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE FBI THAT I UNDERTAKE, AND SO
IT WAS AFTER THAT THAT WE HAD

1:40:18.066 --> 1:40:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT CONVERSATION.
>> NOW, WHAT I'M NOT QUITE CLEAR

1:40:21.633 --> 1:40:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ON IS DID YOU RESPOND WHEN HE
EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN OR NOT?

1:40:28.633 --> 1:40:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> YES, I DID RESPOND.
I THINK HE WAS INCORRECT.

1:40:32.833 --> 1:40:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HE INDICATED, I BELIEVE, THAT HE
WOULD NOT TOTALLY SURE OF THE

1:40:39.300 --> 1:40:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EXACT WORDING OF THE MEETING BUT
I DO RECALL MY CHIEF OF STAFF

1:40:42.266 --> 1:40:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WAS WITH ME, AND WE RECALL THAT
I DID AFFIRM LONG STANDING

1:40:49.166 --> 1:40:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WRITTEN POLICY OF THE DEPARTMENT
OF JUSTICE CONCERNING

1:40:52.533 --> 1:40:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE WHITE
HOUSE.

1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:58.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THOSE RULES,
AND IN THE LONG RUN, YOU'RE MUCH

1:40:58.300 --> 1:41:02.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BETTER OFF IF YOU DO.
THEY DID NOT PROHIBIT

1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COMMUNICATIONS ONE-ON-ONE BY THE
FBI DIRECTOR WITH THE PRESIDENT.

1:41:08.433 --> 1:41:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BUT IF THAT CONVERSATION MOVES
INTO CERTAIN AREAS, IT'S THE

1:41:12.866 --> 1:41:16.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DUTY, THE RULES APPLY TO THE
DAMAGE JUSTICE.

1:41:16.066 --> 1:41:20.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SO DUTY OF THE FBI TO SAY, MR.
PRESIDENT, I CAN'T TALK ABOUT

1:41:20.400 --> 1:41:23.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT.
THAT'S THE WAY THAT SHOULD WORK.

1:41:23.900 --> 1:41:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND APPARENTLY IT DID.
BECAUSE HE SAID HE DID NOT

1:41:30.066 --> 1:41:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IMPROPERLY DISCUSS MATTERS WITH
THE PRESIDENT.

1:41:31.566 --> 1:41:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> WHEN MR. COMEY TALK TO YOU
ABOUT MEETING DID HE MENTION MR.

1:41:34.700 --> 1:41:36.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:86.67% size:62.5%
FLYNN?
>> NO

1:41:36.266 --> 1:41:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> HE MENTIONED NO FACTS OF ANY
KIND.

1:41:39.633 --> 1:41:44.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HE DID NOT MENTION TO ME THAT HE
ASKED TO DO SOMETHING HE THOUGHT

1:41:44.200 --> 1:41:46.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WAS IMPROPER.
HE JUST SAID HE WAS

1:41:46.466 --> 1:41:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNCOMFORTABLE, I BELIEVE, WITH
IT.

1:41:48.533 --> 1:41:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> AFTER THAT DISCUSSION WITH
MR. COMEY

1:41:51.033 --> 1:41:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> ACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW THAT
HE SAID HE WAS UNCOMFORTABLE.

1:41:53.533 --> 1:41:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I BELIEVE HE SAID MAYBE WHAT HE
TESTIFIED TO PERHAPS THE CORRECT

1:42:00.600 --> 1:42:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WORDING.
I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT HE

1:42:03.333 --> 1:42:05.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SAID.
BUT I DON'T DISPUTE IT

1:42:05.533 --> 1:42:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> WELL, EXACTLY WHAT, I THINK
- - WHAT I REMEMBER HIM SAYING

1:42:09.233 --> 1:42:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WAS THAT YOU DIDN'T REACT AT ALL
WHEN KIND OF SHRUGGED.

1:42:12.433 --> 1:42:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU'RE SAYING YOU REFERRED HIM
TO THE NORMAL WAY THESE MEETINGS

1:42:16.300 --> 1:42:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE CONDUCTED?
>> I TOOK IT AS A CONCERN THAT

1:42:22.766 --> 1:42:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HE MIGHT BE ASKED SOMETHING THAT
WAS IMPROPER, AND I AFFIRMED TO

1:42:27.733 --> 1:42:31.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HIM HIS WILLINGNESS TO SAY NO.
NOT GO IN AN IMPROPER WAY,

1:42:36.233 --> 1:42:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IMPROPER DIRECTION.
>> PARDON ME, I'M ASSUMING YOU

1:42:39.733 --> 1:42:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE
IT WOULD RELATE TO THE MAY 8

1:42:43.300 --> 1:42:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MEETING.
BUT MY SENSE IS THAT NO DECISION

1:42:46.766 --> 1:42:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IS FINAL UNTIL IT'S CARRIED OUT.
MY GUESS IS THAT THERE ARE

1:42:50.533 --> 1:42:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PEOPLE AT THIS WHO HAVE SAID
THEY WERE GOING TO LET SOMEBODY

1:42:54.566 --> 1:42:58.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GO OR FIRE SOMEBODY THAT NEVER
DID THAT.

1:42:58.666 --> 1:43:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SO THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT
SAID THAT ON MAY 8 DOESN'T MEAN

1:43:02.533 --> 1:43:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT THE INFORMATION HE GOT FROM
YOU ON MAY 9 WAS NOT NECESSARY

1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OR IMPACTFUL AND I'M SURE YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO SAY HOW MANY TIMES

1:43:11.800 --> 1:43:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE PRESIDENT SAID WE OUGHT TO
GET RID OF THAT PERSON, BUT I'M

1:43:15.900 --> 1:43:20.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SURE THAT'S HAPPENED AND
CHAIRMAN,

1:43:20.333 --> 1:43:23.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> SENATOR McCAINE
>> THANK YOU FOR JOINING US

1:43:23.766 --> 1:43:26.666 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
TODAY.
>> THANK YOU

1:43:26.666 --> 1:43:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> YOU TESTIFIED-
AGO, I'M NOT ABLE TO INVOKE

1:43:28.900 --> 1:43:31.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE.
THAT'S UP TO THE PRESIDENT.

1:43:31.466 --> 1:43:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HAS THE PRESIDENT INVOKED
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE IN CASE OF

1:43:34.066 --> 1:43:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY?
>> HE HAS NOT

1:43:36.233 --> 1:43:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> THEN WHAT IS THE BASIS OF
YOUR REFUSAL TO ANSWER QUESTION

1:43:39.833 --> 1:43:43.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> SENATOR KANE, THE PRESIDENT
HAS A CONSTITUTIONAL?

1:43:43.166 --> 1:43:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THE
PRESIDENT HASN'T ASSERTED IT.

1:43:47.233 --> 1:43:50.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU DON'T HAVE THE POWER TO
ASSERT THE POWER OF EXECUTIVE

1:43:50.266 --> 1:43:52.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRIVILEGE.
WHAT IS THE LEGAL BASIS FOR YOUR

1:43:52.600 --> 1:43:54.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
REFUSAL TO ANSWER THESE
QUESTION.

1:43:54.100 --> 1:43:57.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> I'M PROTECTING RIGHT OF THE
PRESIDENT TO ASSERT IT IF HE

1:43:57.900 --> 1:44:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHOOSES.
AND THERE MAY BE OTHER PRIVILEGE

1:44:00.200 --> 1:44:03.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT IS COULD APPLY IN THIS
CIRCUMSTANCE.

1:44:03.266 --> 1:44:05.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU
CAN HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.

1:44:05.533 --> 1:44:09.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRESIDENT CAN'T NOT ASSERT IT
AND YOU'VE TESTIFIED THAT ONLY

1:44:09.366 --> 1:44:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE PRESIDENT CAN ASSERT IT YET
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THE

1:44:13.600 --> 1:44:17.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LEGAL BASIS FOR YOUR REFUSAL TO
>> WHAT WE TRY TO DO, I THINK

1:44:17.966 --> 1:44:22.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MOST CABINET OFFICIALS OTHERS
THAT YOU QUESTIONED RECENTLY,

1:44:24.400 --> 1:44:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OFFICIALS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE
PROTECT THE PRESIDENT'S RIGHT TO

1:44:27.333 --> 1:44:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DO SO.
IF IT COMES TO A POINT WHERE THE

1:44:31.933 --> 1:44:36.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISSUE IS CLEAR, AND THERE'S A
DISPUTE ABOUT IT AT SOME POINT

1:44:38.333 --> 1:44:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE PRESIDENT WILL EITHER ASSERT
THE PRIVILEGE OR NOT OR SOME

1:44:41.666 --> 1:44:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OTHER PRIVILEGE CAN BE -- WOULD
BE ASSERTED BUT AT THIS POINT, I

1:44:47.966 --> 1:44:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BELIEVE IT'S PREMATURE
>> IT WOULD BE PREMATURE FOR ME

1:44:54.266 --> 1:44:59.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TO DENY THE PRESIDENT A FULL AND
INTELLIGENT CHOICE OF EXECUTIVE

1:45:01.433 --> 1:45:03.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRIVILEGE.
THAT'S NOT NECESSARY AT THIS

1:45:03.766 --> 1:45:06.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
POINT
>> YOU TESTIFIED QUOTE WE WERE

1:45:06.066 --> 1:45:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ASKED FOR OUR OPINION.
WHO ASKED FOR YOUR OPINION?

1:45:10.066 --> 1:45:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> YOU MEAN?
YOU TESTIFIED WE WERE ASKED FOR

1:45:12.100 --> 1:45:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OUR OPINION.
>> MY UNDERSTANDING IS I BELIEVE

1:45:15.633 --> 1:45:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'M CORRECT IN SAYING THE
PRESIDENT HAS SAID SO.

1:45:20.166 --> 1:45:23.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT
>> HE DIDN'T ASK YOU DIRECTLY?

1:45:23.866 --> 1:45:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> I THOUGHT YOU WERE ASKING
ABOUT THE PRIVILEGE.

1:45:26.066 --> 1:45:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> NO, I'M GOING TO BACK.

EVALUATION THAT HAD BEEN GOING
ON FOR SOME MONTHS.

THAT HE THOUGHT HAD BEEN MADE IN

ACCURATE AND FAR MORE

SIGNIFICANT THAN I THINK A LOT

ATTORNEY SESSIONS, GOOD TO SEE

1:48:58.533 --> 1:49:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU AGAIN, YOU SPEAK AS A MAN
EAGER TO SET THE RECORD

1:49:01.233 --> 1:49:04.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STRAIGHT.
YOU'VE SPOKEN PLAIN FROM

1:49:04.533 --> 1:49:09.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BEGINNING TO THIS TIME.
I'M AMAZED AT THE CONVERSATIONS

1:49:09.366 --> 1:49:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AS IF AN ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS
NEVER SAID TO A PRIVATE

1:49:13.033 --> 1:49:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE
PRESIDENT, AND WE DON'T NEED TO

1:49:16.433 --> 1:49:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DISCUSS THOSE, THERE SEEMS TO BE
A SHORT MEMORY ABOUT SOME OF THE

1:49:19.333 --> 1:49:23.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STATEMENTS ERIC HOLDER WOULD AND
WOULD NOT MAKE TO ANY COMMITTEE

1:49:23.066 --> 1:49:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IN THE HOUSE OR THE SENATE.
AND WOULD OR WOULD NOT TURN OVER

1:49:26.666 --> 1:49:30.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DOCUMENTS EVEN REQUESTED.
THAT HAD TO GO THROUGH THE COURT

1:49:30.566 --> 1:49:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SYSTEM TO FINALLY THE COURTS
SAYING, NO, THE PRESIDENT CAN'T

1:49:34.366 --> 1:49:37.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOLD BACK DOCUMENTS AND THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL CAN'T DO THAT.

1:49:37.466 --> 1:49:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOMEHOW, SOME ACCUSATION THAT
YOU'RE NOT SAYING EVERY

1:49:41.633 --> 1:49:45.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CONVERSATION ABOUT EVERYTHING,
THERE'S A LONG HISTORY OF

1:49:45.833 --> 1:49:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ATTORNEY GENERALS STANDING
BESIDES THE PRESIDENT SAYING

1:49:49.133 --> 1:49:51.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THERE ARE SOME CONVERSATIONS
THAT ARE CONFIDENTIAL.

1:49:51.566 --> 1:49:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND THEN CAN WE DETERMINE FROM
THERE.

1:49:54.400 --> 1:49:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IT DOES SEEM THAT EVERY UNNAMED
SOURCE STORY SOMEHOW GETS A

1:50:00.566 --> 1:50:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HEARING.
I WAS IN THE HEARING THIS

1:50:02.100 --> 1:50:05.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MORNING WITH ROD ROSEN STEIN, AS
WE DEALT WITH THE APPROPRIATIONS

1:50:07.233 --> 1:50:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

OBVIOUSLY YOU WERE SCHEDULED TO

1:50:08.633 --> 1:50:10.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BE AT.
ROAD ROSEN STEIN WAS TAKING YOUR

PLACE TO BE ABLE TO COVER.
HE WAS CLEAR AND PEPPERED WITH

1:50:13.633 --> 1:50:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTIONS ABOUT RUSSIA DURING
THAT CONVERSATION AS WELL HE WAS

1:50:17.833 --> 1:50:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VERY CLEAR THAT HE HAS NEVER HAD
CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU ABOUT

1:50:21.800 --> 1:50:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT AND YOU HAVE NEVER
REQUESTED CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

1:50:25.233 --> 1:50:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT.
HE WAS ALSO PEPPERED WITH

QUESTIONS OF THE LATEST RUMOR OF

FIRING ROBERT MUELLER AND

1:50:36.800 --> 1:50:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GETTING RID OF HIM AND WAS CLEAR
THAT ROSEN STEIN HIMSELF SAID

1:50:39.933 --> 1:50:43.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD DO
THAT AND I'M NOT CONTEMPLATING

1:50:43.366 --> 1:50:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT NOR WOULD I DO THAT AND NO

GRABBING THE ATTENTION.
I DO WANT TO BE ABLE TO BRING UP

1:50:53.333 --> 1:50:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A COUPLE THINGS.
ONE IS TO DEFINE THE WORD

2:00:51.200 --> 2:00:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION THAT SHOULD BE ASKED.
I'M ON THE SIDE OF THE DICE.

2:00:57.700 --> 2:01:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IT'S A SIMPLE QUESTION IS DID
DONALD TRUMP OR ANY ASSOCIATES

2:01:02.533 --> 2:01:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IN THE CAMPAIGN, COLUDE WITH
RUSSIA?

WE'VE HEARD FROM SIX OF THE
EIGHT DEMOCRATS IN THIS

DON'T THINK A SINGLE ONE OF THEM

2:01:14.066 --> 2:01:17.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ASKED THAT QUESTION.
THEY'VE GONE DOWN LOTS OF OTHER

2:01:17.066 --> 2:01:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRAILS BUT NOT THAT QUESTION.
MAYBE THAT IS BECAUSE JAMES

2:01:20.866 --> 2:01:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COMEY SAID LAST WEEK AS HE SAID
TO DONALD TRUMP THREE TIMES HE

2:01:24.066 --> 2:01:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ASSURED HIM HE'S NOT UNDER
INVESTIGATION.

2:01:26.866 --> 2:01:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE MULTIPLE
DEMOCRATS ON THIS COMMITTEE HAVE

2:01:29.833 --> 2:01:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STATED THEY HAVE SEEN NO

LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND

2:17:24.700 --> 2:17:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PROSECUTORS MAY NEVER SELECT THE
TIMING OF INVESTIGATIVE STEPS OR

2:17:28.966 --> 2:17:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CRIMINAL CHARGES FOR THE PURPOSE
OF EFFECTING IN THE ELECTION.

2:17:36.800 --> 2:17:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CANDIDATE OR POLITICAL PARTY.
SUCH PURPOSE IS INCONSISTENT

2:17:41.233 --> 2:17:44.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S MISSION
AND WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF

2:17:44.766 --> 2:17:48.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
FEDERAL PROSECUTION.
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?

2:17:48.100 --> 2:17:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> ESSENTIALLY, YES.
>> SO ESSENTIALLY, THE DEPUTY

2:17:54.566 --> 2:17:58.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID IS THAT
FORMER DIRECTOR COMEY VIOLATED

2:17:59.933 --> 2:18:04.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
DETECTIVES WHEN HE HELD THE

2:18:04.100 --> 2:18:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRESS CONFERENCE ON JULY 5,
2016.

2:18:07.833 --> 2:18:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HE ANNOUNCED THAT SECRETARY
CLINTON WAS EXTREMELY CARE LESS

2:18:12.200 --> 2:18:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WITH CLASSIFIED E-MAIL AND WENT
ON TO RELEASE OTHER DEROGATORY

2:18:16.366 --> 2:18:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INFORMATION INCLUDING THIS
CONCLUSION THAT SHE WAS

2:18:18.933 --> 2:18:23.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EXTREMELY CARE LESS, YET WENT ON
TO SAY THAT NO REASONABLE

2:18:23.466 --> 2:18:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PROSECUTOR WOULD PROSECUTE HER.
THAT IS NOT THE ROLE OF THE FBI

2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:29.366 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
DIRECTOR.
IS IT?

2:18:29.366 --> 2:18:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT IS A JOB FOR THE
PROSECUTORS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF

2:18:31.566 --> 2:18:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUSTICE, THAT'S WHAT WAS MEANT
BY DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL ROSEN

2:18:36.300 --> 2:18:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEIN WHEN HE SAID THAT DR.
COMEY USURPED THE ROLE OF THE

2:18:40.366 --> 2:18:42.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
PROSECUTORS SATURDAY?

2:18:42.433 --> 2:18:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> THAT IS CORRECT AND FORMER
ATTORNEY GENERAL BILL BAR WROTE

2:18:50.166 --> 2:18:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RECENTLY IN WHICH HE SAID HE HAD
ASSUMED THAT ATTORNEY GENERAL

2:18:54.133 --> 2:18:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LYNCH HAD URGED MR. COMEY TO
MAKE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT SO SHE

2:19:00.566 --> 2:19:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO IT.
BUT IN FACT, IT APPEARS HE DID

2:19:03.633 --> 2:19:06.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
IT WITHOUT HER APPROVAL,
TOTALLY.

2:19:06.833 --> 2:19:11.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND THAT IS A PRETTY STUNNING
THING, IT IS A STUNNING THING.

2:19:13.266 --> 2:19:17.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND IT VIOLATES FUNDAMENTAL
POWERS AND WHEN HE REAFFIRMED

2:19:17.166 --> 2:19:22.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT THE RIGHTNESS HE BELIEVES
OF HIS DECISION ON MAY 3, I

2:19:23.500 --> 2:19:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BELIEVE IT WAS, THAT WAS
ADDITIONAL CONFIRMATION THAT THE

2:19:29.366 --> 2:19:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIRECTOR'S THINKING WAS NOT

2:19:30.800 --> 2:19:35.800 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
CLEAR.
>> THANK YOU.

2:19:41.966 --> 2:19:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OTHERS HAVE RAISED THE ISSUE OF
LONGSTANDING RULES.

2:19:45.500 --> 2:19:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IF THERE ARE WRITTEN RULES WOULD
YOU PROVIDE THEM TO THE

2:19:48.666 --> 2:19:51.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COMMITTEE, PLEASE?
>> I WILL.

2:19:51.033 --> 2:19:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> NOW, THE POINT HAS BEEN MADE

2:19:55.000 --> 2:19:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT THE WHOLE SUBSTANCE OF YOUR
RECOMMENDATION TO THE PRESIDENT

2:19:58.933 --> 2:20:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TO DISMISS DIRECTOR COMEY WAS
HIS UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT WITH

2:20:03.000 --> 2:20:04.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RESPECT TO THE CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION.

2:20:04.600 --> 2:20:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IS THAT CORRECT.
>> I SUPPORTED EVERYTHING THAT

2:20:11.000 --> 2:20:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL PUT
IN HIS MEMORANDA AS GOOD AND

2:20:17.200 --> 2:20:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IMPORTANT FACTORS TO USE IN
DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT HE

2:20:23.966 --> 2:20:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HAD CONDUCTED HIMSELF IN WAY
THAT JUSTIFIED CONTINUING IN

2:20:28.166 --> 2:20:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OFFICE.
I THINK IT PRETTY WELL SPEAKS

2:20:30.333 --> 2:20:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FOR ITSELF AND I BELIEVE MOST OF
IT DID DEAL WITH THAT.

2:20:34.366 --> 2:20:38.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE DISCUSSION ABOUT HIS
PERFORMANCE WAS A BIPARTISAN

2:20:38.366 --> 2:20:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DISCUSSION.
IT BEGAN DURING THE ELECTION

2:20:40.700 --> 2:20:43.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TIME.
DEMOCRATS WERE VERY UNHAPPY

2:20:43.633 --> 2:20:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ABOUT THE WAY HE CONDUCTED
HIMSELF.

2:20:47.633 --> 2:20:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND IN RETROSPECT, IN LOOKING AT
IT, I THINK IT WAS MORE

2:20:51.633 --> 2:20:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EGREGIOUS AND I MAY HAVE EVEN
UNDERSTOOD AT THE TIME.

2:20:55.633 --> 2:20:59.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WITH REGARD TO
>> IF I MAY, I DON'T WANT TO CUT

2:20:59.466 --> 2:21:01.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
YOU OFF
>> I'LL LET YOU GO.

2:21:01.100 --> 2:21:02.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'M SORRY.
>> EXCUSE ME, SIR.

2:21:02.600 --> 2:21:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ON JULY 7, WHEN MR. COMEY MADE
HIS FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT THE

2:21:06.833 --> 2:21:10.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CASE, YOU WERE ON FOX NEWS AND
YOU SAID FIRST OF ALL, DIRECTOR

2:21:10.866 --> 2:21:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COMEY IS A SKILLED FORMER
PROSECUTOR AND THEN CONCLUDED BY

2:21:14.966 --> 2:21:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAYING ESSENTIALLY THAT IT'S NOT
HIS PROBLEM.

2:21:21.366 --> 2:21:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IT'S HILLARY CLINTON'S PROBLEM.
THEN IN NOVEMBER, NOVEMBER 6

2:21:26.466 --> 2:21:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AFTER IN YOUR COMEY AGAIN MADE
NEWS IN LATE OCTOBER BY

2:21:29.700 --> 2:21:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REOPENING, IF YOU WILL THE
INVESTIGATION, YOU SAID AGAIN ON

2:21:36.166 --> 2:21:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FOX NEWS, FBI DIRECTOR DID THE
RIGHT THING WHEN HE FOUND NEW

2:21:39.266 --> 2:21:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EVIDENCE.
HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO REPORT

2:21:41.600 --> 2:21:45.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IT TO THE AMERICAN CONGRESS.
HE HAD UNDER OATH TESTIFIED.

2:21:45.766 --> 2:21:48.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE INVESTIGATION WAS OVER.
HE HAD TO CORRECT THAT AND SAY,

2:21:48.766 --> 2:21:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THIS INVESTIGATION ONGOING NOW
I'M SURE IT'S SIGNIFICANT OR

2:21:52.100 --> 2:21:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELSE HE WOULDN'T HAVE ANNOUNCED
THAT.

2:21:54.633 --> 2:21:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SO IN JULY AND NOVEMBER DIRECTOR
COMEY WAS DOING EXACTLY THE

2:22:01.033 --> 2:22:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RIGHT THING, YOU FELT THAT IN
FACT, HE WAS A SKILLED

2:22:06.733 --> 2:22:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PROFESSIONAL PROSECUTOR, YOU
FELT THAT HIS LAST STATEMENT IN

2:22:09.766 --> 2:22:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OCTOBER WAS FULLY JUSTIFIED.
SO HOW CAN YOU GO FROM THOSE

2:22:14.500 --> 2:22:19.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STATEMENTS TO AGREEING WITH MR.
ROSEN STEIN AND THEN ASKING THE

2:22:21.366 --> 2:22:23.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRESIDENT FOR RECOMMENDING HE BE
FIRED?

2:22:23.266 --> 2:22:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> I THINK, IN RETROSPECT, AS
ALL OF US BEGIN TO LOOK AT THAT

2:22:30.533 --> 2:22:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLEARLY AND TALK ABOUT I --
ONCE THE DIRECTOR, FIRST GOT

2:22:39.400 --> 2:22:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVOLVED AND EM BRAWLED IN A
PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF THIS

2:22:43.533 --> 2:22:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVESTIGATION, WHICH WOULD HAVE
BEEN BETTER NEVER TO HAVE BEEN

2:22:47.566 --> 2:22:52.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DISCUSSED PROBABLY AND SAID IT
WAS OVER, THEN WHEN HE FOUND NEW

2:22:54.033 --> 2:22:59.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EVIDENCE, THAT CAME UP, I THINK
HE PROBABLY WAS REQUIRED TO TELL

2:23:00.900 --> 2:23:04.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CONGRESS THAT IT WASN'T OVER.
THAT NEW EVIDENCE HAD BEEN

2:23:04.966 --> 2:23:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEVELOPED.
IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN

2:23:06.666 --> 2:23:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BETTER AND WOULD HAVE BEEN
CONSISTENT WITH THE RULES OF THE

2:23:10.400 --> 2:23:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO NEVER
TALKED ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION

2:23:13.500 --> 2:23:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TO BEGIN WITH.
ONCE YOU GET DOWN THAT ROAD,

2:23:16.833 --> 2:23:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT
YOU GET INTO, THAT WENT AGAINST

2:23:20.100 --> 2:23:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLASSICAL PROSECUTING OF
POLICIES THAT I LEARNED AND WAS

2:23:24.933 --> 2:23:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAUGHT WHEN I WAS A UNITED
STATES ATTORNEY AND ASSISTANT

2:23:28.533 --> 2:23:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNITED STATES ATTORNEY
>> LET ME ASK ANOTHER QUESTION.

2:23:32.566 --> 2:23:36.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOUR WHOLE PREMISE IN
RECOMMENDING TO THE PRESIDENT

2:23:36.166 --> 2:23:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WAS THE ACTIONS IN OCTOBER
INVOLVING SECRETARY OF STATE

CONTROVERSY.

2:23:45.800 --> 2:23:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DID YOU FEEL MISLED WHEN THE
PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED THAT THE

2:23:48.466 --> 2:23:52.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REAL REASON FOR DISMISSING MR.
COMEY WAS THE RUSSIAN

2:23:52.500 --> 2:23:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVESTIGATION
>> I'M NOT ABLE TO CHARACTERIZE

2:23:59.033 --> 2:24:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT -- I WOULDN'T TRY TO
COMMENT ON THAT

2:24:01.266 --> 2:24:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> SO YOU HAD NO INKLING THAT
THERE WAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH

2:24:05.433 --> 2:24:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUSSIA UNTIL THE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES BASICALLY

2:24:08.900 --> 2:24:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DECLARED NOT ONLY ON TV, BUT IN
THE OVAL OFFICE TO THE RUSSIAN

2:24:15.333 --> 2:24:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

PRESSURE IS OFF NOW, I GOT RID

2:24:17.633 --> 2:24:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OF THAT NUT JOB.
THAT CAME TO YOU AS A COMPLETE

OUR RECOMMENDATION WAS PUT IN
WRITING AND I BELIEVE IT WAS

2:24:28.233 --> 2:24:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CORRECT, AND I BELIEVE THE
PRESIDENT VALUED IT BUT MADE HIS

2:24:34.533 --> 2:24:38.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DECISION, IT WAS HIS
>> YOU HAD NO INKLING THAT HE

2:24:38.366 --> 2:24:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WAS CONSIDERING THE RUSSIAN
INVESTIGATION?

WHOLE RECAPITULATION OF CLINTON
WAS A STORY BASICALLY, A COVER

2:24:59.633 --> 2:25:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STORY THAT THE PRESIDENT TRIED
TO PUT OUT, AND THAT HE QUICKLY

2:25:03.633 --> 2:25:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ABANDONED AND HIS REAL REASON
WAS RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION, WHICH

2:25:07.500 --> 2:25:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IF HAD BEEN THE CASE, I WOULD
SUSPECT YOU WOULD HAVE RECUSED

ABOUT THAT.
DID YOU RAISE CONCERN ABOUT

RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE?

2:35:19.733 --> 2:35:24.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FACT THAT YOU HAD NEVER BEEN
BRIEFED SINCE DAY ONE ON THE

2:35:24.166 --> 2:35:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVESTIGATION.
BUT YOU MADE CLEAR THAT YOU

2:35:27.466 --> 2:35:31.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAN'T THINK OF ANY OTHER
CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU HAD WITH

2:35:31.600 --> 2:35:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUSSIAN OFFICIALS OR YOU'VE
COVERED IN DETAILS THE

2:35:36.133 --> 2:35:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CONVERSATION THAT YOU HAD,
THOUGH BRIEF, WITH DIRECTOR

2:35:39.400 --> 2:35:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COMEY THAT HE REFERENCED TO IN
HIS PRIVATE MEETING WITH THE

2:35:43.100 --> 2:35:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRESIDENT.
JUST TO NAME A FEW THINGS THAT I

2:35:45.700 --> 2:35:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THINK YOU HELPED US CLEAR UP.
THERE WERE SEVERAL QUESTIONS

2:35:49.100 --> 2:35:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT YOU CHOSE NOT TO ANSWER,
BECAUSE OF CONFIDENTIALITY WITH

2:35:55.266 --> 2:35:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE PRESIDENT.
I WOULD ONLY ASK YOU, NOW, TO GO

2:35:58.433 --> 2:36:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BACK AND THE WHITE HOUSE TO SEE
IF THERE ARE ERRORS OF QUESTIONS

2:36:04.900 --> 2:36:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH
YOU ASKING AND IF THEY DO WOULD

2:36:08.400 --> 2:36:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU PROVIDE THOSE ANSWERS IN
WRITING TO COMMITTEE.

2:36:11.800 --> 2:36:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I WOULD ALSO BE REMISS IF I
DIDN'T REMIND YOU THOSE

2:36:15.533 --> 2:36:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DOCUMENTS THAT YOU CAN PRO
PROVIDE TO THE COMMITTEE THEY

2:36:19.033 --> 2:36:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOULD BE HELPFUL TO US FOR
PURPOSE OF TIMELINES OR ANYTHING

2:36:25.366 --> 2:36:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THAT SUBSTANTIATES YOUR
TESTIMONY TODAY INDIVIDUALS WHO

2:36:30.900 --> 2:36:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIGHT HAVE BEEN AT AN EVENT THAT
YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH, ESPECIALLY

2:36:34.366 --> 2:36:37.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THOSE THAT WOULD BE EXTREMELY
HELPFUL.

2:36:37.066 --> 2:36:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MORE IMPORTANTLY, I WANT TO
THANK YOU FOR YOUR AGREEMENT TO

2:36:40.033 --> 2:36:44.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HAVE CONTINUING DIALOGUE WITH US
AS WE MIGHT NEED TO ASK SOME

2:36:44.466 --> 2:36:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AS WE GO A
LITTLE FURTHER DOWN THE

2:36:47.900 --> 2:36:50.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVESTIGATION.
THAT CERTAINLY DOES NOT HAVE TO

2:36:50.466 --> 2:36:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BE A PUBLIC HEARING.
BUT IT MAY BE AN EXCHANGE OF

2:36:54.033 --> 2:36:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DIALOGUE THAT WE HAVE.
YOU HAVE HELPED US TREMENDOUSLY

2:36:57.633 --> 2:37:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND WE'RE GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR
THE UNBELIEVABLE SACRIFICE THAT

2:37:02.633 --> 2:37:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOU MADE IN THIS INSTITUTION BUT
ALSO NOW IN THIS ADMINISTRATION.

2:37:06.400 --> 2:37:11.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THIS HEARING IS NOW ADJOURNED.
>> THANK YOU.

2:37:11.266 --> 2:37:16.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> THAT CONCLUDES THE HEARING
BEFORE THE SENATE SELECT

2:37:17.700 --> 2:37:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE, I'M
JUDY WOODRUFF, BACK WITH THE

2:37:23.633 --> 2:37:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS
WALTER DELLINGER.

2:37:29.266 --> 2:37:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IT WAS AN EMPHATIC DENIAL THAT
HE HAD ANY IMPROPER CONTACT OR

2:37:36.233 --> 2:37:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COMMUNICATIONS WITH RUSSIAN
OFFICIALS EITHER DURING THE

2:37:39.233 --> 2:37:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAMPAIGN OR AFTERWARDS.
AND HE WAS ALSO THIS BECAME A

2:37:45.666 --> 2:37:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CONTENTIOUS, YOU HEARD IT AGAIN
FROM THE CHAIRMAN SENATOR BURR

2:37:48.700 --> 2:37:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WHO REFUSED TO DISCUSS HIS
CONVERSATIONS WITH PRESIDENT

2:37:52.866 --> 2:37:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP ABOUT THE FIRING OF FBI
DIRECTOR COMEY, AND ABOUT THE

2:37:57.033 --> 2:38:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION OVERALL.
ON WHAT BASIS WOULD YOU AN

2:38:01.966 --> 2:38:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ATTORNEY GENERAL SAY I CANNOT
ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT MY

2:38:05.033 --> 2:38:07.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE
PRESIDENT?

2:38:07.233 --> 2:38:09.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> WELL, HE COULD INVOKE
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE BUT HE

2:38:09.800 --> 2:38:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT OBVIOUSLY
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT HAS TO BE

2:38:13.033 --> 2:38:15.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ONE TO INVOKE EXECUTIVE
PRIVILEGE.

2:38:15.300 --> 2:38:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND THE WANT TO ANSWER THE
QUESTION BUT HE DIDN'T WANT TO

2:38:17.500 --> 2:38:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
INVOKE EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE.
AFTER DOZEN TIMES NOW ANSWERED

2:38:22.033 --> 2:38:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THE QUESTION, HE DID SAY, LOOK,
I NEED TO GO BACK TO THE WHITE

2:38:25.133 --> 2:38:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOUSE, I NEED TO PROTECT THE
PRESIDENT'S RIGHT TO ASSERT

2:38:27.133 --> 2:38:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE.
SO THE PROPER FOLLOW-UP WOULD BE

2:38:29.800 --> 2:38:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FOR THE COMMITTEE TO SAY, HEAR
THE QUESTIONS QUESTIONS.

2:38:33.266 --> 2:38:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DID YOU DISCUSS THE COMEY FIRING
WITH THE PRESIDENT?

2:38:36.033 --> 2:38:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AND DOES THE PRESIDENT WANT TO
ASSERT IN WRITING EXECUTIVE

2:38:39.666 --> 2:38:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRIVILEGE
>> AND THAT WAS AN ANSWER I

2:38:41.300 --> 2:38:45.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THINK TO A QUESTION WHO WAS
PUSHING HIM ON QUESTION OF

2:38:45.333 --> 2:38:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAYING THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT
ASKED YOU TO -- I'M NOT

2:38:49.400 --> 2:38:51.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EXERCISING THE EXECUTIVE
PRIVILEGE BUT YOU'RE STILL NOT

2:38:51.666 --> 2:38:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANSWERING OUR QUESTIONS AND HIS
RESPONSE WAS, I BELIEVE THAT'S

2:38:55.266 --> 2:38:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CONFIDENTIAL AND I'M ABIDING BY
LONG-TIME JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

2:38:58.933 --> 2:39:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
POLICY.
HERE'S SOMEONE WHO WORKED AT THE

2:39:00.966 --> 2:39:05.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.
>> I KNOW OF NO SUCH

2:39:05.333 --> 2:39:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LONGSTANDING POLICY.
IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO SAY, THIS

2:39:09.533 --> 2:39:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IS AN AREA THE PRESIDENT MAY
WANT TO INVOKE EXECUTIVE

2:39:12.666 --> 2:39:14.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRIVILEGE ABOUT AND I NEED TO
ASK HIM THAT.

2:39:14.700 --> 2:39:18.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IT WAS LONG TIME BEFORE HE GOT
THERE, AND IT WAS SOME INDIRECT

2:39:18.366 --> 2:39:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WHEN HE RESPONDED THAT WAY.
I DON'T KNOW OF ANY LONGSTANDING

2:39:21.366 --> 2:39:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
POLICY.
EXCEPT FOR EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE

2:39:25.100 --> 2:39:26.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SIMPLY PREFER NOT TO ANSWER
QUESTIONS

2:39:26.966 --> 2:39:29.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> IT WAS NOTABLE AT THE END
THAT THE CHAIRMAN, SENATOR BURR

2:39:29.966 --> 2:39:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DID ASK THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO
GO BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND

2:39:33.166 --> 2:39:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING HE
CAN REVEAL EITHER SPOKEN OR

2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WRITTEN BETWEEN THEM.
I THOUGHT IT WAS NOTABLE ON

2:39:39.800 --> 2:39:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEVERAL OTHER FRONTS, HE SAID HE
WAS COMFORTABLE WITH THE FIRING

2:39:42.933 --> 2:39:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OF JAMES COMEY AS FBI DIRECTOR
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T APPROVE OF THE

2:39:45.900 --> 2:39:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WAY HE HAD HANDLED THE CLINTON
INVESTIGATION, I WAS ALSO STRUCK

2:39:49.366 --> 2:39:53.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUICKLY WALTER, HE SAID HE HAD
NEVER ASKED FOR A BRIEFING SINCE

2:39:53.166 --> 2:39:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HE'S BEEN ATTORNEY GENERAL ON
THE RUSSIA ATTEMPTS TO INTERFERE

2:39:57.133 --> 2:40:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WITH THE U.S. ELECTION
>> IT WAS QUITE STRIKING HOW

2:40:00.333 --> 2:40:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNDER STATED HE WAS.
HE WAS VERY EFFECTIVE DENYING

2:40:04.833 --> 2:40:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HIS OWN INVOLVE BUT UNDER STATED
ABOUT THE FACT THAT A FOREIGN

2:40:08.366 --> 2:40:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILITARY POWER HAD TO DISRUPT
OUR ELECTIONS HE SAID IT WAS

2:40:12.566 --> 2:40:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IMPROPER.
BUT THEN HE SPOKE ABOUT HE

2:40:14.633 --> 2:40:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WANTED TO GET ON BETTER TRACK.
TO SEEMED VERY UNDER STATED

2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:24.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
>> AS YOU SAID MADE A POINT ONE
POINT IN THIS HEARING OF SAYING

2:40:26.900 --> 2:40:29.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WE SHOULD HAVE BETTER RELATIONS
WITH THE RUSSIANS BUT THE SOVIET

2:40:29.666 --> 2:40:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNION HAS COLLAPSED.
