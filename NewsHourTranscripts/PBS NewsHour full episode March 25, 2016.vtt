JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.673 --> 00:11.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: more
raids and
arrests in Brussels. We're on
the ground as

00:11.578 --> 00:16.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
police and intelligence services
try to track
down the terrorists.

00:16.583 --> 00:21.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is a war of words
between the two
leading Republican presidential
candidates.

00:22.089 --> 00:26.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's Friday. Mark Shields and
David Brooks
are here to analyze the week's
news.

00:26.894 --> 00:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, we head to Kentucky, where
promising
programs help fight and prevent
cancer among

00:33.400 --> 00:35.168 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the poor.

00:35.269 --> 00:38.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM COLLINS, Rural Prevention
Cancer Center:
The challenge is educating them
that they

00:38.138 --> 00:42.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can do something about it, and
that I can
help them do something about it.

00:42.409 --> 00:50.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:50.350 --> 00:53.053 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:53.153 --> 01:03.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This was the
third and final
day of official mourning in
Belgium for victims

01:03.196 --> 01:08.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Islamic State attacks in
Brussels.
And there was confirmation that
two Americans

01:08.435 --> 01:15.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were among the 31 dead. That
word came as
raids spread across the Belgian
capital.

01:15.175 --> 01:17.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Malcolm Brabant has our
coverage, from Brussels.

01:18.078 --> 01:23.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: One raid
centered on this
residential neighborhood, where
police suited

01:23.684 --> 01:30.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up in bomb disposal outfits to
enter two apartments.
State TV reported two
explosions. Cell phone

01:30.791 --> 01:35.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
footage also showed a raid on a
bus stop,
where a suspect was believed to
be carrying

01:35.395 --> 01:39.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a suitcase filled with
explosives. He was
shot in the leg and arrested.

01:39.666 --> 01:46.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: He was sitting at the bus
stop with his
daughter. And after that, two
cars, two special

01:46.540 --> 01:52.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cars from the police coming, and
they told
him to stop. He tried to do
something, boom,

01:52.412 --> 01:54.147 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
boom, two shots.

01:54.247 --> 01:58.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: All told, there
were three
daytime arrests across the city,
in addition

01:58.118 --> 02:02.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to seven others overnight. All
this follows
Tuesday's suicide attacks on the
Brussels

02:02.889 --> 02:07.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
airport and the Molenbeek metro
station. They
came within days of police raids
in the Molenbeek

02:07.861 --> 02:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
neighborhood last week that led
to the capture
of Paris attacker Salah
Abdeslam.

02:13.533 --> 02:17.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Some of today's activity
happened in the nearby
Schaerbeek neighborhood, where
three days

02:17.637 --> 02:23.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago police also found a large
stash of explosives.
Meanwhile, Belgium's nuclear
plants added

02:23.677 --> 02:28.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
security and withdrew entry
badges from some
staff amid concern the plants
could become

02:29.082 --> 02:31.018 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
terror targets.

02:31.118 --> 02:36.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Investigators also named a new
suspect, 28-year-old
Syrian Naim al-Hamed. They now
believe he

02:36.423 --> 02:41.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had some role in Tuesday's
assault. The attacks
underscore the intelligence
challenges across

02:41.228 --> 02:47.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Europe with 28 countries in the
European Union,
each with its own security
services, and communication

02:47.501 --> 02:49.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
among them muddled.

02:49.469 --> 02:54.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Claude Moniquet is a former
French spy, and
head of a security consultancy,
the European

02:54.207 --> 02:56.376 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Strategic Intelligence and
Security Center.

02:56.476 --> 02:58.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CLAUDE MONIQUET, European
Strategic Intelligence
and Security Center: The
services, police

02:58.378 --> 03:05.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and intelligence, are
overwhelmed by a threat
which is not sized to Europe. We
are facing

03:05.519 --> 03:11.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thousands, thousands of possible
potential
terrorists. At the time of
al-Qaida, for instance,

03:11.725 --> 03:18.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we were facing maybe 500 to
1,000 people in
Europe, and it was already
considered a very

03:18.965 --> 03:25.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hard threat. Today, we have at
least 10 times
more people to confront and to
survey.

03:25.238 --> 03:29.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But how does
the West counter
the appeal of the Islamic State
amongst young

03:29.543 --> 03:35.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Muslims? Moroccan-born Rachid
Benzine is a
professor of Islamic studies. He
says European

03:35.415 --> 03:39.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
governments must strive harder
to help them
integrate and give them a sense
of belonging.

03:40.053 --> 03:43.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHID BENZINE, Professor of
Islamic Studies
(through translator): Our young
people are

03:44.091 --> 03:49.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
not being radicalized in
mosques. The phenomenon
of radicalization is taking
place within the

03:49.596 --> 03:53.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
family unit and with their
friends and peers.
We need to provide them with the
tools so

03:54.067 --> 03:59.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that our young people are
sufficiently armed
against the ideology facing us,
because if

03:59.806 --> 04:04.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you don't fully integrate young
people, their
imagination will automatically
create a symbolic

04:04.878 --> 04:07.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
identity, and people can die for
that.

04:07.380 --> 04:10.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Such concerns
were in the
air today as Secretary of State
John Kerry

04:10.984 --> 04:14.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
arrived in Belgium to meet with
Prime Minister
Charles Michel on defeating
ISIS.

04:14.654 --> 04:18.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES MICHEL, Belgian Prime
Minister (through
translator): With John Kerry to
discuss the

04:18.792 --> 04:25.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fight against terrorism, how is
it possible
to do better, how is it possible
to work together

04:26.099 --> 04:28.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in order to be more efficient?

04:28.101 --> 04:32.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: We will
not rest until we have
eliminated your nihilistic

04:32.772 --> 04:37.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
beliefs and cowardice from the
face of this
earth.

04:37.577 --> 04:41.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Later, Kerry
placed a wreath
of flowers at a makeshift
memorial for the

04:41.681 --> 04:46.620 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
victims at Brussels Airport.

04:46.720 --> 04:50.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at Bourse Plaza, which has
also become
a memorial site, the Brussels
Philharmonic

04:50.724 --> 04:59.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
played an impromptu tribute
today to the victims.
The Flemish Radio Choir joined
them to finish

04:59.299 --> 05:04.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with a performance of
Beethoven's "Ode to
Joy," a European anthem, and a
hymn of hope

05:04.337 --> 05:06.373 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for the future.

05:06.473 --> 05:12.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Away from Brussels, police in
neighboring
countries are on the move. In
France, the

05:12.479 --> 05:16.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
authorities say that a man
arrested there
was in the advanced stages of
plotting a new

05:16.349 --> 05:22.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strike and had ties to the
ringleader of Paris'
attacks last November. And in
Germany, authorities

05:22.255 --> 05:27.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are questioning two people who
have potential
links to the Brussels operation
-- Judy.

05:27.160 --> 05:31.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Malcolm Brabant
in Brussels
tonight, thank you.

05:31.464 --> 05:36.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. military is claiming
new kills in
the war on Islamic State
leaders. Pentagon

05:36.937 --> 05:42.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaders announced today that
attacks this
week killed several senior
figures. One was

05:42.609 --> 05:47.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Haji Imam, identified as the
group's finance
minister. Officials say it
happened in a raid

05:47.847 --> 05:53.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Syria. We will take a closer
look at the
war on ISIS after the news
summary.

05:53.753 --> 06:00.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Heavy fighting raged for a third
day, as government
troops fought to retake Palmyra
from ISIS.

06:00.760 --> 06:07.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The army and its militia allies
seized an
ancient citadel, backed by
Russian air support.

06:07.334 --> 06:13.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Capturing Palmyra could open
much of Eastern
Syria to government forces, but
large parts

06:13.106 --> 06:16.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the town remain under the
militants' control.

06:16.276 --> 06:22.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, in Iraq a suicide
bomber killed
29 people at a soccer match
south of Baghdad.

06:22.415 --> 06:28.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At least 60 others were wounded.
There was
no immediate claim of
responsibility.

06:28.488 --> 06:35.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A Korean-American arrested in
North Korea
confessed today to stealing
military secrets.

06:35.228 --> 06:41.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State television showed Kim Dong
Chul at a
news conference in Pyongyang.
The 62-year-old

06:41.167 --> 06:47.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was arrested last October.
Today, he tearfully
admitted to spying for the U.S.
and South

06:47.841 --> 06:49.743 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Korea.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KIM DONG CHUL, Detained
Korean-American (through
translator): The extraordinary
crime I committed

06:52.078 --> 06:56.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was defaming and insulting the
republic's
highest dignity and its system,
and spreading

06:56.716 --> 06:59.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
false propaganda aimed at
breaking down its
solidarity.

06:59.619 --> 07:05.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Earlier this
month, North Korea
sentenced Otto Warmbier, an
American college

07:05.492 --> 07:10.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
student, to 15 years for trying
to steal a
propaganda banner.

07:10.664 --> 07:15.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Much of the Christian world
marked Good Friday
today. In Jerusalem's Old City,
thousands

07:15.735 --> 07:20.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
walked the Way of the Cross.
It's the route
that, according to tradition,
Jesus took to

07:20.907 --> 07:27.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his crucifixion. Later, Pope
Francis led Good
Friday services at the Vatican.
Hundreds of

07:27.147 --> 07:30.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
worshipers filled St. Peter's
Basilica.

07:30.450 --> 07:35.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the Philippines, some of
the faithful
had themselves nailed to
crosses, including

07:35.588 --> 07:42.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one who did it for the 30th
year. Thousands
of tourists looked on and took
pictures.

07:42.329 --> 07:48.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And TV writer Earl Hamner Jr.
has died of
pneumonia in Los Angeles. He was
best known

07:48.368 --> 07:54.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for creating "The Waltons,"
based on his own
upbringing in Virginia's Blue
Ridge Mountains.

07:54.207 --> 08:03.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It ran for nine seasons,
starting in 1972,
and won 12 Emmys. Earl Hamner
Jr. was 92 years

08:03.183 --> 08:04.984 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
old.

08:05.085 --> 08:09.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
how the U.S.
is fighting ISIS; Mark Shields
and David Brooks

08:09.723 --> 08:16.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
take on this week's news;
beating cancer in
one of America's poorest
communities; from

08:16.329 --> 08:22.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
groups of white supremacists to
lone wolves,
exploring a racist undercurrent
in the United

08:22.268 --> 08:37.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
States; and much more.

08:37.650 --> 08:42.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of Defense Ash Carter
and the chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
General Joe

08:42.455 --> 08:47.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dunford, spoke this morning at
the Pentagon
about the fight against the
Islamic State.

08:47.761 --> 08:53.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While hailing operations to kill
top ISIS
leaders like the one we reported
earlier,

08:53.199 --> 08:55.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they sought to put the longer
war in context.

08:55.502 --> 08:58.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ASHTON CARTER, U.S. Defense
Secretary: There's
no question that this individual
and other

08:59.005 --> 09:07.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
individuals we have eliminated
have been part
of the apparatus of ISIL to
recruit and to

09:07.547 --> 09:12.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
motivate foreign fighters, both
to return
from Iraq and Syria to countries
in Europe

09:13.086 --> 09:18.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and elsewhere, and also simply
by using the
Internet and other
communications to do so.

09:18.825 --> 09:24.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even if it's just inspiration,
it still takes
you back to Iraq and Syria and
the need to

09:24.164 --> 09:25.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
eliminate the sources of that
inspiration.

09:25.999 --> 09:29.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEN. JOSEPH DUNFORD, Joint
Chiefs of Staff
Chairman: While ISIL has not
been able to

09:29.102 --> 09:33.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seize ground in the past several
months, that
hasn't precluded them from
conducting terrorist

09:33.740 --> 09:36.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attacks, and it hasn't precluded
them from
conducting operations that are
more akin to

09:36.943 --> 09:40.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
guerrilla operations than the
conventional
operations that we saw when they
were seizing

09:40.580 --> 09:42.248 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
territory.

09:42.348 --> 09:46.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think the momentum is in
our favor.
I think there's a lot of reasons
for us to

09:47.020 --> 09:52.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be optimistic about the next
several months.
But by no means would I say that
we're about

09:52.158 --> 09:54.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to break the back of ISIL or
that the fight
is over.

09:54.961 --> 09:59.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dunford and
Carter also spoke
of expanding the role of U.S.
Marines in Northern

10:00.099 --> 10:05.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraq and the possibility of
sending more forces
in the coming weeks, adding to
the nearly

10:05.738 --> 10:07.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
4,000 already there.

10:07.774 --> 10:13.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We examine the state of the
fight against
ISIS now with retired Army
Colonel Derek Harvey.

10:13.413 --> 10:18.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was an intelligence officer
and special
adviser to the commander of U.S.
forces in

10:18.184 --> 10:24.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraq, General David Petraeus.
He's now a professor
at the University of South
Florida. And Brendan

10:24.591 --> 10:29.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Koerner is a contributing editor
at "Wired"
magazine. He's the author of an
upcoming article

10:30.029 --> 10:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about ISIS and its use of social
media.

10:33.666 --> 10:35.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome you both to the
program.

10:35.902 --> 10:41.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Colonel Harvey, to you first.
How important
was this number two figure at
ISIS who we

10:41.708 --> 10:44.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been talking about who has
evidently
been killed by U.S. forces?

10:44.711 --> 10:47.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COL. DEREK HARVEY (RET.), U.S.
Army: Well,
Judy, I usually don't get very
excited about

10:47.814 --> 10:54.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taking out a senior leader
through the decapitation
strategy, but Haji Imam is a
very important

10:55.088 --> 10:57.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
person, for one particular
reason.

10:57.891 --> 11:04.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not just that he's number
two, but he
connects the Islamic State to
key core al-Qaida

11:04.497 --> 11:10.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
senior leaders, operatives at
that level.
Plus, he is closely tied in and
historically

11:10.169 --> 11:15.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was tied in with the order of
the Naqshbandi
army, Izzat al-Douri's
insurgency wing from

11:15.608 --> 11:19.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the former regime days. Those
entities...

11:19.479 --> 11:21.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meaning Saddam
Hussein.

11:21.281 --> 11:25.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
COL. DEREK HARVEY: Saddam
Hussein's former
vice president, and he was an
architect of

11:25.618 --> 11:32.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the original insurgency back in
2003 and 2004
before becoming part of al-Qaida
in Iraq with

11:32.325 --> 11:34.260 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Zarqawi.

11:34.360 --> 11:38.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, by
eliminating him, assuming
he's been killed, and the other
ISIS leadership

11:38.765 --> 11:43.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the U.S. says has been
eliminated, where does
that leave the state of the
fight against

11:43.336 --> 11:45.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ISIS in Iraq and Syria?

11:45.204 --> 11:49.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COL. DEREK HARVEY: I still -- I
think it's
a very bleak picture, because
what we have

11:49.342 --> 11:55.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had to do is destroy urban
centers, Sunni
Arab cities in order to clear
those areas

11:55.615 --> 12:01.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the Islamic State, Ramadi,
Tikrit, Baiji,
those types.

12:01.187 --> 12:07.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're probably going to wind
up doing
the same in Mosul. And the
humanitarian issues,

12:07.393 --> 12:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fallout, the civil war, the
core issues
have not been addressed yet.
It's necessary

12:14.000 --> 12:18.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to go after the Islamic State
militarily,
but there is so much more to do
and it's still

12:18.705 --> 12:20.540 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very bleak.

12:20.640 --> 12:24.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Derek Harvey, one
more question.
Secretary of State John Kerry
was saying today

12:24.410 --> 12:29.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Europe -- he essentially that
because ISIS
is losing ground in Iraq and
Syria that they're

12:29.749 --> 12:31.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lashing out in Europe.

12:31.784 --> 12:35.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said they're resorting to
actions outside
the Middle East because their
fantasy of a

12:35.855 --> 12:36.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
caliphate is collapsing.

12:37.056 --> 12:40.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COL. DEREK HARVEY: I think
that's just plain
wrong.

12:40.526 --> 12:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Islamic State has for two
years been talking
in their speeches and in their
communications

12:47.066 --> 12:53.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about conducting operations in
Europe and
elsewhere. This wasn't a lashing
out. This

12:53.706 --> 12:58.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is part of their normal
operational profile.
And we are going to see more of
it, particularly

12:58.111 --> 13:04.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as we see these foreign fighters
move back
to areas around the world, not
just just Europe,

13:04.517 --> 13:06.252 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but North Africa and Asia.

13:06.352 --> 13:08.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Brendan
Koerner, when
it comes to these foreign
fighters, we know

13:08.855 --> 13:14.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the -- certainly one of the
main ways
ISIS appeals to them and tries
to recruit

13:14.927 --> 13:16.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fighters is using social media.

13:16.896 --> 13:21.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you have done a lot of
reporting and research
on that. You wrote that -- you
said it's as

13:21.901 --> 13:27.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much a -- that ISIS is as much
as a media
conglomerate as it is a fighting
force. What

13:27.173 --> 13:28.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
do you mean by that?

13:29.075 --> 13:32.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRENDAN KOERNER, "Wired": Well,
I think it
goes back to its earliest days
back in 2004,

13:32.378 --> 13:35.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when it was really just a rogue
al-Qaida offshoot
in Iraq.

13:35.748 --> 13:40.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They understood the value of
pushing out content,
specifically videos of
atrocities, into the

13:40.987 --> 13:45.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world. Therefore, they could
recruit very
brutal young men to come join
their struggle.

13:45.992 --> 13:52.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the organization evolved, it
made media
very central to its ideology and
to its organization.

13:53.032 --> 13:57.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It now has many different media
offices which
all manufacture content it
pushes out through

13:57.704 --> 14:01.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
social media to every corner of
the world
tailored to specific audiences,
whether it

14:02.041 --> 14:05.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be in the Balkans, in Chechnya
or in the Western
world.

14:05.912 --> 14:10.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Give us an
example, Brendan
Koerner, of how that works. I
know there's

14:10.683 --> 14:15.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been a lot of reporting about
this over many
months, but in your reporting,
what did you

14:15.555 --> 14:17.390 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
find?

14:17.490 --> 14:22.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I was struck you also wrote
that -- quote
-- "They have a cockroach-like
resilience."

14:22.361 --> 14:24.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Explain what you mean by that.

14:24.230 --> 14:27.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BRENDAN KOERNER: Well,
certainly, on social
media, the supporters of the
Islamic State

14:27.200 --> 14:31.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are really from all over the
world are
often expelled from social
networks for their

14:31.838 --> 14:33.639 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
speech.

14:33.740 --> 14:37.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet within hours usually of
being booted
from Twitter or Facebook, or
what have you,

14:37.744 --> 14:41.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they're right back at it.
They're registering
new accounts, they're using
false identities,

14:41.614 --> 14:46.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
false cell phones to get back
on. So they're
hard to stamp out in
disseminating their messages.

14:46.619 --> 14:52.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I also found on a story that I
wrote for "Wired"
that the atrocities that we see
in many videos,

14:52.358 --> 14:57.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is a very small personally
of what Islamic
State's media operation
manufactures. What

14:57.396 --> 15:02.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're really good at is making
videos that
portray the so-called caliphate
they're building

15:02.301 --> 15:07.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Syria and Iraq and elsewhere
as kind of
a paradise, a place where people
can bring

15:07.940 --> 15:13.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their spouses and families and
flourish and
practice what they say is true
Islam.

15:13.212 --> 15:15.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's very effective content for
young men.

15:15.681 --> 15:20.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what's the
best way for
the West, for the United States
to counter

15:20.853 --> 15:22.688 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this?

15:22.789 --> 15:26.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRENDAN KOERNER: Well, I don't
think it is
just focusing our efforts
exclusively on tamping

15:26.859 --> 15:28.761 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
down speech.

15:28.861 --> 15:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's in creating better
speech. For
example, the Islamic State is
clearly frightened

15:33.266 --> 15:37.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the outflow of refugees. We
have seen a
lot of media created that
excoriates those

15:37.904 --> 15:42.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who flee from these territories.
I think we
need to take advantage of those
refugees,

15:42.775 --> 15:46.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
give them the tools to make
their own content
to tell their stories to the
world. That is

15:46.913 --> 15:50.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be the best salve
against what the
Islamic State's media is putting
out.

15:50.683 --> 15:55.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Derek Harvey,
Colonel Harvey,
how much does it matter that
progress is made

15:55.221 --> 16:02.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against ISIS in the social media
realm, this
media conglomerate realm that
Mr. is Koerner

16:02.461 --> 16:04.263 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
describing?

16:04.363 --> 16:07.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COL. DEREK HARVEY: I think it's
very important
in order to tamp down the
prospects for the

16:07.667 --> 16:13.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lone wolves as well as the
recruitment and
the finances that flow into this
Islamic State

16:13.539 --> 16:18.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
organization. But I think, you
know, to pivot
off his comments, al Qaeda in
Iraq and other

16:19.078 --> 16:25.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
jihadist groups are framing
their position
as a more moderateñ jihadism,
and they are

16:25.518 --> 16:30.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actively recruiting in Syria and
Iraq, but
in Turkey in the refugee camps,
in Jordan,

16:30.990 --> 16:32.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and now into Europe.

16:32.825 --> 16:36.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are framing their
narrative in a
way that we can have the fight
without the

16:36.329 --> 16:43.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
brutality and the extremism. And
so they're
well-positioned to be, youñr
know, al-Qaida

16:43.870 --> 16:51.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
4.0 after the end of this, once
ISIS is attrited,
unless we really go after the
core issues.

16:51.177 --> 16:56.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't see enough effort in
addressing
the two civil wars and this
conflict within

16:56.249 --> 16:58.050 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Islam.

16:58.150 --> 17:00.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you see that
as a threat
as well, Brendan Koerner, this
idea that they

17:01.087 --> 17:10.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
keep appealing to the peaceful,
the pleasant
side of what they say will be
the future under

17:10.997 --> 17:12.798 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their rule?

17:12.899 --> 17:15.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRENDAN KOERNER: Well, clearly,
the agility
of the Islamic State's media is
one of its

17:15.868 --> 17:20.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trademarks, the fact that they
can respond
to current circumstances and
shift their message.

17:20.773 --> 17:24.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have done that very
effectively.
You can see right now, clearly,
Libya is becoming

17:25.077 --> 17:28.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a new front in the struggle
against the Islamic
State. And they have been very
good about

17:28.547 --> 17:34.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
producing media surrounding its
Libyan ventures,
trying to portray that area as a
place where

17:34.553 --> 17:39.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people can now emigrate to and
participate
in the struggle for this
caliphate.

17:39.825 --> 17:43.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think we need to be very,
very fast about
the way we address this
situation because

17:44.063 --> 17:45.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're clearly one step ahead
of us right
now.

17:45.932 --> 17:50.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, many alarm
bells out
of this conversation, even as
there is progress

17:50.536 --> 17:52.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
being made on theñ battlefield.

17:52.438 --> 17:54.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brendan Koerner, we thank you.
Colonel Derek
Harvey, thank you.

17:54.540 --> 17:55.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COL. DEREK HARVEY: Thank you,
Judy.

17:55.474 --> 17:59.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRENDAN KOERNER: Thank you so
much.

18:00.079 --> 18:11.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, for another
look at the
war against ISIS and the battles
on the presidential

18:11.190 --> 18:16.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign trail, the analysis of
Shields and
Brooks. That's syndicated
columnist Mark Shields

18:16.495 --> 18:18.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and New York Times columnist
David Brooks.

18:18.230 --> 18:19.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Gentlemen, welcome to you both.

18:19.932 --> 18:24.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, let's pick up from where we
were in that
conversation we just heard.

18:25.037 --> 18:30.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark, they did -- you did have
this successful
capture, killing of this top
ISIS leader and

18:30.509 --> 18:36.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
another one recently on the
battlefield, but
in the wake of these Brussels
attacks, growing

18:36.682 --> 18:42.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chorus of criticism that the
Obama administration
is not doing enough to go after
ISIS, that

18:42.955 --> 18:47.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you're still seeing horrible
attacks like
the ones in Belgium.

18:47.793 --> 18:51.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Where do you -- how do you
assess the administration?

18:51.130 --> 18:58.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, the
administration has
taken on ISIS, its caliphate,
that is, in

18:58.504 --> 19:05.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syria and Iraq, and I think it's
fair to say
that they're in retreat.

19:05.344 --> 19:16.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem is Europe. I mean,
that's a problem.
It's a soft target. It's free
and easy access.

19:16.889 --> 19:23.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And these are homegrown
terrorists here. And
what the United States can do is
to encourage

19:23.863 --> 19:28.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and urge and push for the
sharing of information.

19:28.167 --> 19:35.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is a whole inequality
of quality
of intelligence in those
countries. There

19:36.042 --> 19:41.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is an unwillingness,
understandably. There's
language difficulties, and also
there is a

19:41.414 --> 19:46.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tradition. I mean, this is a
continent that
has lived under both Nazism and
communism,

19:46.352 --> 19:53.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the willingness to let
authorities have
access to the metadata that we
have done in

19:54.026 --> 19:59.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this country with only limited
resistance
is a lot stronger there.

20:00.099 --> 20:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Only so much the
U.S. can do,
David?

20:01.801 --> 20:03.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, I think
there are two
issues here.

20:03.869 --> 20:08.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, in Syria, I think we bear
a large responsibility.
I think we withdrew from Iraq
too quickly

20:08.107 --> 20:13.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it created this tremendous
vacancy there
that ISIS filled. I think we
were too slow

20:13.345 --> 20:17.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to recognize what was going on
in Syria in
the civil war, refused to arm
people, refused

20:17.450 --> 20:23.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to take down Assad, ignored the
red line and
then created a vacuum which ISIS
then filled

20:24.023 --> 20:25.858 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

20:25.958 --> 20:29.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that's partly on us. The
European thing
-- I think that has nothing to
do with what

20:29.428 --> 20:34.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
happened in Brussels. The
European thing,
as Mark said, it's a matter of
ideas and alienated

20:34.333 --> 20:37.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cultures. I lived in Brussels
for five years.
This was back in the '90s.

20:37.937 --> 20:42.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If you went to those
neighborhoods which are
a lot of Muslim people live
there, they were

20:42.908 --> 20:46.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
isolated, they were different.
It was like
leaving Brussels and entering a
different

20:46.846 --> 20:52.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country, and there was just
little integration,
social, cultural, economic,
between those

20:52.351 --> 20:55.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
areas and the rest of the
country and the
rest of the city.

20:55.488 --> 21:00.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that sort of thing just
gestated, gestated,
gestated. And then when the
radical ideology

21:00.159 --> 21:04.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
found -- they found a lot of
alienated people,
and they only have to tap a few
young men

21:04.363 --> 21:06.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to create something like this.

21:06.532 --> 21:10.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Some of the
criticism, Mark,
is that the administration has
just not put

21:10.469 --> 21:15.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enough emphasis on this. Yes,
the president
talks about it and, yes, there
have been a

21:16.075 --> 21:20.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
number of limited troops,
special operations
troops, and there may be more
going over,

21:20.713 --> 21:24.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but it doesn't seem to be a
priority, enough
of a priority for this
president.

21:24.383 --> 21:30.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I think the
president
can be accused legitimately of
not having

21:30.756 --> 21:35.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recognized the threat at the
outset. And I
think history will not be kind
to the drawing

21:35.494 --> 21:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the red line in Syria, and
for the United
States.

21:41.066 --> 21:47.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, A, the willingness of the
United States
for further action and
deployment of military,

21:47.439 --> 21:54.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even an all-volunteer military,
is severely
limited, Judy. And let's be very
frank. The

21:55.047 --> 21:59.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
organizing principle of this was
the United
States' invasion of Iraq and the
United States'

22:00.052 --> 22:07.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
occupation of Iraq. That remains
to this moment
the -- whether we left early,
should still

22:07.293 --> 22:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be there, the fact that we went
in, invaded
and occupied this country, and
it was a tragedy

22:13.966 --> 22:17.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a disaster, and we have
reaped that whirlwind
and it remains with us.

22:17.303 --> 22:20.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, even
criticism this
week of the optics. The
president was in Cuba

22:21.073 --> 22:24.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for this historic visit and
there were some
voices, well, he shouldn't have
gone to the

22:24.710 --> 22:29.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
baseball game, he shouldn't have
gone on to
Argentina, how much does that
matter?

22:29.448 --> 22:32.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I think those
criticisms
are unfounded.

22:32.351 --> 22:35.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president -- we have a big
government.
We can do a lot of things at
once. If the

22:35.621 --> 22:39.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
president had skipped the
baseball game and
gone home, what more could he
have done? He

22:39.558 --> 22:43.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has a telephone. He can make
decisions. He
can meetings.

22:43.696 --> 22:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's my basic principle that's
just political
point-scoring. It's my most
fundamental basic

22:47.533 --> 22:52.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
principle. There's never a good
reason to
miss a baseball game. And so his
decision

22:52.171 --> 22:54.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to do that, I fully support
that.

22:54.173 --> 22:55.007 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

22:55.107 --> 22:55.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And this was a
big one.

22:56.041 --> 22:56.875 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But, Mark...

22:56.976 --> 22:57.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I disagree. I do
think...

22:57.676 --> 22:58.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Really? OK.

22:58.677 --> 23:00.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think optics do
matter.

23:00.546 --> 23:02.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the president could --
the baseball
game was probably the most
important event

23:02.982 --> 23:08.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
emotionally and nationally
during his trip
to Cuba. I don't think he had to
be there

23:08.854 --> 23:12.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the wave, when the crowd
stands up for
that. I don't think it's
necessary for him

23:12.958 --> 23:16.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to wear sunglasses and so -- he
could have
gone to the game and the rest.

23:17.029 --> 23:21.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Optics, a terrible word, do
matter, and if
you have any doubts about that,
virtually

23:21.834 --> 23:26.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every paper in the country,
certainly The
Wall Street Journal among them,
featured the

23:26.238 --> 23:33.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
master as servant this week. On
Holy Thursday,
there was Pope Francis kissing
and washing

23:33.412 --> 23:39.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the feet of a refugee, a
penniless refugee.
That is a visual.

23:39.718 --> 23:45.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I agree with David the president
can do anything
anywhere he is, but if you were
sitting in

23:45.291 --> 23:51.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brussels and worried about your
family or
your relatives or your
neighborhood, the picture

23:52.097 --> 23:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of him kind of grinning at the
game, I think,
was probably not helpful.

23:54.900 --> 23:58.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it was
striking among some
of the reaction among the
Republican candidates

23:58.370 --> 24:00.139 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for president.

24:00.239 --> 24:05.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David, you had Ted Cruz saying,
what we need
to do is send more security into
patrolling

24:05.944 --> 24:09.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
basically neighborhoods where
Muslim Americans
live.

24:09.248 --> 24:13.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I have spent
the last week
so repulsed by Donald Trump, I
had forgotten

24:14.086 --> 24:17.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how ugly Ted Cruz could be, but
he reminded
us this week.

24:17.156 --> 24:18.991 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

24:19.091 --> 24:21.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: As I said and as
everyone says,
the reason we have terrorism is
not because

24:21.360 --> 24:23.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Prophet Mohammed came down
and not because
there is a religion called
Islam.

24:24.029 --> 24:25.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.

24:25.764 --> 24:30.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: The reason we have
terror is
that young men are alienated and
feel they

24:30.569 --> 24:38.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can wage war and a just war
against societies
that are racist and xenophobic
and crushing

24:38.477 --> 24:40.312 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
toward them.

24:40.412 --> 24:44.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you want to spread the
message, a good
way would be to have extra
police operations

24:44.183 --> 24:49.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
directed at Muslim
neighborhoods. And so Ted
Cruz's idea is probably the
worst idea, well,

24:49.955 --> 24:54.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only of the day, because we have
a lot in
this campaign, truly terrible
idea, only saved

24:54.426 --> 24:57.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the fact it's almost certain
he doesn't
actually believe it. He just
wants to sound

24:57.930 --> 24:59.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like Donald Trump.

24:59.131 --> 25:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think David put
his finger
on it.

25:01.800 --> 25:06.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would say this. It's ironic,
Judy, that
the Republican Party, to avoid
Donald Trump,

25:07.005 --> 25:13.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is rallying reluctantly, against
their own
will, around Ted Cruz. He
reminded them and

25:13.579 --> 25:18.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everybody else why they didn't
like him in
the first place. This is an
awful, awful position.

25:19.084 --> 25:23.622 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
In fact, when the
Anti-Defamation League comes
out and compares it to the
imprisonment and

25:23.722 --> 25:27.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
incarceration of Japanese
Americans during
World War II, when police
Commissioner Bill

25:27.693 --> 25:33.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bratton in New York says he has
no idea what
he's talking about, there are a
thousand Muslim

25:33.632 --> 25:38.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Americans, many of them combat
veterans, on
the New York police force. It's
just -- it

25:38.537 --> 25:40.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was -- it's beyond stupid.

25:40.906 --> 25:45.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, that
occupied a lot of
the week, but something else
that occupied

25:45.444 --> 25:50.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a fair amount of time, at least
became a war
of words between the two leading
Republican

25:50.916 --> 25:52.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
candidates, had to do with
women.

25:52.718 --> 25:56.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we're going to take a
sidebar look at
that and then come back and talk
to both of

25:56.922 --> 25:58.290 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

25:58.390 --> 26:01.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ted Cruz blasted his main rival,
Donald Trump,
today in Wisconsin.

26:01.593 --> 26:07.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
Years from now, when my
daughters Google this,

26:07.299 --> 26:09.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they will read these lies.

26:09.168 --> 26:14.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Cruz accused
Trump of being
behind tabloid accusations of
extramarital

26:14.740 --> 26:20.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
affairs. It was the latest in
the escalating
war of words over women this
week between

26:20.712 --> 26:22.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the two candidates.

26:22.581 --> 26:29.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It all began with this ad, a
photo of Melania
Trump, a former model, posing
for "British

26:29.888 --> 26:37.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GQ" 16 years ago posted on
Facebook by an
anti-Trump super PAC ahead of
the Utah primary

26:37.629 --> 26:43.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
caucuses Tuesday. Within hours,
Donald Trump
tweeted a response, wrongly
attributing the

26:43.869 --> 26:48.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ad directly to Cruz's campaign,
and warning
him to -- quote -- "be careful."

26:48.874 --> 26:52.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Ted Cruz knowingly, in my
opinion, had this

26:52.511 --> 26:58.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
article sent all over Utah, had
the picture
saying, is this want you want?
Essentially,

26:58.317 --> 27:00.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is this what you want for a
first lady? First
of all, she would be a great
first lady.

27:01.086 --> 27:07.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A fury in the
Twitterverse
ensued, as Cruz hit back,
defending his wife,

27:07.726 --> 27:10.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Heidi, and calling Trump a
coward.

27:10.562 --> 27:16.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A day later, Trump ratcheted up
the war of
the wives, when he retweeted an
unflattering

27:16.368 --> 27:23.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
image of Mrs. Cruz. Polls show
Trump's standing
with women voters has worsened
in recent months.

27:23.942 --> 27:29.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
According to the latest
Washington Post/ABC
News poll, 64 percent of women
say they have

27:29.982 --> 27:37.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a strongly unfavorable reaction
to him. That's
18 points higher than it was in
August.

27:37.890 --> 27:44.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what do we say about this?
Did we ever
think this was going to be the
lead story

27:44.296 --> 27:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out of a campaign for president
of the United
States?

27:47.866 --> 27:49.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, that's the
first thing
I was going to say. Are we
really here? Is

27:49.668 --> 27:54.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this really happening? Is this
America? Are
we a great country talking about
trying to

27:54.172 --> 27:57.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
straddle the world and create
opportunity
in this country?

27:57.809 --> 28:00.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's just mind-boggling. And we
have sort
of become acculturated, because
this campaign

28:00.946 --> 28:05.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been so ugly. We have become
acculturated
to sleaze and unhappiness that
you just want

28:05.951 --> 28:08.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to shower from every 15 minutes.

28:08.921 --> 28:15.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trump comparison of the
looks of the wives,
he does have, over the course of
his life,

28:15.127 --> 28:22.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a consistent misogynistic view
of women as
arm candy, as pieces of meat.
It's a consistent

28:22.334 --> 28:29.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attitude toward women which is
the stuff of
a diseased adolescent.

28:29.241 --> 28:32.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we have seen a bit of
that show up
again. But if you go back over
his past, calling

28:32.811 --> 28:38.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into radio shows bragging about
his affairs,
talking about his sex life in
public, he is

28:38.383 --> 28:44.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
childish in his immaturity. And
his -- even
his misogyny is a childish
misogyny.

28:44.489 --> 28:48.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why I do not think
Republicans,
standard Republicans, can say,
yes, I'm going

28:48.126 --> 28:52.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to vote for this guy because
he's our nominee.
He's of a different order than
your normal

28:52.664 --> 28:56.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
candidate. And this whole week
is just another
reminder of that.

28:56.768 --> 29:00.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Could this
finally be something,
Mark, that really does hurt
Donald Trump?

29:00.439 --> 29:07.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, we have
predicted nine
of his last eight stumbles, and
they have

29:07.679 --> 29:09.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
yet to all materialize.

29:09.648 --> 29:15.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy, whoever did that political
action committee
ad has to be thrilled, because
it elicited

29:15.721 --> 29:22.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Donald Trump the worst of
his personality,
the bullying, the misogyny, as
David has said,

29:22.561 --> 29:24.329 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
brought it out.

29:24.429 --> 29:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think it's more than
childish and juvenile
and adolescent. There is
something creepy

29:28.367 --> 29:36.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about this, his attitude toward
women. Take
Megyn Kelly of FOX News, who he
just has an

29:36.708 --> 29:42.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
absolute obsession about, and
he's constantly
writing about, you know, how
awful she is

29:42.748 --> 29:46.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and no talent and this and that.
It's an obsession.

29:46.618 --> 29:52.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't know if he's just
never had women
-- strong, independent women in
his life who

29:53.025 --> 29:54.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have spoken to him. It doesn't
seem that way.
His daughter...

29:54.960 --> 29:56.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: She has asked him
tough questions
in that debate.

29:56.795 --> 30:00.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: She just asked him
tough questions
and was totally fair, by
everybody else's

30:00.799 --> 30:02.601 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
standards.

30:02.701 --> 30:08.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is something really
creepy about
this that's beyond locker room.
It's almost

30:08.507 --> 30:15.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like a stalker, and I just -- I
thought this
was -- it actually did the
impossible. It

30:15.547 --> 30:20.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made Ted Cruz look like an
honorable, tough
guy on the right side of an
issue.

30:20.986 --> 30:27.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, I just -- I just
marvel at
it. And I don't know at what
point it becomes,

30:27.325 --> 30:32.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know -- politically, he's
still leading.
And I would have to say he's the
overwhelming

30:32.130 --> 30:33.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
favorite for the Republican
nomination.

30:33.899 --> 30:38.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what was
striking is that
this ad, David, which presumably
had very

30:38.270 --> 30:42.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
limited circulation, might have
gone almost
unnoticed if it hadn't have been
for what

30:42.407 --> 30:44.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he -- how he reacted to it.

30:44.376 --> 30:46.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: The odd thing
about his whole
career and his whole language,
his whole world

30:46.611 --> 30:50.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
view is there is no room for
love in it.

30:50.382 --> 30:54.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You get a sense of a man who
received no love,
can give no love, so his
relationship with

30:54.519 --> 30:59.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women, it has no love in it.
It's trophy.
And his relationship toward the
world is one

30:59.624 --> 31:04.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of competition and beating, and
as if he's
going to win by competition what
other people

31:04.529 --> 31:06.298 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
get by love.

31:06.398 --> 31:12.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so you really are seeing
someone who just
has an odd psychology unleavened
by kindness

31:12.404 --> 31:18.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and charity, but where it's all
winners and
losers, beating and being beat.
And that's

31:18.343 --> 31:22.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
part of the authoritarian
personality, but
it comes out in his attitude
towards women.

31:22.848 --> 31:24.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just 10
seconds.

31:24.816 --> 31:27.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, I would say,
in his defense,
which I didn't think I would use
that phrase,

31:27.786 --> 31:32.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
his relationship with his
children seems quite
good, with his daughter and with
his sons.

31:33.058 --> 31:38.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they seem like -- they don't
seem like
malevolent people at all. They
seem like they're

31:38.997 --> 31:39.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
very benevolent people.

31:39.998 --> 31:41.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

31:41.566 --> 31:43.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Makes you wonder
what their
reaction is to all of this.

31:43.568 --> 31:44.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Exactly.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields,
David Brooks,
we thank you.

31:46.338 --> 31:51.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you.

31:51.643 --> 31:56.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Thank you.

31:56.948 --> 32:00.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

32:00.485 --> 32:06.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
deconstructing
strands of racism in America,
from white supremacists

32:06.825 --> 32:13.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to lone wolves; and remembering
two entertaining
greats, comedian Garry Shandling
and rapper

32:13.832 --> 32:17.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Malik Taylor, also known as
Phife Dawg.

32:17.903 --> 32:25.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, poverty has had a
persistent grip
on Eastern Kentucky for
generations. Its residents

32:25.443 --> 32:31.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are poorer and less educated
than any other
region of Appalachia, and the
impact on health

32:31.550 --> 32:38.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is unmistakable. Life expectancy
there is
five years shorter than the rest
of the nation.

32:38.256 --> 32:43.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Jackie
Judd reports
on efforts to turn that around.

32:43.628 --> 32:52.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There are a few
certainties
in Sam Wilson's hardscrabble
life, bluegrass

32:52.504 --> 32:57.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that sustains him, and cancer
that he expects
will kill him.

32:57.275 --> 33:03.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAM WILSON, Cancer Sufferer: I
was laid up
with cancer and didn't know it,
in my bladder,

33:03.215 --> 33:06.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kidney, prostate, some in my
bowels and colon.

33:06.418 --> 33:13.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JACKIE JUDD: In Eastern
Kentucky, Appalachia,
cancer is epidemic, and has been
for decades.

33:13.491 --> 33:19.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The highest-in-the-nation rates
are fueled
by a toxic combination of
poverty, medical

33:19.397 --> 33:26.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
illiteracy, limited access to
care, lifestyle
choices like smoking, and a
fatalism that

33:26.504 --> 33:30.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
says knowing you have cancer
won't save you.

33:30.141 --> 33:33.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAM WILSON: My whole family,
they just won't
go to the doctor anymore. My
mother died of

33:34.045 --> 33:40.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cancer and she wouldn't go. Two
of my sisters
died with cancer. But they went
to the doctor,

33:40.118 --> 33:41.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but they still passed away.

33:42.087 --> 33:45.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Irene, did you try
to convince
him to go to the doctor when he
wasn't feeling

33:45.857 --> 33:47.692 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
well?

33:47.792 --> 33:51.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: He finally told me after
a few years,
and he said, it's so painful,
something has

33:51.263 --> 33:52.130 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be done.

33:52.230 --> 33:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: After a few years?
Years?

33:54.366 --> 33:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Yes, he's very lucky,
yes.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Not months or
weeks, years?

33:57.435 --> 34:00.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: No. No. What, about four
years maybe.

34:00.405 --> 34:05.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Kentucky public
health officials
are trying to change that
storyline, to get

34:05.644 --> 34:10.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people screened, so disease is
discovered
before it is too late to treat.

34:11.049 --> 34:13.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tom Tucker is the director of
the Kentucky
Cancer Registry.

34:13.952 --> 34:17.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM TUCKER, Kentucky Cancer
Registry: The
old models for doing this, where
we tell people

34:17.289 --> 34:21.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they need to do it, and
they're going
to go do it, well, that's
obviously not going

34:21.226 --> 34:26.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to work. So using other
strategies that are
culturally and socially
appropriate for the

34:26.932 --> 34:32.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
population, that connect more
appropriately,
we are much more effective at
doing that now

34:32.637 --> 34:35.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than we were 10, 20, 30 years
ago.

34:35.407 --> 34:37.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Has anybody ever talked to you
about a colonoscopy?

34:37.542 --> 34:43.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: About a decade ago,
health officials
trained their sights on colon
cancer. And

34:43.348 --> 34:52.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
within seven years, screenings
doubled and
deaths declined 24 percent
statewide. Part

34:52.557 --> 34:55.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the strategy is to reach
people where they
live.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM COLLINS, Rural Prevention
Cancer Center:
When's the last time you seen a
doctor?

34:57.896 --> 34:59.130 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Long time.

34:59.230 --> 35:00.832 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TOM COLLINS: Yes?

35:00.932 --> 35:05.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: The only time I go is if a
bone is sticking
out or if I got to be sewed up.

35:05.704 --> 35:11.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Tom Collins with
the Rural Prevention
Cancer Center sets up shop in
the county unemployment

35:11.443 --> 35:19.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
office, sweetening the deal with
his homemade
pies. About half of the people
he corrals

35:19.384 --> 35:23.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
either leave with a home
test-kit or agree
to get colonoscopies.

35:23.755 --> 35:29.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM COLLINS: The challenge is
educating them
that they can do something about
it, and that

35:29.427 --> 35:33.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can help them do something
about it. You
don't have to get cancer.

35:33.498 --> 35:38.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JACKIE JUDD: The state
legislature passed
a law last year requiring
insurance companies

35:39.004 --> 35:41.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to cover colonoscopies.

35:42.073 --> 35:49.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Debra Burchett (ph) had no
insurance and
no way to pay for a screening,
even though

35:50.015 --> 35:57.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she was having symptoms. Then,
her doctor
told her the county had begun
offering free

35:57.655 --> 36:02.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
screenings for people in her
situation. That
probably saved her life.

36:02.927 --> 36:04.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And what was diagnosed?

36:04.429 --> 36:07.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Colon cancer, stage four.

36:07.799 --> 36:15.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: So if you had not
found the free
program, would you not have
gotten the colonoscopy?

36:15.607 --> 36:18.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Probably not. I probably
wouldn't be
here today.

36:18.476 --> 36:24.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Another piece of
this success
story is Polly Gilbert and other
lay health

36:24.215 --> 36:27.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
workers, who are known in the
community and
trusted.

36:27.719 --> 36:33.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gilbert travels hundreds of
miles a week,
visiting people in their homes,
educating

36:33.158 --> 36:37.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them about preventive care and
steering them
to the proper services.

36:37.495 --> 36:40.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
POLLY GILBERT, Health Worker:
Hi. What's going
on today?

36:40.198 --> 36:44.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: So they will listen
to you in
ways that they may not listen to
a doctor.

36:44.169 --> 36:49.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
POLLY GILBERT: Sometimes they
do, and we have
been able to sway them: "Well,
Polly says

36:49.707 --> 36:54.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I need to come," and not just
because I'm
such an influence, but I make
them -- they're

36:54.212 --> 36:55.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
part of my family.

36:56.081 --> 37:00.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: In the past couple
of years,
the increase in the number of
people getting

37:00.351 --> 37:06.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
screened for colon cancer has
plateaued. Even
the trusted Gilbert runs into
resistance,

37:06.758 --> 37:09.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as she does with Sam Wilson's
wife, Irene.

37:09.794 --> 37:11.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have never had a
colonoscopy?

37:11.129 --> 37:12.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: No, I haven't.

37:12.430 --> 37:13.832 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JACKIE JUDD: Why?

37:13.932 --> 37:17.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Well, I guess because I
haven't had
any symptoms or anything.

37:17.268 --> 37:21.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Public health
officials are now
tackling another disease that is
devastating

37:21.673 --> 37:27.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the region. The incidence of
lung cancer
is Almost double here compared
to the national

37:28.046 --> 37:34.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average. Deaths are almost
double. The challenge
is to not only encourage certain
lifelong

37:34.319 --> 37:40.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
smokers to get screened, but to
get them to
quit, and for others to never
start.

37:40.458 --> 37:47.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will be even more difficult
than changing
the profile of colon cancer,
because smoking

37:47.132 --> 37:48.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
involves addiction.

37:48.967 --> 37:52.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JERRY BURCHETT, Kentucky: I have
been smoking
since I was probably 8 years
old. Back in

37:52.837 --> 37:59.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those days in this part of the
country, it
was nothing for kids to smoke.
It was acceptable.

37:59.210 --> 38:06.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Longtime public
health worker
Becky Simpson hopes schools will
begin using

38:06.718 --> 38:14.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this anti-smoking program, even
for kids as
young as 10 or 11. Years ago,
conversations

38:15.059 --> 38:16.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like this never would have
happened.

38:16.961 --> 38:20.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BECKY SIMPSON, Public Health
Worker: I could
not talk about it unless I had
permission.

38:20.832 --> 38:22.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JACKIE JUDD: Why?

38:22.800 --> 38:27.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BECKY SIMPSON: Because we didn't
want to anger
the people that we were working
with. Tobacco

38:27.872 --> 38:33.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was the cash crop. It was the
way people made
a living. And so it just was not
OK to try

38:33.678 --> 38:38.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and tell people don't smoke,
because that
was how people made their
living.

38:38.116 --> 38:42.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: How many of the
patients who
you treat are typically from
Eastern Kentucky?

38:42.220 --> 38:45.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. SUSANNE ARNOLD, Markey
Cancer Center:
We have about 50 to 70 percent.

38:45.456 --> 38:51.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Oncologist and
researcher Susanne
Arnold at the Markey Cancer
Center in Lexington

38:51.930 --> 38:57.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is investigating how to get
screening numbers
up in rural Kentucky, as well as
looking at

38:57.502 --> 39:01.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
causes of lung cancer which may
be unique
to the region.

39:01.272 --> 39:05.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SUSANNE ARNOLD: There's got
to be more
to it than just a little bit
more smoking

39:05.476 --> 39:11.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in that community, that causes
this gigantic
increase in lung cancer rates.
And the reasons

39:11.382 --> 39:17.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for that are probably, we don't
clear carcinogens
as well as the next group, we
don't process

39:17.455 --> 39:23.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tobacco as well, so we have a
higher drive
for more nicotine and we smoke
more.

39:23.127 --> 39:29.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We maybe don't repair our DNA as
well as other
populations, and DNA damage is
at the heart

39:29.634 --> 39:31.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of cancer incidence.

39:31.536 --> 39:37.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Dr. Arnold sees
progress battling
cancer, but progress slowed by
poverty and

39:37.976 --> 39:40.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fiercely held custom.

39:40.211 --> 39:42.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you encounter what I would
call that fatalism?

39:42.313 --> 39:47.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SUSANNE ARNOLD: Yes, I do.
And I'm struck
by it, because it means that
these people

39:47.652 --> 39:55.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been devastated, and they
have been devastated
over and over and over again, by
not having

39:55.526 --> 40:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anybody to reach out to help
them. Ultimately,
we don't want people to lose
hope.

40:01.666 --> 40:07.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: The hope of public
health officials
is that the model used to bring
down colon

40:07.372 --> 40:13.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cancer deaths can be used to the
same effect,
not only for lung cancer, but
for other diseases

40:13.645 --> 40:21.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
plaguing this depressed swathe
of America.

40:21.686 --> 40:27.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As for Sam Wilson, he so wishes
he had not
ignored his health. He says,
he's been sick

40:27.659 --> 40:32.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so long now, he almost forgets
what it means
to feel better.

40:32.864 --> 40:39.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Jackie Judd
in Campton, Kentucky.

40:39.137 --> 40:54.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SAM WILSON (singing): For
letting me live
just one more day.

40:54.819 --> 40:57.555 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

40:57.655 --> 41:05.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Klux Klan and
other white
supremacist groups have gained
more attention

41:05.997 --> 41:11.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the news recently, but as
special correspondent
Charlayne Hunter-Gault explains,
the national

41:11.569 --> 41:15.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
undercurrent of racism may be
even more pervasive.

41:15.340 --> 41:22.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's part of our yearlong
exploration of solutions
to the problems of race in
America.

41:22.213 --> 41:26.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
These are boots that are
intended so that,
when you stomp on someone, the
swastika will

41:26.551 --> 41:28.453 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
be left.

41:28.553 --> 41:30.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Heidi
Beirich is leader
of The Intelligence Project here
at the Southern

41:30.888 --> 41:34.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit
anti-terror
organization.

41:34.826 --> 41:40.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She shows us memorabilia
revealing some Ku
Klux Klan history, boots with
swastikas and

41:40.131 --> 41:45.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
boots with red laces, indicating
Klan members
who've physically harmed
someone, and other

41:45.603 --> 41:52.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
racist paraphernalia. In 2014,
there were
some 784 active hate groups.
Beirich brings

41:52.610 --> 41:54.479 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
us up to date.

41:54.579 --> 41:59.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: The Ku
Klux Klan has
declined over the years, in part
due to lawsuits

41:59.817 --> 42:04.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you people here at the
Southern Poverty
Law Center have filed. Briefly
tell us about

42:04.889 --> 42:06.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
how that came about.

42:06.758 --> 42:08.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEIDI BEIRICH, Southern Poverty
Law Center:
We started filing lawsuits
against the Klan

42:08.693 --> 42:14.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 1981 over a lynching of a
young black man
in Mobile. That was our first
anti-Klan law

42:14.132 --> 42:15.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
suit.

42:16.033 --> 42:18.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we came up with this idea
that we should
sue these folks in civil court
to bankrupt

42:18.803 --> 42:23.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them. That was the plan. We have
now had a
series of Klan groups that we
have sued, put

42:24.041 --> 42:27.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them basically out of business,
leading all
the way up to very recently with
the Imperial

42:27.645 --> 42:32.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Klans of America. Our hope is
that by taking
their money away, they can't
function anymore.

42:32.316 --> 42:34.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And that
was successful?

42:34.185 --> 42:37.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEIDI BEIRICH: Yes. Every single
one of them
has been successful. Obviously,
when these

42:37.221 --> 42:40.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
groups don't have money, that
means there's
less violence that they could
perpetrate.

42:40.525 --> 42:43.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The whole idea is to not allow
them to function.

42:43.361 --> 42:47.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But at
the moment,
there seems to be a resurgence
and what appears

42:47.298 --> 42:50.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be a rise in hate groups.
What explains
that?

42:50.201 --> 42:54.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEIDI BEIRICH: We have seen a
sustained rise
in hate groups since basically
2000. And the

42:55.072 --> 42:59.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
main thing driving this has been
changing
demographics in the United
States.

42:59.877 --> 43:05.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2000 was an important year
because it was
the first time that the U.S.
census said definitively,

43:05.183 --> 43:10.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in our near future, 2042 at the
time, whites
will no longer be the majority.
And obviously,

43:10.188 --> 43:13.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you are a member of a hate
group, right,
if you're a white supremacist,
the fact that

43:13.891 --> 43:18.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whites will be less than 50
percent of the
population is something to
basically be a

43:18.796 --> 43:20.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
little freaked out about.

43:20.731 --> 43:25.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we started to see them
organizing by
hate groups and huge growth,
spiked over 1,000

43:25.136 --> 43:29.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hate groups in a short period of
time. Obama
added to that, right? Obviously,
the first

43:29.807 --> 43:33.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
black president was another
reason for a backlash
like that to develop.

43:33.611 --> 43:39.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And
you're getting
that from former Klans-people
and former white

43:39.283 --> 43:41.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
supremacists who are telling you
that?

43:41.219 --> 43:43.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEIDI BEIRICH: You always hear
exactly the
same thing, whether people are
in the movement

43:43.955 --> 43:45.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or out of the movement.

43:45.857 --> 43:48.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Is it
mostly hatred
of African-Americans or is there
more to it?

43:48.926 --> 43:53.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEIDI BEIRICH: Hatred of black
people is the
driving force for America's hate
movement.

43:53.231 --> 43:57.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, over the years, as you have
seen a change
in sort of the population of
people of color

43:57.201 --> 44:03.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here, you can add to that mix
dislike of Latinos
and immigrants, dislike of gay
people and,

44:03.140 --> 44:08.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very recently, we have seen a
huge outburst
by every kind of hate group
against the Muslim

44:08.746 --> 44:10.581 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
community.

44:10.681 --> 44:14.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: You have
also described
in some of your writings about a
new phenomenon

44:14.218 --> 44:19.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
called the lone wolf, which is
different from
organized groups. How
significant and worrisome

44:20.091 --> 44:21.959 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is that?

44:22.059 --> 44:25.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEIDI BEIRICH: Well, you're
pointing out one
of the biggest trends in terms
of racist killings

44:25.363 --> 44:27.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that we're seeing lately.

44:27.498 --> 44:31.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have people like Dylann Roof,
who killed
nine people in Charleston. Our
understanding

44:32.036 --> 44:37.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Dylann Roof, from his own
manifesto, is
he never met a person in another
hate group

44:37.308 --> 44:41.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in his life. He was completely
radicalized
online.

44:41.112 --> 44:44.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's exactly the same
phenomenon that we
see, for example, for people who
are inspired

44:44.515 --> 44:49.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by ISIS. They go onto Web sites
where there's
propaganda that's widely
available. It enrages

44:49.487 --> 44:53.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them for some reason. That kind
of lone wolf
terrorism is a big problem, and
there's more

44:53.524 --> 44:56.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of it today than it was 10 years
ago, and
we don't expect that to change.

44:56.827 --> 45:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Can you
use any of
the tactics that you used to
decimate the

45:02.400 --> 45:04.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Klan in this new era?

45:04.769 --> 45:09.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEIDI BEIRICH: These people live
on the Web,
like many people do for all
kinds of reasons.

45:09.574 --> 45:14.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only way for law enforcement
to really
find them and track them is to
follow them

45:14.378 --> 45:18.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
onto the hate Web sites. And
it's not easy.
How did Dylann Roof indicate
that he was going

45:18.449 --> 45:20.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to go on a mass shooting spree?
He didn't.

45:20.551 --> 45:24.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So, are
there any
solutions, though, for people
who -- around

45:24.255 --> 45:27.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the country who are concerned
about these
issues?

45:27.191 --> 45:31.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEIDI BEIRICH: The Department of
Justice has
reconstituted a domestic
terrorism task force

45:31.729 --> 45:37.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that had been defunct since 9/11
to start
collecting intelligence
aggressively against

45:37.635 --> 45:42.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
white supremacists and extreme
anti-government
types. That's a very important
thing to do.

45:43.007 --> 45:46.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What we try to do here is
publish information
about these people, where they
are, what groups

45:47.011 --> 45:50.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they're involved in, what
they're publishing,
so that at least law
enforcement, which is

45:50.848 --> 45:55.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the big readership for our
products, knows
where they are, what they
believe, what they

45:55.953 --> 45:59.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think, so they have a chance to
maybe catch
someone before they escalate.

45:59.256 --> 46:02.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: How much
does education
add to a solution?

46:02.860 --> 46:07.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEIDI BEIRICH: It's probably the
biggest solution.
And we know from talking to
people who are

46:07.398 --> 46:11.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
racist today that it has a lot
to do with
what you learn in the home.

46:11.302 --> 46:15.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it's not counteracted in some
way, right,
deep racial hatred, you just --
you don't

46:15.973 --> 46:20.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
learn any differently. We have a
lot of people
who come to us after stints, for
example,

46:20.444 --> 46:24.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in prison for crimes committed
with white
supremacy in some way who meet
people of other

46:24.482 --> 46:28.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
races. That's a place where you
could intervene
with younger people too and
bring them out

46:28.653 --> 46:29.820 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of movement.

46:29.920 --> 46:30.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And you
have seen
that happen?

46:30.688 --> 46:32.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEIDI BEIRICH: Many, many times.

46:32.556 --> 46:37.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of my favorite examples is a
woman named
Angela King. who went to prison
in Florida

46:37.161 --> 46:43.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for involvement with a white
supremacist skinhead
crew. They committed some
robberies. She met

46:43.134 --> 46:48.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a Jamaican woman who was
involved -- who was
imprisoned with her, but was
involved in some

46:48.506 --> 46:50.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
community activities in the
prison there.

46:50.608 --> 46:55.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They became friends. That's how
Angie got
out of the movement, was through
that relationship.

46:55.546 --> 46:59.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the first time in her life,
she had an
honest friendship, right, with a
person of

47:00.084 --> 47:04.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a different color. Now Angela
King runs something
called Life After Hate, which
works with people

47:04.889 --> 47:06.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who wants to get out of white
supremacist
movements.

47:06.991 --> 47:11.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we try to do is bust up
the groups.
We try to sow discord among the
organizations,

47:11.962 --> 47:16.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
show that the people who lead
these organizations
are hypocrites and so on, to
give people a

47:17.034 --> 47:20.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chance to look at what they have
gotten involved
in and maybe reconsider it.

47:20.538 --> 47:21.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And you
have seen
that work?

47:21.772 --> 47:23.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HEIDI BEIRICH: It absolutely
works.

47:23.641 --> 47:27.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The number one thing, I would
say, that drives
people out of hate groups is
seeing their

47:27.745 --> 47:29.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
leadership corrupt.

47:29.680 --> 47:34.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Looking
to the future
and the things that you do, are
you at all

47:34.618 --> 47:41.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
optimistic that your
organization and America
in general can get its arms
around hate and

47:41.759 --> 47:43.394 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
racism?

47:43.494 --> 47:46.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEIDI BEIRICH: I'm optimistic in
the long
run, and I'm extremely
pessimistic in the

47:46.197 --> 47:48.065 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
short run.

47:48.165 --> 47:50.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of the racial strife that
we have been
experiencing over the last year
are all related

47:51.035 --> 47:56.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to our inability to digest the
fact that this
country is changing and white
people are not

47:56.307 --> 47:58.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to be the majority here.
Right?

47:58.275 --> 48:02.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, in the long term,
everything in the
United States may be amazing.
Right? We might

48:02.546 --> 48:08.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
be the first truly
multicultural, multiethnic
democracy that embraces
tolerance everywhere.

48:08.986 --> 48:15.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We would be the first if we
sustain this transition
in the 2050s without having
things descend

48:15.159 --> 48:16.994 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into chaos.

48:17.094 --> 48:19.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we're going to have to get
through a rough
patch. We really have to work on
this issue.

48:19.864 --> 48:22.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's fundamental to our
democracy working.

48:22.500 --> 48:26.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Heidi
Beirich, thank
you so much for joining us.

48:26.537 --> 48:35.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HEIDI BEIRICH: It was a
pleasure.

48:36.080 --> 48:43.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
we note the
passing this week of two
groundbreaking artists

48:43.254 --> 48:45.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the entertainment world.

48:45.189 --> 48:47.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has our
remembrance.

48:47.158 --> 48:54.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In his first
influential sitcom,
Garry Shandling would break
character and

48:54.598 --> 48:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
speak directly to the audience.

48:56.500 --> 48:59.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARRY SHANDLING, Actor: I feel
like I'm on
Gilligan's Island. I can't get
off this date.

48:59.436 --> 49:00.805 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:00.905 --> 49:02.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHNNY CARSON, "The Tonight
Show": Would you
welcome Garry Shandling?

49:02.807 --> 49:06.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He'd started in
stand-up, and
been a fill-in host for Johnny
Carson. And

49:06.410 --> 49:15.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 1992, he created his own mock
late-night
show, "The Larry Sanders Show,"
that subverted

49:16.086 --> 49:17.721 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the form.

49:17.822 --> 49:18.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEC BALDWIN, Actor: Well,
actually, Larry,
you and I have something in
common.

49:18.722 --> 49:19.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GARRY SHANDLING: Yes? Yes, we
do.

49:19.990 --> 49:21.792 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:21.892 --> 49:25.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARRY SHANDLING: A lot of you
probably don't
know that Alec and I -- well,
Alec used to

49:25.396 --> 49:27.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
actually date my ex-wife,
Francine.

49:27.498 --> 49:34.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ALEC BALDWIN: No, I was
referring to our charity
work with multiple sclerosis.

49:34.371 --> 49:34.905 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:35.005 --> 49:36.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GARRY SHANDLING: I know.

49:37.007 --> 49:44.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He pioneered a
kind of meta-humor
and both featured, and
influenced, a generation

49:44.648 --> 49:46.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of up-and-coming comedians.

49:46.617 --> 49:53.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier this year, Sanders
joined his friend
Jerry Seinfeld on his Web series
"Comedians

49:53.757 --> 49:58.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Cars Getting Coffee," where
they discussed
the impact of "The Larry Sanders
Show."

49:58.596 --> 50:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JERRY SEINFELD, Comedian: You
ever watch TV,
"The Office," "Modern Family,"
and go, oh,

50:02.933 --> 50:05.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
look, they're still doing me?
They're still
doing that thing I invented?

50:05.102 --> 50:08.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARRY SHANDLING: I knew when I
explained to
HBO what I wanted to do, I
couldn't say, it's

50:09.073 --> 50:12.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a little bit of this show and a
little bit
of that show. I couldn't even do
that. And

50:12.309 --> 50:14.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, they thought I was
crazy.

50:14.211 --> 50:18.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Among many
others, last night,
Conan O'Brien recalled
Shandling's personal

50:18.682 --> 50:20.351 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
kindness.

50:20.451 --> 50:23.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CONAN O'BRIEN, Host, "Conan": He
was also
extremely sensitive. He was
complicated, and

50:23.721 --> 50:29.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he had a ton of empathy for
other people.
And I want to make that point.
That is something

50:29.660 --> 50:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the business, in comedy, that
is very rare.
He really did care about other
people.

50:35.933 --> 50:40.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Garry Shandling
died of an
apparent heart attack in Los
Angeles yesterday.

50:40.738 --> 50:47.544 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He was 66.

50:47.645 --> 50:53.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another innovator who helped
reshape his artistic
landscape was Malik Taylor,
better known as

50:53.183 --> 51:01.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Phife Dawg. He and childhood
friend, Jonathan,
AKA Q-Tip, helped found the
seminal hip-hop

51:01.425 --> 51:08.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
group A Tribe Called Quest,
known for its
socially-conscious lyrics and
innovative music.

51:08.465 --> 51:20.611 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
MICHAEL RAPAPORT,
Actor/Director: For a lot
of people, A Tribe Called Quest
was our Beatles,

51:20.711 --> 51:22.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our Rolling Stones, our Led
Zeppelin.

51:22.579 --> 51:27.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The group was the
subject of
a 2011 documentary called
"Beats, Rhymes and

51:27.618 --> 51:32.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Life" by actor and director
Michael Rapaport,
who spoke with us via Skype.

51:32.156 --> 51:36.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL RAPAPORT: When Q-Tip and
Phife were
in sync, it was as good as
anything. It was

51:36.760 --> 51:42.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as good as your favorite piece
of pizza, the
best glass of wine.

51:42.199 --> 51:48.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The group's 1991
album "Low
End Theory" fused hip-hop and
jazz, and along

51:48.172 --> 51:51.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with "Midnight Marauders,"
influenced a generation
of rappers and producers.

51:52.009 --> 51:56.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHARRELL WILLIAMS, Musician: We
wouldn't be
here, man, if it wasn't like for
Tribe albums.

51:56.814 --> 51:58.482 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You got it.

51:58.582 --> 52:06.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Phife Dawg died
of complications
with diabetes. He was 45 years
old.

52:07.024 --> 52:19.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And tune in later
this evening.
On "Washington Week," Gwen Ifill
and her panelists

52:19.203 --> 52:22.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will have a breakdown of the
week's big news"
-- Gwen.

52:22.172 --> 52:24.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Thanks, Judy.

52:24.141 --> 52:28.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will pick up where you left
off, providing
reporting and analysis on the
European terror

52:28.645 --> 52:33.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
crisis, the president's
history-making trip
to Cuba, and this completely
unpredictable

52:33.484 --> 52:37.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and consequential presidential
campaign, with
reporters from The New York
Times, The Daily

52:38.022 --> 52:43.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Beast, NPR, and The Washington
Post. That's
tonight on "Washington Week" --
Judy.

52:43.227 --> 52:46.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We look forward,
Gwen.

52:46.196 --> 52:51.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Alison Stewart has a preview
of what's
coming up on tomorrow's edition
of "PBS NewsHour

52:51.101 --> 52:52.669 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Weekend."

52:52.770 --> 52:56.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: On the next "PBS
NewsHour
Weekend": Workers and businesses
struggle

52:56.840 --> 52:59.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to strike a balance between
wages and tips.

52:59.410 --> 53:04.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: There are Sundays the
tips are amazing.
But then there's other days that
I'm making

53:04.782 --> 53:05.816 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
nothing.

53:05.916 --> 53:07.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: On the next "PBS
NewsHour
Weekend."

53:07.885 --> 53:13.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's tomorrow
night on "PBS
NewsHour Weekend."

53:13.190 --> 53:15.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

53:15.626 --> 53:36.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Have a great weekend. Thank you,
and good
night.
