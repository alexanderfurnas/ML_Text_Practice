allowed through passengers

trying to

escape the checks trust my
government

01:04.498 --> 01:10.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
huge responsibility within
Europe and
with the refugees so that we
cannot take

01:10.704 --> 01:16.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
anymore it's a huge huge
backward step
because we doing is a free
country and

01:16.143 --> 01:21.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everyone should come and even if
they
need help they should be getting
it here

01:21.248 --> 01:30.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or where they can it's just
believed you
living in a foreign country

01:30.123 --> 01:35.562 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
free

01:35.595 --> 01:36.930 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
work

01:36.964 --> 01:40.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
precisely 12 hours later

01:40.067 --> 01:43.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Denmark's Prime Minister Lars
loekke
Rasmussen responded by
announcing

01:43.937 --> 01:48.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
controls along the border with
Germany
the Danish measures will
initially be in

01:48.408 --> 01:52.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
place for 10 days but the
government
warmed the procedures could be
extended

01:52.612 --> 01:57.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through PBS Newshour Prime
Minister you
think that you are going to
contribute

01:57.084 --> 02:01.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a crisis further down the
line and
other countries in the rest of
Europe

02:01.188 --> 02:06.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and perhaps beyond i think is
pretty
obvious that we are in a
situation if

02:06.460 --> 02:11.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the European Union country
checked the
external borders you will see
more and

02:11.999 --> 02:18.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more and more countries which
would be
forced into introducing
temporary

02:18.805 --> 02:25.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
internal border control there's
something we need to take very
seriously

02:25.212 --> 02:31.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because it will have a negative
impact
on prosperity I'm a true
believer of the

02:31.318 --> 02:40.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
freedom of movement this is not
a happy
moment at all we have invested
billions

02:40.861 --> 02:45.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in infrastructure between Sweden
and
Denmark we have invested
millions in

02:45.632 --> 02:51.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
international branding of the
greater
Copenhagen region so this is a
step

02:51.371 --> 02:55.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
backwards between the

senior official of the human
rights

group Amnesty International is
concerned
that other nations along the
refugee

02:59.813 --> 03:04.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trail back to Greece will now
follow
suit at a time when migrants who
aren't

03:04.685 --> 03:11.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Syria Iraq and Afghanistan
has
stranded what we're seeing today
is to

03:11.058 --> 03:16.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sweden is desperately trying to
get the
rest of Europe to actually face
up to

03:16.296 --> 03:21.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its responsibilities if there is
a
European response to this crisis
the can

03:21.635 --> 03:28.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be a solution that can at least
be a way
of distributing the the burdens
and to

03:28.942 --> 03:33.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
help people who are in desperate
need of
of protection Christensen is

03:33.547 --> 03:37.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
particularly worried about the
long-term
impact on Turkey Lebanon and
Jordan

03:37.651 --> 03:42.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which have taken in many more
refugees
than the one million also
entered you

03:42.622 --> 03:47.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Europe over the past year we
continue to
see what is happening today and
that is

03:47.094 --> 03:51.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the majority of countries trying
to
shirk their responsibilities
trying to

03:51.698 --> 03:57.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
avoid helping then we will see a
build
up of more and more problems and
more

03:58.004 --> 04:03.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more refugees and the pressure
on the
local areas on the on the
neighboring

04:03.276 --> 04:07.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
countries which they are not
able to
bear in any way shape or form
and that

04:07.848 --> 04:12.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happens in those countries start
to
implode better and we'll see a
refugee

04:13.019 --> 04:17.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problem that will make what we
have
today look like nothing at all
but the

04:17.124 --> 04:21.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most pressing concern for
Michael run
drop is an economic one he
represents

04:21.695 --> 04:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
15,000 people who live and work
in the
cross border region and commute
between

04:26.266 --> 04:30.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Denmark and Sweden their lives
have
suddenly become more complex and

04:30.504 --> 04:35.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disrupted some of the pages says
that
this is a new iron curtain and

Penn Jersey City New Berlin Wall

04:38.645 --> 04:43.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the past 20 years businessman

Edmond has lived in Sweden where
homes

04:43.850 --> 04:48.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and cars are cheaper and worked
in
Copenhagen but he's now
contemplating

04:48.121 --> 04:55.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
moving to Denmark

04:55.195 --> 05:07.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and is that we have an external
border
controls and now suddenly that
seems to

05:07.841 --> 05:12.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be breaking down and each
country's
erasing the inner borders so so
so the

05:12.979 --> 05:18.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whole european community in the
old
corporation cross border seems
to be

05:18.351 --> 05:23.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
challenged dialogue so that's
that's
where I saw the impact of the
changes

05:23.823 --> 05:28.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also being built north of
Copenhagen on
the main ferry route linking
Denmark and

05:28.528 --> 05:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sweden which is in competition
with the
bridge the ferry company feels
the cost

05:32.999 --> 05:36.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of implementing the new measures
will
cost at least three million
dollars a

05:36.603 --> 05:42.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
year chief executive Henry has
complained to the European Union
about

05:42.075 --> 05:51.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sweden's action Stockholm to pay
compensation in New York wants
to reach

05:51.318 --> 06:03.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the idea I'm quite sure that
american
will hopefully not I mean what
we need

06:03.597 --> 06:09.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now is the European leaders who
should
respond to this I mean we have
been

06:09.502 --> 06:15.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pushing and pushing for European
solution so this is a clear
signal that

06:15.542 --> 06:22.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Europe now needs to take
decisions which
can protect the external borders

06:22.249 --> 06:26.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sanctions have been greeted with
disappointment in Germany which
along

06:26.686 --> 06:31.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Sweden has welcomed most
refugees
during this crisis the German

freedom of
movement as the European Union's

06:35.095 --> 06:39.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
greatest achievement but he
warned that
the Schengen area was in danger
he said

06:39.065 --> 06:43.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was crucial that common
solutions
were found to the migrant flow
but

06:43.837 --> 06:48.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
throughout this crisis national
interest
has taken priority over european
unity

06:49.009 --> 06:54.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today's developments reinforce
that
trend the PBS Newshour a marked

06:54.047 --> 06:55.348 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
improvement in Copenhagen
