WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Good evening.

00:06.506 --> 00:07.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm William Brangham.

00:07.507 --> 00:09.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Judy Woodruff is away.

00:09.242 --> 00:11.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Congress reaches
a deal to keep the government's
lights on

00:11.878 --> 00:16.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through September -- a look at
the first bipartisan
agreement of the Trump
administration.

00:16.649 --> 00:22.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, we begin our series on the
brutal civil
war in South Sudan, how ethnic
cleansing and

00:22.288 --> 00:25.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government corruption ravaged
the world's
youngest nation.

00:25.458 --> 00:30.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Civilians are
fleeing towns
and cities across South Sudan
because of repeated

00:30.964 --> 00:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attacks, and they're just
turning into ghost
towns.

00:33.199 --> 00:37.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And inside the
popular photo-sharing
app Instagram.

00:37.637 --> 00:41.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We explore how the young tech
company has
taken the world by storm.

00:41.174 --> 00:44.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN SYSTROM, Co-Founder,
Instagram: You
would post an image, and anyone
anywhere in

00:44.978 --> 00:48.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the world could see that image,
and understand
what you were trying to say
without speaking

00:48.982 --> 00:50.316 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your language.

00:50.350 --> 00:52.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:52.552 --> 00:56.723 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:56.756 --> 01:08.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In the art of
the latest
deal to come out of Capitol
Hill, a number

01:08.568 --> 01:14.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of President Trump's top
priorities were cast
aside to get enough Democratic
votes on board.

01:14.407 --> 01:16.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Lisa Desjardins reports.

01:16.409 --> 01:21.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The massive
trillion-dollar-plus
spending deal keeps government
funded through

01:21.514 --> 01:25.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the fall and gives this Congress
its first
bipartisan success.

01:25.251 --> 01:27.020 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:27.053 --> 01:28.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: These
are important priorities for
Congress and

01:28.188 --> 01:29.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the president.

01:29.656 --> 01:31.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They reflect a lot of hard work.

01:31.591 --> 01:37.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They promise to positively and
meaningfully
impact the lives of the men and
women we represent.

01:37.630 --> 01:39.399 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:39.432 --> 01:41.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: And,
at the end of the day, this is
an agreement

01:41.968 --> 01:49.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that reflects our basic
principles, something
both Democrats and Republicans
can support.

01:49.576 --> 01:53.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: President Trump
told Bloomberg
News he's -- quote -- "very
happy" with the

01:53.313 --> 01:54.280 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bill.

01:54.314 --> 01:55.281 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What's in it?

01:55.315 --> 01:57.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First, what was a sticking
point, security.

01:57.650 --> 02:02.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the end, the Pentagon got a
healthy boost
of some $20 billion.

02:02.355 --> 02:06.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Immigration and Customs
Enforcement will
see an increase of 8 percent,
much of that

02:06.493 --> 02:08.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for increased detention beds.

02:08.761 --> 02:12.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The bill also funds 10 new
immigration judges.

02:12.232 --> 02:17.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it provides nothing for a
President Trump
priority, the border wall.

02:17.036 --> 02:21.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Despite that loss, Vice
President Mike Pence,
speaking on CBS, called the deal
a bipartisan

02:21.608 --> 02:23.443 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
win.

02:23.476 --> 02:25.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE, Vice President of
the United States:
It'll avert a government
shutdown, but more

02:25.245 --> 02:29.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
important than that, there's
going to be a
significant increase in military
spending.

02:29.649 --> 02:33.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our armed forces have been
hollowed out in
recent years by budget cuts.

02:34.020 --> 02:38.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Outside of
defense, and in
contrast to President Trump's
proposals, few

02:38.625 --> 02:40.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
agencies face significant cuts.

02:40.793 --> 02:45.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Some, like the National
Institutes of Health,
will get a big lift, $2 billion.

02:45.765 --> 02:50.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, there is increased funding
to help Puerto
Rico's financial crisis, to fund
Pell Grants

02:50.937 --> 02:55.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
year-round, expand a mental
health office
and to fight opioid addiction.

02:56.009 --> 03:01.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also in the billion, $2 billion
to extend,
permanently, health benefits for
a large group

03:01.247 --> 03:03.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of coal miners and their
families.

03:03.616 --> 03:08.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House Speaker Paul Ryan said the
bill makes
America -- quote -- "stronger
and safer."

03:08.188 --> 03:12.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But contrast that with
Republican Jim Jordan
of Ohio of the conservative
Freedom Caucus.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.127 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:14.160 --> 03:15.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM JORDAN (R), Ohio: I think
you're going
to see a lot of conservatives be
against this

03:15.628 --> 03:17.697 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
plan this week.

03:17.730 --> 03:23.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why did we last fall do a
short-term spending
bill, if we weren't going to
fight for the

03:23.403 --> 03:25.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things we told voters we were
going to fight
for?

03:25.305 --> 03:29.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: White House
spokesman Sean
Spicer acknowledged Republicans
needed Democratic

03:29.442 --> 03:31.177 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
votes.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
This is something that required
60 votes in

03:32.178 --> 03:33.947 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Senate.

03:33.980 --> 03:36.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We couldn't have our entire way
on this, but
we're five months away from
having a 2018

03:36.749 --> 03:41.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
budget, and I think the
president's priorities
will be reflected much more in
that.

03:41.588 --> 03:45.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: With the latest
stopgap funding
measure set to expire Friday,
the legislation

03:45.992 --> 03:49.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could see a vote in Congress as
early as tomorrow.

03:49.462 --> 03:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two very hot topics, Planned
Parenthood and
sanctuary cities, as they are
called, were

03:53.466 --> 03:55.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ignored in this bill.

03:55.602 --> 04:00.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both keep their current funding
for now, but
expect those fights to heat up
again likely

04:00.139 --> 04:01.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as part of other bills, William.

04:02.008 --> 04:06.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Lisa,the
Democrats are claiming
this is a pretty big victory for
them, the

04:06.479 --> 04:09.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GOP, as we saw in your piece, a
little bit
less so.

04:09.515 --> 04:11.284 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do you see this shaking out?

04:11.317 --> 04:13.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, today,
the e-mails
came out first from the
Democrats overnight.

04:13.553 --> 04:16.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it took a little bit longer
to hear from
the Republicans.

04:16.155 --> 04:19.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But let's look at -- what their
broad priorities,
what they did here.

04:19.459 --> 04:20.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republicans made one big
trade-off.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They wanted defense spending to
go up.

04:22.929 --> 04:27.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They wanted some more border
security spending,
but not the border wall.

04:27.300 --> 04:31.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For that, they trade off a slew
of issues
that were important to
Democrats, as we said,

04:31.871 --> 04:33.606 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Puerto Rico.

04:33.640 --> 04:37.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is a whole other range
of them,
including, for example, the
National Endowment

04:37.210 --> 04:40.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the Arts, which got a slight
increase
in this as well.

04:40.513 --> 04:44.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In the past,
we have had
shutdowns, or we came very,
very, very close

04:44.450 --> 04:46.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to having a shutdown.

04:46.519 --> 04:48.254 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This wasn't the case in this.

04:48.288 --> 04:52.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The GOP seemed to think that
they were just
going to get blamed if the
government shut

04:52.191 --> 04:54.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down, and that is why they
seemed to have
backed off a little bit?

04:54.427 --> 04:57.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think that is
exactly right,
because there were Republicans
talking to

04:57.664 --> 05:02.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us privately last week trying to
get reporters
in the framework of, oh,
Democrats will be

05:02.101 --> 05:04.437 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
blamed if this shutdown happens.

05:04.470 --> 05:07.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the very fact that they were
bringing
that up, William, you knew that
they were

05:07.340 --> 05:09.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
worried that they would catch
the blame.

05:09.108 --> 05:11.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Part of that is because they
were blamed the
last time that happened, because
they shut

05:11.944 --> 05:15.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
down government over the
Affordable Care Act
and trying to end that.

05:15.815 --> 05:20.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think there's also an
issue with Republicans
that they are concerned that
some of the issues

05:20.186 --> 05:24.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they feel the most strongest
about do not
yet have majority of approval in
polling,

05:24.090 --> 05:25.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like Planned Parenthood.

05:25.725 --> 05:28.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most Americans want that to
continue to be
funded.

05:28.227 --> 05:32.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So if they are willing to shut
down government
over something that is
unpopular, they think

05:32.098 --> 05:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that will go blow up against
them.

05:33.366 --> 05:35.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So they didn't take those
stances in this
bill.

05:35.768 --> 05:39.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You touched on
some of the
very broad things that were
being cut or being

05:39.138 --> 05:40.907 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
supported.

05:40.940 --> 05:44.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But there are some very
specific, real people
that are targeted here or
benefit here.

05:44.610 --> 05:45.578 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tell us about those people.

05:45.611 --> 05:46.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I get to use
more graphics.

05:46.713 --> 05:47.680 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm excited.

05:47.714 --> 05:49.515 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

05:49.549 --> 05:50.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Let's talk
about some of
the winners here that I found
poring through

05:50.550 --> 05:52.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the bill that you might not hear
about otherwise.

05:52.218 --> 05:54.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The top of the list are military
personal.

05:54.554 --> 05:56.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They will receive a 2.1 percent
pay raise.

05:56.489 --> 05:58.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's something they have been
fighting for.

05:58.291 --> 06:02.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is not an enormous pay
raise, but it
more than they had been getting,
1.6 percent,

06:02.929 --> 06:04.664 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
otherwise.

06:04.697 --> 06:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, the cities of New York and
Palm Beach,
they have a lot of residents in
common, I

06:07.300 --> 06:09.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think often, in winner and
summer.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One of those, of course, is
President Trump.

06:11.604 --> 06:15.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he has been costing millions
of dollars
to those two cities to try and
protect him

06:15.608 --> 06:17.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and protect their residents as
he comes.

06:17.977 --> 06:22.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will receive some $68
million to help
pay for that added protection.

06:22.682 --> 06:25.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They are the two largest
recipients of that
money.

06:25.184 --> 06:28.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Amtrak, people who travel up
and down
the East Coast in particular,
Amtrak is getting

06:28.888 --> 06:30.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a big funding boost.

06:30.456 --> 06:32.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, not everyone did all that
well.

06:32.692 --> 06:37.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A couple of things that I
noticed that did
get some cuts, you might not
hear about, the

06:37.463 --> 06:39.232 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Coast Guard.

06:39.265 --> 06:42.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. Coast Guard will not be
getting as
big of a pay raise as the rest
of the military,

06:42.101 --> 06:43.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and they're also getting a cut.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the U.N., listen to this,
William.

06:45.304 --> 06:51.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N. will see some $640
million less from
the United States in this bill
that was passed

06:51.477 --> 06:52.445 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than last year.

06:52.478 --> 06:54.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is a lot of money.

06:54.046 --> 06:55.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Indeed, it is.

06:55.948 --> 07:00.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But from the outside, as an
observer, this
certainly seemed like a
relatively civil process,

07:00.920 --> 07:05.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with not the usual sort of
fighting and recriminations.

07:05.391 --> 07:08.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is it too much to read into
this, or do you
think this actually could be a
change in the

07:08.494 --> 07:09.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tone on Capitol Hill?

07:09.495 --> 07:10.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Imagine that.

07:10.463 --> 07:12.198 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't think so, actually.

07:12.231 --> 07:15.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I noticed, when senators and
congressmen came
back from their Easter recess,
that there

07:15.635 --> 07:21.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seemed to be less of a personal
sense of animosity
that we had had up until that
point, and that

07:21.707 --> 07:23.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there had been more of a sense
of the political.

07:23.943 --> 07:29.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I guess to paraphrase "The
Godfather,"
it's not personal, it's
political.

07:29.148 --> 07:30.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It had been personal.

07:30.683 --> 07:33.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think that's good for
civility, that's good
for conversation.

07:33.820 --> 07:37.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we still have a very large
political problem,
especially for Republicans.

07:37.523 --> 07:42.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They still don't have all the
votes coalescing
to get across the bills that
they want.

07:42.061 --> 07:45.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Speaking of
those, quickly,
the health care bill, what is
the likelihood

07:45.798 --> 07:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we're going to see something
this week?

07:47.300 --> 07:49.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes, I think
you will talk
to Amy and Tam coming up.

07:49.435 --> 07:50.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I would like to hear what they
say.

07:50.503 --> 07:53.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think right now, unlikely,
for now.

07:53.072 --> 07:54.740 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They do not have the votes.

07:54.774 --> 07:57.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, we look ahead, a lot of
these things,
they are going to kick down the
can.

07:57.410 --> 08:00.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I also understand that the White
House has
been saying tonight that they
will bring the

08:00.913 --> 08:03.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
border wall back up again later
this summer.

08:03.683 --> 08:07.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think we're going to be
regurgitating
all of these issues again.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans will have more and
more chances
to get their votes.

08:09.722 --> 08:11.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We will see if they do.

08:11.424 --> 08:15.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, the
"NewsHour"'s
Lisa Desjardins, thank you so
much.

08:15.294 --> 08:19.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the day's other news:
Thousands of demonstrators
across the country took to the
streets in

08:19.165 --> 08:23.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
massive May Day events, mostly
protesting
President Trump's policies.

08:23.736 --> 08:27.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
May 1 is ®MDNM /International
Workers Day,
and has become a rallying point
for immigration

08:27.573 --> 08:29.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
advocates and labor unions.

08:29.709 --> 08:33.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Strikes and marches were
organized in more
than 200 cities.

08:33.112 --> 08:37.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One protest in New York City
denounced the
president's views on
immigration.

08:37.383 --> 08:39.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: There is fear and there is
anxiety.

08:39.552 --> 08:44.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what gives me hope and gives
me resilience
moving forward is that the
community is resisting

08:44.123 --> 08:47.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and saying this is not the way
that we should
operate in the United States and
we have got

08:47.493 --> 08:48.427 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to stop.

08:48.461 --> 08:49.529 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we are going to push back.

08:49.562 --> 08:52.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what I am excited
today.

08:52.198 --> 08:55.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why we're here marching
and being loud
and visible.

08:55.368 --> 08:59.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: May Day
demonstrations also
took place around the world.

08:59.405 --> 09:03.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In France, protests grew violent
when activists
interrupted a peaceful union
march in Paris

09:04.010 --> 09:07.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by throwing Molotov cocktails at
police officers.

09:07.680 --> 09:10.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They responded with tear gas and
batons.

09:10.449 --> 09:14.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the U.S., parts of the South
and Midwest
braced for more severe weather
today.

09:14.787 --> 09:20.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This comes on the heels of a
line of powerful
weekend storms that killed at
least 16 people.

09:20.459 --> 09:25.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That weather system spawned
tornadoes and
heavy flooding, and inflicted
widespread damage.

09:25.498 --> 09:31.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Deaths were reported across five
states: Texas,
Missouri, Arkansas, Mississippi,
and Tennessee.

09:31.771 --> 09:37.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Korea said it is ramping
up its nuclear
arsenal in the face of growing
U.S. and international

09:37.310 --> 09:39.145 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pressure.

09:39.178 --> 09:42.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This comes two days after North
Korea conducted
another ballistic missile test,
which failed.

09:42.949 --> 09:47.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State television announced the
new threat
today, and hinted at more tests
to come.

09:47.553 --> 09:51.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Now
that the U.S.
is kicking up a racket overall
for sanctions

09:51.724 --> 09:55.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and pressure against us, we will
speed up
at the maximum pace to bolster
our nuclear

09:55.928 --> 09:57.697 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
deterrence.

09:57.730 --> 10:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will be taken in consecutive
and successive
ways at any moment and any place
decided by

10:01.534 --> 10:03.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our supreme leadership.

10:03.436 --> 10:07.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: President
Trump told Bloomberg
news he's open to meeting with
North Korean

10:07.239 --> 10:10.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leader Kim Jong-un, if the
circumstances were
right.

10:10.509 --> 10:14.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He said: "If it would be
appropriate for me
to meet with him, I would
absolutely.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I would be honored to do it."

10:16.816 --> 10:22.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, President Trump's
reelection campaign
unveiled new ads today, hailing
accomplishments

10:22.521 --> 10:24.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of his first 100 days.

10:24.523 --> 10:30.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The $1.5 million TV and online
ad campaign
touts achievements like the
confirmation of

10:30.062 --> 10:35.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Supreme Court Justice Neil
Gorsuch, tax cuts,
and the approval of the Keystone
XL pipeline.

10:35.668 --> 10:39.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It doesn't mention the failed
attempt to repeal
Obamacare or the president's
controversial

10:39.839 --> 10:41.474 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
travel ban.

10:41.507 --> 10:45.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FOX News co-president Bill Shine
has resigned
amid turmoil at the network.

10:45.511 --> 10:48.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Shine has worked for FOX since
1996.

10:48.581 --> 10:53.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was tapped as co-president
after CEO Roger
Ailes was ousted last summer,
following a

10:53.552 --> 10:55.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sexual harassment scandal.

10:55.354 --> 10:59.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shine was named in at least four
lawsuits
or allegations involving alleged
sexual harassment

10:59.959 --> 11:01.761 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or racial discrimination.

11:01.794 --> 11:06.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His departure comes just two
weeks after anchor
Bill O'Reilly also left the
network.

11:06.866 --> 11:10.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trump administration today
rolled back
the nutrition standards for
federally funded

11:10.803 --> 11:14.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
school lunches that were put in
place under
President Obama.

11:14.507 --> 11:19.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That means schools can now delay
implementing
stricter requirements on the
amount of sodium

11:19.445 --> 11:22.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and whole grains in the food
they serve.

11:22.415 --> 11:27.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Agriculture Secretary Sonny
Perdue signed
the order at a school in
Virginia, after eating

11:27.119 --> 11:29.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lunch with elementary school
students.

11:29.655 --> 11:34.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Supreme Court ruled today
that cities
can sue banks for discrimination
under the

11:34.060 --> 11:35.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Fair Housing Act.

11:35.961 --> 11:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they must prove a direct
connection between
predatory lending and the city's
loss of revenue.

11:41.067 --> 11:45.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The case involved a lawsuit
filed by Miami
against Bank of America and
Wells Fargo, which

11:45.838 --> 11:51.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
accused them of targeting
minority borrowers
with risky, more expensive
loans.

11:51.310 --> 11:53.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And stocks were mixed on Wall
Street today.

11:53.312 --> 11:58.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 27 points
to close at 20913.

11:58.617 --> 12:03.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 44 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added four points.

12:03.823 --> 12:08.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Trump's controversial
White House invitation to the
Philippines'

12:08.494 --> 12:15.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strongman president; inside the
civil war
ravaging the world's newest
country; from

12:15.367 --> 12:20.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
elementary to high school, an
investigation
into thousands of sexual
assaults; and much

12:20.773 --> 12:27.146 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

12:27.179 --> 12:37.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now: the president's weekend
phone call with
the president of the Philippines
and the uproar

12:37.523 --> 12:39.158 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that has ensued.

12:39.191 --> 12:41.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
There's a lot that the president
talks to

12:41.594 --> 12:43.529 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
these leaders in private about.

12:43.562 --> 12:46.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Privately talking about them,
building a relationship
can achieve results.

12:46.966 --> 12:51.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The White
House defended
what it said was a very friendly
phone call.

12:51.070 --> 12:55.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other end of that call,
the president
of the Philippines, Rodrigo
Duterte, a man

12:55.741 --> 13:01.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who's presided over a bloody
anti-drug crackdown
that's killed thousands of
people in his country.

13:01.781 --> 13:06.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Also during Saturday's
conversation was an
apparent surprise invitation
from President

13:06.385 --> 13:10.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump to Duterte to visit him in
person at
the White House.

13:10.956 --> 13:14.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That prompted an outcry from
human rights
advocates, including the United
Nations' human

13:14.960 --> 13:16.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rights commissioner.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZEID BIN RA'AD ZEID AL-HUSSEIN,
United Nations
High Commissioner for Human
Rights: My hope

13:18.597 --> 13:23.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that the president of the
United States
will convey this deep sense of
alarm about

13:23.435 --> 13:28.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the apparent shirking of the
obligations under
law.

13:28.040 --> 13:31.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The scale of
the killing
in the Philippines is enormous.

13:31.577 --> 13:36.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Human Rights Watch found that
over 7,000 people
were killed in Duterte's first
six months

13:36.515 --> 13:38.250 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in office.

13:38.284 --> 13:42.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Duterte has been defiant, and
was roundly
condemned for comments like this
last fall:

13:42.354 --> 13:45.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RODRIGO DUTERTE, Philippine
President: Hitler
massacred three million Jews.

13:45.624 --> 13:50.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, there is three million,
what is it, three
million drug addicts, there are.

13:50.963 --> 13:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I would be happy to slaughter
them.

13:53.599 --> 13:57.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: White House
officials said
the overture part of a wider
effort to rally

13:57.937 --> 14:02.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Asian leaders against North
Korea and its
missile program.

14:02.641 --> 14:06.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Speaking to a summit of South
Asian nations
just before the phone call with
President

14:06.478 --> 14:09.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump, Duterte appealed to the
U.S. to show
restraint.

14:09.548 --> 14:16.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RODRIGO DUTERTE: I will say
just, Mr. President,
please see to it that there is
no war, because

14:16.655 --> 14:19.291 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
my region will suffer immensely.

WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Poor relations
with the
Obama White House led Duterte to
threaten

14:23.395 --> 14:26.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a pivot to warmer relations with
China.

14:26.732 --> 14:32.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Philippines and China
continue to dispute
territory in the South China
Sea, but, today,

14:32.137 --> 14:35.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Duterte welcomed a Chinese naval
fleet to
his country's shores.

14:35.975 --> 14:40.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As for taking up President
Trump's invitation
to the White House, Duterte
played coy, saying

14:40.479 --> 14:44.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he was -- quote -- "tied up"
with a full schedule.

14:44.416 --> 14:48.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on President Trump's
invitation to
President Duterte, as well as
his relationships

14:48.487 --> 14:51.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
with other authoritarian
leaders, we turn
to David Kramer.

14:51.924 --> 14:55.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He served as assistant secretary
of state
for human rights during the
George W. Bush

14:55.594 --> 15:00.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration, and is now with
the McCain
Institute for International
Leadership at

15:00.266 --> 15:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Arizona State University.

15:01.333 --> 15:02.701 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Welcome.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID KRAMER, Former U.S.
Assistant Secretary
of State: Thanks.

15:04.270 --> 15:06.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Your first
reaction to the
invitation to President Duterte?

15:06.872 --> 15:10.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID KRAMER: I think it's one
thing for the
president to have a phone call
with President

15:10.709 --> 15:12.645 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Duterte.

15:12.678 --> 15:16.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It needs to be done, given the
tensions in
Asia, the problems with North
Korea, the challenges

15:16.248 --> 15:18.083 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with China.

15:18.117 --> 15:21.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is a different matter,
though, to embrace
Duterte and to invite him here
to Washington

15:21.720 --> 15:23.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and to visit the White House.

15:23.589 --> 15:28.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that's going much too
far, given the
gross human rights abuses that
are occurring

15:28.127 --> 15:33.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the Philippines, with
estimates of some
7,000 people killed since
Duterte became president

15:33.365 --> 15:37.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in June, a number of victims of
extrajudicial
killings.

15:37.202 --> 15:41.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We touched a
little bit
of this in the setup.

15:41.073 --> 15:44.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much do you hold Duterte
responsible for
those killings?

15:44.977 --> 15:47.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID KRAMER: He certainly is
not discouraging
them.

15:47.212 --> 15:49.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
In fact, he is encouraging them.

15:49.114 --> 15:53.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has taken credit for some
killings, including
when he was mayor before
becoming president.

15:53.953 --> 15:58.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he is creating an
environment in which
this kind of action is being
encouraged, not

15:58.390 --> 15:59.525 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
just condoned.

15:59.558 --> 16:03.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think Duterte does deserve
a lot of
responsibility.

16:03.929 --> 16:08.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It is popular in certain
segments, in part
because a lot of the people
being killed come

16:08.233 --> 16:13.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from poor, impoverished areas,
and they don't
have strong advocates speaking
out for them.

16:13.038 --> 16:17.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is this concern that
it could spin
out of control and create all
sorts of problems.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it already has.

16:19.278 --> 16:22.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, 7,000, if that number is
right, is
an extraordinary number in such
a short period

16:22.748 --> 16:24.516 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of time.

16:24.550 --> 16:27.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Apparently,
President Trump
didn't clear this with the State
Department

16:27.119 --> 16:28.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
before issuing this invitation.

16:28.787 --> 16:30.589 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is that unusual?

16:30.622 --> 16:33.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID KRAMER: Well, the
president of the United
States, whether it's Donald
Trump, Barack

16:33.459 --> 16:37.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Obama, George Bush, can
basically do what
he wants when it comes to
invitations to the

16:37.096 --> 16:38.731 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
White House.

16:38.764 --> 16:43.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it is a little unusual that
this kind
of invitation wouldn't have been
prepared

16:43.068 --> 16:45.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ahead of time as part of his
talking points.

16:45.504 --> 16:49.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reports indicate that it
came as a surprise,
not only to the State
Department, but to some

16:49.641 --> 16:52.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people on the National Security
Council and
the White House as well.

16:52.544 --> 16:56.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Do you think
of this invitation
as an endorsement?

16:56.148 --> 17:00.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have described this as an
open-arms embrace
of sorts.

17:00.452 --> 17:05.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is the president endorsing this
behavior by
bringing this man seemingly with
open arms?

17:05.124 --> 17:08.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID KRAMER: Well, in the
statement, there
didn't appear to be any
reference to human

17:08.293 --> 17:09.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rights concerns in the
Philippines.

17:09.995 --> 17:15.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And by inviting a leader to the
White House
or to the United States to visit
with his

17:15.167 --> 17:20.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American counterpart, it does
send a signal
that the president is not
attaching much importance

17:20.939 --> 17:22.808 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to human rights concerns.

17:22.841 --> 17:27.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen the embrace of
President Sisi
from Egypt, the phone call to
President Erdogan

17:27.946 --> 17:31.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after the very controversial
referendum in
Turkey.

17:31.116 --> 17:36.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen the admiration
voiced by candidate
Trump and President Trump toward
Vladimir

17:37.022 --> 17:38.924 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Putin.

17:38.957 --> 17:43.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there does seem to be this
affinity for
strongmen around the world,
without an accompanying

17:43.262 --> 17:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expression of concern about the
human rights
abuses that are occurring in
these countries.

17:47.933 --> 17:49.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You were in
the State Department.

17:49.735 --> 17:53.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know that presidents often
have to deal
with unsavory characters and
sometimes that

17:54.006 --> 17:58.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is a strategic goal in
putting your
arm around someone who you may
personally

17:58.177 --> 18:01.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
feel is a reprehensible human
being.

18:01.680 --> 18:03.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Couldn't there be a strategic
interest?

18:03.082 --> 18:05.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, couldn't this really
just be about
North Korea?

18:05.617 --> 18:07.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID KRAMER: Well, for sure.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those of us in the human rights
community
have never argued that human
rights should

18:10.889 --> 18:13.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drown out other interests the
United States
has.

18:13.692 --> 18:18.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have energy, economic
interests with countries,
security interests, but we also
have democracy,

18:18.163 --> 18:19.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
human rights interests with
countries.

18:19.965 --> 18:24.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And our argument is that that
last set of
interests shouldn't be
shortchanged in the

18:24.870 --> 18:26.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pursuit of these other
interests.

18:26.772 --> 18:30.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let's say
President Trump
did speak out and somehow
condemned what Duterte

18:30.809 --> 18:33.445 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has been doing or been involved
in.

18:33.479 --> 18:37.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Isn't there a risk, given
Duterte's personality,
that we could jeopardize the
Philippines as

18:37.816 --> 18:40.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an ally, who are a very crucial
ally to us?

18:40.319 --> 18:43.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Isn't there a risk that he could
sully that
relationship?

18:43.155 --> 18:44.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID KRAMER: There is a risk.

18:44.990 --> 18:48.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we saw this last year when
President Obama
indicated he was going to raise
human rights

18:48.727 --> 18:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issues if he had met with
Duterte, and Duterte
responded with an epithet toward
the president,

18:54.766 --> 18:58.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and basically said he was going
to turn to
China and Russia.

18:58.170 --> 19:03.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that's a little more
bluff, even though
today there were Chinese naval
vessels in

19:03.642 --> 19:06.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a port in the Philippines that
Duterte himself
visited.

19:06.512 --> 19:10.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, at the end of the day, the
Philippines-American
relationship is longstanding.

19:10.849 --> 19:15.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have very strong ties between
our peoples,
our countries and our
governments.

19:15.921 --> 19:20.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's important to
use those ties
as leverage to insist and press
for better

19:20.926 --> 19:23.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
treatment of the people of the
Philippines.

19:23.428 --> 19:25.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Last quick
question.

19:25.597 --> 19:28.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump today also said
that he would
meet with the North Korean
leader.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How does that sit with you?

19:30.335 --> 19:33.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID KRAMER: I would hope that
that would
be a last resort after
everything else is

19:33.405 --> 19:35.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tried at lower levels.

19:35.307 --> 19:40.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Granting an audience to the
worst abuser of
human rights, the North Korean
leader, President

19:40.445 --> 19:43.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kim, is something I would hope
we don't see
any time soon.

19:43.949 --> 19:49.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem is, obviously, not
just nuclear
concerns, nuclear security, but
also the treatment

19:50.022 --> 19:52.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of North Korean people by its
leader.

19:52.758 --> 19:54.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is a huge problem.

19:54.159 --> 19:56.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I hope that would also not
get swept under
the rug.

19:56.862 --> 20:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
David Kramer
of the McCain Institute, thank
you very much.

20:01.300 --> 20:08.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID KRAMER: Thank you.

20:08.240 --> 20:14.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The world's
youngest country
is tearing itself apart.

20:14.813 --> 20:19.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South Sudan was founded in 2011,
but, two
years later, forces allied to
the president

20:19.585 --> 20:22.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and vice president began
fighting each other.

20:22.321 --> 20:25.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That civil war has now led to
the near collapse
of the country.

20:25.757 --> 20:29.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In partnership with the Pulitzer
Center on
Crisis Reporting, special
correspondent Jane

20:29.928 --> 20:33.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ferguson begins a series of
three reports.

20:33.465 --> 20:36.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight is a look at this brutal
war and its
tribal roots.

20:36.602 --> 20:40.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a warning: Some images and
stories in
this report are disturbing.

20:40.839 --> 20:45.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: This was once a
busy market
town.

20:45.711 --> 20:51.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Villagers from the countryside
would come
to Leer to trade goods and catch
up on news.

20:51.049 --> 20:53.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now there is no one.

20:53.518 --> 20:58.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All the people have fled into
the bush, hiding
from violent raids by government
soldiers.

20:58.690 --> 21:02.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We found some of them a few
miles away in
rebel-held land.

21:03.028 --> 21:07.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They had crept out of hiding to
get help from
aid agencies.

21:07.633 --> 21:10.402 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Without it, they will starve.

21:10.435 --> 21:13.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their stories of what they have
endured are
horrifying.

21:13.639 --> 21:18.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): The
government is
killing men, women and children,
and sometimes

21:18.577 --> 21:22.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they even cook the dead bodies
and force us
to eat them.

21:22.914 --> 21:27.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My 5-year-old daughter was
slaughtered, and
they made me eat her body.

21:27.786 --> 21:32.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Tales of such
brutality are
common in South Sudan's civil
war.

21:32.190 --> 21:38.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A fallout between president
Salva Kiir and
his vice president, Riek Machar,
began in

21:38.363 --> 21:42.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
2013, tearing the country along
tribal lines.

21:42.434 --> 21:49.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kiir is from the Dinka tribe,
Machar from
the rival Nuer tribe.

21:49.241 --> 21:52.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fighting between the two sides
soon involved
other subtribes.

21:52.644 --> 21:56.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Battles broke out across the
country.

21:56.982 --> 22:03.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Murderous raids on civilian
communities are
a favored tactic, according to
Jonathan Pedneault

22:03.889 --> 22:05.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Human Rights Watch.

22:05.757 --> 22:08.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN PEDNEAULT, Human Rights
Watch: Both
opposition and government
fighters see various

22:08.293 --> 22:12.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
specific ethnic groups as being
supportive
of their -- either of their
opponents.

22:12.364 --> 22:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in order to decrease the
military capacities
of their opponents, they decide
to target

22:15.167 --> 22:18.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
civilians, because, without
civilians, those
fighters won't have a place to
stay, they

22:18.236 --> 22:23.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
won't receive food, they won't
receive popular
support.

22:23.475 --> 22:32.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, the aim by targeting
civilians is, in
effect, to cut the grass under
the feet of

22:32.918 --> 22:34.119 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those fighters.

22:34.152 --> 22:38.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: This is what
ethnic cleansing
looks like.

22:38.857 --> 22:44.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Entire populations of specific
tribes are
being forced out of areas in
South Sudan.

22:44.563 --> 22:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Malakal town was a mixture of
tribes.

22:47.899 --> 22:52.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Government and opposition forces
have been
fighting over it throughout the
war, both

22:52.404 --> 22:53.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
committing atrocities.

22:54.005 --> 22:59.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Each time the town changed
hands, civilians
of a specific tribe were
targeted.

22:59.878 --> 23:04.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's now controlled by Dinka
government soldiers.

23:04.082 --> 23:09.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Entire neighborhoods, where the
Nuer and other
tribes at risk used to live, lay
silent and

23:09.554 --> 23:14.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
empty, the grass reclaiming
streets that used
to be home for so many.

23:14.526 --> 23:17.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are not allowed to get out
and film in
the town center.

23:17.629 --> 23:23.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's lots of police and army
around, but
what there aren't are civilians
who live here.

23:23.201 --> 23:26.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was once South Sudan's
second biggest
city.

23:26.071 --> 23:30.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the streets and
neighborhoods are completely
abandoned now.

23:30.509 --> 23:35.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Civilians are fleeing towns and
cities across
South Sudan because of repeated
attacks.

23:35.280 --> 23:38.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they're just turning into
ghost towns.

23:38.850 --> 23:42.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They ran to this camp just
outside the town.

23:42.087 --> 23:48.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is a dusty, miserable place,
where sewage
runs between shacks and
desperately poor survivors

23:48.260 --> 23:51.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the violence try to go on
living.

23:51.897 --> 23:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Elizabeth is one of them.

23:54.199 --> 23:59.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A single mother of six, she
sells cups of
tea in the camp to earn some
money.

24:00.005 --> 24:04.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the memory of what happened
in the town
is always with her.

24:04.376 --> 24:09.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH SHOL ROUT, South Sudan
(through
translator): I saw many people
killed, including

24:09.748 --> 24:11.349 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my brother.

24:11.383 --> 24:14.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They called my brother to come
out of the
house and shot him in front of
me.

24:14.553 --> 24:20.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: The only thing
standing between
her and the government soldiers
are U.N. peacekeeping

24:20.826 --> 24:22.594 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
soldiers.

24:22.627 --> 24:28.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They guard this camp and others
like it across
South Sudan, trying to stop more
massacres.

24:28.900 --> 24:34.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N. said in December in a
statement South
Sudan is on the brink of all-out
genocide,

24:34.940 --> 24:37.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
similar to what happened in
Rwanda in 1994.

24:37.976 --> 24:44.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And yet its peacekeepers seem
unwilling or
unable to stop it.

24:44.216 --> 24:49.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, government soldiers
forced their
way into the camp, and over
several days murdered

24:49.521 --> 24:54.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more than 25 people and injured
and raped
many others.

24:54.259 --> 24:56.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Elizabeth shows us where they
came in.

24:56.928 --> 25:00.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She remains bitter that the U.N.
soldiers
didn't stop them.

25:00.599 --> 25:04.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELIZABETH (through translator):
They did nothing.

25:04.703 --> 25:08.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When they saw the soldiers cut
the fence and
come into the camp, they just
opened the gate

25:08.874 --> 25:10.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to allow the people to escape.

25:10.575 --> 25:16.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: There are over
13,000 U.N.
peacekeeping soldiers in South
Sudan.

25:16.047 --> 25:21.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 200,000 civilians have
fled to their
bases across the country when
targeted by

25:21.453 --> 25:28.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the violence, forcing the U.N.
to create guarded
camps in order to protect the
people.

25:28.326 --> 25:33.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Despite having authority to use
force if needed
to stop attacks against
civilians, the peacekeepers

25:33.665 --> 25:38.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have come under criticism for
not doing so
when attacks have happened in
front of them.

25:38.737 --> 25:42.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOUSTAPHA SOUMARE, United
Nations: Peacekeeping,
and that's all it is.

25:43.008 --> 25:45.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's really you keep peace.

25:45.477 --> 25:52.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, normally, the people who
come in peacekeeping,
the troops and so on, are really
prepared

25:52.117 --> 25:55.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the spirit of peacekeeping,
not really
entering into direct fight.

25:55.754 --> 26:00.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Despite this, he
says the U.N.
have now pushed their forces to
improve.

26:00.358 --> 26:06.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOUSTAPHA SOUMARE: They have
been instructed
that, if you see something like
that, you

26:06.331 --> 26:07.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
make a warning shot.

26:08.033 --> 26:13.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If people are -- really not
responded, you
can actually use your firearm on
that.

26:13.438 --> 26:18.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: South Sudan is
the world's
youngest nation, and the
international community

26:18.343 --> 26:21.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
played a major part in its
creation.

26:21.479 --> 26:27.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After decades of devastating
civil war with
the North, South Sudan finally
won its independence

26:27.352 --> 26:30.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with a referendum in 2011.

26:30.589 --> 26:35.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American church groups and
politicians had
campaigned for the peaceful
birth of the nation

26:35.360 --> 26:37.228 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for years.

26:37.262 --> 26:42.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it was South Sudanese
fighters, community
leaders and advocates who
sacrificed so much

26:42.901 --> 26:45.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to see this country find its
freedom.

26:45.971 --> 26:47.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
One of them was Alfred Taban.

26:47.772 --> 26:53.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A veteran journalist and
newspaper editor,
he was jailed and tortured
repeatedly for

26:53.244 --> 26:56.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years in the northern capital of
Khartoum
for calling for independence.

26:56.715 --> 27:00.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALFRED TABAN, Journalist: Well,
I knew we
were going to succeed.

27:00.585 --> 27:11.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I knew we had not -- we had not
done anything
bad.

27:11.863 --> 27:17.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were struggling for our
rights as human
beings.

27:17.636 --> 27:26.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what led me to
survive.

27:26.711 --> 27:28.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I knew we will succeed.

27:28.980 --> 27:35.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: After sacrificing
so much for
his country, its rapid descent
into civil

27:35.220 --> 27:37.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
war has broken his heart.

27:37.555 --> 27:43.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALFRED TABAN: The killing of one
another started,
the Nuers being killed, the
Dinkas being killed

27:43.828 --> 27:50.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and other tribes, then I knew
things had really
gone bad.

27:50.368 --> 27:57.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then I knew that partly we -- or
they themselves,
they were not only struggling
for the people,

27:57.275 --> 28:02.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but they were struggling for
themselves to
lead or to rule.

28:02.047 --> 28:04.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I became very, very
disappointed.

28:04.582 --> 28:09.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: In frustration,
he wrote a
column in the newspaper he runs
calling for

28:09.688 --> 28:14.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the leaders of both sides in
this war to step
down.

28:14.059 --> 28:19.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shortly after, the government he
sacrificed
his freedom for jailed him for
nearly two

28:19.898 --> 28:21.132 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weeks.

28:21.166 --> 28:23.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALFRED TABAN: They were not
struggling for
their people.

28:23.201 --> 28:26.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They were struggling for
themselves.

28:26.204 --> 28:31.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is why really the
struggle of the
people of South Sudan has been
hijacked from

28:31.976 --> 28:34.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the very beginning.

28:34.379 --> 28:42.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has become a struggle for
position and
wealth, not a struggle for the
betterment

28:42.587 --> 28:46.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the lives of the people of
South Sudan.

28:46.324 --> 28:50.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Yet neither side
in this war
is backing down.

28:50.862 --> 28:56.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is spiraling into a frenzy of
ethnic-driven
murder and revenge.

28:56.134 --> 29:01.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The dream of a peaceful South
Sudan is dying
with its people.

29:01.206 --> 29:06.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Jane
Ferguson
in Juba, South Sudan.

29:06.678 --> 29:11.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For the
record, the South
Sudanese information minister
canceled an

29:11.349 --> 29:15.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interview with Jane Ferguson to
respond to
charges against the government.

29:15.253 --> 29:21.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tomorrow, Jane reports on the
famine that
the war has caused.

29:21.893 --> 29:30.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Stay with us.

29:30.535 --> 29:35.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
weekend chockful
of politics kicks off a busy
week on Capitol

29:35.373 --> 29:40.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hill -- our Politics Monday duo
breaks it
all down; and a
behind-the-scenes look at

29:40.912 --> 29:44.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of the world's fastest
growing social
media networks.

29:44.315 --> 29:50.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But first: A new investigative
report finds
a disturbing pattern.

29:50.088 --> 29:55.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sexual abuse of students by
other students
happens more frequently in
schools than reported,

29:55.627 --> 29:59.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the consequences for the
offenders vary
considerably.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

30:00.999 --> 30:05.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A hidden horror
educators have
long been warned not to ignore
-- that's the

30:05.937 --> 30:10.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
description of sexual abuse in
schools by
the Associated Press, which
published its

30:10.575 --> 30:12.210 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
story today.

30:12.243 --> 30:16.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AP Reporters found that students
were seven
times more likely than adults to
sexually

30:16.948 --> 30:18.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
assault another student.

30:18.917 --> 30:24.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During a four-year period, the
AP tallied
at least 17,000 cases around the
country.

30:24.622 --> 30:29.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These included many cases that
were treated
as bullying or hazing instead.

30:29.527 --> 30:31.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Emily Schmall is a member of the
AP team.

30:31.462 --> 30:33.598 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She joins me now from Dallas.

30:33.631 --> 30:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Emily, thanks for joining us.

30:35.266 --> 30:40.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One key point you're making is
that this happens
more often than we know, right?

30:40.205 --> 30:42.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is it possible to say how
pervasive it is?

30:42.841 --> 30:45.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EMILY SCHMALL, Associated Press:
Yes, it's
absolutely true.

30:45.777 --> 30:49.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It happens far more often, I
think, than people
realize.

30:50.014 --> 30:56.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To say exactly how pervasive it
is, it's difficult
though, because, just like rape
and sexual

30:56.921 --> 31:04.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
assault perpetrated in other
places, rape
and sexual assault in schools is
definitely

31:04.262 --> 31:06.064 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
under-reported.

31:06.097 --> 31:11.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, while we have been able to
tally about
17,000 incidents over the four
years, experts

31:11.669 --> 31:13.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have told us it's just the tip
of the iceberg.

31:13.504 --> 31:16.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, let's
establish what we
are talking about.

31:16.140 --> 31:19.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Really, we're going beyond
bullying, beyond
hazing.

31:19.978 --> 31:21.779 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tell us what you are looking at
exactly.

31:21.813 --> 31:22.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EMILY SCHMALL: Yes.

31:23.014 --> 31:27.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, we were very, very
deliberate in what
we counted.

31:27.485 --> 31:34.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we are looking at sexual
assault as defined
by the Justice Department, which
means forced

31:34.192 --> 31:43.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
intercourse or sodomy, forced
oral sex, the
most severe forms of sexual
assault.

31:43.268 --> 31:49.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We deliberately didn't include
categories
like sexual harassment or
bullying, even though,

31:49.841 --> 31:53.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as you noted, sometimes, sex
assaults are
reported as these things.

31:53.511 --> 31:57.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so if you
look at the
rules governing schools, I
gather that it

31:57.682 --> 32:02.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really varies from state to
state in terms
of how much this is tracked and
what kind

32:02.687 --> 32:03.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of actions are taken.

32:04.022 --> 32:07.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EMILY SCHMALL: Yes, and even
sometimes within
school districts.

32:07.392 --> 32:14.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's no federal requirement
that says schools
have to track student-on-student
sex assault,

32:14.532 --> 32:19.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even though for a long time
schools have been
tracking things like free and
reduced lunch,

32:19.370 --> 32:22.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
guns, drugs on school property.

32:22.807 --> 32:27.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is just something that they
are not obligated
to track.

32:27.111 --> 32:33.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, various states do collect
some sort of
information, but it's
inconsistent state to

32:33.151 --> 32:34.886 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
state.

32:34.919 --> 32:38.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a lot of times, school
districts sort
of have the discretion over how
they report

32:39.023 --> 32:40.792 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these things.

32:40.825 --> 32:46.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Therefore, in a case -- there
were plenty
of cases we found where they
have led to a

32:46.631 --> 32:54.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
criminal charge, but the act it
itself was
categorized and reported to the
state as bullying

32:54.405 --> 32:59.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or as sexual harassment or as a
lesser form
of sex offense.

32:59.544 --> 33:02.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You referred to
this a little
bit earlier, Emily.

33:02.280 --> 33:08.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just in terms of why these cases
float so
much under the radar, why we
know so little,

33:08.319 --> 33:10.054 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
spell that out a little bit.

33:10.088 --> 33:15.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMILY SCHMALL: Yes, so the
experts we spoke
to said there's just a real
reluctance on

33:15.526 --> 33:21.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the part of not only school
administrators,
but parents as well, to
acknowledge this for

33:21.566 --> 33:23.334 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what it is.

33:23.368 --> 33:29.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They have a hard time
recognizing that kids
at such a young age can be
perpetrators or

33:29.841 --> 33:32.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be victimized in this way.

33:32.310 --> 33:34.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, that's part of it.

33:34.579 --> 33:41.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other part is that a lot of
schools have
said that they aren't really
aware of what

33:41.586 --> 33:48.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are supposed to do when an
allegation
of sexual assault between
students surfaces.

33:48.459 --> 33:54.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, lastly, some experts
have actually
said that schools are just
looking after their

33:54.732 --> 33:57.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
public image more than they are
the victims.

33:57.502 --> 34:01.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, of course,
in the wider
public, it's just something hard
for all of

34:01.639 --> 34:03.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
us to want to even discuss, I
assume.

34:03.975 --> 34:05.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMILY SCHMALL: I think so.

34:05.843 --> 34:11.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I think there's still
really a stigma
about sexual violence, not only
in the context

34:11.449 --> 34:15.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of K-12 schools, but in our
country at large.

34:15.820 --> 34:21.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it's even more intense at the
younger school
level.

34:21.426 --> 34:24.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so what can
or should
be done?

34:24.662 --> 34:26.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What -- for parents, for
educators?

34:26.798 --> 34:28.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What are the experts telling
you?

34:28.533 --> 34:32.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMILY SCHMALL: Well, the experts
are saying
that, you know, there is a real
reluctance

34:32.570 --> 34:39.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
among, not only school
administrators, but
parents as well, to acknowledge,
even, that

34:39.644 --> 34:44.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is happening and that kids
of such a
young age are perpetrating these
kinds of

34:44.982 --> 34:46.517 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
offenses.

34:46.551 --> 34:51.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the experts say that it needs
to be recognized
for what it is.

34:51.422 --> 34:57.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a lot of people
working in the space
of how we solve this, how we
empower other

34:57.929 --> 34:59.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
kids to report it.

34:59.630 --> 35:04.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is actually something that
we're going
to be taking on later on in the
series.

35:04.469 --> 35:07.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our stories are running every
Monday in May.

35:07.071 --> 35:11.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Emily
Schmall of
the AP, thank you very much.

35:11.642 --> 35:18.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMILY SCHMALL: Thank you.

35:18.983 --> 35:25.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Turning back
now to the
compromise reached in Congress
to avoid a

35:25.323 --> 35:29.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government shutdown, the effort
to pass a
health care replacement, and the
president's

35:29.660 --> 35:34.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contentious relationship with
the press, it's
time for Politics Monday, with
Tamara Keith

35:34.665 --> 35:38.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of NPR and Amy Walter of The
Cook Political
Report.

35:38.703 --> 35:39.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

35:39.937 --> 35:41.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Good
to be here.

35:41.172 --> 35:42.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Amy, I would
like to start
with you.

35:42.039 --> 35:43.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, government didn't get shut
down.

35:43.808 --> 35:45.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's a good thing, right?

35:45.143 --> 35:46.878 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What happened?

35:46.911 --> 35:48.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Yes,
great, they kept government
functioning.

35:48.312 --> 35:49.847 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

35:49.881 --> 35:52.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: The most basic thing
that Congress
can do is to keep the lights on.

35:52.383 --> 35:59.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, yes, this is a success, but
it also is
not the hardest thing that they
need to do.

35:59.624 --> 36:04.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have big, difficult pieces of
legislation
that we have been hearing about.

36:04.462 --> 36:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, one of those pieces
of legislation,
health care, has already been
pulled.

36:08.499 --> 36:11.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's talk that it may be
reintroduced this
week or later on.

36:11.636 --> 36:17.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the fact that they were able
to get one
basic piece of legislating done,
which, by

36:18.009 --> 36:23.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the way, is supposed to be the
easiest, I
don't think means that we're
going to suddenly

36:23.748 --> 36:27.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see the floodgates open and now
everything
is going to...

36:27.151 --> 36:28.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Kumbaya.

36:28.152 --> 36:29.854 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

36:29.887 --> 36:31.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Right, everybody is
going to work
together and get the big stuff
done.

36:31.055 --> 36:32.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Tam, do you
think that is
right?

36:32.790 --> 36:36.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Have we just lowered the bar so
low that,
when they do basic things like
cross kids

36:36.460 --> 36:38.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
across the sidewalk to school,
that is a huge
victory?

36:38.629 --> 36:41.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Yes,
and if you liked this movie,
just wait.

36:41.632 --> 36:42.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The sequel comes in September.

36:42.700 --> 36:43.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

36:43.701 --> 36:45.169 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

36:45.203 --> 36:48.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Because this was
just basically
finishing out of the year.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The year ends at the end of
September.

36:50.208 --> 36:54.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And what the Trump
administration is saying
is, you know, we didn't try that
hard to get

36:54.245 --> 36:58.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what we wanted this time around
because it
was already -- the process was
under way.

36:58.082 --> 37:00.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was a bipartisan effort.

37:00.785 --> 37:04.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we're going to really fight
for what we
want next time around.

37:04.088 --> 37:10.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it becomes potentially a
bigger battle
in September, where you have a
president who

37:10.962 --> 37:13.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
needs to prove that he can get
some of the
things that he wants.

37:13.864 --> 37:17.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Democrats aren't going to be
any more
willing to roll over than they
were this time

37:17.902 --> 37:19.237 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
around.

37:19.270 --> 37:21.906 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This -- it is a fascinating
thing.

37:21.939 --> 37:27.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Basically, Democrats and
Republicans in Congress
have been fighting over how to
fund the government,

37:27.245 --> 37:32.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and not very successfully
fighting about it,
for years and years and years
and years.

37:32.717 --> 37:36.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then you just -- you know,
we're on like
the eighth or ninth sequel.

37:36.254 --> 37:38.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's like "The Fast and the
Furious."

37:38.055 --> 37:39.023 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:39.056 --> 37:40.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Do you think
this is just...

37:40.057 --> 37:41.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: But without any of
the cool...

37:41.058 --> 37:42.260 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

37:42.293 --> 37:43.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Right, no car
crashes, no
Vin Diesel.

37:43.060 --> 37:44.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: No Vin Diesel.

37:44.862 --> 37:47.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Was this just
a case where
the GOP was scared that they
were going to

37:47.698 --> 37:49.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
get the blame?

37:49.567 --> 37:53.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes, if you control
the government,
you get all the blame, and you
get the credit.

37:53.471 --> 37:59.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the bottom line is, we have
seen now in
these past 100 days that,
despite the fact

37:59.777 --> 38:04.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Republicans control all
three levers
of government, getting stuff
done isn't as

38:04.115 --> 38:06.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
easy as they thought it was.

38:06.250 --> 38:09.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president himself has said,
boy, this
is a little bit harder doing
this governing

38:09.587 --> 38:11.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thing that I thought.

38:11.455 --> 38:16.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he is rightly pointing to
the fact that
Republicans have never had to
govern before.

38:16.694 --> 38:19.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have been -- most of them
have been in
the minority.

38:19.530 --> 38:22.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have never been with a
Republican president.

38:22.500 --> 38:24.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have never had control of
government.

38:24.669 --> 38:26.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, this is a brand-new
experience for them.

38:27.004 --> 38:31.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All the old fights that, by the
way, to Tam's
point, have been brewing for
years and years

38:31.275 --> 38:33.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and years -- this isn't Donald
Trump's fault.

38:33.444 --> 38:37.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The divisions between
Republicans on a whole
host of issues have been there,
I would argue,

38:37.882 --> 38:41.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going all the way back to the
Bush administration
on a lot of these issues.

38:41.452 --> 38:44.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They didn't just get cleared
away because
there is a new president.

38:44.355 --> 38:49.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: On health
care, Tam, rumblings
that there might be a piece of
legislation.

38:49.193 --> 38:53.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are they going to be able to
solve these divisions
that they -- that the GOP
discovered last

38:53.931 --> 38:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
time they tried to do this?

38:55.766 --> 39:00.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: So, these
rumblings have been
rumbling basically every week
since the health

39:00.137 --> 39:02.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
care bill in the House failed to
get a vote.

39:02.773 --> 39:05.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They pulled it from the floor
without a vote
because it was going to fail.

39:05.976 --> 39:08.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, these rumblings happen every
single week.

39:08.379 --> 39:10.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They are happening again.

39:10.047 --> 39:15.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But until we see House leaders
put a bill
on the floor, the votes aren't
there.

39:15.353 --> 39:18.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When they have the votes, they
will put it
up for a vote.

39:18.255 --> 39:20.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But in the meantime, we will
continue to talk
about it.

39:20.191 --> 39:25.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, in a Bloomberg interview,
the president
said, I want this to be good for
sick people.

39:25.529 --> 39:27.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not in its final form right
now.

39:27.398 --> 39:33.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will be every bit as good on
preexisting
conditions as Obamacare.

39:33.371 --> 39:37.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What he is describing is not the
thing that
they are potentially voting on
right now,

39:37.742 --> 39:42.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because advocates from various
nonpartisan
groups will say that it isn't as
good on preexisting

39:42.913 --> 39:43.881 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
conditions.

39:43.914 --> 39:45.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, does that mean that this is
reopened?

39:45.282 --> 39:46.650 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I guess we will find out.

39:46.684 --> 39:47.651 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

39:47.685 --> 39:49.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Right.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And that's a very
difficult place
if you are a Republican right
now.

39:51.756 --> 39:56.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Your choice is, we don't get
anything done,
and then the base is furious at
you, because

39:56.727 --> 40:00.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
you have been telling
Republicans, you have
been telling the whole country,
vote for us,

40:00.164 --> 40:01.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we going to repeal Obamacare.

40:01.165 --> 40:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For seven
years.

40:02.166 --> 40:03.534 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: For seven years.

40:03.567 --> 40:05.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Don't do it, that's a problem.

40:05.403 --> 40:11.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or you do pass something that is
not particularly
popular, where you lose the
support of your

40:11.041 --> 40:15.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moderate wing of your party, the
folks who,
by the way, are in the most
vulnerable districts,

40:15.780 --> 40:18.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
most likely to lose in a midterm
election.

40:18.349 --> 40:23.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are voting no because they
see it as
being unpopular, whether on
preexisting conditions

40:23.454 --> 40:24.422 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or others.

40:24.455 --> 40:27.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is a very uncomfortable
spot to be.

40:27.491 --> 40:29.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Don't pass anything, people are
angry with
you.

40:29.360 --> 40:34.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pass something that even a lot
of your supporters
don't like, and then you have to
defend it

40:34.365 --> 40:36.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
coming up in the midterm
election.

40:36.333 --> 40:40.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a very, very -- you
know, it's like
being in a vice.

40:40.604 --> 40:41.639 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Not comfortable.

40:41.672 --> 40:43.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let's talk
about this weekend.

40:43.841 --> 40:48.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's just say, if I had been
Rip Van Winkle,
and I woke up, say, Sunday
morning and looked

40:48.479 --> 40:52.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the newspaper, and saw
President Trump
had had that rally and seen
clips from that

40:52.750 --> 40:55.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rally, I would think we were
still in the
middle of a campaign.

40:56.020 --> 40:58.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: It was absolutely
a campaign
rally.

40:58.155 --> 41:00.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was put on by his campaign.

41:00.090 --> 41:06.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It included some of the greatest
hits from
his campaign, including the
snake poem, song

41:06.464 --> 41:13.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thing that was hugely popular
among his supporters
that it is supposed to be a
cautionary tale

41:13.103 --> 41:14.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about immigrants coming...

41:14.104 --> 41:15.739 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

41:15.773 --> 41:17.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: There is about
-- Trump
is saying, if you let the snake
into your

41:18.008 --> 41:20.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
house, and that snake bites you,
who is to
blame?

41:20.177 --> 41:21.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You are to blame.

41:21.178 --> 41:22.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Exactly.

41:22.980 --> 41:25.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's been something -- it's
the kind of
thing where he would say, I
might talk about

41:25.749 --> 41:28.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the snake at his rallies, and
people would
go, rah!

41:28.786 --> 41:31.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this that is exactly what
happened at
this rally.

41:31.222 --> 41:36.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also did the CNN is terrible,
the failing
New York Times, the whole thing,
a lot of

41:36.927 --> 41:41.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bashing of the media, which is
kind of fascinating,
because it comes in a week where
he has done

41:41.999 --> 41:46.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
so many interviews with
basically every news
outlet in America.

41:46.637 --> 41:51.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the media is the opposition
party or whatever
he wants to call it, why does he
keep talking

41:51.609 --> 41:52.576 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to us?

41:52.610 --> 41:53.577 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:53.611 --> 41:55.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Right.

41:55.412 --> 41:58.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And his campaign, by
the way -- on
top of all of this, not only did
he have a

41:58.215 --> 42:07.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign-style rally as a
president, but his
campaign is literally running
ads right now

42:07.124 --> 42:08.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that look like...

42:08.125 --> 42:09.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Right.

42:09.126 --> 42:11.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How unusual is that?

42:11.128 --> 42:13.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: It's not that
unusual for a president
out of the time when he is
running for president

42:13.564 --> 42:16.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
trying to sow some good
feelings.

42:16.066 --> 42:19.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, definitely, he needs to
boost his approval
rating.

42:19.703 --> 42:25.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it is unusual that the
campaign itself
is already spending money trying
to talk about

42:25.743 --> 42:28.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a president who is 100 days into
his presidency.

42:28.913 --> 42:30.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Right.

42:30.381 --> 42:32.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: The other thing you
noticed was,
it wasn't just the media.

42:32.249 --> 42:36.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, they had their own
special event
where they were defending
themselves against

42:36.053 --> 42:37.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
attacks from Donald...

42:37.054 --> 42:38.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
correspondents dinner.

42:38.422 --> 42:40.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Right, which, again,
felt like
we were back in 2016.

42:40.357 --> 42:44.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then there were rallies
around the country,
especially here in Washington,
D.C., on climate

42:44.895 --> 42:50.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change, where you had the
so-called resistance
shouting about how much they
dislike the president

42:50.734 --> 42:52.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and want to see him go.

42:52.036 --> 42:54.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it feels like we are never
going to break
out of this...

42:54.471 --> 42:55.839 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

42:55.873 --> 42:57.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's
probably why he wanted
to get out of town.

42:57.641 --> 43:00.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Amy Walter, Tamara Keith, thank
you both so
much.

43:00.377 --> 43:05.482 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

43:05.516 --> 43:10.588 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

43:10.621 --> 43:18.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Next: the
rapid rise of
one of the world's biggest
social media networks,

43:18.329 --> 43:20.097 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Instagram.

43:20.130 --> 43:24.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's building up steam, with 700
million people
now using it each month, and it
just took

43:24.702 --> 43:28.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
four months to pick up its
latest 100 million
new accounts.

43:28.706 --> 43:33.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But along the way, the company
has faced concerns
over how it can be used, and
even some criticism

43:33.711 --> 43:37.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the way it essentially
copied ideas from
its rival, Snapchat.

43:37.915 --> 43:42.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy Woodruff recently got an
inside look
during her trip to Silicon
Valley.

43:42.353 --> 43:49.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the first
things that
greets you inside Instagram is,
no surprise,

43:49.259 --> 43:51.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a place to take pictures.

43:51.261 --> 43:59.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The free photo-sharing mobile
app was born
in 2010 with its first post, a
foot in a flip-flop

43:59.136 --> 44:01.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
alongside a stray dog.

44:01.572 --> 44:05.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Turns out it was taken in Mexico
by co-founder
Kevin Systrom.

44:05.843 --> 44:07.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEVIN SYSTROM, Co-Founder,
Instagram: It's
a mixture of teams.

44:07.678 --> 44:12.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have got design teams, we
have got
partnership teams, we have got a
community

44:12.549 --> 44:13.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
team, and then a bunch of
engineers.

44:13.951 --> 44:15.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We don't really have an
organization.

44:15.919 --> 44:21.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Systrom showed us
around Instagram's
new offices in Menlo Park,
California, designed

44:21.592 --> 44:24.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to accommodate an ever-expanding
staff.

44:24.995 --> 44:26.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You moved here six months ago;
is that right?

44:26.930 --> 44:30.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEVIN SYSTROM: Yes, six months
ago, we moved
from the original campus.

44:30.968 --> 44:38.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we designed this entire
experience inside
here to be cleaner, and a little
bit more

44:38.042 --> 44:39.476 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Instagrammy.

44:39.510 --> 44:42.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we have got the hip wood
walls, and the
polished concrete floors.

44:42.146 --> 44:45.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's very start-uppy, but it's
in an Instagram
way.

44:45.349 --> 44:52.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A start-up no
longer, Instagram
was acquired by Facebook in 2012
for a cool

44:52.356 --> 44:53.624 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
billion dollars.

44:53.657 --> 44:57.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Then, the company had 13
employees.

44:57.161 --> 45:05.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now it has more than 600 to keep
up with a
rapidly growing user base, 700
million monthly

45:05.335 --> 45:10.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
active users and counting, 80
percent of them
outside the United States.

45:10.941 --> 45:14.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
How do you explain the
phenomenal, rapid growth
of this?

45:14.378 --> 45:19.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN SYSTROM: On Instagram,
very early on,
you would post an image, and
anyone anywhere

45:19.516 --> 45:23.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the world could see that
image, and understand
what you were trying to say
without speaking

45:23.721 --> 45:25.355 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your language.

45:25.389 --> 45:29.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, we like to say that
Instagram was one
of the first truly international
networks

45:29.460 --> 45:31.295 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the world.

45:31.328 --> 45:33.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's what's
allowed it to scale
to the hundreds of millions of
people that

45:33.931 --> 45:35.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
use it every day today.

45:35.432 --> 45:39.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It still is a
pretty extraordinary
growth rate, isn't it?

45:39.269 --> 45:41.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KEVIN SYSTROM: Yes.

45:41.171 --> 45:44.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I mean, even with
that rational
explanation, it's hard for
people to understand

45:44.174 --> 45:45.142 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
how it happened.

45:45.175 --> 45:47.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KEVIN SYSTROM: Yes.

45:47.044 --> 45:48.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, back in the day, if
you started
a company, you would have to
rent a warehouse,

45:48.679 --> 45:50.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you would have to hire a bunch
of employees.

45:50.748 --> 45:55.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, with very, very
few people
sitting here in this building
today, we're

45:55.185 --> 46:00.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
able to scale it to hundreds of
millions of
people around the world, because
of the innovations

46:00.524 --> 46:02.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that we are built up upon.

46:02.493 --> 46:05.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's the cool thing about
running a
company today, is how many
people you can

46:05.662 --> 46:07.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
touch how quickly.

46:07.531 --> 46:12.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For a company
founded on images,
the walls here are adorned with
some of the

46:12.136 --> 46:15.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
best, culled from Instagram
users around the
world.

46:15.939 --> 46:20.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN SYSTROM: Well, not to
invoke the common
saying, but a picture is worth
1,000 words.

46:20.410 --> 46:24.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's kind of like the
phrase that this
company is built on.

46:24.314 --> 46:28.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just something that's
unlike traditional
texts and traditional media.

46:28.218 --> 46:32.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it allows you to see
a different
side of people, maybe a more raw
and human

46:32.222 --> 46:33.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
emotional side of people.

46:33.824 --> 46:36.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Celebrities have
embraced the
app.

46:36.994 --> 46:42.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Singer Selena Gomez has the most
followers,
more than 118 million.

46:42.366 --> 46:48.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Beyonce has the distinction
of having
the most-liked image in the
history of Instagram,

46:48.539 --> 46:55.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
10.9 million and climbing, for
this photo
that announced she's pregnant
with twins.

46:55.145 --> 47:01.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For teens, the quest for more
and more likes
and followers, plus the pressure
for perfection

47:01.652 --> 47:07.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
as portrayed by some
mega-popular users, is
raising concerns among parents.

47:08.025 --> 47:13.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not only body image, but also
bullying have
become issues for some younger
users.

47:13.530 --> 47:20.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Instagram is grappling with
how to foster
a safe community, free from
abusive behavior.

47:20.037 --> 47:25.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when you started Instagram
seven years
ago in 2010, did you have any
idea you were

47:25.108 --> 47:29.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be spending time, a lot
of time now,
thinking about protecting the
people who use

47:29.980 --> 47:31.715 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it?

47:31.748 --> 47:36.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN SYSTROM: No, I would say,
every day
at Instagram is not only the
most complicated

47:36.453 --> 47:38.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
day of my career, but also the
most interesting.

47:38.889 --> 47:41.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you
prepare yourself
for this kind of responsibility?

47:41.992 --> 47:43.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, what are you, 32 years
old?

47:43.493 --> 47:44.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEVIN SYSTROM: Thirty-three.

47:44.494 --> 47:45.462 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thirty-three.

47:45.495 --> 47:46.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KEVIN SYSTROM: Yes.

47:46.496 --> 47:47.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All of 33.

47:48.031 --> 47:49.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's a lot of responsibility,
isn't it?

47:49.700 --> 47:51.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KEVIN SYSTROM: Yes.

47:51.635 --> 47:53.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are a lot of parents
here at Instagram
who think deeply about a world
in which their

47:53.837 --> 47:57.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children are going to grow up
online, and
what kind of product they want
to create,

47:57.708 --> 47:59.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and what kind of legacy they
want to leave.

47:59.643 --> 48:04.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't yet have kids, but in a
world where
I do have kids, I want to make
sure that the

48:04.448 --> 48:08.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world they grow up in is one
that is safe
online, and that Instagram led
the way to

48:08.118 --> 48:09.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
create that world.

48:09.753 --> 48:15.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But with 95
million uploads
a day, monitoring is a tall
order.

48:15.225 --> 48:21.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New guidelines are aimed at
blurring out questionable
material before the user even
sees it, with

48:21.565 --> 48:24.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a screen labeled "sensitive
content."

48:24.668 --> 48:30.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There's also a reporting
function for content
about self-harm or suicide.

48:30.474 --> 48:33.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Systrom says the company's work
is far from
over.

48:33.210 --> 48:35.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KEVIN SYSTROM: This is a
constant process.

48:35.913 --> 48:40.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is about making sure that
we continue
to evolve the way we attack the
problem.

48:40.784 --> 48:45.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This isn't about getting to an
eventual future
where it is absolutely gone.

48:45.589 --> 48:49.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That being said, it doesn't mean
that we can't
make real progress on it, and,
more importantly,

48:49.459 --> 48:53.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
show the leadership that I think
our company
can and should, so that other
tech companies

48:53.630 --> 48:55.499 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do as well.

48:55.532 --> 49:02.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The pressure in
Silicon Valley
to lead, innovate and stay
relevant is intense.

49:02.205 --> 49:08.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Instagram has come under
criticism for
its outright and successful
copying of rival

49:08.345 --> 49:11.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Snapchat's video stories feature

49:11.181 --> 49:17.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instagram Stories, you have
openly said was
copied, in effect, from
Snapchat.

49:17.721 --> 49:19.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that what happened?

49:19.589 --> 49:22.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN SYSTROM: The way things
work in Silicon
Valley is that companies will
think up ideas,

49:22.793 --> 49:24.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and, if they're good, they will
stick.

49:24.728 --> 49:26.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, often, they spread to other
companies.

49:26.663 --> 49:29.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if we can learn from other
companies that
do it really well, we're going
to continue

49:29.800 --> 49:31.301 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do that.

49:31.335 --> 49:35.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Advertising on
the app is also
growing and reaping rewards.

49:35.105 --> 49:40.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are one million active
advertisers,
a 400 percent increase from last
year.

49:40.510 --> 49:43.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How have you changed your
advertising philosophy
over time?

49:43.613 --> 49:48.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN SYSTROM: Yes, there were
two major changes,
I think, to our advertising
philosophy over

49:48.885 --> 49:49.920 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

49:49.953 --> 49:51.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The first was just to have
advertising at
all.

49:51.054 --> 49:52.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Period.

49:52.055 --> 49:53.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KEVIN SYSTROM: That was a big
one.

49:53.991 --> 49:57.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we always knew we were going
to be a business,
and that's how we were going to
be a business,

49:57.094 --> 49:58.862 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was advertising.

49:58.895 --> 50:04.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second shift was going from
a world where
we had a small number of
advertisers doing

50:04.735 --> 50:10.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very refined ads to now, where
we have many,
many millions of advertisers on
Facebook able

50:10.741 --> 50:12.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to buy Instagram ads.

50:12.509 --> 50:18.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We ended where we
began, in
front of Instagram's wall of
photo-ops, where

50:18.248 --> 50:21.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Systrom shares credit for how
far the company
has come.

50:21.451 --> 50:25.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN SYSTROM: It was the right
time, it was
the right idea, and then it was
the right

50:25.322 --> 50:26.556 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
team.

50:26.590 --> 50:29.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You need a lot of things to go
well to get
to this point.

50:29.092 --> 50:30.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So I feel very lucky.

50:30.894 --> 50:34.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The business
practices and
decisions made by Instagram and,
much more

50:35.032 --> 50:37.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
broadly, by Facebook are
increasingly under
scrutiny.

50:37.834 --> 50:50.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will have a closer look at
that issue later
this week.

50:50.847 --> 50:54.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now to our "NewsHour" Shares,
something that
caught our eye that may be of
interest to

50:54.751 --> 50:56.453 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you, too.

50:56.486 --> 50:59.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Herbert Hoover may be best
remembered as a
rigid Republican whose
presidency saw the

50:59.856 --> 51:01.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
start of the Great Depression.

51:01.725 --> 51:06.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But newly discovered reels of
film reveal
a softer, more human side of the
man and his

51:06.797 --> 51:07.764 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
family.

51:07.798 --> 51:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s Julia Griffin
explains.

51:09.933 --> 51:19.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Herbert Clark
Hoover, engineer,
humanitarian, and 31st president
of the United

51:19.342 --> 51:25.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States, he's forever imprinted
in our history
books in Depression-era black
and white -- or

51:25.582 --> 51:27.617 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
maybe not.

51:27.651 --> 51:32.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Seven recently unveiled home
movies now place
his White House in a colorful
new light.

51:32.389 --> 51:34.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LYNN SMITH, Herbert Hoover
Presidential Library-Museum:
You get used to seeing the '20
and '30s in

51:34.925 --> 51:40.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
black and white only, so, to see
them in color
is kind of like going through a
time machine.

51:40.664 --> 51:47.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Lynn Smith is the
audio-visual
archivist at Herbert Hoover
Presidential Library-Museum.

51:47.938 --> 51:53.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2014, she discovered the
films weren't
black and white, but rather
Kodacolor, a short-lived

51:53.944 --> 51:58.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
product that requires a special
projection
lens to reveal colored hues.

51:58.248 --> 52:04.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LYNN SMITH: It's nice to have
old color film,
but White House color films,
there's only

52:05.021 --> 52:07.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one first, and I think we may
have it.

52:07.190 --> 52:12.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: The camera
belonged to Hoover's
wife, Lou, an early home movie
technophile.

52:12.762 --> 52:19.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now restored, the films show
unguarded moments
of first family life, a 1929
fishing trip,

52:20.003 --> 52:24.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in which then president-elect
Hoover catches
a barracuda, or a game of fetch
on the White

52:25.008 --> 52:30.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House lawn between first lady
Lou and first
dogs Pat and Weejie.

52:30.213 --> 52:35.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One even features Alonzo Fields,
who served
20 years as the chief White
House butler.

52:35.352 --> 52:38.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here, he stands in the 1930 Rose
Garden.

52:38.722 --> 52:44.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the longest clip offers a
rare glimpse
of the president's favorite
physical activity:

52:44.060 --> 52:47.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a morning match of catch the
press dubbed
Hoover Ball.

52:47.597 --> 52:52.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LYNN SMITH: It was a 6-pound
leather ball
that was filled with stuffing,
and they'd

52:52.736 --> 52:59.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have Cabinet members, some
members of the
Supreme Court out every morning,
six days

52:59.309 --> 53:00.277 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a week.

53:00.310 --> 53:02.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they would toss and catch
thing.

53:02.145 --> 53:05.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They would score it similar to
volleyball
or something like that.

53:05.815 --> 53:09.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: The videos show
the Hoover
family's lighter side.

53:09.486 --> 53:14.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LYNN SMITH: He wasn't just the
dour, stone-faced
man that was president during
the Depression.

53:14.491 --> 53:16.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He did have a heart and soul.

53:16.293 --> 53:21.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Smith is busy
scouring the
museum's archives for more shots
like this.

53:21.998 --> 53:24.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Julia Griffin.

53:24.568 --> 53:27.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Tune in later
this evening.

53:27.504 --> 53:32.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Independent Lens" presents a
film that looks
at the secret U.S. drone program
through the

53:32.108 --> 53:34.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
eyes of three veterans who are
now whistle-blowers.

53:34.611 --> 53:41.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"National Bird" explores the
difficult circumstances
faced by military personnel in
