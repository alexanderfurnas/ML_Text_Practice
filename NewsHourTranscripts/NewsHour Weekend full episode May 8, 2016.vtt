IN MANY CASES IN RECENT YEARS

04:56.830 --> 04:57.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THEMSELVES UP, TRIED TO ESCAPE

05:08.241 --> 05:10.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN

05:10.610 --> 05:11.711 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THE GOVERNMENT IS SUPPOSED TO

05:11.711 --> 05:14.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TURN THESE KIDS OVER TO U.N.

BUT INSTEAD OUR REPORTER KEVIN

05:19.319 --> 05:21.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOUND THEY DETAINED A LOT OF

THEM AND FORCED THEM TO GO OUT

05:23.523 --> 05:25.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON VERY DANGEROUS MISSIONS AND

05:25.025 --> 05:26.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POINT OUT FORMER COLLEAGUES,

05:26.660 --> 05:30.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

IDENTIFY THEM.

05:39.773 --> 05:40.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT KIND OF DANGER DOES THAT

05:40.707 --> 05:42.042 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUT THAT IN?

05:42.042 --> 05:43.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> A HUGE AMOUNT.

05:43.710 --> 05:45.078 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE KIDS TOLD YOU, KEVIN

05:45.078 --> 05:46.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERVIEWED EIGHT OF THEM AND

05:46.580 --> 05:47.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TALKED TO RELIEF WORKERS AND SO

05:47.981 --> 05:49.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THAT THE KIDS' FACES WERE NO

05:49.716 --> 05:51.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT COVERED AND HOME

NEIGHBORHOODS.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO PEOPLE KNOW WHO THEY ARE.

05:55.488 --> 05:56.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE KIDS ARE NOW VERY

05:56.523 --> 05:58.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRIGHTENED BOTH THEY AND OTHER

05:58.792 --> 05:59.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE TOLD US THEY MAY HAVE TO

05:59.793 --> 06:01.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE RELOCATED.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.964 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY REALLY FACE GRAVE RISK OF

06:03.964 --> 06:05.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF BEING KILLED.

06:05.865 --> 06:07.801 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Thompson: WHY IS CHILDREN

06:07.801 --> 06:09.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT ALL FOR THIS?

06:09.169 --> 06:10.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE THEY MORE EASILY MANIPULATED

06:10.937 --> 06:12.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR SOME SAY SOMETHING GREATER

06:12.472 --> 06:13.473 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THE STATE OF THE

OFFICIALS, THESE KIDS WERE PART

06:18.845 --> 06:21.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ANTS -- COMBATANTS THEY

06:26.686 --> 06:29.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUSTIFIED THEIR BEHAVIOR.

06:29.289 --> 06:30.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KIDS TOLD US MAYBE MORE

06:30.557 --> 06:31.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MALLEABLE.

06:31.591 --> 06:32.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT IS A VIOLATION OF

06:32.859 --> 06:34.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERNATIONAL LAW IN SOME CASES

06:34.261 --> 06:35.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S A WAR CRIME.

AL-SHABAB WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS

06:40.467 --> 06:42.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOES THIS RAISE ABOUT U.S.

06:42.802 --> 06:44.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNMENT KNOWS ABOUT THE

06:44.371 --> 06:45.972 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SITUATION OR DID IT CONDONE

06:45.972 --> 06:47.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS?

06:47.340 --> 06:48.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

INTELLIGENCE AGENCY.

06:54.514 --> 06:55.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CIA WOULDN'T RESPOND TO OUR

06:55.882 --> 06:57.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR

INVOLVEMENT.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT SOMALIA OFFICIALS TOLD US

07:00.120 --> 07:01.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CIA KNOWS EVERYTHING WE'RE

07:01.121 --> 07:02.322 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOING.

07:02.322 --> 07:04.024 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT KNOWS THAT

07:04.024 --> 07:06.393 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMALIA HAS USED CHILD SOLDIERS,

07:06.393 --> 07:07.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH IS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

07:07.193 --> 07:08.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THING.

07:08.528 --> 07:09.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT'S BEEN A HUGE ISSUE,

07:09.596 --> 07:10.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S A LAW AGAINST PROVIDING

07:10.797 --> 07:12.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITARY AID TO COUNTRIES THAT

07:12.165 --> 07:14.868 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
USE CHILD SOLDIERS, THERE'S A

WEAVER SOME TIME FOR NATIONAL

SECURITY REASONS.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.972 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS A REAL QUESTION OF HOW

07:18.972 --> 07:21.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUCH THE CIA HAD OBSERVED OR IS

07:21.675 --> 07:25.178 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AWARE OF WHAT IS REAL HUMAN

07:25.178 --> 07:26.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHTS ABUSE.

07:26.079 --> 07:27.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Thompson: WHAT HAPPENS NOW

07:27.781 --> 07:28.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THESE KIDS?

07:28.882 --> 07:30.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS ANYTHING BEING DONE TO END

07:30.283 --> 07:32.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS PRACTICE, ALSO HAS

07:32.686 --> 07:33.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMALI GOVERNMENT SAD ANYTHING

07:33.953 --> 07:35.588 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THIS.

07:35.588 --> 07:37.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS THE

07:37.991 --> 07:39.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KIDS WERE KEPT IN A CENTER WHERE

07:39.726 --> 07:42.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO ACCESS TO

07:42.062 --> 07:43.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

AS OF COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, A

07:49.736 --> 07:51.137 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOT OF THE KIDS WERE TRANSFERRED

TO A CENTER WHERE THEY ARE

07:52.405 --> 07:53.473 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GETTING REHABILITATION, NO

07:53.473 --> 07:55.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONGER BEING USED AS INFORMANTS.

07:55.375 --> 07:57.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WHAT WE WERE TOLD THAT WE

07:57.010 --> 07:59.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK THE PRACTICE -- OR AID

07:59.546 --> 08:00.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORKERS AND OTHERS THINK THE

08:00.647 --> 08:02.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRACTICE ACTUALLY CONTINUES AND

08:02.382 --> 08:03.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS OTHER CHILDREN STILL

08:03.550 --> 08:04.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
