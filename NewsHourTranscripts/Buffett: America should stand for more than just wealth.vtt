JUDY WOODRUFF: Next, to
part one of my interview
with Warren Buffett.

00:04.066 --> 00:08.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's one of the shrewdest and
most successful investors in
the world, earning the nickname

00:08.866 --> 00:10.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Oracle of Omaha.

00:10.800 --> 00:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I traveled to Nebraska
last week for this
wide-ranging conversation.

00:15.300 --> 00:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a note: Buffett is CBO of
Berkshire Hathaway, which owns
BNSF Railway, one of the funders

00:21.500 --> 00:24.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the "NewsHour."

00:24.033 --> 00:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's number two on Forbes'
list of the world's
wealthiest people, worth
more than $75 billion.

00:31.900 --> 00:36.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Warren Buffett is an
investing rock star to
his Berkshire Hathaway
shareholders, who gather

00:37.666 --> 00:39.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Omaha every year.

00:39.900 --> 00:44.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
One share is trading
today at $251,000.

00:46.900 --> 00:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two years ago, the legendary
firm celebrated its record of
investment over a half-century,

00:52.466 --> 00:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a portfolio that includes Kraft
Heinz, Geico, Wells Fargo,
Coca-Cola and, among others,

00:58.866 --> 01:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Nebraska Furniture Mart.

01:01.200 --> 01:04.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the largest furniture
store in North America.

01:04.866 --> 01:09.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Buffet bought it in 1983
from Rose Blumkin, a
Russian immigrant who
built it from nothing.

01:11.800 --> 01:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT, Chairman
and CEO, Berkshire Hathaway:
There's nothing like it.

01:13.900 --> 01:16.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're the 58th market in the
United States, and this was the
largest home furnishing store

01:16.166 --> 01:19.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the country, until
we built two more.

01:19.100 --> 01:21.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why
was she so successful?

01:21.100 --> 01:23.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What was the secret?

01:23.133 --> 01:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: She would say --
she had a thing in her office,
which you probably couldn't

01:29.000 --> 01:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
read, but it says she
had two things, sell
cheap and tell the truth.

01:31.400 --> 01:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We talked on the
showroom floor surrounded by
sofas, lamps and coffee tables.

01:37.900 --> 01:41.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The state of the economy
was our first topic.

01:41.133 --> 01:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The stock market's booming.

01:43.533 --> 01:47.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Unemployment rate is,
what, is as low as it's
been in 15, 16 years.

01:47.766 --> 01:52.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we're still not
seeing the growth that
people would like to see.

01:52.566 --> 01:54.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What's going on?

01:54.633 --> 01:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: The economy
is doing well, but all
Americans aren't doing well.

01:56.433 --> 02:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we have got $57,000 or
$58,000 of GDP per person.

02:02.866 --> 02:04.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is a lot of stuff.

02:04.833 --> 02:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And yet
the growth, the rate of
growth is, what, 2 percent.

02:08.233 --> 02:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Yes, 2 percent.

02:10.333 --> 02:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
is saying we're going to get
it up a lot higher than that.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is that doable?

02:15.033 --> 02:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, it may
be occasionally it happens.

02:17.100 --> 02:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, no, I don't think
probably on average we will
have that kind of growth.

02:20.733 --> 02:23.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But 2 percent does
wonders for you, Judy.

02:23.366 --> 02:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you take 2 percent,
we have a half-a-percent
population growth, and we
have a little immigration,

02:29.900 --> 02:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but 2 percent in one generation
will add $19,000 of GDP per
person, family of four, $76,000

02:36.633 --> 02:38.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in one generation.

02:38.700 --> 02:42.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, your children and
your children's children
and all that, they
will live far, far, far

02:43.800 --> 02:45.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
better than we live
with 2 percent growth.

02:45.866 --> 02:49.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me
then ask you a little bit about
the employment picture, because

02:49.066 --> 02:51.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it is, as you ISIS
, low unemployment.

02:51.733 --> 02:54.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
People -- a lot of
people have jobs.

02:54.233 --> 02:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, we're
told the labor participation
rate is lower than what
the experts like it

03:00.466 --> 03:01.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to be.

03:01.433 --> 03:02.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: Yes.

03:02.966 --> 03:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: More people are
leaving jobs than are joining.

03:04.500 --> 03:06.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Are we seeing some
kind of shift?

03:06.933 --> 03:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, we always
see shifts in employment.

03:09.166 --> 03:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you think about it, if you go
back to 1800, it took 80 percent
of the labor force to produce

03:15.033 --> 03:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
enough food for the country.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now it takes less
than 3 percent.

03:19.266 --> 03:22.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, the truth is that market
systems move people around.

03:22.866 --> 03:27.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You also see,
though, some experts saying
that not enough -- there aren't

03:27.566 --> 03:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
enough workers out there who
know -- who have the skills to
do all the jobs that are needed.

03:33.966 --> 03:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well,
there's always a mismatch.

03:36.033 --> 03:41.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I mean, you know, as
the economy evolves, it
reallocates resources.

03:43.033 --> 03:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, the real problem, in my
view, is -- this has been -- the
prosperity has been unbelievable

03:47.266 --> 03:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the extremely rich people.

03:49.433 --> 03:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you go to 1982, when Forbes
put on their first 400 list,
those people had $93 billion.

03:56.833 --> 04:01.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They now they have $2.4
trillion, 25 for one.

04:01.166 --> 04:06.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That is -- this has
been a prosperity that's
been disproportionately
rewarding to the people

04:07.300 --> 04:08.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on top.

04:08.933 --> 04:11.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are we
stuck forever with some
measure inequality?

04:11.133 --> 04:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: No, we generally
have translated greater output
in the few hours of work per

04:18.600 --> 04:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
week over the last century.

04:21.333 --> 04:23.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's a good
trend of the future.

04:23.600 --> 04:28.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we do have to have a system
that, as output of goods and
services keeps increasing per

04:30.600 --> 04:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
capita, that it takes care of
the people who are willing to
work and really are not getting

04:34.633 --> 04:37.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by very well with a
family on a 40-hour week.

04:37.700 --> 04:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You come
across as optimistic about
the future of this country.

04:41.700 --> 04:44.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

04:44.300 --> 04:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I think you
wrote to your shareholders
last year it's been a
mistake to bet against

04:45.700 --> 04:48.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the United States for
the last 240 years.

04:48.966 --> 04:53.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Has the U.S. standing, though,
in the world been -- has it
been changed, has it been harmed

04:55.933 --> 04:59.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in any way, given what's
been going on for the
last six or eight months?

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: We do not
have quite the percentage
of the world's GDP
that we had 20 or 30 or

05:05.100 --> 05:07.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
40 years ago, but
we're still the leader.

05:07.300 --> 05:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The question is whether we
can be the moral leader, as
well as the economic leader.

05:09.833 --> 05:11.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
what do you think?

05:11.466 --> 05:14.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well,
I think that's a podium
that we should have.

05:14.900 --> 05:19.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We will be the economic
leader, and we should
be the moral leader.

05:21.566 --> 05:23.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We should stand for more
than the fact that we're
the wealthiest country.

05:23.766 --> 05:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And do you
think we are right now?

05:25.833 --> 05:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, sometimes,
we are and sometimes we aren't.

05:28.700 --> 05:30.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

05:30.700 --> 05:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: I didn't think
what happened on the Paris
agreement was a good idea.

05:35.866 --> 05:36.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have to live with
the rest of the world.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's a mistake, in my view.

05:39.700 --> 05:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trade has generally
developed in this country.

05:41.733 --> 05:44.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We actually export 12 or
13 percent of our GDP.

05:44.666 --> 05:46.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was only 5 percent in 1970.

05:46.866 --> 05:48.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But it benefits us.

05:48.100 --> 05:49.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It benefits the
rest of the world.

05:49.566 --> 05:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It doesn't benefit the
steelworker maybe in Ohio.

05:51.933 --> 05:55.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the problem that has
to be addressed, because when
you have something that's good

05:55.666 --> 06:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for society, but terribly
harmful for given individuals,
we have got to make sure those

06:00.233 --> 06:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
individuals are taken care of.

06:02.300 --> 06:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask
you about a couple questions
about markets, investing.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, nobody knows
markets better than you do.

06:08.600 --> 06:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think you said earlier this
year that you weren't worried
that the market was in a bubble,

06:12.300 --> 06:14.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because interest rates
were staying low.

06:14.933 --> 06:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As you know, the Federal Reserve
is starting to raise them.

06:17.433 --> 06:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you still feel the
market is not in a bubble?

06:19.800 --> 06:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, anything
can happen in markets.

06:21.533 --> 06:24.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I bought my first stock in
1942, in the summer of '42.

06:24.766 --> 06:26.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was 11 years old.

06:26.966 --> 06:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so 75 years have gone by.

06:28.966 --> 06:32.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I have never known
what the market's going
to do the next day.

06:32.966 --> 06:35.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's not my game.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My game is to decide whether
I'm in the right economy, which
America's definitely been ever

06:38.700 --> 06:39.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
since that time.

06:39.933 --> 06:44.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Dow has gone from
121000 during that time.

06:46.866 --> 06:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And no matter what the headlines
say, or terrible things are
happening -- we were losing the

06:49.133 --> 06:53.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
war in the Pacific when
I first bought stocks.

06:53.233 --> 06:56.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, America's going
to do fine over time.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
America business is going
to do fine over time.

06:58.766 --> 07:03.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Occasionally, we go off the
tracks with bubbles like -- and
a lot of human error and that

07:04.366 --> 07:05.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sort of thing.

07:05.566 --> 07:07.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But it will never
permanently derail us.

07:07.766 --> 07:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I don't try and guess when
to get in and out of the market.

07:10.233 --> 07:13.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have owned stocks
consistently since 1942.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I owned the -- I was
buying stocks the day
before the election.

07:16.266 --> 07:18.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was buying the same stocks
the day after election.

07:18.666 --> 07:21.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And if Hillary had been
elected, it would have
been the same thing.

07:21.333 --> 07:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does President
Trump deserve credit for what
is going on right now in the

07:25.333 --> 07:27.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
market?

07:27.366 --> 07:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: I -- the
stock market has been going up
basically since March of 2009.

07:32.866 --> 07:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's when it hit the
bottom, very early in March.

07:35.233 --> 07:37.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's been going up more
or less ever since then.

07:37.700 --> 07:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if I ever get elected
president, I will never claim
credit for anything the market

07:40.933 --> 07:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
does, because I don't
want to be blamed when it
goes the other direction.

07:43.300 --> 07:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Your investment
decisions over time have been
remarkably right much of the

07:50.933 --> 07:52.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
time, most of the time.

07:52.966 --> 07:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, as people look at you
and look at the decisions that
you have made, what mainly

07:57.100 --> 07:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
should people take a look at?

07:58.600 --> 08:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: They should
be willing to bet on America.

08:00.766 --> 08:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They shouldn't listen to a lot
of jabbering about what the
market's going to do tomorrow

08:03.433 --> 08:05.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or next week or next month,
because nobody knows.

08:05.900 --> 08:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They should just keep buying
and buying and buying a little
bit of America as they go

08:10.100 --> 08:11.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
along.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And 30 or 40 years from now,
they will have a lot of money.

08:13.666 --> 08:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Berkshire
Hathaway has made a huge
investment in Wells Fargo.

08:15.533 --> 08:17.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: True.

08:17.600 --> 08:21.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you
-- it came up at your
recent shareholders
meeting that Wells Fargo

08:22.433 --> 08:23.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
had problems.

08:23.633 --> 08:25.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They engaged in some...

08:25.166 --> 08:26.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT:
Plenty of problems.

08:26.333 --> 08:28.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
Plenty of problems.

08:28.266 --> 08:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They engaged in some fake
accounts, in millions
of fake accounts.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The leadership of the
company was replaced.

08:32.700 --> 08:34.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: Right.

08:34.766 --> 08:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The critics are
saying, yes, you called them
out, but Berkshire Hathaway

08:39.800 --> 08:42.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
still owns a big
chunk of Wells Fargo.

08:42.766 --> 08:43.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: Sure.

08:43.766 --> 08:45.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sure.

08:45.300 --> 08:46.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
they're saying, is
there a double standard?

08:46.533 --> 08:47.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: It was
a terrible mistake.

08:47.466 --> 08:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They incentivized bad behavior.

08:49.533 --> 08:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Incentives work, but they
work -- you incentivize good
behavior or bad behavior.

08:53.666 --> 08:58.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the problem,
big problem is -- and
sometimes will you -- you
can design an incentive

08:59.966 --> 09:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
system that is incentivizing
the wrong things.

09:01.633 --> 09:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have got to end it, and
end it fast and decisive.

09:04.133 --> 09:06.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, that's where they
made the big mistake.

09:06.200 --> 09:10.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there a clear
line in your mind when behavior
becomes just so unacceptable

09:12.266 --> 09:13.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that you don't want
to have anything to
do with that company?

09:13.766 --> 09:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, it's
a very interesting question.

09:19.433 --> 09:21.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I wouldn't want to
manufacture cigarettes.

09:21.233 --> 09:25.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But if I owned -- we
do own ÑMDNMÑCostco.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do they sell them?

09:27.733 --> 09:29.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I don't have a problem
owning stock in that.

09:31.666 --> 09:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I just wouldn't want to --
I wouldn't want to do it myself.

09:34.366 --> 09:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I basically think, if
anything is sufficiently
antisocial, society
should do something about

09:38.400 --> 09:39.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But that's a separate question.

09:41.366 --> 09:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But -- and I don't think
there's any company that I have
seen that's 100 percent pure.

09:44.900 --> 09:48.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In terms of what I will call
them out for, I will call
individuals out, but generally

09:48.800 --> 09:50.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I would not apply that
to the corporation.

09:50.900 --> 09:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Something that
affects all businesses is the
cost of health care in this

09:54.600 --> 09:55.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: Right.

09:57.033 --> 09:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you
have been vocal about that.

09:59.133 --> 10:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have argued that, right
now, in effect, that the cost
of paying for health care can

10:05.166 --> 10:07.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
affect a company
even more than taxes.

10:07.200 --> 10:11.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, it
does, I mean, in terms of our
competitiveness in the world.

10:11.766 --> 10:16.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Health care in 1960
was 5 percent of GDP.

10:16.366 --> 10:18.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And there's only 100
cents in the dollar.

10:18.133 --> 10:22.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it's gone from 5 cents
-- 5 percent to 17 percent.

10:22.966 --> 10:24.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it keeps going up.

10:24.900 --> 10:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Corporate taxes have gone down
from 4 percent to 2 percent.

10:28.833 --> 10:33.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, corporate taxes are
way less of a factor in
American competitiveness
than -- I'm talking

10:35.066 --> 10:38.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about overall business
-- than medical costs.

10:38.100 --> 10:42.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And as
we sit here today in
Omaha, the Republicans
in Congress are madly

10:42.933 --> 10:47.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trying to figure out what
to do to replace Obamacare,
the Affordable Care Act.

10:47.166 --> 10:49.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: Yes.

10:49.333 --> 10:53.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you
have a firm idea in your
mind of what ought to
be done about Obamacare?

10:54.866 --> 10:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Everybody acknowledges there
have been some problems with it.

10:56.600 --> 10:59.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: I think
that's way outside of
my circle of competence.

10:59.666 --> 11:02.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But I would say this.

11:02.300 --> 11:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can't have that 5 go to
17 and move on to 20 and 22
or 24 percent, because there

11:08.733 --> 11:10.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are only 100 cents in a dollar.

11:10.633 --> 11:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And health care is gobbling up
well over $3 trillion a year.

11:17.600 --> 11:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just about the same
as federal -- the federal
budget is getting up there.

11:23.300 --> 11:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are we now at
the point where the country
does need to think about some

11:25.533 --> 11:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sort of single-payer system
in some form or another?

11:28.233 --> 11:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: With my
limited knowledge, I think that
probably is the best system,

11:34.666 --> 11:37.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because it is a system --
we are such a rich country.

11:37.466 --> 11:39.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In a sense, we can
afford to do it.

11:39.566 --> 11:44.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But in almost every field
of American business, it
pays to bring down costs.

11:46.466 --> 11:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's an awful lot of people
involved in the medical --
the whole -- just the way the

11:49.633 --> 11:53.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ecosystem works, that
there is no incentive
to bring down costs.

11:53.166 --> 11:56.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it
sounds like you're saying,
with a single-payer
system, it would be easier

11:56.166 --> 11:57.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to figure out a way to
get those costs down.

11:57.666 --> 11:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: It would
be more effective, I think.

11:59.733 --> 12:03.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And tune in
tomorrow night for the second
part of my conversation with

12:03.300 --> 12:05.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Warren Buffett.

12:05.333 --> 12:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will look then more at his
own taxes and his views on
tax reform and philanthropy.

12:11.266 --> 12:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Online, you can view Buffett's
very first tax return, filed
when he just 14 years old

12:16.966 --> 12:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for money he earned delivering
newspapers in his then Northwest
Washington, D.C., neighborhood.

12:21.466 --> 12:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.
