02:25.178 --> 02:27.614
IT WAS A REFLEX.

02:27.614 --> 02:28.949
WE DIDN'T THINK.

02:28.949 --> 02:29.983
>> IF THEY HAD BEEN ABLE TO

GET IN, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN

02:31.084 --> 02:32.019
CARNAGE.

03:41.455 --> 03:42.722

03:42.722 --> 03:43.857
"ALTHOUGH WE DON'T KNOW THE

03:43.857 --> 03:45.192
MOTIVE BEHIND THE ATTACK, THERE

03:45.192 --> 03:46.059
ARE FORCES THAT WANT TO HURT

03:46.059 --> 03:46.993
DENMARK'S BELIEF IN RELIGIOUS

03:46.993 --> 03:48.361
FREEDOM."

03:48.361 --> 03:49.763
BUT, SHE SAID, "WE ARE NOT IN A

04:04.678 --> 04:05.612
90 MINUTES BEFORE ITS START

04:05.612 --> 04:06.780
BECAUSE OF WHAT AUTHORITIES

04:06.780 --> 04:07.948

04:20.227 --> 04:22.329
SO THAT MORE EUROPEAN JEWS COULD

04:22.329 --> 04:26.299

05:11.845 --> 05:13.480

05:13.480 --> 05:14.848
EGYPT'S MILITARY.

05:14.848 --> 05:15.982
MORSI COULD BE EXECUTED IF

05:50.917 --> 05:51.818
THE RUSSIANS HAVE A LOT TO

ACCOUNT FOR HERE.

05:52.919 --> 05:53.954
I'M NOT OPTIMISTIC OR

HOUR RANGE, THIS VERY LIGHT

07:23.243 --> 07:24.744
SNOW WILL CONTINUE TO BLOW

07:24.744 --> 07:26.579
AROUND A LOT AND AS A RESULT

07:26.579 --> 07:27.981
ROADS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN

07:27.981 --> 07:28.748
PLOWED RECENTLY WILL START

07:28.748 --> 07:30.116
TO LOOK PRETTY QUICKLY LIKE

07:30.116 --> 07:32.352
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN PLOWED.

07:32.352 --> 07:38.358
>> AND

07:38.358 --> 07:39.059

07:39.059 --> 07:40.226
HARDLY THE ONLY PLACE DEALING

07:40.226 --> 07:41.928
WITH EXTREME WEATHER.

07:41.928 --> 07:42.929
BLIZZARD WARNINGS ARE IN EFFECT

07:54.207 --> 07:54.941
>> THE HIGHEST TEMPERATURE I

07:54.941 --> 07:56.443
CAN SEE IS 26 DEGREES.

07:56.443 --> 07:58.144
THAT IS DISAPPOINTING.

07:58.144 --> 07:58.945
>> THOUSANDS IN THE EAST

07:58.945 --> 08:00.280
HAVE ALREADY LOST POWER

08:00.280 --> 08:07.520
BECAUSE OF HIGH WINDS.

08:07.520 --> 08:10.490
MUCH OF THE MIDWEST ALSO

08:10.490 --> 08:11.424
SUFFERED THROUGH EXTREME COLD

LAST NIGHT AND THIS MORNING.

IMMIGRANTS FROM POSSIBLE

DEPORTATION.

08:32.679 --> 08:39.052
>> CERTAINLY.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.320
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE DID NOT

08:40.320 --> 08:41.287
HAVE A AUTHORITY TO DO WHAT HE

08:41.287 --> 08:41.955
DID.

08:41.955 --> 08:42.722
>> WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF

08:55.668 --> 08:56.636
AND THE FEDERAL AVIATION

08:56.636 --> 08:57.704
ADMINISTRATION TODAY RELEASED

08:57.704 --> 08:58.638
PROPOSED RULES THAT COULD OPEN

08:58.638 --> 08:59.739
UP THE SKIES TO COMMERCIAL DRONE

08:59.739 --> 09:00.807
USE.

09:00.807 --> 09:01.941
THE LONG-AWAITED RULES WOULD

09:01.941 --> 09:03.209
REQUIRE PILOTS TO BE CERTIFIED,

09:03.209 --> 09:04.377
KEEP DRONES WITHIN SIGHT,

09:04.377 --> 09:05.311
OPERATE ONLY IN DAYLIGHT, AND

09:05.311 --> 09:06.413
FLY UNDER 500 FEET.

09:06.413 --> 09:07.213
IT'S EXPECTED TO TAKE ANOTHER

09:07.213 --> 09:07.981
FEW YEARS BEFORE THE RULES ARE

09:07.981 --> 09:10.617
FINALIZED.

09:25.031 --> 09:25.899
234 CANADA 3000 MEMBERS OF

09:25.899 --> 09:26.733
THE TEAMSTERS WENT ON A

09:26.733 --> 09:29.302
STRIKE IN A DISPUTE OVER THE

09:29.302 --> 09:30.904
RAILWAY OVER BENEFITS.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.839
ANALYSTS SAY A PROLONGED

09:32.839 --> 09:36.142
STRIKE WILL DISRUPT THE FLOW

09:36.142 --> 09:37.110
OF THINGS INTO THE UNITED

09:37.110 --> 09:37.610
STATES.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.712
ANOTHER DISPUTE BETWEEN SHIP

09:39.712 --> 09:41.514
OWNER-- SHIP OWNERS AND LONG

09:41.514 --> 09:45.051
SHOREMAN IS IN THIS COUNTRY.

09:45.051 --> 09:45.685
-- THOMAS PEREZ TO

09:45.685 --> 09:47.120
CALIFORNIA TO TRY TO RESOLVE

09:47.120 --> 09:47.387
IT.

09:47.387 --> 09:48.488
FOR MORE ABOUT THIS WE ARE

09:48.488 --> 09:50.156
JOINED FROM LOS ANGELES BY

09:50.156 --> 09:51.124
CHRISTOPHER THORNBERG, HE IS

09:51.124 --> 09:52.826
AN ECONOMIST AND A FOUNDING

09:52.826 --> 09:54.227
PARTNER OF BEACON ECONOMICS.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.762
SO CHRISTOPHER, TELL ME,

09:55.762 --> 09:57.297
WHAT IS AT THE CENTRE OF

09:57.297 --> 09:59.065
THIS DISPUTE AND WHY HAS IT

09:59.065 --> 10:00.066
GONE ON FOR SOMETHING LIKE

10:00.066 --> 10:00.700
NINE MONTHS.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.068
>> WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT,

10:02.068 --> 10:03.470
YOU KNOW, THERE IS A LONG

10:03.470 --> 10:05.171
HISTORY OF TENSION BETWEEN

10:05.171 --> 10:06.539
THE LONG SHOREMEN AND THE

10:06.539 --> 10:07.574
VARIOUS OWNERS OF THE

10:07.574 --> 10:08.741
SHIPPING COMPANIES THAT MOVE

10:08.741 --> 10:09.709
PRODUCTS IN AND OUT OF THOSE

10:09.709 --> 10:10.810
PORTS.

10:10.810 --> 10:12.679
THIS TIME AROUND, THE

10:12.679 --> 10:14.781
CONTRACT WAS UP FOR RENEWAL.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.149
THOSE NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BEEN

10:16.149 --> 10:16.816
CARRYING ON.

10:16.816 --> 10:18.184
I KNOW THE WORKERS AT THE

10:18.184 --> 10:19.552
PORT HAVE BEEN WORKING UNDER

10:19.552 --> 10:20.920
THE OLD EXPIRED CONTRACT FOR

10:20.920 --> 10:22.956
A NUMBER OF MONTHS.

10:22.956 --> 10:23.623
CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS

10:23.623 --> 10:24.624
HAVEN'T BEEN GOING VERY

10:24.624 --> 10:25.325
FAST.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.092
AND AS A RESULT OF THAT,

10:26.092 --> 10:27.360
THERE HAS BEEN KIND OF THIS,

10:27.360 --> 10:29.462
IF YOU WILL, GUERRILLA

10:29.462 --> 10:31.097
ACTION GOING ON BETWEEN BOTH

10:31.097 --> 10:32.866
PARTIES, SOMEWHAT OF A WORK

10:32.866 --> 10:35.301
SLOWDOWN BY ONE SIDE OF THE

10:35.301 --> 10:36.336
EQUATION AND OF COURSE THESE

10:36.336 --> 10:37.871
KIND OF WEEKEND LONG

10:37.871 --> 10:38.705
LONGOUTS ON THE OTHER SIDE

10:38.705 --> 10:39.339
OF IT.

10:39.339 --> 10:40.740
AND OVERALL THE TENSIONS ARE

10:40.740 --> 10:41.908
GETTING HOTTER AND HOTTER.

10:41.908 --> 10:42.809
>> Stewart: WHAT IS THE

10:42.809 --> 10:43.643
FIGHT ABOUT?

10:43.643 --> 10:45.178
>> JUST THE SAME OLD, RIGHT.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.613
WAGES AND BENEFITS.

10:46.613 --> 10:48.114
THE PORT WORKERS ARE LOOKING

10:48.114 --> 10:50.416
TO REALLY INCREASE SOME OF

10:50.416 --> 10:51.551
THE BENEFITS THEY'RE GETTING

10:51.551 --> 10:52.385
RIGHT NOW.

10:52.385 --> 10:53.920
AND AT THE SAME TIME WE FOE

10:53.920 --> 10:55.622
THAT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE

10:55.622 --> 10:57.123
CONTINUES TO ALTER

10:57.123 --> 10:58.558
OPERATIONS AT THE PORT AND

10:58.558 --> 10:59.592
THEY'RE FIGHTING VERY HARD

10:59.592 --> 11:01.694
TO TRY AND MAINTAIN THE

11:01.694 --> 11:02.729
OVERALL LEVEL OF THE

11:02.729 --> 11:04.430
EMPLOYMENT AT THOSE PORTS.

11:04.430 --> 11:05.198
>> Stewart: THUS FAR W WHO

11:05.198 --> 11:06.366
HAS BEEN MOST AFFECTED BY

11:06.366 --> 11:08.635
THIS SLOWDOWN BUSINESS

11:08.635 --> 11:09.269
FUTURE-- DISPUTE AND IF IT

11:09.269 --> 11:10.637
GOES ON WHO WILL BE MOST

11:10.637 --> 11:11.704
AFFECTED.

11:11.704 --> 11:13.406
>> WHEN YOU SIT DOWN AND

11:13.406 --> 11:14.374
LOOK AT WHAT HAS BEEN

11:14.374 --> 11:15.208
HAPPENING AT THE PORTS IN

11:15.208 --> 11:16.476
TERMS OF CONTAINERS MOVING

11:16.476 --> 11:18.011
IN AND OUT, WHILE THERE ARE

11:18.011 --> 11:19.546
THESE DELAY, THE OVERALL

11:19.546 --> 11:20.647
VOLUME HASN'T DROPPED BY

11:20.647 --> 11:21.981
VERY MUCH AT ALL, TO BE

11:21.981 --> 11:22.949
PERFECTLY HONEST BY THE

11:22.949 --> 11:24.284
NUMBERS WE HAVE BEEN SEEING.

11:24.284 --> 11:24.984
>> Stewart: WHAT ABOUT

11:24.984 --> 11:26.352
FARMERS IN THE MIDWEST OR

11:26.352 --> 11:27.153
TRUCKERS?

11:27.153 --> 11:28.154
WOULDN'T THIS AFFECT THEIR

11:28.154 --> 11:28.721
LIVELIHOOD?

11:28.721 --> 11:29.822
>> AT SOME LEVEL.

11:29.822 --> 11:31.190
BUT REMEMBER A LOT OF

11:31.190 --> 11:32.592
FARMERS HAVE ALTERNATIVE

11:32.592 --> 11:34.294
WAYS OF GETTING THEIR CROPS,

11:34.294 --> 11:35.595
WE SAY OUT AND ABOUT.

11:35.595 --> 11:36.529
>> Stewart: RIGHT NOW THERE

11:36.529 --> 11:37.730
ARE 29 PORTS AFFECTED FROM

11:37.730 --> 11:39.065
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CALL UP TO

11:39.065 --> 11:39.933
WASHINGTON STATE.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.534
AND THE BACKLOG HAS BEEN ITS

11:41.534 --> 11:42.869
WORST IN THE PAST WEEK SINCE

11:42.869 --> 11:43.836
THIS WHOLE THING STARTED.

11:43.836 --> 11:45.538
SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR

11:45.538 --> 11:46.606
AN AVERAGE CONSUMER?

11:46.606 --> 11:47.640
>> NOT MUCH AT THIS

11:47.640 --> 11:49.008
PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME.

11:49.008 --> 11:51.177
YOU KNOW, I REALIZE THAT

11:51.177 --> 11:52.178
IT'S EASY TO MAKE BIG NEWS

11:52.178 --> 11:53.212
ABOUT THESE PORTS.

11:53.212 --> 11:54.314
YOU HEAR ALL THE RHETORIC

11:54.314 --> 11:56.282
ABOUT THESE BEING AN

11:56.282 --> 11:57.483
IMPORTANT, ALMOST, IF YOU

11:57.483 --> 12:00.053
WILL, AN ARTERY OF THE U.S.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.454
ECONOMY AND IF IT GETS CUT

12:01.454 --> 12:02.488
OFF WE ALMOST THINK ABOUT

12:02.488 --> 12:04.924
THE BODY ECONOMY BLEEDING

12:04.924 --> 12:06.259
OUT AS THE CASE MAY BE.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.594
BUT THOSE KIND OF VIEWS ARE

12:07.594 --> 12:08.928
HIGHLY OVERSTATED.

12:08.928 --> 12:10.697
GO TO YOUR LOCAL SUPERMARKET,

12:10.697 --> 12:11.798
GO TO YOUR LOCAL DEPARTMENT

12:11.798 --> 12:13.399
STORE, THE SHELVES ARE

12:13.399 --> 12:14.434
STUFFED WITH PRODUCTS AND

12:14.434 --> 12:14.767
GOODS.

12:14.767 --> 12:15.868
NOBODY IN THE UNITED STATES

12:15.868 --> 12:18.104
IS BEING DENIED ANY KIND OF

12:18.104 --> 12:18.838
CONSUMPTION CHOICE AS A

12:18.838 --> 12:20.707
RESULT OF THESE DISRUPTIONS.

12:20.707 --> 12:22.275
AND CANDIDLY IT WOULD TAKE A

12:22.275 --> 12:23.543
VERY LONG TIME FOR THAT TO

12:23.543 --> 12:24.243
HAPPEN.

12:24.243 --> 12:25.812
THE PORTS ARE A CHEAP AND

12:25.812 --> 12:27.380
CONVENIENT WAY OF MOVING

12:27.380 --> 12:28.715
PRODUCT IN AND OUT OF THE

12:28.715 --> 12:29.716
UNITED STATES BUT THEY ARE

12:29.716 --> 12:30.750
NOT THE ONLY WAY.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.051
YOU CAN WHEEL STUFF THROUGH

12:32.051 --> 12:32.852
CANADA OR MENTION QUO.

12:32.852 --> 12:33.886
YOU COULD SHIP IT TO THE

12:33.886 --> 12:35.855
EAST COAST, PUT IT ON A

12:35.855 --> 12:36.889
PLANE THERE ARE PLENTY OF

12:36.889 --> 12:38.324
WAYS OF MOVING PRODUCT IN

12:38.324 --> 12:38.925
AND OUT.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.593
THIS MAY BE A HASSLE AND

12:40.593 --> 12:42.729
INDEED EVEN A FINANCIAL HIT

12:42.729 --> 12:43.896
FOR SOME COMPANIES.

12:43.896 --> 12:45.465
BUT ON THE MACRO SORT OF

12:45.465 --> 12:46.799
LEVEL WHERE WE LOOK AT THE

12:46.799 --> 12:48.101
WINNERS AND THE LOSERS,

12:48.101 --> 12:49.235
OVERALL IT DOESN'T REALLY

12:49.235 --> 12:50.603
MEAN THAT MUCH FOR THE U.S.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.704
ECONOMY OR EVEN HERE IN

12:51.704 --> 12:53.239
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, AS IT

12:53.239 --> 12:54.374
MAY BE.

12:54.374 --> 12:55.375
>> Stewart: CHRISTOPHER

12:55.375 --> 12:56.409
THORNBERG, THANK YOU SO MUCH

12:56.409 --> 12:59.112
FOR SHARING YOUR ANALYSIS.

12:59.112 --> 13:07.387
>> MY PLEASURE.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.588
>> Stewart: AND NOW TO OUR

13:08.588 --> 13:09.956
SIGNATURE SEGMENT, OUR ORIGINAL

13:09.956 --> 13:10.790
IN-DEPTH REPORTS FROM AROUND THE

13:10.790 --> 13:12.325
NATION AND AROUND THE WORLD.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.327
EACH YEAR, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

13:14.327 --> 13:16.396
OF TROPICAL FISH ARE COLLECTED

13:16.396 --> 13:17.664
IN THE WATERS OFF HAWAII AND

13:17.664 --> 13:18.464
SHIPPED TO PET STORES AROUND THE

13:18.464 --> 13:19.532
WORLD.

13:19.532 --> 13:20.233
THEY ARE ULTIMATELY SOLD TO

13:20.233 --> 13:22.368
AQUARIUM OWNERS.

13:22.368 --> 13:23.536
BUT FOR SOME TIME NOW, THE

13:23.536 --> 13:24.737
PRACTICE HAS COME UNDER FIRE BY

13:24.737 --> 13:27.473
ENVIRONMENTALISTS IN THAT STATE

13:27.473 --> 13:28.274
AND NEW PROPOSED LEGISLATION

13:28.274 --> 13:29.475
COULD SPELL THE END OF THE

13:29.475 --> 13:30.843
INDUSTRY.

13:30.843 --> 13:32.111
NEWSHOUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

13:41.187 --> 13:42.755
MINIATURE WORKS OF LIVING ART

13:42.755 --> 13:43.856
THAT CAN THRIVE AND ENTERTAIN

13:43.856 --> 13:48.061
FOR YEARS.

13:48.061 --> 13:48.828
THEY'RE KOLES, LONGNOSE

BUTTERFLIES, AND A VARIETY OF

13:52.131 --> 13:52.899
IN THE 2003 ANIMATED HIT FINDING

13:52.899 --> 13:54.634
NEMO.

13:54.634 --> 13:55.568
>> LOOK, SOMETHING SHINY!

13:55.568 --> 13:58.938
>> WHERE?

13:58.938 --> 14:00.206
>> Reporter: TODAY, THERE ARE

14:00.206 --> 14:01.808
TENS OF MILLIONS OF TROPICAL

14:01.808 --> 14:03.042
REEF FISH LIVING IN MORE THAN

14:03.042 --> 14:04.243
TWO MILLION SALTWATER TANKS IN

14:04.243 --> 14:06.579
HOMES AND RESTAURANTS AND

14:06.579 --> 14:08.448
CORPORATE LOBBIES ACROSS THE

14:08.448 --> 14:09.782
WORLD, THE MAJORITY IN THE U.S.,

14:09.782 --> 14:10.917
AND, OF COURSE, IN BIG AQUARIUMS

14:10.917 --> 14:13.286
OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.721
BUT BEFORE ANY OF THESE FISH END

14:14.721 --> 14:16.255
UP HERE, SOMEONE HAS TO GO OUT

14:16.255 --> 14:19.058
AND CATCH THEM, AS THEY DO HERE

14:19.058 --> 14:21.060
IN THE AQUARIUM FISHERY OFF OF

14:21.060 --> 14:22.195
THE WEST COAST OF THE BIG ISLAND

14:22.195 --> 14:23.396
OF HAWAI'I.

14:23.396 --> 14:24.464
IT'S THE RICHEST SUCH FISHERY

14:24.464 --> 14:30.503
ANYWHERE IN US WATERS.

14:30.503 --> 14:31.604
66-YEAR-OLD TONY NAHACKY AND HIS

14:31.604 --> 14:32.805
PARTNER LUCIANO PERINO ARE AMONG

14:32.805 --> 14:34.006
THE MORE THAN FOUR DOZEN OR SO

14:34.006 --> 14:35.074
COLLECTORS WHO HAVE STATE

14:35.074 --> 14:36.375
PERMITS TO TAKE REEF FISH.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.477
THEY HAVE BEEN AT IT FOR

14:37.477 --> 14:38.778
DECADES.

14:38.778 --> 14:40.346
AND THEY'RE NOT JUST COLLECTORS;

14:40.346 --> 14:41.481
THEY SELECT, PREPARE AND SHIP

14:41.481 --> 14:42.682
THE CATCH OF OTHER AQUARIUM

14:42.682 --> 14:44.350
FISHERMEN AS WELL.

14:44.350 --> 14:46.152
>> I LOVE AQUARIUMS.

14:46.152 --> 14:47.553
I STILL HELP PEOPLE WITH THEIR

14:47.553 --> 14:48.955
AQUARIUMS.

14:48.955 --> 14:51.824
THEY LOVE THEIR AQUARIUMS JUST

14:51.824 --> 14:53.159
THE WAY PEOPLE, LIKE, LOVE THEIR

14:53.159 --> 14:54.360
DOGS, LOVE THEIR CATS, LOVE

14:54.360 --> 14:56.162
OTHER PETS, YOU KNOW?

14:56.162 --> 14:57.663
>> Reporter: THIS LOVE AFFAIR,

14:57.663 --> 14:58.765
THOUGH, IS NOT ROOTED IN

14:58.765 --> 15:00.233
HAWAIIAN HISTORY OR CULTURE, AND

15:00.233 --> 15:02.835
IT'S HARDLY UNIVERSALLY CHEERED.

15:02.835 --> 15:04.470
ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS LIKE

15:04.470 --> 15:06.439
SCUBA INSTRUCTOR RENE UMBERGER

15:06.439 --> 15:07.774
HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR YEARS TO

15:07.774 --> 15:09.442
GET THE AQUARIUM FISHERY BANNED

15:09.442 --> 15:10.543
OUTRIGHT.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.512
>> OBVIOUSLY, IT'S DESTRUCTIVE.

15:12.512 --> 15:13.346
>> Reporter: AND YOU WANT IT OUT

15:13.346 --> 15:15.982
OF BUSINESS?

15:15.982 --> 15:17.450
>> I WANT IT ALL GONE, NOT JUST

15:17.450 --> 15:19.452
HAWAII.

15:19.452 --> 15:20.586
>> Reporter: BUT IN HAWAII THE

15:20.586 --> 15:22.455
DEBATE OVER AQUARIUM COLLECTING

15:22.455 --> 15:23.923
HAS REACHED A FLASH POINT.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.258
LAST MAY, UMBERGER WAS

15:25.258 --> 15:26.526
DOCUMENTING FISH COLLECTING AND

15:26.526 --> 15:28.427
POSSIBLE DAMAGE TO THE REEFS AS

15:28.427 --> 15:30.863
PART OF A TEAM ORGANIZED BY THE

15:30.863 --> 15:32.298
ECO-ACTIVIST GROUP SEA SHEPHERD

15:32.298 --> 15:34.700
WHEN SHE SAYS SHE WAS SUDDENLY

15:34.700 --> 15:35.701
RUSHED BY ONE OF THE COLLECTORS

15:35.701 --> 15:37.804
50 FEET BELOW THE SURFACE.

15:37.804 --> 15:41.073
WE REVIEWED THE VIDEO WITH HER.

15:41.073 --> 15:43.943
>> THIS ONE SEES ME, AND STARTS

15:43.943 --> 15:47.847
CHARGING, RIPS OUT MY AIR.

15:47.847 --> 15:49.282
>> Reporter: AND THAT'S YOUR

15:49.282 --> 15:52.585
CAMERA?

15:52.585 --> 15:53.419
>> THAT WAS MY CAMERA SO IT'S

15:53.419 --> 15:54.220
ALL TOPSY TURVY BECAUSE I'M

15:54.220 --> 15:55.555
DISORIENTED, TRYING TO FIND MY

15:55.555 --> 16:00.893
AIR.

16:00.893 --> 16:02.995
>> Reporter: THE VIDEO WAS

16:02.995 --> 16:04.297
WIDELY SEEN IN T.V. NEWS

16:04.297 --> 16:05.898
REPORTS, AND FOCUSED ATTENTION

16:05.898 --> 16:07.266
ONCE MORE ON AN ISSUE THAT'S

16:07.266 --> 16:08.534
BEEN CONTROVERSIAL IN HAWAII FOR

16:08.534 --> 16:09.702
YEARS: THE IMPACT OF THE

16:09.702 --> 16:12.271
AQUARIUM FISHERY ON HAWAII'S

16:12.271 --> 16:13.873
LIVING REEFS, ON THE POPULAR

16:13.873 --> 16:14.841
FISH SPECIES THAT CALL THOSE

16:14.841 --> 16:16.509
REEFS HOME, AND ON HAWAII'S

16:16.509 --> 16:19.378
BIGGEST INDUSTRY: TOURISM.

16:19.378 --> 16:20.580
DR. BILL WALSH, A STATE MARINE

16:20.580 --> 16:22.949
BIOLOGIST, IS A DEFENDER OF THE

16:22.949 --> 16:24.083
WAY HAWAII HAS MANAGED THE

16:24.083 --> 16:26.185
FISHERY.

16:26.185 --> 16:27.119
>> THE NUMBER OF COLLECTORS HAS

16:27.119 --> 16:28.454
INCREASED OVER THAT PERIOD OF

16:28.454 --> 16:29.288
TIME.

16:29.288 --> 16:30.356
THE NUMBER OF FISH BEING TAKEN

16:30.356 --> 16:31.824
OUT AND THE NUMBER OF FISH

16:31.824 --> 16:32.892
PRESENT ON THE REEF HAVE

16:32.892 --> 16:33.926
INCREASED.

16:33.926 --> 16:35.094
SO IT'S A REALLY POWERFUL

16:35.094 --> 16:36.195
STATEMENT THAT THINGS ARE

16:36.195 --> 16:38.064
WORKING.

16:38.064 --> 16:39.198
>> Reporter: IT'S BEEN WORKING,

16:39.198 --> 16:41.634
WALSH SAYS, SINCE 1999, WHEN IN

16:41.634 --> 16:42.935
RESPONSE TO STUDIES SHOWING

16:42.935 --> 16:44.604
SEVERAL SPECIES OF REEF FISH

16:44.604 --> 16:47.106
WERE BEING SEVERELY DEPLETED,

16:47.106 --> 16:48.674
HAWAII CLOSED AROUND A THIRD OF

16:48.674 --> 16:50.076
THE KONA COAST TO COLLECTORS,

16:50.076 --> 16:51.577
ESTABLISHING "FISH REPLENISHMENT

16:51.577 --> 16:52.945
AREAS" WHILE THE REST OF THE

16:52.945 --> 16:54.480
COAST REMAINED OPEN TO FISH

16:54.480 --> 16:56.349
COLLECTION.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.717
AND TWO YEARS AGO, IN THE OPEN

16:57.717 --> 16:59.819
AREAS, ANOTHER KEY STEP: THE

16:59.819 --> 17:01.587
STATE LIMITED THE NUMBER OF

17:01.587 --> 17:03.022
ORNAMENTAL SPECIES THAT COULD BE

17:03.022 --> 17:06.058
TAKEN FROM HUNDREDS TO JUST 40.

17:06.058 --> 17:07.793
THE RESULTS?

17:07.793 --> 17:09.629
DR. WALSH SAYS EXTENSIVE SURVEYS

17:09.629 --> 17:11.564
SHOW FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE

17:11.564 --> 17:12.899
NUMBERS OF YELLOW TANG, BY FAR

17:12.899 --> 17:14.901
THE MOST POPULAR SPECIES TAKEN,

17:14.901 --> 17:16.168
ARE WAY UP OVERALL IN THE PAST

17:16.168 --> 17:17.570
15 YEARS.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.138
OPPONENTS EMPHASIZE THAT IN THE

17:19.138 --> 17:20.673
AREAS OPEN TO COLLECTING, THERE

17:20.673 --> 17:22.975
ARE STILL MANY FEWER YELLOW

17:22.975 --> 17:25.011
TANGS THAN IN THE CLOSED AREAS.

17:25.011 --> 17:26.979
AT THIS POINT IN THIS LONG

17:26.979 --> 17:28.514
RUNNING CONTROVERSY THERE ARE

17:28.514 --> 17:29.415
STILL FEW FACTS THAT ARE NOT IN

17:29.415 --> 17:30.516
DISPUTE.

17:30.516 --> 17:31.651
BUT IT IS NOW LESS ABOUT THOSE

17:31.651 --> 17:35.554
FACTS, DISPUTED OR OTHERWISE,

17:35.554 --> 17:36.756
THAN IT IS ABOUT THE STUBBORNLY

17:36.756 --> 17:37.657
OPPOSING ANSWERS TO A SINGLE

17:37.657 --> 17:38.758
QUESTION: SHOULD THERE BE AN

17:38.758 --> 17:40.393
AQUARIUM FISHERY AT ALL?

17:40.393 --> 17:43.095
>> THIS IS WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING

17:43.095 --> 17:44.530
FOR THE PET TRADE.

17:44.530 --> 17:45.631
>> Reporter: BUT THAT'S A

17:45.631 --> 17:47.667
DISTANCE LINGUISTICALLY THAT

17:47.667 --> 17:49.035
YOU'RE SIDE HAS BEEN WILLING TO

17:49.035 --> 17:49.702
GO.

17:49.702 --> 17:50.536
>> YES.

17:50.536 --> 17:51.337
>> Reporter: A "TRAFFICKER"--

17:51.337 --> 17:52.271
THAT'S A WORD THAT'S LADEN WITH

17:52.271 --> 17:53.105
MEANING-- HUMAN TRAFFICKERS,

17:53.105 --> 17:54.307
DRUG TRAFFICKERS.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.641
>> YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

17:55.641 --> 17:56.709
>> Reporter: AND SHE'S NOT ALONE

17:56.709 --> 17:57.877
IN HER OPPOSITION TO AQUARIUM

17:57.877 --> 17:59.045
COLLECTING.

17:59.045 --> 18:00.146
NATIVE HAWAIIANS LIKE WILLIE

18:00.146 --> 18:01.514
KAUPIKO AND HIS SON KAIMI HAVE

18:01.514 --> 18:02.682
LINED UP FIRMLY AGAINST THE REEF

18:02.682 --> 18:04.216
COLLECTORS, SAYING FROM THEIR

18:04.216 --> 18:05.618
FISHING VILLAGE OF MILOLII THAT

18:05.618 --> 18:07.186
THAT KIND OF FISHING HAS NO

18:07.186 --> 18:08.354
PLACE IN THEIR HISTORY OR

18:08.354 --> 18:09.822
TRADITIONS.

18:09.822 --> 18:10.823
>> YOU KNOW, WHATEVER YOU TAKE,

18:10.823 --> 18:12.291
YOU'RE GONNA EAT.

18:12.291 --> 18:13.492
>> Reporter: ONLY FISH FOR FOOD,

18:13.492 --> 18:14.493
YOU'RE SAYING?

18:14.493 --> 18:15.661
>> YES, YES, WE DON'T PLAY WITH

18:15.661 --> 18:18.064
THE FISH.

18:18.064 --> 18:19.265
THE OCEAN WAS OUR ICE BOX AS

18:19.265 --> 18:21.300
WELL AS OUR GARDEN, AND WE NEED

18:21.300 --> 18:23.235
TO PROTECT THE RESOURCES AND THE

18:23.235 --> 18:25.438
OCEAN.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.238
>> THEY BELONG ON THE REEF.

18:26.238 --> 18:27.606
THAT'S WHERE THEY BELONG.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.308
AND THEY ARE PART OF OUR FAMILY,

18:29.308 --> 18:30.309
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

18:30.309 --> 18:32.912
THEY ARE PART OF US.

18:32.912 --> 18:34.180
>> Reporter: WHILE OPINIONS CAN

18:34.180 --> 18:35.147
DIFFER ON THIS ISSUE, AS THEY DO

18:35.147 --> 18:36.749
ABOUT SPORTFISHING AND HUNTING,

18:36.749 --> 18:38.351
AND ABOUT COLLECTING OTHER KINDS

18:38.351 --> 18:39.618
OF PETS, DR. WALSH SAYS THIS IS

18:39.618 --> 18:41.821
A LEGITIMATE AND INCREASINGLY

18:41.821 --> 18:43.222
IMPORTANT FISHERY, AND THAT HE'S

18:43.222 --> 18:44.657
FRUSTRATED AT AN OPPOSITION HE

18:44.657 --> 18:47.426
SAYS IS BASED ON MISINFORMATION.

18:47.426 --> 18:50.329
>> WHY IS THE AQUARIUM FISHERY

18:50.329 --> 18:51.864
SO EGREGIOUS COMPARED TO OTHER

18:51.864 --> 18:53.699
THINGS THAT WE DO?

18:53.699 --> 18:55.601
AND A LOT OF IT IS BECAUSE YOU

18:55.601 --> 18:56.635
GET SOME PEOPLE JUST KINDA

18:56.635 --> 18:59.071
WHIPPING UP THIS FRENZY OF

18:59.071 --> 19:00.439
ENMITY TOWARDS THE FISHERY,

19:00.439 --> 19:03.743
WITHOUT REALLY RELYING ON SOLID

19:03.743 --> 19:05.678
INFORMATION.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.013
>> Reporter: NOW THE DEBATE HAS

19:07.013 --> 19:08.681
TAKEN ANOTHER NEW TURN THAT

19:08.681 --> 19:10.449
COULD SPELL THE END OF THIS

19:10.449 --> 19:11.717
FISHERY, COLLECTORS SAY.

19:11.717 --> 19:13.419
>> EVIDENCE SHOWS DEATH WITHIN

19:13.419 --> 19:14.920
THE SUPPLY CHAIN FROM REEF TO

19:14.920 --> 19:19.091

19:25.364 --> 19:26.766
SHIPPED IN AT LEAST A GALLON OF

19:26.766 --> 19:28.267
WATER AND WOULD PROHIBIT"

WITHHOLDING FOOD FROM AQUARIUM

19:29.535 --> 19:30.970
LIFE FOR MORE THAN 24 HOURS."

19:30.970 --> 19:32.338
AND NOW THE HAWAII STATE

19:32.338 --> 19:33.773
LEGISLATURE IS CONSIDERING

19:33.773 --> 19:34.874
SEVERAL OTHER BILLS THAT WOULD

19:34.874 --> 19:38.177
BAN OR PLACE RESTRICTIONS ON HOW

19:38.177 --> 19:38.978
THESE FISH ARE COLLECTED AND

19:38.978 --> 19:41.514
SHIPPED.

19:41.514 --> 19:42.848
TONY NAHACKY, AS BOTH A

19:42.848 --> 19:44.483
FISHERMAN AND A SHIPPER WITH

19:44.483 --> 19:46.152
NEARLY FIVE DECADES' EXPERIENCE,

19:46.152 --> 19:47.119
SAYS HE WORRIES THE CHANGES

19:47.119 --> 19:47.987
COULD BE ECONOMICALLY FATAL TO

19:47.987 --> 19:49.755
FISHERMEN.

19:49.755 --> 19:50.790
>> Reporter: YOU COULDN'T DO

19:50.790 --> 19:54.560
BUSINESS THAT WAY?

19:54.560 --> 19:55.694
>> WE COULDN'T DO BUSINESS IN

19:55.694 --> 19:57.463
THE MANNER THAT WE DO.

19:57.463 --> 19:58.564
>> Reporter: HE SHOWED US HOW

19:58.564 --> 19:59.698
HIS SUPPLY CHAIN WORKS.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.133
FIRST, THERE'S THE ACTUAL

20:01.133 --> 20:02.501
COLLECTING ALONG THE REEF--

20:02.501 --> 20:03.569
INDIVIDUAL FISH CHOSEN BY SIZE,

20:03.569 --> 20:05.671
SPECIES, AND DESIRABILITY AND

20:05.671 --> 20:08.674
TAKEN BY HAND USING NETS.

20:08.674 --> 20:10.709
IN THE WAREHOUSE THEY'RE BAGGED

20:10.709 --> 20:13.112
AND SEALED-- THIS THREE-INCH

20:13.112 --> 20:14.113
FISH IN ABOUT A PINT OF

20:14.113 --> 20:17.583
OXYGENATED WATER.

20:17.583 --> 20:18.417
A GALLON, AS SOME LEGISLATION

20:18.417 --> 20:19.452
WOULD REQUIRE, COULD INCREASE

20:19.452 --> 20:20.286
SHIPPING COSTS EIGHT-FOLD,

20:20.286 --> 20:21.587
NAHACKY ESTIMATES.

20:21.587 --> 20:23.089
SOME FISH, LIKE THIS NASO TANG,

20:23.089 --> 20:24.690
HAVE THEIR BLADDERS SQUEEZED SO

20:24.690 --> 20:25.891
AS NOT TO FOUL THEIR SHIPPING

20:25.891 --> 20:27.693
WATER WITH WASTE, A DANGER

20:27.693 --> 20:29.829
NAHACKY ALSO SAYS WOULD BE

20:29.829 --> 20:31.430
IMPOSED BY FEEDING REQUIREMENTS.

20:31.430 --> 20:32.531
AFTER BEING COLLECTED,

20:32.531 --> 20:34.400
ACCLIMATED, SELECTED AND PACKED

20:34.400 --> 20:36.836
FOR SHIPMENT, THESE FISH ARE

20:36.836 --> 20:38.737
HEADED TO PARIS AND TO WHOLESALE

20:38.737 --> 20:40.239
DISTRIBUTORS THROUGHOUT EUROPE.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.440
FROM THE OCEAN TO THOSE

20:41.440 --> 20:42.475
WHOLESALERS' TANKS: PERHAPS TEN

20:42.475 --> 20:43.742
DAYS.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.711
NAHACKY SAYS THAT OF THE 8,000
