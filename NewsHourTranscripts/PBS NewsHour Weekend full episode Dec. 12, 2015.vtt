02:02.389 --> 02:03.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

COMES TO REDUCING CARBON FROM

02:10.263 --> 02:11.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THEY'RE ALL PLEASANTLY SURPRISED

02:32.319 --> 02:33.920 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT HOW AMBITIOUS THE

AGREEMENT TURNED OUT TO BE.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.090 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WAS REALLY NOT MUCH

02:37.090 --> 02:39.326 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WATERING DOWN AT THE END OF THE

02:39.326 --> 02:40.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEGOTIATIONS.

02:40.193 --> 02:42.295 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN FACT, IN SOME WAYS, THE

02:42.295 --> 02:44.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGREEMENT MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN MORE

02:44.164 --> 02:44.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGOROUS.

02:44.765 --> 02:47.801 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, EVERYBODY IS REALLY PLEASED.

02:47.801 --> 02:48.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: LAST WEEK,

02:48.735 --> 02:49.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN WE SPOKE, WE SAID ONE OF

02:49.736 --> 02:52.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MAJOR HURDLES WAS THE

02:52.239 --> 02:53.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAYMENT SCHEME.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.075 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT ARE THE RICH COUNTRIES, THE

02:55.075 --> 02:56.410 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEVELOPED COUNTRIES RESPONSIBLE

02:56.410 --> 02:57.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR?

02:57.010 --> 02:57.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT ARE THE DEVELOPING

02:57.944 --> 02:59.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRIES LIKE INDIA AND CHINA

02:59.146 --> 03:00.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESPONSIBLE FOR?

03:00.514 --> 03:01.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND YOU SAID AT THE TIME THERE

03:01.915 --> 03:03.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE LOTS OF BRACKETS, THINGS TO

03:03.183 --> 03:03.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE DETERMINED.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT?

03:05.318 --> 03:06.186 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: THIS IS ONE AREA

03:06.186 --> 03:07.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE I THINK THERE WAS A LITTLE

03:07.354 --> 03:08.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIT OF WATERING DOWN.

03:08.488 --> 03:12.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES HAVE

03:12.259 --> 03:14.027 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AVOIDED ANY KIND OF LEGAL

03:14.027 --> 03:17.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REQUIREMENT TO PAY THIS MONEY TO

03:17.664 --> 03:18.932 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

03:18.932 --> 03:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS A

03:19.966 --> 03:20.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RED LINE FOR THE U.S. IN

03:20.967 --> 03:22.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTICULAR BECAUSE THEY DON'T

03:22.502 --> 03:24.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WANT TO HAVE TO BRING THIS

03:24.704 --> 03:26.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGREEMENT TO BE RATIFIED BY THE

03:26.239 --> 03:28.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. SENATE, WHERE REPUBLICANS

03:28.442 --> 03:30.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY BLOCK IT.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, ANY KIND OF LEGAL OBLIGATION

03:32.612 --> 03:33.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WOULD INVOLVE A

03:33.647 --> 03:35.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONGRESSIONAL APPROPRIATION TO

03:35.182 --> 03:39.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FUND THESE KINDS OF SCHEMES WAS

03:39.619 --> 03:42.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUSHED ASIDE, LARGELY AT THE

03:42.155 --> 03:43.590 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REQUEST OF THE U.S. AND A FEW

03:43.590 --> 03:45.425 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES.

03:45.425 --> 03:47.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ESCAPED

03:47.527 --> 03:50.163 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANY KIND OF REQUIREMENT TO FUND

03:50.163 --> 03:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANY OF THE POOREST NATIONS ON

03:53.800 --> 03:55.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR OWN.

03:55.168 --> 03:57.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WAS SOME TALK-- THE

03:57.070 --> 03:58.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEVELOPED COUNTRIES REALLY WANT

03:58.171 --> 04:00.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS-- TO HAVE A COUNTRY LIKE

04:00.507 --> 04:03.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHINA, WHICH IS A WEALTHY,

04:03.210 --> 04:04.711 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:07.180 --> 04:08.482 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROVIDE MONEY AS A LEGAL

04:08.482 --> 04:10.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REQUIREMENT UNDER THIS

04:10.484 --> 04:11.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGREEMENT.

04:11.518 --> 04:13.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT WAS-- THAT WAS PUSHED

04:13.353 --> 04:14.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASIDE, AS WELL.

17:37.156 --> 17:38.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THEY DECIDED TO CROWDSOURCE

TERRORISM.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.560 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE HOOK THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA,

17:58.210 --> 17:59.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT THEY WOULD DO IS OFTEN TAKE

17:59.845 --> 18:03.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

RADICAL... RADICALIZATION.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHILE THEIR SUCCESS RATE IS

18:17.463 --> 18:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY SMALL, ALL IT TAKES IS A

18:20.066 --> 18:21.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER TO POSE

18:21.968 --> 18:23.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TODAY TO SPREAD IDEAS.

18:31.978 --> 18:34.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW DO YOU STOP SOMEONE FROM

18:37.083 --> 18:38.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TO FOCUS ON THE SOLUTION.

18:43.689 --> 18:45.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DON'T WANT THEIR BUSINESSES

USED BY TERRORISM.

18:47.159 --> 18:48.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SEXUAL PREDATORS.

20:28.260 --> 20:28.994 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THEIR PHONES ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

20:37.603 --> 20:39.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY

20:41.073 --> 20:42.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT BEFORE SOMEONE WOULD BECOME

ONLINE.

20:57.289 --> 20:57.857 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

21:58.417 --> 22:00.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO, I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO

22:00.085 --> 22:01.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO IS HAVE A BALANCE BETWEEN

22:10.963 --> 22:12.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WE CAN AND HAVE DONE BOTH.

22:12.231 --> 22:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR NOW

22:14.200 --> 22:15.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN PARTNERSHIP IS SAYING, "LOOK,

22:32.918 --> 22:33.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEED THE COMPANY TO BE ABLE TO

22:33.619 --> 22:34.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
