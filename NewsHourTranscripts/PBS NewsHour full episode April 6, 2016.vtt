JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I
am Judy Woodruff.
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:07.808 --> 00:13.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Wisconsin's primary
sets a potential turning point
in the presidential

00:14.014 --> 00:18.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
race, as both party's
front-runners are handed
a loss.

00:18.552 --> 00:23.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead this Wednesday: a
dangerous rise
in diabetes. The World Health
Organization

00:23.891 --> 00:30.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
announces the number of adult
cases quadrupled
globally in less than 40 years.

00:30.497 --> 00:35.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With this year's predicted
strongest El Nino
on record, scientists step up
their efforts

00:35.869 --> 00:40.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to better understand the weather
pattern when
forecasts predict the worst.

00:40.340 --> 00:47.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BILL PATZERT, NASA
Climatologist: When these
events impose themselves on the
climate system,

00:47.314 --> 00:57.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everybody on the planet feels
it. And the
droughts, floods are
spectacular, and they're

00:57.557 --> 00:59.359 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
global.

00:59.393 --> 01:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And remembering
Merle Haggard,
one of country music's original
outlaws, who

01:06.667 --> 01:09.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
died today at 79.

01:09.202 --> 01:11.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:11.705 --> 01:13.473 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:13.507 --> 01:17.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's on to New
York in the
presidential campaign, after
Wisconsin voters

01:17.377 --> 01:19.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
shook up the race.

01:19.212 --> 01:25.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Ted Cruz and Democrat
Bernie Sanders
won big in the Badger State on
Tuesday. The

01:25.152 --> 01:29.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidates they are chasing,
Donald Trump
and Hillary Clinton, aim to do a
lot better

01:29.856 --> 01:35.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in New York, which is home to
both. We will
have a full report after the
news summary.

01:35.696 --> 01:41.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the day's other news:
Pharmaceutical giant
Pfizer and its Irish rival
Allergan called

01:41.201 --> 01:46.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off a record merger agreement.
The deal would
have saved Pfizer hundreds of
millions of

01:46.239 --> 01:53.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dollars in taxes by moving its
corporate address
overseas. But, on Monday, the
Obama administration

01:53.680 --> 01:58.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
imposed rules to block such
so-called tax
inversions.

01:58.118 --> 02:02.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the White House today,
spokesman Josh Earnest
rejected criticism from the drug
companies.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
Most corporate leaders in
America understand

02:05.792 --> 02:11.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that a strong American economy
is good for
their business. And the concern
that we have

02:11.732 --> 02:20.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is with the leaders of some
corporations that
are looking to take the best of
America without

02:21.008 --> 02:25.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
making a contribution to the
success of our
country. And that is wrong.

02:25.112 --> 02:30.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The merger would
have been
worth $160 billion.

02:30.183 --> 02:35.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former coal executive Don
Blankenship was
sentenced to a year in federal
prison for

02:35.922 --> 02:42.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a mine disaster that killed 29
people. Blankenship
was CEO of Massey Energy, which
owned the

02:42.696 --> 02:48.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Upper Big Branch Mine in West
Virginia when
an explosion hit six years ago
yesterday.

02:48.735 --> 02:53.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His sentencing today came after
a federal
jury convicted him of conspiracy
to violate

02:53.640 --> 02:58.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
safety standards. He was
acquitted of more
serious charges.

02:58.111 --> 03:03.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New signs are emerging that the
flow of migrants
from Turkey to the Greek islands
is finally

03:03.950 --> 03:10.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
slowing. The Turkish coast guard
reports that
it stopped 68 people trying to
cross the Aegean

03:10.123 --> 03:17.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sea today. That is down sharply
from 225 yesterday.
Turkey's prime minister says it
shows a deal

03:17.998 --> 03:23.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the European Union to
deport illegal
migrants is having an effect.

03:23.937 --> 03:29.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
More world leaders found
themselves on the
defensive today over offshore
investments.

03:29.209 --> 03:35.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were detailed this week in
a massive
leak of documents, the so-called
Panama Papers.

03:35.082 --> 03:39.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
British Prime Minister David
Cameron said
today that his family will not
benefit from

03:39.820 --> 03:43.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
offshore funds or trusts in the
future.

03:43.590 --> 03:49.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And in Tokyo, Ukraine's
President Petro Poroshenko
said that his offshore holdings
were a blind

03:49.830 --> 03:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trust that he created once he
took office.

03:52.499 --> 03:56.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETRO POROSHENKO, Ukrainian
President: The
only purpose of that was a
transparent separation

03:56.837 --> 04:04.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of business of the Ukrainian
president from
any political influence. This is
absolutely

04:04.478 --> 04:11.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
normal procedure, and I think
this is the
main difference from the blaming
all the political

04:11.518 --> 04:14.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
figures in this Panama list.

04:14.454 --> 04:20.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also today, the
documents leak
led police in Switzerland to
raid the headquarters

04:20.327 --> 04:25.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of European soccer's governing
body. They
are focused on a TV contract
that could be

04:25.832 --> 04:28.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
linked to a bribery scandal.

04:28.735 --> 04:33.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Governments around the world
carried out more
executions last year than at any
time since

04:33.840 --> 04:41.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1990. Amnesty International
reports more than
1,600 people were put to death
in 2015. Almost

04:41.848 --> 04:47.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
90 percent of the executions
came in three
countries: Iran, Saudi Arabia
and Pakistan.

04:47.988 --> 04:55.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were 28 executions in the
U.S., the
lowest number since 1991.
Amnesty says it's

04:55.495 --> 05:02.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
believed that China executes
thousands of
people every year, but won't
confirm any figures.

05:02.335 --> 05:06.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, investment
brokers are
going to have to meet a higher
standard when

05:06.807 --> 05:14.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they advise people on
retirement. Labor Department
rules issued say advisers act as
fiduciaries,

05:14.347 --> 05:20.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
legally required to put a
client's best interest
above all else. They also have
to disclose

05:20.220 --> 05:27.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fees they are paid to recommend
a given investment.
The rules will be phased in next
year.

05:27.160 --> 05:31.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Wall Street, stocks broke out
of a two-day
slump thanks to gains in the
health care and

05:31.932 --> 05:40.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
energy sectors. The Dow Jones
industrial average
climbed 112 points to close at
17716. The

05:40.140 --> 05:46.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nasdaq rose 76 points, and the
S&amp;P 500 added
21.

05:46.046 --> 05:51.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the University of
Connecticut celebrated
today, after the women's
basketball team won

05:51.351 --> 05:59.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their fourth straight national
championship.
The Huskies routed Syracuse last
night 82-51.

05:59.259 --> 06:06.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It marked the 11th championship
overall for
coach Geno Auriemma, the most in
college basketball

06:06.433 --> 06:08.134 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
history.

06:08.168 --> 06:12.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
all eyes
on New York, as the presidential
front-runners

06:12.839 --> 06:20.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suffer setbacks in Wisconsin;
the underlying
cause of a global spike in
diabetes; and much

06:20.213 --> 06:27.220 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

06:27.254 --> 06:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Already, the 2016 spotlight has
shifted to
the next two major campaign
battlegrounds,

06:40.000 --> 06:45.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New York and Pennsylvania. Ted
Cruz, fresh
off his win in Wisconsin's
Republican primary,

06:45.672 --> 06:51.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
paid a visit today to the Big
Apple. There,
he was forced to defend his
criticism earlier

06:51.678 --> 06:57.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this campaign of front-runner
Donald Trump's
what he called New York values.

06:57.584 --> 07:02.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Cruz pointed to what one
Hispanic pastor told
him today about what's wrong
about New York

07:02.889 --> 07:05.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
politics and the values that
drive them.

07:05.158 --> 07:08.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
We fight them every day in our
country. We

07:08.495 --> 07:16.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fight them. They're the values
that led, for
example, Mayor Bill de Blasio,
liberal Democrat,

07:16.036 --> 07:17.771 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of getting elected there.

07:17.804 --> 07:23.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the first things he did
was try to
shut down charter schools in
Harlem, because

07:23.176 --> 07:29.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he is captive to the union
bosses who control
him, so one of his first actions
was to try

07:29.716 --> 07:34.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to throw young African-American
and Hispanic
kids out of the schools that
were giving them

07:34.321 --> 07:37.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hope and giving them a lifeline.

07:37.390 --> 07:42.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are the values. It's the
values of the
liberal Democratic politicians
that have been

07:42.662 --> 07:44.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hammering the people of New York
for a long
time.

07:44.397 --> 07:49.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Donald Trump, for
his part,
has a rally scheduled this
evening in Long

07:49.235 --> 07:53.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Island, while Ohio Governor John
Kasich was
off the trail today.

07:53.106 --> 07:58.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Democratic side, Bernie
Sanders is
moving on to Pennsylvania with
his Wisconsin

07:58.144 --> 08:04.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
win last night under his belt.
But the Democratic
front-runner once again took aim
at Sanders'

08:04.384 --> 08:07.754 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ability to turn his rhetoric
into reality.

08:07.787 --> 08:11.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here's what Hillary Clinton said
today at
an AFL-CIO convention in
Philadelphia.

08:11.725 --> 08:17.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I am concerned that some of his
ideas just

08:17.564 --> 08:23.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
won't work because the numbers
don't add up.
Others won't even pass Congress,
or they rely

08:23.603 --> 08:29.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Republican governors suddenly
having a
conversion experience and
becoming progressive,

08:29.542 --> 08:35.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
while, in a number of important
areas, he
doesn't have a plan at all.

08:35.582 --> 08:40.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: To dig into last
night's results
in Wisconsin and perhaps tell us
what it could

08:40.520 --> 08:45.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mean for the road ahead, we are
joined by
Ron Brownstein, who writes for
"The Atlantic"

08:45.492 --> 08:50.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and "National Journal,"
specializing in the
demographics of the nation's
politics, and

08:50.764 --> 08:54.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dante Chinni. He's director of
the American
Communities Project, a
county-by-county look

08:54.501 --> 08:57.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the U.S. electorate. He is
also a politics
reporter for The Wall Street
Journal.

08:57.303 --> 08:58.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome you both to the
program.

08:58.972 --> 08:59.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DANTE CHINNI, American
Communities Project:
Thank you.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good to see you.

09:01.708 --> 09:05.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, let's talk about -- a little
bit about
breaking down that vote
yesterday, Ron, in

09:05.678 --> 09:10.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wisconsin. What did you see from
what voters
did, how they voted that tells
us anything

09:10.049 --> 09:11.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about what's happening?

09:11.885 --> 09:13.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RON BROWNSTEIN, "National
Journal": The short
version, Judy, is that it
reconfirmed the

09:13.653 --> 09:16.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
patterns we have seen on the
Democratic side
and it broke the patterns we
have seen on

09:16.790 --> 09:18.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Republican side.

09:18.525 --> 09:21.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Democratic side, we saw
Bernie Sanders
strong where he has been strong,
dominant

09:21.995 --> 09:27.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
among young people, and
surprisingly competitive
among working-class white voters
in the Midwest.

09:27.033 --> 09:31.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's now won them in every
state, except for
Ohio, where the two of them ran
even.

09:31.805 --> 09:35.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So he has shown that he can
continue to be
very strong in states that are
predominantly

09:35.708 --> 09:40.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
white and where the share of
vote cast by
Democrats is lower. Hillary
Clinton maintained

09:40.280 --> 09:44.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
her strength among
African-American voters,
which is critical going into the
big diverse

09:44.217 --> 09:47.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
battlegrounds to come, New York,
Pennsylvania,
California, New Jersey.

09:47.554 --> 09:52.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Republican side, the
patterns broke
substantially. Ted Cruz did
better among voters,

09:52.459 --> 09:55.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
particularly those who are not
evangelicals,
than he's done before. The
question will be

09:55.929 --> 09:59.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether that was a one-time
anomaly or that's
a new pattern in the race.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you see,
Dante, when
you look at Wisconsin?

10:01.768 --> 10:04.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANTE CHINNI: Well, one thing
that struck
me on the Republican side in
particular was

10:04.871 --> 10:08.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it really did seem that we have
been waiting
a long time to see who this
establishment

10:08.241 --> 10:10.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
candidate was going to be on the
Republican
side.

10:10.109 --> 10:14.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We had Marco Rubio. He went
away. We had some
earlier folks. We had Jeb Bush.
We even had

10:14.481 --> 10:18.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scott Walker. And it really did
look -- last
night, it looked like the
establishment said,

10:18.785 --> 10:23.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OK, we're going on all in Ted
Cruz, we're
going, which is remarkable. To
say that, a

10:23.256 --> 10:25.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year ago, that Ted Cruz has
become the candidate
of the establishment, that
honestly...

10:25.959 --> 10:27.193 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

10:27.227 --> 10:28.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RON BROWNSTEIN: It's 2:00 a.m.
and closing
time at the bar.

10:28.895 --> 10:29.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANTE CHINNI: Exactly.

10:29.929 --> 10:30.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RON BROWNSTEIN: The Republican
establishment...

10:30.864 --> 10:31.698 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

10:31.731 --> 10:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANTE CHINNI: Time to go. Time
to go.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But that you're
looking at
a lot of endorsements. And
you're right. It

10:34.934 --> 10:36.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
does -- at this point, it looks
like that's
where they're coalescing.

10:36.736 --> 10:40.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, let's -- we have some
graphics here,
Ron. Let's talk about something
you say you

10:40.240 --> 10:45.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have seen in really all the
primaries so far.
And you just referred to it that
helps us

10:45.378 --> 10:51.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
understand the Republican vote.
And it has
to do with on the Republican
side who is winning

10:51.317 --> 10:54.120 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the white college grads and
non-college grads.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RON BROWNSTEIN: Right.

10:56.089 --> 10:59.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, look, what Donald Trump has
done is fracture
the Republican Party along a new
line of division.

10:59.759 --> 11:04.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, in the past, Republican
races have been
defined mostly by ideology and
religious affiliation.

11:04.631 --> 11:10.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You had one candidate who was
more moderate,
somewhat conservative voters,
and also non-evangelicals,

11:10.136 --> 11:12.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
another candidate who tends to
be more conservative
and evangelicals.

11:13.006 --> 11:16.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump has replaced that with a
new divide
along the lines of education. As
you look

11:16.976 --> 11:22.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at that map, he has won voters
who are white
college graduates in only eight
of the 21

11:22.181 --> 11:25.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states. In the cumulative exit
polls, he's
carried about a third of them.
He has been

11:25.318 --> 11:30.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dominant, though, Judy, among
those non-college
white voters in the Republican
primary. He's

11:30.523 --> 11:31.190 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
won them.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The next graphic.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RON BROWNSTEIN: He's won them
now, yes, in
17 of the first 20 states.

11:35.662 --> 11:39.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the things that was
significant
last night, he's won about 45
percent of them.

11:39.532 --> 11:45.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in most states, the pattern
has been Trump
loses the college voters usually
pretty narrowly,

11:45.705 --> 11:49.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and wins the non-college voters
by big margins.
Last night in Wisconsin, we saw
something

11:49.876 --> 11:51.644 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very different.

11:51.678 --> 11:54.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw him lose the college
voters by a very
big margin, almost 20 points.
And he also

11:54.414 --> 11:58.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lost the non-college white
voters, only the
fourth time he's done that in
the 21 sees

11:58.084 --> 11:59.852 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with exit polls.

11:59.886 --> 12:03.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That was one of the key
questions. Is that,
again, a one-time confluence of
events that

12:03.890 --> 12:07.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
makes Wisconsin unique, or is
this a new pattern?
By the way, new polling out
tonight in New

12:08.027 --> 12:11.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
York suggests it may have been a
one-time
event, at least as compared to
his home state.

12:11.664 --> 12:15.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's got to be proven that Cruz
can sustain
the advantages we saw in
Wisconsin. But there's

12:15.468 --> 12:19.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no question that Trump has
upended the usual
order in the Republican primary
by building

12:19.672 --> 12:23.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his blue-collar coalition that
transcends
the usual geographic divides.

12:23.142 --> 12:26.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we know
Wisconsin voters
were bombarded with this
campaign for the

12:26.312 --> 12:29.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last few weeks. And now New York
voters are
about to experience the same
thing.

12:29.682 --> 12:34.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Dante, you have been looking
at something
related, but it's not exactly.
You have been

12:34.253 --> 12:39.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looking at how suburban voters
are looking
at this election. What you have
found? And

12:39.959 --> 12:41.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we have a graphic on this, too.

12:41.894 --> 12:43.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANTE CHINNI: Well, the one
thing I have noticed
looking at the data throughout
the election,

12:43.997 --> 12:48.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and even going in, is that
Republicans need
to win the suburbs to win the
general election.

12:48.434 --> 12:52.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's very important to them.
They have been
losing in the suburbs for a long
time. In

12:52.205 --> 12:59.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the last election, say, in 2008
-- 2012 -- sorry
-- Barack Obama won these
suburban places

12:59.178 --> 13:02.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by about 16 points in the
breakdown that I
used for the American
Communities Project.

13:02.415 --> 13:07.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I looked at head-to-head data
between Hillary
Clinton and Donald Trump. She's
winning in

13:07.253 --> 13:11.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those places now by like 32
points. She's
doubled the advantage. And we're
seeing in

13:11.824 --> 13:15.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- what we're seeing in these
primaries is
Trump cannot win in these
places, and it revealed

13:15.628 --> 13:17.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
itself again last night.

13:17.430 --> 13:22.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You look at that map. Where does
he win? He
wins Milwaukee, he wins
Waukesha, Washington.

13:22.568 --> 13:24.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wins over to Dane, which is
where Madison
is.

13:24.771 --> 13:25.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is the
county, Dane County.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANTE CHINNI: Yes. Yes.

13:27.774 --> 13:31.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then he wins up a little bit
around Green
Bay, Appleton. But when you get
up in those

13:31.477 --> 13:33.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rural areas, that's all Trump.

13:33.346 --> 13:37.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But there are
suburbs and there
are suburbs. Are you talking
inner suburbs?

13:37.917 --> 13:40.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or -- because we know, today, a
city, there's
sprawl.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.954 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DANTE CHINNI: Absolutely.

13:41.988 --> 13:45.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And there are
places where
suburbs become almost rural.

13:45.792 --> 13:48.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANTE CHINNI: Absolutely, and
exurbs, right,
and exurban areas.

13:48.728 --> 13:51.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's been -- those places
have been
fairly good for Republicans in
the past. And

13:51.964 --> 13:56.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
even when I look at the
breakdown, the head-to-head
numbers with Trump and Hillary
Clinton, he

13:56.969 --> 14:00.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still holds down the Republican
edge in those
places, but he's way down. He
doesn't have

14:00.707 --> 14:02.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the edge that, say, Mitt Romney
had.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.210 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

14:04.243 --> 14:06.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RON BROWNSTEIN: There has been
some commentary,
even from Trump himself, that he
is winning

14:06.345 --> 14:09.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because he is transforming the
Republican
electorate. That's not really
happening.

14:09.649 --> 14:14.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look at the share of the
vote cast
by Republicans, it is basically
the same as

14:14.420 --> 14:20.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was in 2012. There has not
been this big
upsurge of Democrats and
independents. And

14:20.727 --> 14:24.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump has won Republicans in
every state that
he has won except Missouri.

14:24.397 --> 14:28.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What he has done, Judy, is taken
the existing
coalition and divide it in a new
way. He has

14:28.901 --> 14:32.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
basically achieved what someone
like Pat Buchanan
or Rick Santorum tried and
failed to do. He's

14:33.005 --> 14:37.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
consolidated this blue-collar
half of the
party in a way that no one has
done before.

14:37.477 --> 14:40.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And really for the first time in
a divided
primary, the blue-collar side is
driving the

14:40.913 --> 14:43.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
result, and the white-collar
side is the fragmented
one.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, just
quickly, we
want to turn to the Democrats
here, because,

14:45.985 --> 14:51.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ron, you have also looked at
that, and frankly
how it is divided by race, how
Hillary Clinton

14:51.257 --> 14:54.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Bernie Sanders have divided
the white
voters. And we have got a
graphic on that.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RON BROWNSTEIN: Right.

14:56.362 --> 14:58.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, look, Sanders started as
the classic
wine track candidate. He was a
candidate of

14:58.197 --> 15:02.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
basically white-collar whites,
vocal liberals,
and young people. He's doing
incredibly well

15:02.268 --> 15:04.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
among young people, among 70
percent overall.

15:04.270 --> 15:08.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he has expanded beyond that.
He is now
competitive among those
blue-collar whites.

15:08.841 --> 15:14.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has won all white voters in
every state
outside of the South except for
Ohio and Iowa.

15:14.981 --> 15:19.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has dominated among white
voters in the
South. And that's allowed him to
compete far

15:19.085 --> 15:24.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beyond the kind of wine track
states like
an Oregon, say, or a Vermont and
New Hampshire.

15:24.157 --> 15:27.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What he hasn't done, though,
yet, Judy, is
cross that second hill, which is
the diversity

15:27.794 --> 15:31.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Democratic Party. And the
challenge
that creates for him is that, on
the Democratic

15:31.631 --> 15:36.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
side, every large state is
diverse, and she
has won every large state,
except for Michigan.

15:36.636 --> 15:37.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meaning
African-American voters.

15:38.004 --> 15:39.105 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

15:39.138 --> 15:39.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RON BROWNSTEIN: African-American
and Hispanic
voters.

15:39.806 --> 15:41.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Asian voters.

15:41.707 --> 15:43.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RON BROWNSTEIN: And until he
breaks that pattern,
that is his task in the
remaining contests,

15:43.709 --> 15:45.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
New York, Pennsylvania,
California, and New
Jersey.

15:46.012 --> 15:49.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANTE CHINNI: The one thing you
also see with
Bernie Sanders that is
interesting, while

15:49.182 --> 15:51.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's winning these rural -- he's
winning rural
white places.

15:51.417 --> 15:55.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are aspects to Bernie. We
all think
about him as, yes, he's the
college kids,

15:55.788 --> 15:57.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
crazy Professor Sanders. Go vote
for him.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Colleges, yes.

15:58.724 --> 16:00.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANTE CHINNI: But that's not
really everything
that's going on with him.

16:00.560 --> 16:04.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has aspects to him that are
really -- that
are -- he's a prairie populist
in a lot of

16:04.363 --> 16:08.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ways. It's prairie populist.
He's winning
Kansas. He's winning these rural
parts of

16:08.334 --> 16:11.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wisconsin, Nebraska. And, yes,
he wins big.
He wins the Pacific Northwest,
but he's winning

16:11.938 --> 16:15.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rural whites that kind of live
in the old
prairie populist areas.

16:15.641 --> 16:20.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But he still is,
Ron, a significant
number of delegates behind
Hillary Clinton.

16:20.379 --> 16:22.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RON BROWNSTEIN: Right.

16:22.081 --> 16:24.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is because, if you look
forward,
you see where the challenge is.
He's a good

16:24.283 --> 16:29.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidate for Kentucky, for West
Virginia,
for South Dakota, for Oregon.
But on the Democratic

16:29.121 --> 16:33.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
side, the big states that award
the big trove
of delegate delegates are all
diverse.

16:33.526 --> 16:37.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Sanders' campaign recognizes
that he has
-- he has obviously advanced far
from where

16:37.797 --> 16:42.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he started. But the hill that he
has to get
over to truly challenge her is
to crack the

16:42.068 --> 16:45.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
diversity of the Democratic
Party. Without
that, he can't win a place like
California

16:45.438 --> 16:47.139 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or New Jersey.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, we are
going to
have to leave it there. It is
all fascinating,

16:48.641 --> 16:50.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and New York two weeks from
yesterday.

16:50.543 --> 16:51.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RON BROWNSTEIN: Yes. Yes.

16:51.911 --> 16:58.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ron Brownstein,
Dante Chinni,
we thank you both.

16:58.384 --> 17:05.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RON BROWNSTEIN: Thanks for
having us.

17:05.191 --> 17:12.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now, an
alarming new report
about the dramatic growth of
diabetes across

17:12.064 --> 17:13.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the globe.

17:14.000 --> 17:19.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The World Health Organization
said today that
an estimated 422 million people
are now suffering

17:19.538 --> 17:22.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from this chronic lifelong
disease.

17:22.508 --> 17:24.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has more.

17:24.210 --> 17:28.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The WHO's
report tracked
the global rise of diabetes over
the last

17:28.214 --> 17:33.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
40 years. And it showed a
quadrupling of the
number of cases worldwide. It's
now estimated

17:33.252 --> 17:38.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that 8.5 percent of adults in
the world have
the disease, and the costs are
tremendous.

17:38.557 --> 17:43.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An estimated 3.7 million deaths
every year
are linked to diabetes and
higher-than-normal

17:43.863 --> 17:45.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
blood sugar levels.

17:45.531 --> 17:49.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fastest growth of the
disease has been
in Africa, the Middle East and
Asia.

17:49.635 --> 17:53.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining me now is Dr. Etienne
Krug. He's the
World Health Organization's
point person for

17:53.572 --> 17:55.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dealing with diseases like
diabetes.

17:55.841 --> 18:01.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dr. Krug, these are genuinely
shock numbers.
How do you explain this
incredible growth

18:01.714 --> 18:03.516 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of diabetes?

18:03.549 --> 18:05.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. ETIENNE KRUG, World Health
Organization:
Well, we have seen a steady
growth now for

18:05.384 --> 18:11.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
several decades, which largely,
particularly
for people with type 2 diabetes,
is linked

18:11.390 --> 18:16.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to our changes in the way we eat
and changes
in our levels of physical
activity.

18:16.095 --> 18:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are seeing more and more
unhealthy eating
and a reduction in physical
activity, which

18:20.967 --> 18:26.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contributes both to overweight,
which in turn
is a big cause of type 2
diabetes.

18:26.772 --> 18:31.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We tend to
think of diabetes
as a disease that afflicts
wealthier nations,

18:31.277 --> 18:35.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but your report indicates that
poorer countries
are increasingly bearing a
bigger and bigger

18:35.915 --> 18:37.817 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
burden.

18:37.850 --> 18:42.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. ETIENNE KRUG: For a long
time, diabetes
was considered the disease of
the rich countries.

18:42.254 --> 18:47.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is not the case anymore,
and the report
clearly shows that rates are now
higher in

18:48.027 --> 18:51.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
lower- and middle-income
countries than in
the high-income countries.

18:51.530 --> 18:56.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is a total reverse of the
situation, what
it was. And the increase is
steeper in those

18:56.235 --> 18:58.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
countries as well.

18:58.137 --> 19:01.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The health
impacts of diabetes,
as we described are, really
quite striking.

19:01.774 --> 19:05.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm wondering, do you have a
sense of the
economic cost of this disease?

19:05.244 --> 19:14.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. ETIENNE KRUG: The total cost
of treating
diabetes is more than $827
billion every year.

19:14.053 --> 19:18.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's a very high number, and
that's only
the direct cost. It's not even
talking about

19:18.457 --> 19:20.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lost productivity, for example.

19:20.493 --> 19:25.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Diabetes
requires lifetime,
costly medical care. Do you have
any sense

19:25.564 --> 19:29.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of whether these nations have
the medical
infrastructure to deal with
these patients

19:29.969 --> 19:31.771 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over the rest of their lives?

19:31.804 --> 19:37.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. ETIENNE KRUG: Diabetes is a
disease that's
there to stay for the life of an
individual,

19:37.710 --> 19:40.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and it does require a lot of
different responses.

19:40.746 --> 19:45.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's important to mention that a
lot of it
doesn't have to be costly. Just
through healthier

19:45.151 --> 19:53.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
eating and more physical
activity, type 2
diabetes can be reduced quite a
bit. And it

19:53.092 --> 19:56.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is an issue that's important,
also, for type
1 diabetes.

19:56.429 --> 20:02.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then we need to have access
to diagnostics
and to treatment. And, today, 23
percent of

20:02.935 --> 20:07.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the lower-income countries say
they don't
have a good, widespread access
to insulin,

20:07.873 --> 20:12.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for example, which is a
lifesaving medicine
for people with diabetes. And
that means we

20:12.278 --> 20:17.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need to work on supply chains,
making sure
those medicines reach even the
poorest countries

20:17.850 --> 20:23.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the poorest corners of those
countries,
as well as on the prices,
because we know

20:23.322 --> 20:27.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that some types of insulin, for
example, are
too expensive.

20:27.460 --> 20:30.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have to make sure that
even poorest
people, who need them just as
much as the

20:30.996 --> 20:32.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rich ones, have access to them.

20:32.765 --> 20:36.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let's talk
about possible
remedies. What is it that can be
done? Is

20:36.435 --> 20:41.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it education? We have seen some
faltering
attempt here in the U.S. to try
to tax sugary

20:41.340 --> 20:45.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beverages. Mexico has done that.
The U.K.
is trying that. Is that a
possible solution?

20:45.478 --> 20:48.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. ETIENNE KRUG: It is a
combination of measures
that are needed.

20:48.848 --> 20:54.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clearly, all of us have to make
an effort
in terms of healthier eating and
more physical

20:54.153 --> 20:58.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
activity, but that is not going
to be enough.
And particularly when we look at
the poorest

20:58.724 --> 21:03.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
countries, people don't have
access to the
information, but also don't
always have the

21:03.262 --> 21:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
choice to eat healthily or to do
more physical
activity.

21:07.666 --> 21:13.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the governments have an
important role
to play in terms of providing
information,

21:13.272 --> 21:20.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but also making sure healthier
choices are
available. And that can be done
through legislation

21:20.079 --> 21:24.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in terms of content of food,
through taxation,
as you have mentioned. These are
important

21:24.717 --> 21:27.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
measures that can work.

21:27.052 --> 21:33.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we need to also think
about our urban
planning, for example. One of
the causes to

21:33.092 --> 21:40.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
overweight is urbanization.
People cannot
walk and cycle safely anymore to
work or to

21:40.065 --> 21:46.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
school. And making sure our
cities are healthy
and provide opportunities for
safe walking,

21:46.372 --> 21:49.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cycling, physical activity in
general is extremely
important.

21:49.074 --> 21:52.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, Dr.
Etienne Krug
of the World Health
Organization, thanks very

21:52.711 --> 21:54.380 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

21:54.413 --> 22:02.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. ETIENNE KRUG: Sure. No,
thanks very much
for having us and supporting our
work.

22:02.521 --> 22:09.828 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

22:09.862 --> 22:16.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
drones, satellites
and balloons, the tools to
predicting El Nino;

22:17.002 --> 22:24.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two views on whether there is
hope for Israeli-Palestinian
peace; plus, the urban workers
excluded from

22:24.410 --> 22:26.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
India's economic prosperity.

22:26.545 --> 22:32.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, this has been a
stronger season
than usual for the weather
pattern known as

22:32.551 --> 22:37.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
El Nino, a phenomenon that
affects weather
all around the planet

22:37.056 --> 22:42.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scientists and forecasters have
repeatedly
warned about its impact this
year. But they

22:42.061 --> 22:46.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still want to find out more
about it to better
gauge what it might do.

22:46.599 --> 22:50.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Science correspondent Miles
O'Brien went with
them to see what they're
learning.

22:50.803 --> 22:58.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It's another
beautiful day
in sunny Hawaii. A Gulfstream G4
jet spools

22:58.410 --> 23:04.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up its engines and taxis for
departure.

23:04.049 --> 23:10.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The plane is the ultimate in
business jet
luxury, in this case minus the
luxury. Nicknamed

23:10.956 --> 23:16.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gonzo, it is owned and operated
by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, NOAA,

23:16.862 --> 23:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the business is scientific
research on
one of the most significant
weather patterns

23:21.533 --> 23:25.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the planet, El Nino.

23:25.471 --> 23:28.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They make a beeline from good
weather to bad.

23:28.474 --> 23:34.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Positive rate. Gear up,
gear up. Heading
and altitude? Verified.

23:34.079 --> 23:39.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The cabin is
filled with researchers
using sophisticated equipment.
They are part

23:39.351 --> 23:47.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a scientific campaign on
multiple fronts,
deploying satellites, drones,
planes, balloons,

23:47.059 --> 23:52.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
surface ships and buoys, all
focused on the
largest El Nino in nearly 20
years.

23:52.498 --> 23:57.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BILL PATZERT, NASA
Climatologist: El Ninos
come small, medium, large and
what I'm fond

23:57.102 --> 23:58.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of calling is Godzilla.

23:58.871 --> 24:03.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Veteran NASA
climatologist
Bill Patzert has studied El Nino
his entire

24:04.009 --> 24:10.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
career. He watches the weather
from a perch
in space via the Jet Propulsion
Lab in Southern

24:10.049 --> 24:16.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
California. Launched in January,
the Jason-3
oceanography satellite is the
fourth in a

24:16.488 --> 24:22.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
series NASA and the European
Space Agency
have deployed to monitor El Nino
and sea level

24:22.728 --> 24:24.630 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rise since the early '90s.

24:24.663 --> 24:31.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL PATZERT: When these events
impose themselves
on the climate system, everybody
on the planet

24:31.870 --> 24:37.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
feels it. And the droughts,
floods are spectacular
and they're global.

24:37.876 --> 24:42.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Here's what makes
an El Nino
tick: Normally, trade winds blow
from the

24:42.047 --> 24:47.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
east westward across the Pacific
Ocean. This
creates a mound of water near
Indonesia that

24:47.986 --> 24:54.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is as much as 10 degrees warmer
and 1.5 feet
higher than the water off the
coast of Ecuador.

24:54.093 --> 25:00.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During an El Nino year, the
trade winds either
stop, or blow in the opposite
direction, transporting

25:00.466 --> 25:03.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the mound of warm water to the
east.

25:03.035 --> 25:09.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BILL PATZERT: So, it's a
tremendous redistribution
of heat. And so when this
happens, all the

25:09.141 --> 25:11.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pieces on the weather board are
rearranged.

25:11.744 --> 25:16.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The unusually
warm water adds
heat and moisture to the air
above it, and

25:16.648 --> 25:21.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it rises, causing rain, often
torrential,
on the West Coast of the United
States and

25:21.920 --> 25:24.356 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in Central and South America.

25:24.390 --> 25:29.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At the other side of the
Pacific, the colder-than-normal
ocean leads to serious droughts
in Southeast

25:29.695 --> 25:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Asia, India and Africa. It's the
kind of weather
no one can ignore.

25:34.700 --> 25:39.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: El Nino is threatening
parts of the
West this morning with more
dangerous weather.

25:39.171 --> 25:41.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Heavy rain and high winds will
take aim at
California.

25:41.473 --> 25:46.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Strong El Nino
winds bring
colder temperatures and more
rain across the

25:46.145 --> 25:53.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Southern U.S., this year
triggering flooding
and mudslides in Texas,
Louisiana and Tennessee.

25:53.585 --> 25:59.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it flattens out the northern
jet stream,
redirecting the flow of cold
polar air, resulting

25:59.158 --> 26:04.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a milder winter for much of
the country.
Scientists are getting better at
predicting

26:04.263 --> 26:09.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an El Nino. They foresaw this
one six months
in advance, but there is still a
lot that

26:09.601 --> 26:11.403 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they don't know.

26:11.437 --> 26:13.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS FAIRALL, National Oceanic
and Atmospheric
Administration: This is not
rocket science.

26:13.806 --> 26:17.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's much, much more difficult
than rocket
science.

26:17.443 --> 26:23.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Chris Fairall is
a NOAA physicist.
He says one of the key
challenges is data,

26:23.081 --> 26:29.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or, more accurately, the absence
of it. El
Nino forms along the equator in
the Pacific,

26:29.588 --> 26:31.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as remote as any place on the
planet.

26:31.890 --> 26:38.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS FAIRALL: It's a gigantic
data void.
There's a huge area with no
islands, no land

26:38.864 --> 26:44.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stations, no radiosonde. And
it's extremely
active.

26:44.303 --> 26:50.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: That is what
makes this flight,
one of 22, so crucial. They are
now flying

26:50.509 --> 26:52.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
45,000 feet above the equator.

26:52.444 --> 26:56.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I think the model's wrong,
which is part
of the mission here.

26:56.715 --> 27:01.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Randy Dole is a
senior climate
and weather scientist with NOAA.
He and the

27:01.954 --> 27:06.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
team are Hoovering data in the
place where
they have the least of it,
hoping to fix what

27:06.992 --> 27:08.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is broken in their model.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDY DOLE, National Oceanic and
Atmospheric
Administration: Some of the
errors were larger

27:10.696 --> 27:15.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
than we might have even
anticipated. And this
affects not just the weather
models, but it

27:15.267 --> 27:23.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
affects models that are used to
project U.S.
climate on a seasonal scale or
even globally

27:23.041 --> 27:24.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the long-term.

27:24.843 --> 27:28.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: As they fly, they
gather data
left and right, aiming a
side-scanning radar

27:28.747 --> 27:32.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at nearby clouds to determine
how much moisture
they contain.

27:32.718 --> 27:36.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Three, two, one, drop.

27:36.855 --> 27:43.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And they look out
below as
well, releasing a few dozen
dropsondes, which

27:43.095 --> 27:48.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
transmit real-time snapshots of
temperature,
humidity, wind speed and
direction as they

27:48.800 --> 27:52.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fall toward the sea.

27:52.971 --> 28:00.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dr. Dole is also very interested
in the connection
between El Nino and climate
change.

28:00.512 --> 28:06.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDY DOLE: There are several
papers that
suggest that -- that some of the
events like

28:06.518 --> 28:13.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the climate we're seeing may
become more frequent,
that is, extreme warm events in
the future.

28:13.592 --> 28:17.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This kind of mission or campaign
ultimately
provides data that will help to
improve the

28:17.963 --> 28:20.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
models needed to understand that
question.

28:20.399 --> 28:26.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Meanwhile, in
Pearl Harbor,
the crew of a NOAA research
vessel, the Ron

28:26.138 --> 28:31.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brown, readies to set sail on a
month-long
voyage into El Nino waters.

28:31.076 --> 28:36.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Bridge copies all hands
aboard. Ship
to colors. Hundred RPMs on the
port.

28:36.114 --> 28:42.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Lieutenant
Adrienne Hopper
is an operations officer in
NOAA's Commissioned

28:42.921 --> 28:44.756 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Corps.

28:44.790 --> 28:46.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. ADRIENNE HOPPER, NOAA
Commissioned Corps:
Increase speed to 400 RPMs.
Thrusters all

28:46.892 --> 28:48.760 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ahead 400.

28:48.794 --> 28:52.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: She and her crew
will be maintaining
several buoys along the equator
called the

28:52.364 --> 28:58.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tropical Atmospheric Ocean
array. The TAO
buoys were deployed to better
understand El

28:58.370 --> 29:04.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nino by gathering data just
above and below
the surface, and beaming it to
forecasters

29:04.242 --> 29:06.011 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
via satellite.

29:06.044 --> 29:08.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. ADRIENNE HOPPER: So, this is
a temperature
and conductivity probe. This is
one of the

29:08.280 --> 29:12.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first probes that's immediately
below the
surface of the mooring
collecting temperature

29:12.818 --> 29:18.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and conductivity data. They go
down about
every 20 to 25 meters between
the surface

29:18.490 --> 29:20.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
down to about 500 meters.

29:20.292 --> 29:23.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And when you
think about El
Nino, this is kind of where the
rubber meets

29:23.161 --> 29:23.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the road, as it were, right?

29:23.862 --> 29:25.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LT. ADRIENNE HOPPER: Absolutely.

29:25.597 --> 29:26.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: This really is a
key point
to know what's going on
underwater and the

29:26.898 --> 29:28.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
atmosphere immediately
surrounding it.

29:28.533 --> 29:30.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LT. ADRIENNE HOPPER: Absolutely.
Together.

29:30.469 --> 29:35.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: They hope to add
one more piece
to the puzzle on this voyage,
launching weather

29:35.741 --> 29:37.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
balloons every three hours.

29:37.643 --> 29:40.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: OK, one, two, three,
release.

29:40.946 --> 29:46.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Designed to
gather the same
kind of data as those dropsondes
released

29:46.118 --> 29:47.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from 45,000 feet.

29:47.419 --> 29:50.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: It was in the clouds
roughly right in
this period here.

29:50.489 --> 29:57.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: What goes up
apparently must
go down in this racket.

29:57.195 --> 29:58.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
After deploying 27 dropsondes...

29:58.797 --> 30:02.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Landing gear is down. Three
green confirmed?

30:02.167 --> 30:03.935 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Confirmed.

30:03.969 --> 30:11.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: ... Gonzo comes
down eight
hours after leaving Honolulu.
The next day,

30:11.376 --> 30:13.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dr. Dole debriefed the flight
for me.

30:13.545 --> 30:18.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDY DOLE: So, this is the
actual flight
plan track. That's in red. These
are dropsonde

30:18.583 --> 30:20.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
points in the plan.

30:20.385 --> 30:24.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: On the left is
the forecast
model, what was predicted, and
on the right

30:24.189 --> 30:25.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is what we saw during the
flight.

30:25.957 --> 30:30.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDY DOLE: We want to see if in
fact this
model is right in predicting
that we should

30:30.362 --> 30:35.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have seen more activity on this
side even
than we saw in the eastern
portion, where

30:35.901 --> 30:39.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there was existing activity
already. So was
it going to develop here or not?
Three or

30:39.838 --> 30:43.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
four model cycles had said it
was. So, let's
test it.

30:43.975 --> 30:47.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So, based on this
flight, how
would you grade this model?

30:47.045 --> 30:53.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDY DOLE: Not very good. I'm a
hard grader,
but I won't give you a letter
grade on it,

30:53.351 --> 30:56.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but let's just say it didn't
happen.

30:56.154 --> 31:00.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My sense is that they should be
in good shape
if they turn, it looks like, at
about one

31:00.959 --> 31:02.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
north, instead of at the
equator.

31:02.794 --> 31:07.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: They are seizing
the scientific
moment, hoping this is a perfect
opportunity

31:07.466 --> 31:13.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make the model smarter. It
can't stop El
Nino's conveyor belt of
moisture, but it might

31:13.472 --> 31:16.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
give us better warning.

31:16.174 --> 31:26.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Miles O'Brien, the "PBS
NewsHour," Honolulu.

31:26.418 --> 31:38.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now the next
conversation in
our occasional series in the
decades-old Israeli-Palestinian

31:38.363 --> 31:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conflict that we are calling The
Long Divide.

31:41.933 --> 31:47.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight: whether there is reason
to be hopeful
that the peace process could
ever bear fruit.

31:47.105 --> 31:48.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And to John Yang.

31:48.874 --> 31:52.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: For that, we have
tonight two men
we have hosted on the "NewsHour"
many times

31:52.811 --> 31:54.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over the years on this subject.

31:54.913 --> 31:59.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hisham Melhem is a columnist for
the Al-Arabiya
news channel in Washington,
D.C., and a correspondent

31:59.651 --> 32:05.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the Lebanese daily newspaper
An-Nahar.
And David Makovsky is a -- was a
senior policy

32:05.557 --> 32:10.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
adviser to Secretary of State
John Kasich's
peace team for
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations

32:10.962 --> 32:17.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
during 2013 and 2014 and is a
long-serving
fellow at the Washington
Institute for Near

32:17.035 --> 32:18.770 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
East Policy.

32:18.804 --> 32:22.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To begin this series, Judy
Woodruff spoke
with Tom Friedman of The New
York Times. And

32:22.908 --> 32:25.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here's a little bit of what Tom
had to say
about the peace process.

32:25.544 --> 32:29.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS FRIEDMAN, The New York
Times: It's
actually been dead for a while.
I just called

32:29.514 --> 32:31.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it by its real name.

32:31.349 --> 32:36.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's clear to me, Judy, that
both sides have
conspired. This was like "Murder
on the Orient

32:36.988 --> 32:40.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Express." There were so many
stab wounds in
this body, hard to tell exactly
which one

32:40.725 --> 32:42.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was the fatal blow.

32:42.527 --> 32:47.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: David, we quickly
heard from you
in disagreement. So, explain why
you disagree

32:47.465 --> 32:49.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with Tom Friedman's analysis.

32:49.234 --> 32:51.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MAKOVSKY, Senior Fellow,
Washington
Institute for Near East Policy:
No, I think

32:51.036 --> 32:54.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tom made a lot of good points,
so -- but I
think, the United States, we
have tried to

32:54.406 --> 33:00.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hit the home run ball three
times, Bill Clinton
in 2000, Condoleezza Rice in
2007-'8, and

33:00.979 --> 33:06.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the effort I was a part of with
Secretary
of State Kerry 2013-2014.

33:06.852 --> 33:12.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think what we see is that,
despite the
best efforts of the United
States, these guys

33:12.090 --> 33:17.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cannot do the home run ball. We
don't have
time to explain all the reasons,
but the point

33:17.963 --> 33:23.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, is that I think we just have
to be more
modest in our objectives and try
to hit singles

33:23.134 --> 33:27.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and doubles, because whether
it's a lack of
leadership -- and, by the way,
even the great

33:27.339 --> 33:29.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leaders in the Middle East
deferred these
issues.

33:29.641 --> 33:35.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a reason why these
issues -- the can's
been kicked down the road, and
we have disbelieving

33:35.881 --> 33:38.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
publics. They might say, I'm for
a two-state
solution, but I don't think the
other guy

33:38.850 --> 33:42.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is. And, third, we have got the
Middle East
in unprecedented turmoil, as the
"NewsHour"

33:42.587 --> 33:45.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has been chronicling, since the
Arab Spring
in 2011.

33:45.991 --> 33:50.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Taken all together, we could
just give up
and say let these guys kill each
other on

33:50.795 --> 33:55.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
both sides, or we could say
maybe we have
to be more modest in our
objectives, maintain

33:55.934 --> 34:00.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the viability of a two-state
solution, even
if we can't implement it, keep
that door open,

34:00.539 --> 34:02.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so when the sides want to go
through that
door, they can.

34:03.008 --> 34:04.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there are some practical
ideas are
possible.

34:04.576 --> 34:06.645 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Hisham, is that
possible?

34:06.678 --> 34:09.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HISHAM MELHEM, Washington Bureau
Chief, Al-Arabiya
Television: Look, American
leadership is indispensable.

34:09.447 --> 34:11.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have known that.

34:11.316 --> 34:15.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you leave the parties to
their own devices,
given the asymmetry between
Israel and the

34:15.654 --> 34:18.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Palestinians, given the fact
that Israel has
tremendous military
preponderance, strong

34:18.723 --> 34:24.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
economy, strong constitution,
you will end
up with two societies living
side by side

34:24.262 --> 34:32.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unequal and resentful of each
other, and in
a state of constant
low-intensity violence.

34:32.370 --> 34:37.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you allow the Israelis to
continue
settlement activities in
Palestinian territories,

34:37.442 --> 34:42.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
incorporating more Palestinian
lands, even
when you work on the limited
objectives, OK,

34:43.014 --> 34:46.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then you will reach a point --
we may have
already reached it -- where
there will be

34:46.251 --> 34:48.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nothing to divide.

34:48.219 --> 34:54.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have half-a-million Israelis
on Palestinian
land. And if you allow the
situation to continue,

34:54.859 --> 34:59.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then it is impossible to talk
about two-state
solution, and you will end up in
a situation

34:59.230 --> 35:05.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where you have these two unequal
societies
living in a state of perpetual
low-intensity

35:05.971 --> 35:07.772 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
violence.

35:07.806 --> 35:13.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's the problem if you
maintain this
approach, let's contain it for a
while until

35:13.278 --> 35:15.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it ripens. But it may be too
late.

35:15.914 --> 35:19.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: David, given the
situation now,
they can't hit the long ball, as
you say.

35:19.584 --> 35:20.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Can they even hit the single or
the double?

35:20.919 --> 35:22.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID MAKOVSKY: Look, I don't
know, but we
have to try.

35:22.754 --> 35:28.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my goal is not to contain or
to have a
status quo, but really to find a
way that

35:28.360 --> 35:33.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
basically you channel the
settlement enterprise
into an area we already know; 80
percent of

35:33.732 --> 35:40.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the settlers own 5 percent of
the land largely
adjacent to the Israeli urban
areas we used

35:40.305 --> 35:42.207 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to call the pre-1967 border.

35:42.240 --> 35:47.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And most of the Palestinians are
on the other
side of that. And so we kind of
know, territorially,

35:47.746 --> 35:52.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where this is going, and there
will be a land
exchange, what we call a
territorial swap.

35:52.183 --> 35:56.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, both sides know basically
what has to
be done. I do think you could
hit the single

35:56.855 --> 36:00.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or double. I just think the
stakes are so
high that, if we don't try, we
are basically

36:00.825 --> 36:02.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
consigning these people to
perpetual bloodshed.

36:02.994 --> 36:07.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if we try to hit the home
run ball a fourth
time, when we know these leaders
and publics

36:07.365 --> 36:09.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can't do it, we're setting
ourselves up for
failure.

36:09.934 --> 36:14.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But, Hisham, giving
up the settlement
blocs around the urban areas,
sounds like

36:14.239 --> 36:19.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that would be giving up East
Jerusalem. And
isn't the Palestinian goal of
having -- establishing

36:19.944 --> 36:22.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a capital in East Jerusalem?
Would that be
acceptable?

36:22.981 --> 36:24.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HISHAM MELHEM: Not to the
Palestinians, definitely.

36:24.883 --> 36:29.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, Palestinians would like
to have East
Jerusalem as their capital, just
as the Israelis

36:29.454 --> 36:34.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could have West Jerusalem as
their capital.
This is a Palestinian position
that no Palestinian

36:34.292 --> 36:38.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leaders can even entertain not
having or not
insisting upon that.

36:38.129 --> 36:43.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem of what we're having
here is,
there are structural problems in
the Israeli

36:43.668 --> 36:48.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
political culture. There are
powerful people
in Netanyahu's cabinet who are
calling for

36:48.840 --> 36:50.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
annexing the West Bank. It is
not only the
settlements.

36:51.009 --> 36:55.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They believe that the
Palestinians cannot
accept the Israeli presence or
existence,

36:55.480 --> 37:01.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, essentially, they are
asking the Palestinians
to accept the impossible. There
are forces

37:02.020 --> 37:04.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on both sides who are
maximalists now.

37:04.522 --> 37:09.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was always a time when you
had an Israeli
constituency for peace and a
Palestinian constituency

37:09.527 --> 37:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for peace. These constituencies
have been
shrinking in the last few years.
And you have

37:15.533 --> 37:19.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the demonization taking place on
both sides
and maximalist positions on both
sides.

37:19.437 --> 37:23.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hamas lives in its own world.
You have an
ossified Palestinian leadership.
And you have

37:23.074 --> 37:29.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an Israeli leadership that is
perpetuating
the status quo, unwilling or
unable, not courageous

37:29.047 --> 37:33.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enough to make initiative, given
the fact
that Israel is the stronger
party.

37:33.485 --> 37:37.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And talking about the
situation
in Israel, are there Israelis
who are willing

37:37.489 --> 37:39.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to look for that single?

37:39.090 --> 37:40.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID MAKOVSKY: Yes.

37:40.058 --> 37:41.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Israeli leaders.

37:41.826 --> 37:44.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MAKOVSKY: You see half of
the Knesset,
half of the Israeli parliament,
is talking

37:44.329 --> 37:46.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about this openly.

37:46.164 --> 37:50.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to your point on Jerusalem,
obviously,
Jerusalem has to be solved
between the parties.

37:50.435 --> 37:55.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can't find -- you can't
impose any solution
and you can't just let it kind
of unilaterally

37:55.240 --> 37:57.108 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
go in a certain director.

37:57.142 --> 38:01.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think there's ground rules
you could
set that -- in East Jerusalem
that would preserve

38:01.980 --> 38:07.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the outcome of a solution. And,
by the way,
if you look at some of the
positions, the

38:07.118 --> 38:11.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Palestinians know that the
Jewish neighborhoods
will be Israel and the
Palestinian neighborhoods

38:11.222 --> 38:12.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will be Palestine.

38:12.557 --> 38:14.359 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So I see...

38:14.392 --> 38:17.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HISHAM MELHEM: But you want to
hear an Israeli
leadership articulate a position
like -- you

38:17.495 --> 38:21.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want to hear an Israeli leader
saying Jerusalem
should be shared.

38:21.533 --> 38:26.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You want to see an Israeli
leader saying,
this is our outlook and our
vision of eventual

38:26.204 --> 38:29.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
peace. They don't do that. They
keep kicking
the can down the road.

38:29.507 --> 38:32.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MAKOVSKY: Part of the
problem is, you
have to realize, is these waves
of stabbings

38:32.944 --> 38:34.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that have radicalized the
situation.

38:34.846 --> 38:40.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have had like 180 stabbings
on the Palestinian
side that have convinced the
Israelis there

38:40.285 --> 38:42.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is no partner, and the
Palestinians think,
we don't have a solution and we
will never

38:42.954 --> 38:43.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
get to a solution.

38:43.755 --> 38:45.423 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

38:45.456 --> 38:46.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Hisham Melhem, I'm
sorry. David
Makovsky, I'm afraid we have got
to leave

38:46.758 --> 38:48.092 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it there.

38:48.126 --> 38:51.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will be coming back to this
discussion
many, many times again.

38:51.596 --> 38:56.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

38:56.601 --> 39:01.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HISHAM MELHEM: Thank you.

39:01.606 --> 39:09.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next, we begin a
series of
reports on India's work force.

39:09.380 --> 39:13.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, the country became
the world's
fastest growing economy. But the
benefits

39:13.851 --> 39:16.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have eluded many of its
citizens.

39:16.421 --> 39:21.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fred de Sam Lazaro has our first
report on
one group trying to reverse that
trend. It

39:21.693 --> 39:24.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is part of his ongoing series,
Agents for
Change.

39:24.729 --> 39:32.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The big
malls may have
arrived, but in India, food,
clothing and

39:32.070 --> 39:36.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
virtually everything else is
still bought
mostly from street vendors.

39:36.441 --> 39:42.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They, along with construction
laborers, domestics,
rickshaw drivers and rickshaw
pullers, in

39:42.480 --> 39:47.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fact, most workers in India's
economy, are,
quite literally, off the books,
says Indiana

39:47.819 --> 39:49.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
University's Sumit Ganguly.

39:49.587 --> 39:55.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SUMIT GANGULY, Indiana
University: Ninety
percent of the work force in
India is in the

39:55.727 --> 39:57.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so-called informal sector.

39:57.562 --> 40:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: That could
be a technical
term that means a very hard
life. They live

40:02.233 --> 40:07.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from day to day. That is, if
there's work
on any given day, they are paid
at the end

40:07.105 --> 40:09.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of it, less than $2 for most of
them.

40:09.841 --> 40:15.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUMIT GANGULY: These are people
who have no
Social Security provisions, who
have no health

40:15.179 --> 40:22.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
care provisions, who can be
hired and fired
at will. And yet, according to a
recent Credit

40:22.620 --> 40:30.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Suisse study, it's close to --
they contribute
close to 50 percent of India's
gross national

40:30.662 --> 40:32.630 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
product.

40:32.664 --> 40:37.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Not only are
they underappreciated,
but they fall easy prey to
corrupt officials.

40:37.302 --> 40:42.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The market outside of Delhi's
main mosque
has been here for more than 200
years. The

40:42.607 --> 40:47.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vendors complain that they're
subject to regular
harassment from police demanding
bribes or

40:47.612 --> 40:51.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from municipal authorities who
conduct regular
raids to evict them.

40:51.416 --> 40:56.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IMRAN KHAN, Vendor (through
translator): They
kicked us out from here in 2014,
citing security

40:56.721 --> 40:58.589 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
reasons.

40:58.623 --> 41:02.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Across
India's cities,
vendors like Imran Khan carry
tales of harassment,

41:02.894 --> 41:07.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sometimes along with their own
video, of stalls
dismantled and merchandise
confiscated.

41:07.398 --> 41:14.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IMRAN KHAN (through translator):
Then finally,
we went to NASVI, to Arbind, and
he said,

41:14.138 --> 41:16.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you have only one option,
straight to court.

41:16.541 --> 41:22.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Social
activist Arbind
Singh founded NASVI the National
Association

41:22.480 --> 41:24.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Street Vendors.

41:24.349 --> 41:27.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARBIND SINGH, Founder, NASVI:
All those who
were kicked out, have them come
to the office

41:27.552 --> 41:29.420 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tomorrow.

41:29.454 --> 41:32.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: We ran into
Singh in another
Delhi market, where he was
getting the familiar

41:32.223 --> 41:33.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
complaints from merchants.

41:34.025 --> 41:38.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARBIND SINGH: We had gone to
court for these
vendors, and in recent days,
they are having

41:38.496 --> 41:39.497 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
some trouble.

41:39.530 --> 41:40.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: They're
still be harassed?

41:40.932 --> 41:42.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARBIND SINGH: Yes, yes, yes.

41:42.600 --> 41:46.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: For 20 years
since it
began, Singh's group has
organized various

41:46.938 --> 41:52.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
informal workers. It lobbied
successfully
for a law to protect street
vendors, calling

41:52.443 --> 41:57.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a zoning and permit system.
And until
it's in place, the court said no
one can be

41:57.515 --> 41:59.317 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
evicted.

41:59.350 --> 42:03.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem, many officials
simply flout the
new law, preying on a population
that is poorly

42:03.955 --> 42:07.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
educated and doesn't fully
understand it or
their rights.

42:07.725 --> 42:13.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: This
19-year-old said
he'd been in business for a
year, selling

42:13.264 --> 42:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this street food staple called
panipuri.

42:15.833 --> 42:18.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: So, how much do they
take from you?

42:18.669 --> 42:20.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Who?

42:20.071 --> 42:21.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: The municipality
people.

42:21.839 --> 42:23.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
Nothing. I don't
give any money.

42:23.875 --> 42:28.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He worried
at first about
reprisals, but did finally tell
us he bribes

42:28.513 --> 42:34.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the authorities about $1.50 each
time they
come round. That's a third to a
half of a

42:34.152 --> 42:35.920 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
day's pay.

42:35.953 --> 42:41.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But protecting vendors like him
is only the
first step. The second is to
improve their

42:41.125 --> 42:42.794 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
skills.

42:42.827 --> 42:45.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's obviously untrained. He's
using his bare
hands. What would you do with
him?

42:45.930 --> 42:50.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARBIND SINGH: Well, first thing
is that we
need to organize, so he becomes
part of the

42:50.468 --> 42:52.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
organizing process. Then,
secondly, he goes
for the training.

42:52.703 --> 42:58.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: With help
from the tourism
ministry and the hospitality
industry, Singh's

42:58.976 --> 43:04.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
organization has put thousands
of street food
vendors through training on food
preparation,

43:04.816 --> 43:07.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
handling, service and storage.

43:07.919 --> 43:12.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Using street food festivals, the
group's message
to vendors is that with better
hygiene and

43:12.590 --> 43:18.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
food safety, their business can
grow. But
Singh says the new economy,
geared very much

43:18.362 --> 43:23.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the middle class, must begin
to help the
much larger number below it to
join it.

43:23.534 --> 43:27.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARBIND SINGH: All what we need
in a country
like ours is equality of
opportunity that

43:27.939 --> 43:32.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is very much part of our
constitution, that
there has to be equality of all.
I mean, you

43:32.844 --> 43:38.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can get a loan for a car. You
can't get a
loan for buying a rickshaw.

43:38.182 --> 43:42.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Today, some
350,000 people
across India pay a small
membership fee to

43:42.620 --> 43:44.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
belong to Singh's group.

43:44.422 --> 43:48.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MANOJ KUMAR RANE, India (through
translator):
We never did know the law. They
have helped

43:48.392 --> 43:50.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
us to find our voice.

43:50.161 --> 43:54.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Manoj Kumar
Rane says
being organized has allowed
vendors in his

43:54.632 --> 43:59.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
neighborhood to assert their
rights. There
are still reports of harassment
from the cops

43:59.403 --> 44:03.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and city people, he says, but
far fewer than
before.

44:03.741 --> 44:10.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Nidan has also started
micro-finance programs
and encouraged members to form
local co-opts

44:10.548 --> 44:16.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and savings clubs. Rani Harbans
Kaur helped
start this club, whose members
pool their

44:16.554 --> 44:19.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
savings to make small loans.

44:19.557 --> 44:25.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kaur, who's 40, has graduated
over the years
from a sidewalk stall to a
brick-and-mortar

44:25.763 --> 44:30.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
store, thanks to a series of
small loans she
says she has easily repaid.

44:30.401 --> 44:35.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARBIND SINGH: There was an
entrepreneur within
herself. We just unleashed that
with that

44:35.239 --> 44:37.041 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
access.

44:37.074 --> 44:40.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And India
needs to provide
a lot more access and employment
to a growing

44:40.745 --> 44:45.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
youthful population. The median
age is just
27.

44:45.216 --> 44:46.951 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Indiana University Professor
Ganguly:

44:46.984 --> 44:52.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUMIT GANGULY: We're talking
about entire
armies of young men who are
unemployed or

44:52.823 --> 45:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
underemployed, with expectations
which cannot
be reasonably fulfilled, unless
one sees a

45:02.166 --> 45:06.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
greater dispersion of jobs and
wealth in India.

45:06.571 --> 45:10.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Most of
those young workers
will likely wind up fending for
themselves

45:10.875 --> 45:18.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the informal economy. Arbind
Singh says
the social stability in this
land of 1.3 billion

45:18.082 --> 45:27.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
may well depend on organizing
and protecting
them and converting many of them
into entrepreneurs.

45:27.525 --> 45:31.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Fred de Sam
Lazaro in New Delhi.

45:31.395 --> 45:36.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In his next
report, Fred looks
at the plight of workers in a
remote rural

45:36.567 --> 45:41.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
region where debt and a deadly
disease trap
many in poverty.

45:41.505 --> 45:46.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Fred's reporting is a
partnership with the
Under-Told Stories Project at
University of

45:46.510 --> 46:00.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
St. Thomas in Minnesota.

46:00.224 --> 46:05.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Finally tonight: remembering the
country music
legend, and one of its outlaw
heroes, Merle

46:05.630 --> 46:06.897 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Haggard.

46:06.931 --> 46:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
William Brangham is back with a
look at his
career.

46:09.133 --> 46:15.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MERLE HAGGARD, Musician: I guess
I will just
always be the old country
singer, you know,

46:15.072 --> 46:20.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the guy that sings about all the
things that
happen.

46:20.711 --> 46:34.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Merle Haggard
rose to country
music stardom singing about what
he knew best,

46:34.425 --> 46:44.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
poverty, prison, heartache. Born
near Bakersfield,
California, Haggard was raised
in a converted

46:44.368 --> 46:47.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
railway car, the only home his
parents could
afford.

46:47.805 --> 46:51.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was 9 when his father died,
and before
long, he turned to petty crime
and landed

46:51.709 --> 46:54.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in San Quentin Prison, where he
saw Johnny
Cash play.

46:54.512 --> 46:57.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DON CUSIC, Belmont University:
Merle Haggard
lived outside the Law and got
thrown into

46:57.915 --> 46:59.650 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
prison for it.

46:59.684 --> 47:02.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Don Cusic is a
historian
of country music at Belmont
University in

47:02.653 --> 47:04.388 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Nashville.

47:04.422 --> 47:09.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DON CUSIC: If ever there was a
poster boy
for prison reform and prison
rehabilitation,

47:09.960 --> 47:11.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Merle Haggard would be exhibit
A.

47:11.729 --> 47:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Haggard turned
to writing
his own music after his release
in 1960, and

47:15.666 --> 47:20.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eventually scored hits with "The
Legend of
Bonnie &amp; Clyde" and "Sing Me
Back Home," which

47:20.037 --> 47:23.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was an ode to his time in San
Quentin.

47:23.841 --> 47:33.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Merle would find prison
stories. He would
find a single parent, a single
father in holding

47:33.884 --> 47:39.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Merle would find prison
stories. He would
find a single parent, a single
father in holding

47:39.223 --> 47:44.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things together, fight inside of
me sticking
up for our country. Just -- he
was unabashed

47:44.729 --> 47:46.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about telling the truth.

47:46.630 --> 47:51.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That came
through most famously
in Haggard's 1969 hit "Okie From
Muskogee,"

47:51.368 --> 48:01.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
which became a kind of
conservative anthem
at the height of the Vietnam
War.

48:01.212 --> 48:11.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DON CUSIC: It was an anthem for
the silent
majority for the middle class.
It was what

48:11.322 --> 48:17.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DON CUSIC: It was an anthem for
the silent
majority for the middle class.
It was what

48:17.862 --> 48:23.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the conservative -- in political
terms, conservative
movement, the conservative folks
were wanting

48:23.501 --> 48:25.302 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to say.

48:25.336 --> 48:28.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Haggard later
said he never
intended to be taken that way,
and later in

48:28.606 --> 48:30.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
life, he turned anti-war
himself.

48:30.875 --> 48:35.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also helped pioneer the
so-called outlaw
country genre, bucking the
highly polished

48:35.312 --> 48:37.114 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Nashville sound.

48:37.148 --> 48:42.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DON CUSIC: Haggard was an outlaw
in the sense
that he demanded creative
control. He didn't

48:42.419 --> 48:48.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do just what producers told him
to, lived
his own life, called his own
shots.

48:48.926 --> 48:53.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As his career
grew, the
accolades piled on, including
dozens of albums

48:53.731 --> 48:59.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and number one hits, album of
the year awards
and the Country Music Hall of
Fame. In 2010,

48:59.403 --> 49:01.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he was honored by the Kennedy
Center and at
a White House ceremony.

49:01.872 --> 49:05.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
In a day and age when so many
country singers

49:05.042 --> 49:09.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
claim to be rambling, gambling
outlaws, Merle
actually is one.

49:09.713 --> 49:11.715 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:11.749 --> 49:16.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Haggard also
continued performing
late into life. But a long
battle with pneumonia

49:16.120 --> 49:18.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
forced him off the road this
year.

49:18.122 --> 49:24.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Here he is back in 1978
performing "Sing Me
Back Home" on the PBS series
"Austin City

49:24.795 --> 49:28.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Here he is back in 1978
performing "Sing Me

JUDY WOODRUFF: And before we
leave you tonight,
an update on Brazil's fight
against the Zika

51:15.472 --> 51:17.241 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
virus.

51:17.274 --> 51:21.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The health ministry there says
the number
of confirmed and suspected cases
of microcephaly

51:21.712 --> 51:28.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has declined slightly. The
condition causes
babies to be born with
abnormally small heads.

51:28.519 --> 51:36.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cases went down from 5,235 two
weeks ago to
5,092 just last week.

Later tonight on PBS program
"NOVA": the discovery
of what scientists believe is a

explorers traveled
farther into south into North
America than

51:47.237 --> 51:53.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
previously thought. "NOVA" airs
tonight at

On the "NewsHour" online: Twenty
years ago,
a group of inmates at the Stock
Island Detention

51:59.049 --> 52:05.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Center in Key West, Florida,
adopted a family
of local ducks. Their efforts
grew into a

52:05.322 --> 52:12.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unique program where inmates now
care for
more than 150 animals, including
giant rabbits

52:12.796 --> 52:18.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and tiny horses. You can see
what it looks
like in a gallery by
photographer Kim Raff.

52:18.369 --> 52:20.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's on our home page.

52:20.170 --> 52:26.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on our science page, using
radioactive
dust buried at the bottom of the
oceans, two

52:26.043 --> 52:32.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
teams of researchers have
identified the location
and dates of supernovas that
exploded near

52:32.416 --> 52:38.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earth in the last 13 million
years. Why does
this matter? These massive
fireworks may have

52:38.956 --> 52:44.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
had an effect on human
evolution. You can
read more about the cosmic
findings.

52:44.395 --> 52:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:49.933 --> 52:51.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
