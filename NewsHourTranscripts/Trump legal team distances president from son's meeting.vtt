JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
is heading back to Europe
tonight, this time to France,

00:04.666 --> 00:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for its independence, or
Bastille Day, celebrations.

00:08.033 --> 00:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he leaves behind a swirl
over his son's efforts to get
damaging information about

00:14.500 --> 00:16.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, provided
by the Russian government.

00:16.900 --> 00:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Across Capitol Hill,
the big question was what the
bombshell revelations in Donald

00:25.133 --> 00:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump Jr.'s e-mails do to
the Russia investigation.

00:28.933 --> 00:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At his weekly news conference,
House Speaker Paul Ryan did
his best to avoid commenting

00:33.900 --> 00:34.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
directly.

00:34.900 --> 00:37.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

00:37.033 --> 00:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: We have a special counsel
that's doing an investigation

00:38.400 --> 00:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over at the Justice Department.

00:39.900 --> 00:42.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have an investigation
here in the House.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have an investigation
in the Senate.

00:44.666 --> 00:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's very important
that these professionals
in these committees
do their jobs, so that

00:49.733 --> 00:51.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we can get to the
bottom of all this.

00:51.766 --> 00:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: Mike Conaway, the
Texas Republican leading the
House investigation, didn't say

00:56.000 --> 00:58.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
much either.

00:58.066 --> 01:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you have any concerns about
what you're seeing now, the
press reports about these

01:00.933 --> 01:02.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
meetings that he took
with the Russian lawyer?

01:02.233 --> 01:04.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:04.266 --> 01:06.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE CONAWAY (R), Texas: Yes,
we're going to pursue every
lead that needs to pursue

01:06.033 --> 01:08.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and every clue that
needs to be pursued.

01:08.266 --> 01:09.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
QUESTION: Does this
lead need to be pursued?

01:09.266 --> 01:11.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:11.333 --> 01:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE CONAWAY: We're going
to pursue every lead that
makes sense to pursue.

01:13.433 --> 01:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In an interview to
be broadcast tomorrow on CBN,
President Trump said Russian

01:15.666 --> 01:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Vladimir Putin
wouldn't have wanted to
help him in the first place.

01:19.566 --> 01:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of
the United States: If Hillary
had won, our military would be

01:22.700 --> 01:24.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
decimated.

01:24.700 --> 01:27.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Our energy would be
much more expensive.

01:27.866 --> 01:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what Putin doesn't
like about me, and that's why
I say, why would he want me?

01:31.733 --> 01:36.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Last night,
Donald Trump Jr. offered
his first public defense
to FOX News Channel's

01:37.333 --> 01:39.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Sean Hannity.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP JR., Son of
Donald Trump: In retrospect, I
probably would have done things

01:40.133 --> 01:41.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a little differently.

01:41.366 --> 01:43.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Again, this was
before Russia mania.

01:43.133 --> 01:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This was before they were
building it up in the press.

01:45.133 --> 01:47.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For me, this was
opposition research.

01:47.733 --> 01:51.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: This morning,
Mr. Trump gave his eldest
son a rave review: "He
was open, transparent

01:53.366 --> 01:54.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and innocent.

01:54.766 --> 01:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is the greatest witch-hunt
in political history."

01:58.566 --> 02:03.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At his confirmation hearing to
be FBI director, Christopher
Wray was pressed on that point.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had a different view of
the investigations, including
special counsel Robert Mueller's

02:08.600 --> 02:10.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
probe, than the man
who nominated him.

02:10.700 --> 02:13.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:13.266 --> 02:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South
Carolina: I'm asking
you, as the future FBI
director, do you consider

02:14.500 --> 02:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this endeavor a witch-hunt?

02:16.500 --> 02:18.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER WRAY, FBI Director
Nominee: I do not consider
Director Mueller to be on

02:18.366 --> 02:20.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a witch-hunt.

02:20.366 --> 02:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Meanwhile, the
president's legal team tried to
distance their client from his

02:23.533 --> 02:25.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
namesake.

02:25.533 --> 02:27.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAY SEKULOW, Attorney For Donald
Trump: The president wasn't
aware of the meeting, didn't

02:27.566 --> 02:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
participate in the meeting,
didn't attend the meeting and
was only made aware of the

02:31.133 --> 02:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
e-mails -- actually, reading
the e-mails, seeing the
e-mails, was yesterday when they

02:35.200 --> 02:37.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were released.

02:37.233 --> 02:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: For Mr. Trump, the
Russia story has become a burden
he cannot escape, no matter

02:40.300 --> 02:42.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
how hard he tries.

02:42.400 --> 02:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every time he appears to be
moving in a different direction,
another disclosure puts it right

02:47.200 --> 02:48.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
back front and center.

02:48.966 --> 02:52.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Today, Russian Foreign
Minister Sergei Lavrov
seemed to sympathize.

02:52.766 --> 02:56.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SERGEI LAVROV, Russian Foreign
Minister (through translator):
Today, I turned on the TV again,

02:56.466 --> 02:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and all the Western channels
are discussing only this.

02:59.333 --> 03:04.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is amazing how serious
people can make a mountain
when there might not even be a

03:04.066 --> 03:06.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
molehill.

03:06.133 --> 03:09.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: There's sure to be
more discussion next week, when
the Senate Judiciary Committee

03:09.866 --> 03:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wants former Trump campaign
chairman Paul Manafort to
testify about his role.

03:15.900 --> 03:18.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm John Yang.

03:18.400 --> 03:22.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Later, the
president told Reuters
that he only learned
of Donald Trump Jr.'s

03:22.966 --> 03:25.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
meeting with a Russian
lawyer a few days ago.

03:25.366 --> 03:29.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he said -- quote --
"I think many people would
have held that meeting."

03:29.300 --> 03:34.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He also said that he
asked Russian President
Putin last week if he
had meddled in the U.S.

03:35.733 --> 03:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
election, and Putin that
said twice absolutely not.

03:38.400 --> 03:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will explore the legal
implications of all this
after the news summary.
