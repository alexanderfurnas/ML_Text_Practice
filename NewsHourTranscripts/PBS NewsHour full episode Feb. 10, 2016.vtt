HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.
Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff are
in Milwaukee,

00:08.208 --> 00:11.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Wisconsin, preparing for
tomorrow night's
Democratic debate.

00:11.645 --> 00:15.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: Two
clear winners
emerge from New Hampshire, but
what does this

00:15.782 --> 00:18.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mean for the rest of the
presidential race?

00:18.852 --> 00:24.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Also ahead, we kick off a
three-part series
from Egypt -- tonight, silenced
by fear five

00:24.157 --> 00:25.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
years after the revolution.

00:26.059 --> 00:28.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMAL SHARAF, April 6 Movement:
They know that
he's a symbol for the
revolution. And he's

00:28.929 --> 00:38.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
paying the price now. For what?
For saying
the truth, for opposing the
oppression.

00:38.438 --> 00:43.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Plus, a play
that tackles
the economic downfall of union
workers in

00:43.443 --> 00:45.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the once prosperous Reading,
Pennsylvania.

00:45.379 --> 00:49.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LYNN NOTTAGE, Pulitzer
Prize-Winning Playwright:
I decided that I want to go
about finding

00:50.017 --> 00:55.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of the source of this
trauma and figuring
out how we, as Americans, had
come to that

00:55.756 --> 00:59.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point where we could be living
so close to
poverty without recognizing it
on a daily

01:00.060 --> 01:01.461 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
basis.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:03.363 --> 01:07.567 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:07.668 --> 01:19.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The first two
presidential
contests of the year are in the
books, and

01:19.346 --> 01:24.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on both sides, it still looks
wide open. Tuesday's
stunning results shook up the
field again,

01:24.985 --> 01:29.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and left a couple of names by
the wayside.
The rest moved on, hoping
clarity will come

01:29.957 --> 01:31.792 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
soon.

01:31.892 --> 01:37.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A day after New Hampshire, the
Republican
field hit the ground running in
South Carolina,

01:37.164 --> 01:40.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
battleground for their next
primary, February
20.

01:40.834 --> 01:43.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
Come out and help us. I need
your support.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Oh, wow.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Fresh off last
night's big
win, Donald Trump planned a
rally in the Palmetto

01:48.976 --> 01:50.744 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
State tonight.

01:50.844 --> 01:54.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on NBC's "Today Show," he
announced he
will release his tax returns
over the next

01:54.448 --> 01:56.216 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
few months.

01:56.316 --> 01:58.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: They're going to
be surprised
at how little I pay. I fight
like hell not

01:58.185 --> 02:02.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to pay a lot of tax. And you
know what? Every
politician probably does. I
watched others

02:02.255 --> 02:06.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where they say, oh, I want to
pay taxes. I
fight like hell not to pay
taxes. I hate the

02:06.760 --> 02:08.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way the government spends my
money.

02:08.729 --> 02:12.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Meanwhile,
John Kasich sought
to build on his surge to second
place in New

02:12.632 --> 02:17.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hampshire. The Ohio governor has
mostly avoided
attacking his rivals, but said
he will answer

02:17.671 --> 02:19.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
if they start attacking him.

02:19.673 --> 02:22.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate:
I'm not going to be a pincushion
or a marshmallow,

02:22.175 --> 02:27.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but I'm also not going to spend
my time trying
to trash other people. I will
tell you why,

02:27.681 --> 02:32.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because if this message works,
it's fantastic.

02:32.552 --> 02:37.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In New Hampshire, I had millions
and millions
of dollars spent against me. And
you know

02:37.524 --> 02:42.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what I told them last night? The
light overcame
the darkness of negative
campaigning, and

02:42.929 --> 02:44.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I feel great about it.

02:44.231 --> 02:46.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:46.166 --> 02:49.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Texas Senator
Ted Cruz stumped
in Myrtle Beach today, after
officially being

02:49.369 --> 02:53.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
awarded third place in New
Hampshire. He'd
won in Iowa just a week earlier.

02:53.874 --> 02:56.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
Everyone said a conservative
couldn't compete

02:56.576 --> 03:02.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a more moderate New England
state like
New Hampshire. Those predictions
proved wrong.

03:02.215 --> 03:07.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a national campaign. And
one of the
most important conclusions
coming out of these

03:07.721 --> 03:12.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first two states is that the
only candidate
who can beat Donald Trump is me.

03:12.559 --> 03:16.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jeb Bush
finished fourth
in New Hampshire, but now hopes
to score his

03:16.496 --> 03:22.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first win of the year, in South
Carolina.
The Bush campaign released a new
radio ad

03:22.369 --> 03:25.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today that features his brother
former President
George W. Bush.

03:25.405 --> 03:28.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE W. BUSH, Former President
of the United
States: We need a strong leader
with experience,

03:28.875 --> 03:34.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ideas, and resolve. There's no
doubt in my
mind that Jeb Bush will be a
great commander

03:34.214 --> 03:35.982 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in chief for our military.

03:36.083 --> 03:40.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The other
Floridian in the
race, Senator Marco Rubio,
stumbled to fifth

03:40.520 --> 03:44.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in New Hampshire. He said today
he still expects
to win the Republican
nomination.

03:44.658 --> 03:50.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: Every nominee
of both parties
has a test, or more than one,
and it's a ride

03:50.530 --> 03:53.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you have got to fight
through. I'm the
only one that can quickly unite
the Republican

03:53.667 --> 03:57.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Party and take our message to
new voters.
And that's been consistent in
the polling

03:57.370 --> 04:00.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and you have seen it all over
the country.
I feel strongly about that.

04:00.574 --> 04:04.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The New
Hampshire results
also winnowed the GOP field
today. New Jersey

04:04.778 --> 04:09.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Governor Chris Christie and
Carly Fiorina
dropped out of the race after
poor showings.

04:09.549 --> 04:15.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As for the Democrats, they're
looking ahead
to their next contest, the
Nevada caucuses,

04:15.222 --> 04:20.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
10 days away. Fresh off his
landslide win
last night, Vermont Senator
Bernie Sanders

04:20.827 --> 04:25.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moved today to broaden his
appeal beyond his
mostly white base. He met with
Reverend Al

04:26.032 --> 04:30.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sharpton in New York to discuss
issues affecting
the African-American community.

04:30.303 --> 04:33.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, later, he took his message
to ABC's talk
show "The View."

04:33.340 --> 04:37.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
We have a lot of support within
the African-American

04:37.477 --> 04:42.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community. But I think, most
importantly,
I think the reason we will do
well is our

04:42.716 --> 04:48.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
views on criminal justice in
this country.
And that is, we have a broken
criminal justice

04:48.155 --> 04:54.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
system. Why should we in America
have more
people in jail, largely
African-American and

04:54.161 --> 04:56.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Latinos, than another other
country on Earth?

04:56.429 --> 04:58.431 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

04:58.532 --> 05:01.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For her part,
Hillary Clinton
was mostly out of public view,
after acknowledging

05:01.501 --> 05:06.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last night she needs to do
better appealing
to younger voters in particular.

05:06.306 --> 05:10.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The two Democrats are now
preparing to share
the stage tomorrow night, as PBS
hosts their

05:10.911 --> 05:14.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
next presidential debate in
Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

05:15.015 --> 05:18.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gwen and Judy have already
arrived to prepare
for the debate. They join us now
from the

05:18.718 --> 05:20.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Helen Bader Concert Hall at the
University
of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

05:21.021 --> 05:25.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gwen, Judy, I can you see there.
You all ready,
excited?

05:25.192 --> 05:27.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We are excited,
Hari.

05:27.194 --> 05:31.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are excited especially to be
doing this
on the weekend of the big,
iconic New Hampshire

05:31.932 --> 05:36.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
primary. The results there were
so interesting.
And we're going to be talking to
two of the

05:36.269 --> 05:40.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidates who made the most
news, Hillary
Clinton and Bernie Sanders, of
course.

05:40.207 --> 05:44.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have many, many questions
for them,
but, of course, if we told you
that, we would

05:44.544 --> 05:44.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
then have to kill you.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.746 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

05:46.846 --> 05:48.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So we're just going
to keep them
to ourselves until tomorrow
night.

05:49.049 --> 05:52.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You know, Hari,
every one of
these debates has been different
-- I guess

05:52.619 --> 05:57.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that goes without saying -- but
because they
have taken place at a different
moment in

05:57.257 --> 05:59.059 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the campaign.

05:59.159 --> 06:04.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, you have to say,
this is a
pretty important turning point,
because Bernie

06:04.731 --> 06:10.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders managed to come off with
a commanding
win from New Hampshire, as Gwen
just said.

06:10.971 --> 06:14.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we expect this to be an
enlightening encounter.

06:14.107 --> 06:17.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Do you have any
questions for
us to ask, Hari?

06:18.011 --> 06:20.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Sure. I think
there's a
Facebook group that have we been
working on.

06:20.647 --> 06:24.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have sent you a lot. So,
hopefully, that
give you some ideas. People are
very interested

06:24.884 --> 06:26.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and they're following you
closely.

06:26.820 --> 06:33.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, what we
have seen, Hari,
is that I noticed in the exit
polls yesterday

06:33.360 --> 06:38.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in New Hampshire, people were
asked how many
of them were affected by the
debates, and

06:38.198 --> 06:43.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a large percentage of voters say
they paid
attention to the debates. In one
way or another,

06:43.503 --> 06:45.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it affected their vote.

06:45.372 --> 06:47.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You know, this is
going to be
the first commercial-free debate
we have had

06:47.440 --> 06:51.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
this season. And public
broadcasting has a
special responsibility to bring
kind of a

06:51.978 --> 06:53.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
deeper view to this.

06:53.913 --> 06:57.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's what we're hoping we
can do. We're
hoping that people come away
learning more

06:57.117 --> 07:00.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about what their choices are.
That's really
what these debates are all
about. That's what

07:00.754 --> 07:04.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have been so successful at
so far this
year. And we just want to do our
part.

07:04.991 --> 07:09.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Gwen Ifill and
Judy Woodruff,
on the eve of the PBS debate,
thanks for joining

07:09.162 --> 07:09.729 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
us tonight.

07:09.829 --> 07:11.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Thanks, Hari.

07:11.197 --> 07:12.932 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you, Hari.

07:13.033 --> 07:16.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the day's
other news,
the U.S. Justice Department
filed a civil

07:16.369 --> 07:21.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rights lawsuit against Ferguson,
Missouri.
That's after the city council
vetoed to revise

07:21.308 --> 07:27.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parts of a consent decree on
police and court
reform. The decree grew out of
the killing

07:27.247 --> 07:32.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Michael Brown by a white
officer in 2014.
Local officials cited the cost
of compliance,

07:32.519 --> 07:35.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
but U.S. Attorney General
Loretta Lynch rejected
that argument.

07:35.689 --> 07:38.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORETTA LYNCH, U.S. Attorney
General: The
agreement that was being
reviewed and was

07:38.458 --> 07:44.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
discussed was painstakingly
negotiated by
both the department and the
city's own team.

07:44.664 --> 07:49.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was the agreement that was
to be decided
upon. The city was well aware
that by deciding

07:49.202 --> 07:53.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not to accept it that they were
choosing litigation.
This is their choice.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Ferguson Mayor
James Knowles
said earlier that the city was
prepared to

07:56.943 --> 07:59.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fight it out in court, if need
be.

08:00.013 --> 08:03.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Federal Reserve Chair Janet
Yellen sent new
signals today that the Central
Bank means

08:03.750 --> 08:09.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to go slow on additional
interest rate hikes.
At a House hearing, she said the
Fed's Open

08:09.255 --> 08:14.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Market Committee is keeping a
close eye on
global economic weakness and
turmoil in world

08:14.427 --> 08:16.229 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
markets.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANET YELLEN, Federal Reserve
Chair: The FOMC
anticipates that economic
conditions will

08:18.531 --> 08:24.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
evolve in a manner that will
warrant only
gradual increases in the federal
funds rate.

08:24.204 --> 08:29.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition, the committee
expects that the
federal funds rate is likely to
remain for

08:29.642 --> 08:34.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some time below the levels that
are expected
to prevail in the longer run.

08:34.714 --> 08:38.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Central
Bank raised
interest rates in December for
the first time

08:38.618 --> 08:43.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in nearly a decade. Its next
decision on rates
comes next month.

08:43.356 --> 08:48.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Nigeria, officials are
blaming the Islamist
Boko Haram group for deadly new
bombings.

08:48.928 --> 08:53.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two women blew themselves up in
a refugee
camp today, killing at least 58
people and

08:53.133 --> 08:58.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
wounding nearly 80. The
attackers struck northeast
of Maiduguri, the largest city
in the northeastern

08:58.371 --> 09:01.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
portion of Nigeria, and the
militants' home
base.

09:01.941 --> 09:07.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATO is moving to beef up its
presence in
the Baltics and Eastern Europe
to deter possible

09:07.647 --> 09:12.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian aggression. Alliance
defense ministers
met in Brussels today and agreed
to set up

09:12.285 --> 09:17.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new outposts in the region and
bolster troop
numbers. The measure also calls
for regular

09:17.590 --> 09:24.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
war games and a rapid-reaction
force. Russia
has warned any such move will
threaten European

09:24.164 --> 09:26.099 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stability.

09:26.199 --> 09:30.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. policy in Syria came under
fire on multiple
fronts today. Syrian rebels and
the governments

09:30.570 --> 09:35.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of France and Turkey all
complained of weakness
in Washington's actions.

09:35.241 --> 09:39.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jonathan Rugman of Independent
Television
News is on the ground in Turkey.

09:39.846 --> 09:46.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JONATHAN RUGMAN: Russian
airstrikes like these
in the town of Tell Rifaat
yesterday have

09:46.252 --> 09:51.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sent rebels fighting President
Assad to new
levels of despair.

09:51.357 --> 09:56.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Iranians are certainly
supporting the
Assad regime, sending Shia
militiamen and

09:56.663 --> 10:01.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hezbollah fighters. And the
Russians are not
talking about a cease-fire until
March the

10:02.035 --> 10:08.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1st, clearly hoping these men
will take much
more territory before attempts
at peace talks

10:08.541 --> 10:10.176 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
begin again.

10:10.276 --> 10:15.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Showing me a map of Aleppo under
siege is
Zakaria Malahifji, political
chief of one

10:15.915 --> 10:22.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the largest Syrian rebel
groups armed and
funded by the CIA. But he says
the Americans

10:22.889 --> 10:26.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
have deprived his men of
anti-aircraft missiles
to defend themselves.

10:27.026 --> 10:29.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ZAKARIA MALAHIFJI, Rebel
Political Chief (through
translator): The Americans are
doing nothing.

10:29.896 --> 10:36.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We tried to raise our voice, but
it was no
use. They know what's going on,
but, until

10:36.269 --> 10:40.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now, they're not using their
pressure for
a political solution. And how
are we going

10:40.440 --> 10:45.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to achieve this political
solution while the
Russians are destroying it?

10:45.278 --> 10:50.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JONATHAN RUGMAN: France's
foreign minister
has also had enough. Today,
Laurent Fabius

10:50.984 --> 10:56.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
announced that he's stepping
down. President
Assad is gaining strength, he
said, complaining

10:56.656 --> 11:01.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a lack of commitment from the
American
side.

11:01.227 --> 11:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Turks feel the same way.
President Erdogan
has accused Washington of
causing a regional

11:07.166 --> 11:14.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bloodbath by supporting Kurdish
groups in
Syria, which he regards as
terrorists. With

11:14.807 --> 11:21.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
injured Syrians now filling
Turkish hospitals,
the Turks may be tempted to
intervene themselves,

11:21.714 --> 11:25.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to defend both civilians and
rebels and push
back the Kurds.

11:25.885 --> 11:29.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Turkey also
rebuked the
United Nations today for
insisting that it

11:29.455 --> 11:34.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take in thousands of Syrian
refugees from
Aleppo. The Turkish prime
minister said that

11:34.527 --> 11:37.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would amount to aiding in ethnic
cleansing.

11:37.897 --> 11:41.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, the U.S.
Senate moved
to impose new sanctions on North
Korea, after

11:41.367 --> 11:45.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its recent nuclear test and
satellite launch.
The legislation targets the
communist state's

11:45.838 --> 11:50.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ability to access money for
nuclear warheads
and long-range missiles. A
similar version

11:50.877 --> 11:52.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
already passed the House.

11:52.912 --> 11:57.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Wall Street struggled to a
mixed finish
after oil prices sank again. The
Dow Jones

11:58.051 --> 12:03.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
industrial average lost nearly
100 points
to close at 15914. The Nasdaq
rose almost

12:03.222 --> 12:07.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
15 points, but the S&amp;P 500
slipped a fraction
of a point.

12:07.994 --> 12:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
how candidates
hope to sway the South's more
diverse electorate;

12:13.433 --> 12:19.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where leaders of the Arab spring
are five
years later; the CIA deputy
director on imminent

12:19.339 --> 12:33.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
terror threats; and much more.

12:33.686 --> 12:37.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We look ahead now to Thursday's
Democratic
presidential debate, and the
next phase of

12:37.590 --> 12:40.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the campaign for both parties
coming out of
New Hampshire.

12:40.793 --> 12:44.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining us are Susan Page,
Washington bureau
chief for USA Today, and Reid
Wilson, chief

12:44.430 --> 12:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
political correspondent for the
politics and
polling Web site Morning
Consult.

12:48.001 --> 12:51.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All right, let's start with the
Republicans
first. How meaningful was
Trump's win?

12:51.871 --> 12:53.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau
Chief, USA Today:
Pretty meaningful.

12:53.706 --> 12:57.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was -- he not only won
among traditional
Republican voters in New
Hampshire. He won

12:57.343 --> 13:01.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
among nontraditional Republican
voters, among
independents who voted in the
Republican primary,

13:02.015 --> 13:06.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
among people who were voting in
a Republican
primary for the first time. So
he is clearly

13:06.386 --> 13:09.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
drawing new people into the
Republican coalition.

13:09.288 --> 13:13.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that raises a possibility
that he will
change what it means to be a
Republican.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What about
Kasich coming
in second?

13:15.862 --> 13:19.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON, Morning Consult:
Kasich essentially
saved off the end of his
campaign. The problem

13:19.599 --> 13:22.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for him going forward, though,
is that he's
likely to be living essentially
hand to mouth

13:23.036 --> 13:24.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the rest of the campaign.

13:24.971 --> 13:29.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He spent most of his war chest
in New Hampshire
because it was either do or die
there. Now,

13:29.742 --> 13:33.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as he raises money in the wake
of a surprisingly
good showing, the first time I
think we can

13:33.780 --> 13:38.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ever say 16 percent is a
surprisingly good
showing, he will be essentially
spending every

13:38.284 --> 13:42.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
dollar he possibly can on
television ads to
introduce himself to voters in
South Carolina,

13:42.989 --> 13:47.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then if he makes it out of
there alive,
to voters in Nevada and then on
to the Super

13:47.994 --> 13:49.929 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Tuesday states.

13:50.029 --> 13:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Rubio even
admitted yesterday
kind of his -- or day before --
in his concession

13:53.966 --> 13:58.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speech, saying, this is my
fault, this is
my debate performance, it won't
happen again.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Was it that singular event that
just...

14:00.540 --> 14:07.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: I think we know from
the exit
polls of voters that the debate
loomed very

14:07.180 --> 14:11.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
large in the last-minute
decisions made by
a lot of Republican voters.
Clearly, it really

14:11.384 --> 14:15.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hurt Rubio. We thought he was on
a path to
be second or, at worst, third.

14:15.655 --> 14:19.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That didn't happen. So, I think
that the next
debate, he's going to have a lot
to prove.

14:19.592 --> 14:24.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not that he's damaged
beyond the possibility
of recovery, but he's definitely
damaged.

14:24.197 --> 14:29.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He needs to prove that he can be
more self-assured,
be more self-confident and
especially be more

14:29.235 --> 14:31.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
spontaneous in the next debate.

14:31.270 --> 14:34.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
speaking of self-assured,
confident, spontaneous, Jeb
Bush.

14:34.574 --> 14:39.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: Jeb Bush is -- this
result in
New Hampshire was just about the
worst thing

14:39.679 --> 14:44.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that could have happened for
sort of the business
lane Republicans who are all
trying to find

14:44.183 --> 14:46.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one candidate to coalesce
around.

14:46.285 --> 14:50.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It looked like Rubio coming out
of Iowa. Rubio
finishes fifth in New Hampshire,
Jeb Bush

14:50.790 --> 14:54.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only barely ahead of him. And
now they have
got a new contender for the
crown in John

14:55.094 --> 14:59.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kasich, who will at least stick
around and
try to win those voters going
forward. So,

14:59.866 --> 15:03.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this means a divided business
lane of the
Republican Party.

15:03.903 --> 15:07.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Ted Cruz has his avenue,
especially among
evangelical voters, who play a
huge role in

15:07.940 --> 15:12.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South Carolina. And Donald Trump
has his fans,
as Susan says, largely new folks
coming into

15:13.012 --> 15:18.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the process. It's hard to see
how the business
end coalesces before we get to
the really

15:18.885 --> 15:21.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
big Super Tuesday states on
March 1.

15:21.287 --> 15:24.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Speaking of
the business
end, how much does the war chest
matter at

15:24.590 --> 15:28.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this point? If you're Jeb Bush,
you have got
a fair amount of support.
Perhaps if you're

15:28.461 --> 15:30.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ted Cruz, you have picked up
some.

15:30.263 --> 15:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: So, tell me how much
good has
that done Jeb Bush so far. Not
much. He spent

15:34.033 --> 15:36.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than anybody else on ads,
on organization.

15:36.836 --> 15:40.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, of course, we do enter a
phase of the
campaign where it matters a
little more in

15:40.239 --> 15:45.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these big states. You do less
retail campaigning.
TV ads can mean more. But so far
this has

15:45.878 --> 15:53.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not rescued Jeb Bush. This has
been a campaign
of momentum, enthusiasm, and
anger, not one

15:53.419 --> 15:55.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
where money talks.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK. And Ted
Cruz seemed
to spend the least amount of
money and had

15:58.524 --> 16:03.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a pretty respectable showing in
New Hampshire,
not where his demographic, his
base is.

16:03.629 --> 16:09.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: He spent about $18
per vote,
which is a bargain in this day
and age, when

16:09.101 --> 16:14.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeb Bush was spending somewhere
around $1,200
per vote, including the super
PAC.

16:14.440 --> 16:18.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cruz's opportunities lie ahead,
no only in
South Carolina, where, as I say,
evangelical

16:18.778 --> 16:23.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters play a huge role, but
also in those
March 1 Super Tuesday primaries.
A lot of

16:23.783 --> 16:28.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Southern state are voting that
day, Alabama,
Mississippi, Georgia, Virginia,
Texas, Cruz's

16:28.688 --> 16:34.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
home state, Oklahoma, all places
where conservatives
play a huge role and especially
evangelical

16:34.594 --> 16:36.529 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
conservatives.

16:36.629 --> 16:39.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK. Today, we
heard basically
Fiorina and Christie deciding to
leave. Surprised?

16:39.732 --> 16:41.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: No, not a surprise.

16:41.667 --> 16:46.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, if they hadn't
left, they were
already irrelevant I think to
the conversation

16:46.239 --> 16:49.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going forward. That is the
situation that
Ben Carson now finds himself in.
He may or

16:50.076 --> 16:53.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
may not drop out of this race.
It doesn't
really matter. He's been
discounted. We're

16:54.046 --> 16:57.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down to about five candidates
who matter.
And we will see what happens
going forward

16:57.617 --> 17:00.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as we head into these bigger
states at a faster
pace.

17:00.653 --> 17:04.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That's still a
crowded field.
It's not a two-person or
three-person field.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
REID WILSON: It is.

17:06.492 --> 17:08.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as we're talking about the
early states,
Susan brings up a very important
point here

17:08.794 --> 17:12.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the pacing of all this.
The early states
are less about collecting the
delegates you

17:12.899 --> 17:16.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need to win the nomination once
you get to
Cleveland for the Republicans or
Pennsylvania,

17:17.069 --> 17:19.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Philadelphia, for the Democrats.

17:19.138 --> 17:23.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The early states are about
building momentum
into those later voting states
where voters

17:23.376 --> 17:27.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are just now starting to tune
in, just starting
to pay attention. And those
voters who haven't

17:27.647 --> 17:32.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been paying attention before
have seen now
Bernie Sanders win big in New
Hampshire and

17:32.418 --> 17:37.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump win big and Ted
Cruz's surprise
in Iowa. Those are the names
that are getting

17:37.523 --> 17:38.824 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the most attention nationally.

17:38.925 --> 17:40.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Let's talk a
little bit
about the Democrats.

17:40.626 --> 17:43.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders' win, does it
translate into
a win in Nevada or South
Carolina?

17:43.696 --> 17:49.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: We will find out. It
was a big
win. This was stunning for a
candidate who

17:49.802 --> 17:54.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has not actually been a Democrat
before to
win the Democratic primary in
New Hampshire

17:54.507 --> 17:59.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the person we thought was
once the likely
the front-runner, the likely
nominee by such

17:59.745 --> 18:02.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a huge margin. That's really
historic.

18:02.615 --> 18:06.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also has money. It's not that
he starts
out with a big base of support
in a state

18:06.852 --> 18:11.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like South Carolina, but he's
raising a ton
of dough. And that means that he
may not have

18:11.891 --> 18:15.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fate that some New Hampshire
winners have
had, which is where they can't
exploit and

18:15.594 --> 18:17.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
capitalize on that victory.

18:17.496 --> 18:20.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's in a position where his
finances mean
that this race on the Democratic
side, I think,

18:20.933 --> 18:22.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is guaranteed to go into the
spring.

18:22.768 --> 18:26.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the
weaknesses point
to is, how does he translate his
support in

18:26.105 --> 18:30.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New Hampshire and Iowa into a
far more racially
diverse population in the rest
of the country?

18:30.276 --> 18:33.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: It's going to be a
huge challenge
for him, and it's an opportunity
for Hillary

18:33.279 --> 18:39.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton, who has a far deeper
bench base and
history with African-American
voters who dominate

18:39.785 --> 18:43.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in South Carolina, with Hispanic
voters who
dominate in Nevada.

18:43.622 --> 18:48.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders, however, is getting the
opportunity
to introduce himself. In just
the -- what

18:48.361 --> 18:52.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was it, about 20 hours after the
polls closed
in New Hampshire, his campaign
said they had

18:53.065 --> 18:58.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
raised something like $5
million, which is
-- that's a good month for some
candidates.

18:58.604 --> 19:03.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders is going to have the
resources necessary
to keep his message on the air
in South Carolina,

19:03.576 --> 19:07.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which hasn't seen a lot of
advertising spending
yet, in Nevada and beyond.

19:07.179 --> 19:09.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, finally,
what's the
Clinton camp thinking today?

19:09.215 --> 19:12.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Well, I think they
are distressed.
I think they are distressed by
her showing.

19:12.585 --> 19:16.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They had hoped maybe they would
keep it to
single digits. That didn't
happen in New Hampshire.

19:17.056 --> 19:21.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, you look at what voters
told us in the
exit polls. They don't find her
honest. They

19:21.894 --> 19:25.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't find her trustworthy. She
has a huge
deficit when it comes to younger
voters, voters

19:25.798 --> 19:27.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
under 30.

19:27.566 --> 19:29.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are issues that she's
going to have
to address in the next couple of
weeks if

19:29.935 --> 19:31.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
she's going to prevail.

19:31.404 --> 19:34.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REID WILSON: The exit polls were
a disaster
for the Clinton campaign.

19:34.407 --> 19:38.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among voters who said they
wanted an honest
and trustworthy candidate,
Sanders won more

19:38.644 --> 19:42.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than 90 percent of the vote.
Even among voters
who said that Clinton said
shared their views,

19:42.882 --> 19:45.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
40 percent of those voters voted
for Bernie
Sanders.

19:45.618 --> 19:50.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's really hard to see, at this
moment, any
sort of silver lining for the
Clinton campaign

19:50.222 --> 19:53.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coming out of New Hampshire, a
state that
effectively launched Bill
Clinton into the

19:53.926 --> 19:55.661 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
White House.

19:55.761 --> 19:59.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Reid Wilson from
Morning Consult, Susan Page from
USA Today,

19:59.198 --> 20:02.368 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thanks so much.

20:02.468 --> 20:06.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: Thank you.

20:06.772 --> 20:10.976 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
REID WILSON: Thank you.

20:11.077 --> 20:17.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Five years ago
today, Egypt
stood at the edge of tectonic
changes. The

20:17.116 --> 20:23.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
protests that began January 25,
2011, in Cairo's
Tahrir Square would soon cause
the military-led

20:23.456 --> 20:26.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ouster of longtime President
Hosni Mubarak.

20:26.859 --> 20:31.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was the culmination of the
so-called 18
days, and a high point of what
became known

20:31.297 --> 20:38.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as the Arab Spring. In 2012,
Egyptians elected
Mohammed Morsi of the Muslim
Brotherhood president.

20:38.537 --> 20:44.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The next year, he was deposed by
the military
and its top general, Abdel
Fattah El-Sisi.

20:44.844 --> 20:47.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sisi was then elected president
in 2014.

20:47.813 --> 20:53.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It has been five years of
upheaval and tumult.
And, today, the picture from
Cairo is much

20:53.519 --> 20:56.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
changed from those days of
protest.

20:56.722 --> 21:00.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Nick
Schifrin begins
tonight our series of three
reports, 5 Years

21:01.093 --> 21:02.428 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
On.

21:02.528 --> 21:06.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Take me back five
years ago.

21:06.398 --> 21:11.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: We kept crying from
happiness. I couldn't
believe it, we were saying. We
did it. We

21:11.470 --> 21:14.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
made it. It was a dream that
came true.

21:14.940 --> 21:17.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: All Egyptians are happy.

21:17.810 --> 21:25.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I
cried. I cried.
I was ecstatic. We laughed,
jumped, hugged

21:25.851 --> 21:29.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
my colleagues, shouted. We did
everything.

21:29.321 --> 21:34.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: How exciting was
that time?

21:34.193 --> 21:36.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): After
the revolution,
we felt the highest stage of
freedom and expression

21:36.962 --> 21:39.932 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in our lives.

21:40.032 --> 21:50.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Five years later,
the revolution's
protagonists still revel in 18
days they call

21:50.543 --> 21:59.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
utopia. But, today, the square
that toppled
a dictator is empty. There are
no celebrations

21:59.552 --> 22:02.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and no protesters, because
protests are illegal.

22:02.288 --> 22:08.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMAL SHARAF, April 6 Movement:
During Mubarak,
at least we had the chance to
speak. Now we

22:08.260 --> 22:18.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are ruled by weapons. We can't
open our mouths.
If you go into the street, you
can get shot.

22:18.671 --> 22:24.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Today, Egypt is
tense. Above
Cairo's streets, President Abdel
Fattah El-Sisi

22:24.643 --> 22:29.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and his government keep a close
watch. They
have forcibly muted almost all
opposition.

22:30.049 --> 22:36.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When a state TV anchor
criticized him, she
was suspended. When a comedian
spoofed police

22:36.388 --> 22:41.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by blowing up condoms like
balloons, a politician
called for him to be assaulted,
forcing him

22:41.594 --> 22:43.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to go into hiding.

22:43.963 --> 22:49.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Adding to the fear, an Italian
student was
found dead just last week, his
body tortured.

22:49.268 --> 22:55.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In total, 40,000 political
prisoners fill
Egypt's jails. Hundreds, perhaps
thousands

22:55.274 --> 22:59.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more have disappeared into
secret prisons.

22:59.245 --> 23:03.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government crackdown peaked
last month
in downtown Cairo. This has long
been the

23:03.949 --> 23:08.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
epicenter for people who oppose
the government.
And this used to be full of
cafes. You can

23:08.621 --> 23:14.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see they have all been closed
now, clearly
designed to send the message
that nobody was

23:14.159 --> 23:16.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
allowed the space to meet or
organize.

23:17.029 --> 23:20.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In today's Egypt, is there
freedom of speech?

23:20.633 --> 23:25.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MUSTAFA MAHER, Egypt (through
translator):
It's completely disappeared.
Either you're

23:25.571 --> 23:29.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Sisi supporter and you can
freely talk,
or you oppose him even in a
limited way, like

23:30.075 --> 23:37.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Facebook profile picture or on
Twitter,
and you will be brought to
justice.

23:37.783 --> 23:42.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Mustafa Maher is
the brother
of Ahmed Maher, one of Egypt's
best-known

23:42.121 --> 23:50.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
activists. Ahmed Maher helped
lead the revolution.
On the streets, he became an
icon, mobbed

23:50.162 --> 23:51.897 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wherever he went.

23:51.997 --> 23:55.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMAL SHARAF: "Dear Ahmed Maher,
we call for
your immediate and unconditional
release."

23:55.634 --> 24:00.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But, today,
Maher's admirers
can only write him letters. Two
years ago,

24:00.272 --> 24:05.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he and many of the revolution's
leaders were
arrested for protesting a new
law that banned

24:05.177 --> 24:10.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
protesting. He has spent every
day since in
solitary confinement.

24:10.449 --> 24:15.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Amal Sharaf worked hand-in-hand
with Maher.
Will Ahmed see any of these?

24:15.621 --> 24:18.090 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Reham Ibrahim is Maher's wife.

24:18.190 --> 24:22.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REHAM IBRAHIM, Wife of Ahmed
Maher (through
translator): They don't allow
anything written,

24:22.261 --> 24:27.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not even personal messages.
Anything that
will provide any hope, they
block.

24:27.466 --> 24:33.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMAL SHARAF: They know he's a
symbol for the
revolution. And he's paying the
price now.

24:33.572 --> 24:40.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For what? For saying the truth,
for opposing
the oppression.

24:40.612 --> 24:46.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Maher's daughter,
Meral (ph),
is 8. Each time she visits her
dad in prison,

24:46.251 --> 24:50.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she draws him a portrait. Last
month, the
portrait was of her crying.

24:50.356 --> 24:56.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REHAM IBRAHIM (through
translator): I never
imagined years would pass this
way, and I

24:56.362 --> 24:58.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
don't know when they will end.

24:58.464 --> 25:00.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So what's her name?

25:00.299 --> 25:03.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tariq El Khouly (ph) was also a
member of
the April 6 Movement. He painted
the group's

25:03.969 --> 25:10.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
flag and demonstrated in Tahrir
Square. He
protested with Maher, but Khouly
gets to celebrate

25:10.509 --> 25:14.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his daughter's birthday in
person, because
he chose a different path.

25:14.213 --> 25:20.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we're in your office. And
this is a photo
of you and the president. What
is the significance

25:20.319 --> 25:24.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for you of this photo?

25:24.990 --> 25:27.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TARIQ EL KHOULY, Egyptian
Parliament Member
(through translator): Egypt
needs a president

25:27.626 --> 25:34.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that can unite Egyptians in a
dangerous time,
when the society is vulnerable
and could become

25:34.967 --> 25:36.802 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
another Syria.

25:36.902 --> 25:40.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: El Khouly might
still call
himself a revolutionary, but
he's not protesting

25:40.906 --> 25:42.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
anymore. He's a member of
parliament.

25:42.775 --> 25:46.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TARIQ EL KHOULY (through
translator): We left
the political zone empty. We
should now be

25:46.478 --> 25:48.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
filling this space.

25:48.414 --> 25:51.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The opposition
complains that
space has been co-opted, because
even President

25:51.250 --> 25:57.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sisi praises the revolution. El
Khouly defends
the president by arguing
lawmaking is the

25:57.523 --> 25:59.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
revolution's next step.

25:59.358 --> 26:03.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TARIQ EL KHOULY (through
translator): It's
time to protect the revolution
through politics

26:03.729 --> 26:10.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and to build strong parties in
parliament
and government.

26:10.702 --> 26:14.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But what kind of
government?
And what are those parties'
priorities?

26:15.040 --> 26:22.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ABDEL RAHIM ALI, Egyptian
Parliament Member
(through translator): When the
matter has

26:22.648 --> 26:28.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do with national security and
Egypt's place
in the world, we will act as one
man, called

26:28.654 --> 26:30.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Abdel Fattah El-Sisi.

26:30.522 --> 26:34.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Abdel Rahim Ali
is a member
of Parliament in the same
coalition as Tariq

26:34.560 --> 26:40.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
El Khouly. They are supposed to
check presidential
power. But he and hundreds of
colleagues hastily

26:40.432 --> 26:44.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
approved Sisi's campaign.

26:44.703 --> 26:52.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Rahim Ali broadcasts that
support. He is a
popular TV anchor who indicts
the government's

26:52.177 --> 26:59.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
opponents on national
television. That's a
recording of Ahmed Maher's
private phone conversation.

26:59.451 --> 27:05.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ali airs tapped phone calls, in
order to paint
revolutionaries like Maher as
disloyal Western

27:05.290 --> 27:06.892 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
spies.

27:06.992 --> 27:12.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ABDEL RAHIM ALI (through
translator): The
devil Ahmed Maher is plotting to
get loads

27:12.264 --> 27:15.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of money from abroad and destroy
Egypt.

27:15.801 --> 27:18.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Your critics
accuse you of
McCarthyism.

27:18.103 --> 27:22.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ABDEL RAHIM ALI (through
translator): McCarthyism
is something else. We referred
to a group

27:22.307 --> 27:28.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of parties that want to kidnap
the whole country
on behalf of foreigners.

27:28.547 --> 27:33.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Ali supports the
kind of nationwide
surveillance he performs in his
own office.

27:33.185 --> 27:38.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
His main target? The most
organized opposition,
the Muslim Brotherhood.

27:38.290 --> 27:42.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Three-and-a-half years ago, the
Brotherhood's
Mohammed Morsi became Egypt's
first democratically

27:42.594 --> 27:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
elected president. When the
military overthrew
him, and when Sisi took power,
the Brotherhood

27:47.933 --> 27:50.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was labeled a terrorist group.

27:50.335 --> 27:56.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're the government's primary
culprit,
even for natural disasters. When
heavy flooding

27:56.775 --> 28:01.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
killed seven people in
Alexandria, the government
released this video of alleged
Muslim Brotherhood

28:01.580 --> 28:06.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
members and accused them of
clogging the sewers.

28:06.285 --> 28:11.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ABDEL RAHIM ALI (through
translator): The
conspiracy is still there. They
are trying

28:12.057 --> 28:16.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to achieve tomorrow what wasn't
achieved yesterday
using the counter-revolution
powers from the

28:16.962 --> 28:18.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Muslim Brotherhood.

28:18.797 --> 28:20.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But right now,
thousands of
Muslim Brotherhood members are
in prison.

28:20.599 --> 28:22.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the leaders who aren't
jailed are in exile.

28:22.534 --> 28:28.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMR DARRAG, Muslim Brotherhood:
The media
and the black campaigning has
managed to cultivate

28:28.106 --> 28:30.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some sort of fear inside many
Egyptians.

28:30.175 --> 28:34.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Amr Darrag is the
most senior
Muslim Brotherhood leader not in
prison. He

28:34.646 --> 28:36.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Skyped with us from Istanbul.

28:36.548 --> 28:42.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMR DARRAG: Sisi right now, what
he's doing,
he's trying to close all room
for work, not

28:42.254 --> 28:47.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just for the Brotherhood, but
all of the political
and social players in Egypt.

28:47.793 --> 28:54.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And that means
Muslim Brotherhood
supporters still in Egypt need
to hide; 22-year-old

28:54.132 --> 29:00.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mahmoud, not his real name,
comes from a Brotherhood
family. In 2013, he joined
protests against

29:00.572 --> 29:05.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the military takeover,
demonstrations that
ended with a massacre of
Brotherhood supporters.

29:05.777 --> 29:09.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, he stays quiet. He would
only speak
to us if we hid his face.

29:09.715 --> 29:15.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAHMOUD, Egypt (through
translator): You can
never feel comfortable about
your security.

29:15.621 --> 29:25.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The leaders are either
imprisoned or killed.
Many supporters have been
disappeared. There

29:25.263 --> 29:29.768 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is no Muslim brother still free.

29:29.868 --> 29:35.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And the secular
activists aren't
free either. They stay inside,
knowing they

29:35.607 --> 29:37.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lack public support.

29:37.476 --> 29:41.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMAL SHARAF: No public protests,
not because
we are afraid, because we have
been through

29:41.747 --> 29:47.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of demonstrators, and a
lot of people
got killed because it will do
nothing. People

29:47.219 --> 29:49.021 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are not with us.

29:49.121 --> 29:52.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Perhaps the only
activists
keeping the faith are the very
ones the Egyptian

29:52.324 --> 29:53.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
government has silenced.

29:53.659 --> 29:57.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In 2013, "PBS NewsHour"
interviewed Ahmed
Maher.

29:57.462 --> 30:02.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AHMED MAHER, Activist (through
translator):
I am convinced that January 25
was the beginning

30:02.634 --> 30:04.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the revolution, not the whole
revolution.

30:05.003 --> 30:07.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: We played the
clip for Maher's
family.

30:07.572 --> 30:15.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AHMED MAHER (through
translator): That's why
the results of the revolution
are not known

30:15.180 --> 30:16.948 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
yet.

30:17.049 --> 30:28.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REHAM IBRAHIM (through
translator): My reaction
to the video was not to what he
said, but

30:28.593 --> 30:41.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Ahmed himself. For most
people, he is just
a figure, but, for me, he is my
life.

30:41.440 --> 30:45.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MUSTAFA MAHER: That instead of
longing to
move -- is already our home,
where I as a

30:45.577 --> 30:50.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
citizen have dignity and freedom
in my country.

30:50.449 --> 30:57.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But, today, Maher
has no freedom.
And his dream of the revolution
is a dream

30:57.689 --> 30:58.523 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
deferred.

30:58.623 --> 31:00.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nick Schifrin, "PBS NewsHour,"
Cairo.

31:00.726 --> 31:05.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tomorrow
night, Nick Schifrin
will look at the central role of
Egypt's courts

31:05.931 --> 31:20.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the revolution.

31:20.245 --> 31:22.080 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Stay with us.

31:22.180 --> 31:25.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
Supreme Court
halts President Obama's landmark
climate change

31:25.383 --> 31:29.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plan, and "Sweat," a play that
doesn't shy
away from hard work.

31:29.788 --> 31:34.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, yesterday America's
top intelligence
officials were on Capitol Hill
yesterday to

31:34.459 --> 31:39.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
discuss their updated assessment
of worldwide
threats to the United States.
Among their

31:39.231 --> 31:44.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
top concerns, cyber-attacks, the
Islamic State
group, the war in Syria, North
Korea's nuclear

31:44.836 --> 31:47.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
activities and a resurgent
Russia.

31:47.973 --> 31:51.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're joined now by David Cohen,
the deputy
director of the Central
Intelligence Agency.

31:51.343 --> 31:55.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's been at the CIA for one
year, after five
years at the Treasury Department
overseeing

31:55.347 --> 31:59.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sanctions implementation and
efforts to combat
terrorism financing.

31:59.217 --> 32:03.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when I rattle off those
lists of concerns
that the community has, what are
the top three

32:03.955 --> 32:06.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that keep you up at night?

32:06.658 --> 32:08.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID COHEN, Deputy Director,
Central Intelligence
Agency: Well, I think that was a
list of six,

32:08.527 --> 32:11.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I think all six of those
keep us up at
night.

32:11.997 --> 32:17.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, obviously, we're
spending a lot of
time focused on the threat from
ISIL. We're

32:17.536 --> 32:23.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also very much engaged in what's
happening
in Syria and Iraq, the threat
from Russia.

32:23.909 --> 32:30.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And just this past weekend, we
saw North Korea
launch a rocket after a nuclear
test they

32:30.215 --> 32:34.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conducted about six weeks ago,
so all these
issues are, you know, top of the
list for

32:34.653 --> 32:36.555 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
us at the agency.

32:36.655 --> 32:40.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK. Given the
time you spent
a lot of time at Treasury
looking at sanctions,

32:40.392 --> 32:44.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right now, especially in the
political climate,
there is quite a conversation
happening about

32:45.063 --> 32:46.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Iran after the nuclear deal.

32:46.398 --> 32:48.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID COHEN: Sure.

32:48.333 --> 32:51.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So looking at
it now through
your lens at the CIA, what
intelligence do

32:51.736 --> 32:56.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have? How are we so confident
we can catch
Iran if they were to cheat?

32:56.975 --> 33:03.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID COHEN: Well, the Joint
Comprehensive
Plan of Action, the JCPOA, that
was agreed

33:03.281 --> 33:11.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to over the summer has within it
a whole series
of measures that would allow the
IAEA the

33:11.723 --> 33:18.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unprecedented access to Iran's
nuclear program,
from the very -- from the
uranium mills and

33:19.030 --> 33:24.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
mines all the way through
whatever enrichment
facilities they may have, to
their centrifuges,

33:24.669 --> 33:30.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an extraordinary window into
what Iran is
doing that the IAEA will have
and the international

33:30.809 --> 33:33.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
community will have.

33:33.111 --> 33:40.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's one very important
part of it,
but we have also been very much
focused on

33:40.518 --> 33:46.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iran's nuclear program for a
number of years,
and so we will be able to,
obviously, supplement

33:46.625 --> 33:52.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
what the IAEA is able to
discover through
our own efforts as well.

33:52.864 --> 33:57.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What about the
money that's
sort of been freed up past the
deal? We have

33:57.235 --> 34:00.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heard even Secretary of State
Kerry after
the deal say, listen, I can't
account for

34:00.772 --> 34:02.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
every dollar, where it goes.

34:02.841 --> 34:07.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the CIA, are you seeing
evidence that any
of those dollars that had been
freed are going

34:08.046 --> 34:09.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to fund terrorism organizations?

34:09.915 --> 34:16.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID COHEN: Look, one of the
major reasons
that Iran entered into the
nuclear deal was

34:16.955 --> 34:22.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because of the sanctions and
because of the
huge economical toll that had
been created

34:23.028 --> 34:24.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over the years by the sanctions
program.

34:24.896 --> 34:31.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think it's our assessment
that Iran is
intending to use the sanctions
relief, the

34:31.503 --> 34:37.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vast majority of the sanctions
relief that
it will be obtaining to repair
its economy,

34:37.776 --> 34:44.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to try and deliver some modicum
of economic
growth to its people. And we
will be watching

34:44.649 --> 34:49.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very carefully how Iran is
making use of that
money. We're watching it very
carefully.

34:49.988 --> 34:51.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK.

34:51.856 --> 34:57.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's talk a little bit about
ISIS, or ISIL.
We had a report that we saw just
today from

34:57.696 --> 35:04.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fighters trained by the CIA
saying that they
feel abandoned on the
battlefield, especially

35:04.202 --> 35:07.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in light of recent events. How
do you support
them?

35:07.172 --> 35:10.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID COHEN: Well, look, I'm not
going to
get into anything that the CIA
may or may

35:10.742 --> 35:15.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not be doing with respect to the
battlefield
in Syria.

35:15.613 --> 35:22.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will say that the Russians, in
particular,
since they have come in to Syria
last fall,

35:22.454 --> 35:29.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, came in saying that
they were there
to fight Da'esh, to fight the
terrorists,

35:29.594 --> 35:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have spent most of their time
trying to bolster
Assad.

35:35.533 --> 35:44.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what that has meant is
helping the Syrian
regime to bomb the moderate
opposition in

35:44.609 --> 35:55.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syria, which has been putting
pressure on
the Assad regime. That is not
fighting Da'esh,

35:55.687 --> 36:01.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it's taking a toll on the
moderate opposition.
But, you know, the State
Department has a

36:02.027 --> 36:05.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
program to work with the
moderate opposition.

36:05.697 --> 36:14.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Others around the world,
frankly, in the Middle
East and beyond are working to
try and support

36:14.539 --> 36:19.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the moderate opposition. They
have been taking
it on the chin recently, but
they have also

36:19.411 --> 36:25.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been quite resilient. You know,
this conflict
has been going on now for, you
know, five

36:25.183 --> 36:27.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
years, close to five years.

36:27.552 --> 36:33.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the moderate opposition has,
you know,
faced first the Syrian regime.
They faced

36:33.224 --> 36:36.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hezbollah working with the
Syrian regime.
They faced the Iranians working
with the Syrian

36:37.095 --> 36:42.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regime and now they're facing
the Russians
working with the Syrian regime,
and they are

36:42.867 --> 36:44.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a resilient bunch.

36:44.669 --> 36:47.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All these
things lead me
to say that we are living
through a period

36:47.439 --> 36:52.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of incredible geopolitical
instability right
now. And part of the reason that
we're aware

36:52.410 --> 36:55.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of that is because of the spread
of digital
technology.

36:55.580 --> 36:58.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the concerns that's
always come from
the intelligence community is
that you're

36:58.550 --> 37:03.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not getting enough help from the
technology
companies. So, I wanted to ask,
if you find

37:04.022 --> 37:09.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a suspect somewhere overseas
that has some
sort of a social media presence,
are the Facebooks,

37:09.627 --> 37:13.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Googles, the Twitters of the
world helping
you in any way?

37:13.331 --> 37:18.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID COHEN: Look, I'm not going
to get into
the sort of particularities of
how we -- how,

37:18.269 --> 37:24.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if we find a suspect who is on
social media,
how we're able to tap into that.

37:24.576 --> 37:30.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is an ongoing conversation
with the
media companies, some of which
we're involved

37:30.381 --> 37:35.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in, but also, you know, the FBI
and others
in domestic law enforcement are
very much

37:35.186 --> 37:37.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
engaged in this conversation.

37:37.188 --> 37:44.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We set up this new directorate
specifically
because we have recognized that
we need to

37:44.262 --> 37:50.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do a better job of leveraging
and operating
in the digital domain. I mean, I
think your

37:50.468 --> 37:57.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
viewers know this as well as we
do that increasingly
we live our lives online.
Increasingly, the

37:58.042 --> 38:03.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
information that we have access
to is digital
information.

38:03.815 --> 38:09.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we, as the Central
Intelligence Agency,
felt that we needed to do a
better job of

38:09.521 --> 38:15.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
both harnessing the digital
information that
we have, of thinking about how
we operate

38:16.027 --> 38:22.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the digital domain, and
making sure that
we are making use of digital
technologies

38:22.834 --> 38:25.136 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the greatest extent possible.

38:25.236 --> 38:31.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally, I
have heard that
one of the things that you say
to the new

38:31.376 --> 38:35.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
folks that are being sworn in is
that this
is an agency that's governed by
law, right?

38:35.647 --> 38:37.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID COHEN: Right.

38:37.482 --> 38:39.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And one of the
practices
that's very difficult for
Americans to swallow

38:39.317 --> 38:45.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is drone strikes that kill
targets overseas,
and at times, there are civilian
casualties

38:45.390 --> 38:49.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as well. A lot of people are
going to say,
you know what? That seems like
extrajudicial

38:49.494 --> 38:53.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
killings. That doesn't seem that
would be
following what American law is.

38:53.164 --> 38:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Should the CIA be in the drone
strike business?

38:55.900 --> 39:00.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID COHEN: Look, I'm not going
to comment
on whether the CIA is involved
in any of those

39:00.638 --> 39:02.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sorts of activities.

39:02.740 --> 39:11.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will say, however, that the
embrace of legal
constraints on what we do,
domestic law, international

39:11.282 --> 39:17.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
law, is something that we are
quite happy
to have and to operate within a
system of

39:17.322 --> 39:22.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
laws. And what makes the CIA,
what makes the
United States different from
many countries

39:22.126 --> 39:25.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around the world is adherence to
the rule
of law.

39:25.997 --> 39:30.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as you said, Hari, when I
swear in new
officers, one of the points I
make to them

39:30.735 --> 39:38.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that we operate within a
legal construct,
we operate within the laws, not
fighting against

39:38.409 --> 39:45.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it, but willingly, happily
embracing the fact
that what we do is governed by
law. That's

39:45.116 --> 39:52.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
core to the CIA. It's core to
what this country
is all about, and it's not
something that

39:52.123 --> 39:53.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we chafe against at all.

39:53.958 --> 39:57.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
David Cohen with
the CIA, thanks so much for
joining us.

39:57.762 --> 40:06.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID COHEN: Thank you.

40:06.871 --> 40:14.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In a surprise
move late
yesterday, the U.S. Supreme
Court stepped

40:14.279 --> 40:19.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in to put the centerpiece of
President Obama's
climate change agenda on hold,
pending the

40:19.784 --> 40:23.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
outcome of judicial appeals in
the lower courts.

40:23.321 --> 40:25.223 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has that.

40:25.323 --> 40:28.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In a move
that's been called
unprecedented, the Supreme Court
has temporarily

40:28.793 --> 40:32.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
blocked major environmental
regulations that
were designed to cut back on
greenhouse gas

40:33.097 --> 40:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
emissions from coal-fired power
plants.

40:35.667 --> 40:39.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The high court's order means
these regulations,
which were put out by the
Environmental Protection

40:39.737 --> 40:44.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Agency, can't go into effect
until legal challenges
against them are settled. The
coal industry

40:45.076 --> 40:48.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a consortium of states have
sued to stop
the rules, calling them -- quote
-- "a power

40:49.047 --> 40:50.848 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
grab."

40:50.948 --> 40:53.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To help us understand all this,
we turn to
Coral Davenport, who has been
reporting the

40:53.217 --> 40:54.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
story for The New York Times.

40:55.019 --> 40:59.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Coral, before we get to what
the court
ordered, let's talk a little bit
about these

40:59.557 --> 41:03.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regulations. These are not some
arcane set
of rules. These seem pretty
fundamental to

41:03.161 --> 41:05.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the president's environmental
agenda.

41:05.129 --> 41:09.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORAL DAVENPORT, The New York
Times: Yes,
the regulation that was put on
hold is really

41:09.801 --> 41:13.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
at the heart of President
Obama's climate
change agenda.

41:13.404 --> 41:18.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In his second term, President
Obama really
wanted to build a legacy around
addressing

41:18.343 --> 41:24.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
climate change. He just got back
less than
two months ago from a meeting in
Paris where

41:24.949 --> 41:30.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the first ever universal global
accord on
climate change was signed.

41:30.621 --> 41:35.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the reasons or one of the
cornerstones
for the success of that accord
was the fact

41:35.727 --> 41:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the U.S. had acted on this
specific policy.
So this is -- as you say, this
is not some

41:42.333 --> 41:48.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
small, arcane policy. This was
set to be sort
of the cornerstone of what
President Obama

41:48.840 --> 41:53.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hoped would be the first major
climate action
by the United States.

41:53.144 --> 41:57.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The coal
industry and 20-something
states have been suing to try to
block these

41:58.082 --> 42:01.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rules. What has been their
argument against
them?

42:01.386 --> 42:08.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORAL DAVENPORT: Their reason to
block the
rules is, if the rules were to
go into effect,

42:08.993 --> 42:14.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they would target, as you say,
emissions from
coal-fired power plants, and in
the long run

42:14.232 --> 42:18.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
probably shut down hundreds of
coal-fired
power plants in the U.S.

42:18.703 --> 42:24.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They would freeze construction
of future coal-fired
power plants and almost
certainly freeze the

42:24.242 --> 42:31.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
domestic market for U.S. coal.
So the coal
industry and states where coal
mining or coal-fired

42:31.449 --> 42:36.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
power plants are a big part of
the company
have been fighting tooth and
nail against

42:36.387 --> 42:39.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this rule from the very
beginning.

42:39.290 --> 42:49.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their legal argument is that
rule is so broad,
so creative that it's a sort of
overinterpretation

42:49.367 --> 42:54.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the existing law of the Clean
Air Act,
that it violates the
Constitution. These are

42:54.305 --> 42:56.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their legal arguments against
the rule.

42:56.607 --> 43:01.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, the
Supreme Court steps
in and says no implementing of
these rules

43:01.379 --> 43:06.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
until the legal challenges
against the rules
are settled. Is that what's
unusual about

43:06.384 --> 43:08.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this, the timing of when the
court stepped
in?

43:08.920 --> 43:14.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORAL DAVENPORT: Yes, it's very
rare for the
court to issue a stay like this,
and almost

43:15.026 --> 43:22.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unprecedented for the court to
halt a regulation
before the regulation has --
before there's

43:22.200 --> 43:26.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
even been any kind of court or
legal action.

43:26.971 --> 43:32.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the regulation is on track to
-- there
will be oral arguments in a
district federal

43:32.510 --> 43:39.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
court in June, but, essentially,
you know,
the Supreme Court is halting
implementation

43:39.517 --> 43:44.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the rule before it's even had
its first
day in court. That is what is so
surprising

43:44.522 --> 43:46.390 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about this.

43:46.491 --> 43:51.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I can tell you that even the
plaintiffs
in this case, even the coal
states and coal-fired

43:51.796 --> 43:59.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
power plants who sued for this
actually called
this result amazing. Even they
were surprised

43:59.303 --> 44:01.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that the Supreme Court did this.

44:01.239 --> 44:05.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You touched on
this a little
bit earlier. In fact, you
reported today that

44:05.910 --> 44:11.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Supreme Court's move could
prove to be
a major blow to the Paris
agreements that

44:11.782 --> 44:16.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this administration and hundreds
of other
countries agreed to. Explain how
that would

44:16.454 --> 44:19.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
work. How does a domestic ruling
affect an
international global treaty?

44:19.824 --> 44:26.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORAL DAVENPORT: Well, the
accord -- it's
not quite a treaty -- the
accord, what's important

44:26.497 --> 44:33.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about it is, it's the first ever
universal
climate change deal. Every
country on Earth

44:33.938 --> 44:40.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has signed on to this deal with
a commitment
to take action at home on
climate change.

44:40.678 --> 44:46.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, historically, the reason no
such deal
has been possible before is
because of lack

44:46.884 --> 44:54.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of action by the United States.
So, once President
Obama put this regulation in
place, he met

44:54.458 --> 45:00.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with his counterparts, he met
with the other
world leaders in China, in
India, around the

45:00.731 --> 45:05.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world, and said, look, we have
got this policy
in place, this regulation is
being implemented,

45:06.070 --> 45:10.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the U.S., the largest historic
carbon emitter
in the world is acting.

45:10.308 --> 45:14.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And because of the nature of
climate change,
you know, it's a global problem.
You can't

45:14.412 --> 45:19.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a solution unless really
all the players
are on board. And so President
Obama used

45:20.084 --> 45:25.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this regulation as leverage in,
you know,
getting a deal and getting other
countries

45:25.957 --> 45:27.792 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on board.

45:27.892 --> 45:33.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If this rule is not enacted, if
it is ultimately
struck down by the Supreme
Court, it takes

45:33.998 --> 45:40.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
away that leverage. It takes
away this major
action by the world's largest
economy. And

45:40.204 --> 45:45.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so already in New Delhi and
Beijing, there
are questions about, well, if
the U.S. might

45:45.610 --> 45:51.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
not be able to meet its
commitment, you know,
there are questions about, well,
why should

45:51.649 --> 45:53.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
other countries do the same?

45:53.484 --> 45:59.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No one is threatening not to
move forward
with the accord yet, but what
analysts in

45:59.357 --> 46:03.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those other countries are saying
is, they're
going to look ahead to the final
Supreme Court

46:03.594 --> 46:08.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decision. If the Supreme Court
moves all the
way ahead and strikes down this
rule, it really

46:08.799 --> 46:13.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
could imperil this Paris
agreement that was
celebrated with such fanfare
less than two

46:13.971 --> 46:15.673 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
months ago.

46:15.773 --> 46:17.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Coral Davenport
of The New York Times, thanks so
much.

46:17.308 --> 46:18.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CORAL DAVENPORT: It's great to
be with you.
Thank you.

46:18.442 --> 46:29.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally: A

46:29.920 --> 46:33.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new play tells the story of an
industrial
Pennsylvania city in decline and
the impact

46:33.858 --> 46:35.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on a group of friends.

46:35.559 --> 46:39.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown talks with
Pulitzer Prize-winning
playwright Lynn Nottage.

46:39.163 --> 46:49.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The year is 2000,
the setting,
a bar in Reading, Pennsylvania,
as friends,

46:49.874 --> 46:57.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
co-workers at a steel plant,
celebrate a birthday.
But as time passes, there is
little celebrating,

46:57.148 --> 47:01.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rather, a sense of loss, of
jobs, friendships,
loved ones, a way of life.

47:01.252 --> 47:03.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACTRESS: The union don't got a
lot to say
about it. Those machines are
gone. They aren't

47:03.921 --> 47:09.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coming back. But if we do this
right, we can
protect the rest of your jobs.

47:09.460 --> 47:16.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LYNN NOTTAGE, Pulitzer
Prize-Winning Playwright:
I decided that I wanted to go
about finding

47:16.801 --> 47:22.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of the source of this
trauma and figuring
out how we as Americans had come
to that point

47:22.840 --> 47:27.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where we could be living so
close to poverty
without recognizing it on a
daily basis.

47:27.178 --> 47:30.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACTOR: You need to shut up and
drink your
beer. That's exactly why I
didn't say anything,

47:30.314 --> 47:32.116 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
man.

47:32.216 --> 47:35.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There is humor in
Lynn Nottage's
new play "Sweat," but at its
heart, it's a

47:35.653 --> 47:40.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
harrowing look at workers who
have been impacted
by large forces in American
life.

47:40.691 --> 47:44.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACTOR: Three generations of
loyalty to the
same company. I never imagined
working anywhere

47:45.029 --> 47:49.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
else. I get injured, I'm in the
hospital for
nearly two months, can't walk,
can't feel

47:49.967 --> 47:51.769 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
my toes.

47:51.869 --> 47:54.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The characters
live amid the
decline of the Rust Belt, the
consequences

47:54.772 --> 47:58.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of NAFTA and new technology, the
weakening
of unions.

47:58.209 --> 48:02.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LYNN NOTTAGE: The bar is the
place where the
truth happens most often,
because you have

48:02.246 --> 48:04.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the lubricant that loosens
people's tongues.

48:04.315 --> 48:08.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The bar in the
play itself
is based on a real one in
Reading, a city

48:08.619 --> 48:14.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
once a symbol of industrial
power, home to
the Reading Railroad Company, so
famous from

48:14.125 --> 48:18.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Monopoly," and in its day, one
of the richest
corporations in the world.

48:18.829 --> 48:23.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By 2011, though, Reading was
cited as the
poorest city in the nation, with
more than

48:23.901 --> 48:30.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
41 percent of its citizens
living below the
poverty line. The statistics
drew Nottage,

48:30.374 --> 48:32.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and her research began.

48:32.243 --> 48:36.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LYNN NOTTAGE: I got in a car
with someone
who I was working with, and we
drove the 2.5

48:36.714 --> 48:39.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hours to Reading from New York
City and just
began to explore it.

48:39.884 --> 48:44.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I always begin by saying that
I'm not a reporter
and I'm not there to fix
anything. I'm just

48:44.889 --> 48:51.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there to listen and to absorb.
And it may
result in something and it may
result in nothing

48:52.062 --> 48:59.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at all. But I find that, for a
lot of people,
there's this palliative effect
of just sitting

48:59.403 --> 49:04.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down and talking, and having
someone who's
nodding and listening and
appreciative of

49:04.642 --> 49:06.510 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their stories.

49:06.610 --> 49:10.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And did some of
these interviews,
or whatever you want to call
them, gathering

49:10.481 --> 49:12.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of stories, end up in the play?

49:12.616 --> 49:18.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LYNN NOTTAGE: Absolutely. After
about a year-and-a-half,
I encountered a group of
steelworkers who

49:18.823 --> 49:23.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had been locked out of their
factory for 92
weeks. This was a group of sort
of burly,

49:23.861 --> 49:30.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sturdy people who normally,
given where I
live and given what I do, I
wouldn't have

49:30.701 --> 49:32.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the opportunity to sit down
with.

49:32.603 --> 49:35.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we're sitting in a circle,
and they began
to tell their stories. And the
majority of

49:35.206 --> 49:40.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them had been working in the
steel factory
for between 25 to 30 years.

49:40.578 --> 49:46.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Many stories
later, the result
is "Sweat," a co- commission of
the Oregon

49:46.250 --> 49:51.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shakespeare Festival and Arena
Stage in Washington,
D.C., where the play is now
running.

49:51.889 --> 49:57.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Here, Tracey, a central
character, looks back
to what she sees as the good old
days.

49:57.127 --> 50:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACTRESS: My family's been here
since the '20s.
They built the house that I live
in. They

50:02.733 --> 50:09.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
built this town. My grandfather
was German.
He could build anything,
cabinets, fine furniture,

50:10.007 --> 50:11.876 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
anything.

50:11.976 --> 50:17.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Nostalgia comes
as security
is slipping away, and machines
and jobs literally

50:17.615 --> 50:19.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
disappear overnight.

50:19.483 --> 50:24.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tracey's friend, Cynthia,
fulfills her dream
of a management position after
26 years on

50:24.555 --> 50:30.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the factory floor, only to find
herself cut
off by co-workers as layoffs
begin.

50:30.461 --> 50:32.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ACTOR: Are they trying to
squeeze us out?

50:32.229 --> 50:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIMBERLY SCOTT, Actress: You saw
how easy
it was for them to sneak in and
break down

50:36.333 --> 50:43.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those machines while all of us
were at home
sleeping. I guarantee you
they're in Mexico.

50:43.240 --> 50:46.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For Kimberly
Scott, who plays
Cynthia, the themes hit home.

50:46.710 --> 50:48.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KIMBERLY SCOTT: I was raised in
a union household.

50:48.679 --> 50:50.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: You were?

50:50.614 --> 50:54.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIMBERLY SCOTT: Yes. One of the
first things
I learned to read was the United
Transportation

50:54.418 --> 51:00.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Union newsletter. My dad worked
on the railroad
for over 30 years. When I went
to graduate

51:00.691 --> 51:06.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
school, I remember a day when I
was going
to school and I had to cross the
union picket

51:06.430 --> 51:08.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
line to get into class.

51:08.299 --> 51:12.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was traumatic. I remember
calling my
mom, crying, what do I do, what
do I do? And

51:12.870 --> 51:16.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she said, baby, you're there to
get an education.
You do what you have to do.

51:16.607 --> 51:21.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: As changes come,
no one is
spared, not Chris, Cynthia's
son, or his best

51:21.946 --> 51:27.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
friend, Jason, who also work at
the plant,
not Stan the bartender, or his
young helper

51:27.451 --> 51:32.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Oscar from a Latino family, who
decides to
cross a picket line to improve
his lot, with

51:33.023 --> 51:34.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tragic consequences.

51:34.258 --> 51:36.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: You offer me $3 more per
hour than
I make here.

51:37.027 --> 51:41.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Lynn Nottage
says, after all
the research, she started her
writing at the

51:41.565 --> 51:43.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
end of the story, with these
four men.

51:43.701 --> 51:47.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LYNN NOTTAGE: The image that I
had was the
last image of the play, in which
you have

51:47.871 --> 51:53.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
four men for who come from very
different
backgrounds standing on the
stage in a moment

51:53.444 --> 51:58.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of extreme crisis and trying to
find the vocabulary
to communicate across the
divide. That's what

51:58.949 --> 52:00.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I began with, and I thought, how
do I get
there?

52:00.951 --> 52:06.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Nottage is best
known for her
2009 Pulitzer Prize-winning play
"Ruined,"

52:06.256 --> 52:11.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which examined another crisis,
violence against
women in an African civil war.

52:11.261 --> 52:15.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where does the compulsion come
from for you
to look at things like this?

52:15.199 --> 52:18.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LYNN NOTTAGE: It comes from
curiosity. It's
one of the things that I always
told my students,

52:18.802 --> 52:20.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is replace judgment with
curiosity.

52:20.938 --> 52:24.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I mean, because
people usually
come in with judgments?

52:24.541 --> 52:27.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LYNN NOTTAGE: People enter with
judgment.
And I think that judgment
becomes a wall.

52:27.878 --> 52:32.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And rather than being passive
and sitting
back and allowing that curiosity
to sort of

52:32.416 --> 52:37.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
die, I reach out and ask the
question. And
so I think that's why I travel.
And that's

52:37.788 --> 52:39.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
why I go in search of
characters.

52:39.690 --> 52:44.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Sweat," drama
that takes on
social and economic issues now
part of the

52:44.795 --> 52:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presidential campaign, is in
Washington through
February, and is then expected
to move to

52:49.900 --> 52:51.201 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
New York.

52:51.301 --> 52:54.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From Arena Stage, I'm Jeffrey
Brown for the
"PBS NewsHour."

52:54.538 --> 53:08.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: On the
"NewsHour" online
right now: In 1995, "NewsHour"'s
Margaret

53:08.152 --> 53:12.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Warner profiled a brash young
congressman
from Ohio who was charged with
coming up with

53:12.489 --> 53:16.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the plan to balance the
country's budget.
