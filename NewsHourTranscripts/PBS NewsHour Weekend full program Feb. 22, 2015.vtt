00:18.385 --> 00:20.254
MILITANT GROUPS OVERSEAS.

00:25.893 --> 00:27.027
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT WALMART'S

00:27.027 --> 00:28.795
DECISION TO RAISE WAGES MIGHT

00:28.795 --> 00:30.264
MEAN FOR THE REST OF THE U.S.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.231
ECONOMY.

00:31.231 --> 00:32.766
AND IN OUR SIGNATURE SEGMENT,

00:32.766 --> 00:34.801
THE POOR STRUGGLING TO STAY WARM

00:34.801 --> 00:36.103

00:36.103 --> 00:38.739

01:10.938 --> 01:12.940
URGED VIGILANCE, SAYING TERROR

01:12.940 --> 01:14.875
GROUPS NO LONGER NEED TO RELY ON

01:14.875 --> 01:16.743
PEOPLE TRAINED OVERSEAS TO COME

01:16.743 --> 01:18.178
INTO THE UNITED STATES TO LAUNCH

01:18.178 --> 01:19.112
AN ATTACK.

01:19.112 --> 01:21.548
>> WE'RE IN A NEW PHASE IN THAT

01:21.548 --> 01:23.650
THESE GROUPS ARE RELYING MORE

01:23.650 --> 01:25.519
AND MORE ON INDEPENDENT ACTORS

01:25.519 --> 01:28.422
TO BECOME INSPIRED, DRAWN TO THE

01:28.422 --> 01:29.189
CAUSE...

01:29.189 --> 01:30.223
>> AND THE INTERNET, THROUGH THE

INTERNET.

01:31.258 --> 01:32.192

01:32.192 --> 01:33.727
ATTACKS ON THEIR OWN THROUGH

01:33.727 --> 01:35.362
THEIR EFFECTIVE USE OF THE

01:35.362 --> 01:36.029
INTERNET.

01:36.029 --> 01:37.197

01:37.197 --> 01:38.966
TAKING THIS THREAT?

01:38.966 --> 01:40.834
>> I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:40.834 --> 01:44.037
SERIOUS POTENTIAL THREAT OF

01:44.037 --> 01:45.605
INDEPENDENT ACTORS HERE IN THE

01:45.605 --> 01:47.140
UNITED STATES.

01:47.140 --> 01:48.508
WE'VE SEEN THIS NOW IN EUROPE.

01:48.508 --> 01:49.743
WE'VE SEEN THIS IN CANADA.

01:49.743 --> 01:50.911
>> BUT SPECIFICALLY AGAINST THE

01:52.212 --> 01:53.580
>> ANYTIME A TERRORIST

01:53.580 --> 01:55.682
ORGANIZATION CALLS FOR AN ATTACK

01:55.682 --> 01:58.051
ON A SPECIFIC PLACE, WE'VE GOT

01:58.051 --> 01:59.086
TO TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY.

01:59.086 --> 01:59.987
>> Sreenivasan: AL SHABAB

IN THE FALL OF 2013 THAT LEFT

02:04.925 --> 02:06.660
MORE THAN 60 PEOPLE DEAD.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.428
THAT MONTH-LONG STRIKE AT OIL

02:08.428 --> 02:09.863
REFINERIES ACROSS THE UNITED

02:09.863 --> 02:11.732

UNITED STEELWORKERS, HAVE ALSO

02:23.744 --> 02:25.212
WAGED STRIKES AT PLANTS IN

02:25.212 --> 02:27.414

02:27.414 --> 02:28.715
ECONOMISTS SAY GAS PRICES HAVE

02:28.715 --> 02:30.817
CREPT UP IN SOME LOCATIONS AS A

RESULT OF THE WALKOUT.

02:32.719 --> 02:34.054
OVERSEAS, MIXED SIGNALS FROM

02:34.054 --> 02:34.855
UKRAINE.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.256
PRO-RUSSIAN REBELS AND THE

02:36.256 --> 02:37.657
UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT FORCES

02:37.657 --> 02:39.059
THEY'VE BEEN BATTLING BOTH SAY

02:39.059 --> 02:40.794
THEY WILL HONOR THE NEW CEASE-

02:40.794 --> 02:42.729
FIRE AND PULL BACK SOME OF THEIR

02:42.729 --> 02:43.897
HEAVY WEAPONRY.

02:43.897 --> 02:44.931
THE TWO SIDES EXCHANGED

02:44.931 --> 02:46.299
PRISONERS YESTERDAY.

02:46.299 --> 02:47.401
BUT AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE WERE

02:47.401 --> 02:48.702
KILLED AND TEN WOUNDED TODAY

02:48.702 --> 02:50.137
WHEN AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE WAS

02:50.137 --> 02:52.172
TOSSED FROM A CAR INTO A CROWD

02:52.172 --> 02:53.607
OF PEOPLE AT A PEACE RALLY.

02:53.607 --> 02:54.841
THIS AMATEUR VIDEO WAS OBTAINED

02:54.841 --> 02:56.109
BY REUTERS AND IS BELIEVED TO

02:56.109 --> 02:58.211
SHOW THE MOMENT OF THE ATTACK.

02:58.211 --> 02:59.379
FIGHTING CONTINUES IN SOME

02:59.379 --> 03:00.814
CITIES, AND THE UKRAINIAN

03:00.814 --> 03:02.482
GOVERNMENT SAYS RUSSIA IS STILL

03:02.482 --> 03:04.317
SENDING ARMORED COLUMNS INTO THE

03:04.317 --> 03:06.186
REGION TO SUPPORT THE REBELS.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.587
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE

03:07.587 --> 03:09.589
CIVIL WAR BEGAN IN SYRIA NEARLY

03:09.589 --> 03:11.691
FOUR YEARS AGO, TURKISH TROOPS

03:11.691 --> 03:13.126
CROSSED THE BORDER BETWEEN THE

03:13.126 --> 03:14.494
TWO COUNTRIES OVERNIGHT.

03:14.494 --> 03:15.929
THE TROOPS, SUPPORTED BY TANKS

03:15.929 --> 03:18.031
AND DRONES, RESCUED ANOTHER 40

03:18.031 --> 03:19.800
TURKISH TROOPS WHO HAD BEEN

03:19.800 --> 03:22.002
TRAPPED FOR EIGHT MONTHS BY ISIS

03:22.002 --> 03:22.836
FIGHTERS.

03:22.836 --> 03:23.870
THE RESCUED TROOPS HAD BEEN

03:23.870 --> 03:25.138
GUARDING THE REMAINS OF THE

03:25.138 --> 03:27.040
GRANDFATHER OF THE FOUNDER OF

03:27.040 --> 03:28.542
THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.676
TURKEY CLAIMED THE SITE UNDER A

03:29.676 --> 03:31.545
TREATY SIGNED IN 1921.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.613
SYRIA DENOUNCED THE INCURSION AS

03:33.613 --> 03:35.482
"BLATANT AGGRESSION."

03:35.482 --> 03:36.683
FROM NIGERIA TONIGHT, WORD OF

03:36.683 --> 03:37.684
ANOTHER SUICIDE BOMBING

03:37.684 --> 03:39.286
INVOLVING A YOUNG CHILD.

03:39.286 --> 03:40.821
AUTHORITIES THERE SAY A YOUNG

03:40.821 --> 03:42.456
GIRL, POSSIBLY ONLY EIGHT YEARS

03:42.456 --> 03:44.124
OLD, BLEW HERSELF UP AT A

03:44.124 --> 03:45.859
CHECKPOINT OUTSIDE A MARKET.

03:45.859 --> 03:46.893
SHE DIED ALONG WITH AT LEAST

03:46.893 --> 03:47.828
FIVE OTHERS.

03:47.828 --> 03:48.895
THE INCIDENT HAPPENED IN THE

03:48.895 --> 03:50.363
NORTHEAST REGION OF THE COUNTRY

03:50.363 --> 03:51.798
WHERE BOKO HARAM ISLAMIC

03:51.798 --> 03:53.066
EXTREMISTS FREQUENTLY CARRY OUT

03:53.066 --> 03:54.000
ATTACKS.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.335
JUST WEEKS AGO, ANOTHER GIRL

03:55.335 --> 03:56.636
CARRIED OUT ANOTHER SIMILAR

03:56.636 --> 03:57.337
ATTACK THERE.

03:57.337 --> 03:58.872
SHE WAS TEN.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.507
THERE IS A SUSPECTED NEW LEAK OF

04:00.507 --> 04:01.875
RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL AT THE

04:01.875 --> 04:03.944
STRICKEN FUKUSHIMA NUCLEAR POWER

04:03.944 --> 04:05.312
PLANT IN JAPAN.

04:05.312 --> 04:06.046
AUTHORITIES THERE SAY THEY

04:06.046 --> 04:07.514
DETECTED IT THIS MORNING AND

04:07.514 --> 04:09.182
RESPONDED BY BLOCKING THE FLOW

04:09.182 --> 04:11.017
OF WATER FROM THE PLANT INTO A

04:11.017 --> 04:12.285
NEARBY BAY.

04:12.285 --> 04:13.220
CONTAMINANT LEVELS WERE

04:13.220 --> 04:15.055
INITIALLY REPORTED TO BE 70

04:15.055 --> 04:16.923
TIMES ABOVE ACCEPTED LEVELS

04:16.923 --> 04:18.558
BEFORE FALLING.

04:18.558 --> 04:20.360
A MAJOR ART DISCOVERY: TWO

04:20.360 --> 04:21.795
UNFINISHED SKETCHES BY PAUL

04:21.795 --> 04:23.630
CEZANNE HAVE BEEN FOUND ON THE

04:23.630 --> 04:25.699
REVERSE SIDE OF WATERCOLORS

04:25.699 --> 04:27.834
ACQUIRED MORE THAN 90 YEARS AGO.

04:27.834 --> 04:28.735
THE DISCOVERY WAS MADE BY

04:28.735 --> 04:29.703
OFFICIALS AT PHILADELPHIA'S

04:29.703 --> 04:31.371
BARNES FOUNDATION MUSEUM.

04:31.371 --> 04:32.806
CURATORS SAY COLLECTOR ALBERT

04:32.806 --> 04:34.541
BARNES LIKELY NEVER KNEW HE HAD

04:34.541 --> 04:36.643
ACQUIRED, IN THEIR WORDS, "FOUR

04:36.643 --> 04:38.178
FOR THE PRICE OF TWO."

04:38.178 --> 04:39.679
AND LEGENDARY JAZZ TRUMPETER

04:39.679 --> 04:41.081
CLARK TERRY HAS DIED.

04:41.081 --> 04:42.582
TERRY PLAYED WITH BOTH DUKE

04:42.582 --> 04:44.417
ELLINGTON AND COUNT BASIE, AND

04:44.417 --> 04:45.685
LATER WAS FEATURED IN THE

04:45.685 --> 04:46.887
"TONIGHT SHOW" BAND.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.522
CLARK TERRY WAS 94.

04:48.522 --> 04:52.058
â™ª

05:02.936 --> 05:03.904
>> Sreenivasan: WALMART MADE

05:03.904 --> 05:05.071
NEWS THIS WEEK BY ANNOUNCING

05:05.071 --> 05:06.573
THAT IT IS RAISING THE WAGES FOR

05:06.573 --> 05:08.475
ITS EMPLOYEES ABOVE THE FEDERAL

05:08.475 --> 05:11.344
MINIMUM OF $7.25 AN HOUR.

05:11.344 --> 05:12.479
STARTING PAY AT THE COMPANY, THE

05:12.479 --> 05:13.547
WORLD'S LARGEST PRIVATE

05:13.547 --> 05:15.882
EMPLOYER, IS GOING UP TO $9 AN

05:15.882 --> 05:18.218
HOUR, AND $10 AN HOUR BY NEXT

05:18.218 --> 05:19.152
FEBRUARY.

05:19.152 --> 05:19.753
TO DISCUSS THE BROADER

05:19.753 --> 05:20.787
IMPLICATIONS, WE'RE JOINED NOW

05:20.787 --> 05:21.721
BY SHELLY BANJO.

05:21.721 --> 05:22.722
SHE HAS REPORTED THE STORY FOR

05:22.722 --> 05:23.857
QUARTZ, A BUSINESS SITE

05:23.857 --> 05:25.158
PUBLISHED BY THE ATLANTIC MEDIA

05:25.158 --> 05:25.859
COMPANY.

05:25.859 --> 05:26.793
SO, HOW SIGNIFICANT IS IT?

05:26.793 --> 05:28.195
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE IN 100

05:28.195 --> 05:29.563
PEOPLE EMPLOYED IN THE UNITED

05:29.563 --> 05:30.997
STATES ARE EMPLOYED BY WALMART.

05:30.997 --> 05:31.798
>> PRETTY SIGNIFICANT.

05:31.798 --> 05:32.732
WALMART... AS YOU MENTIONED,

05:32.732 --> 05:33.700
WALMART IS THE BIGGEST PRIVATE

05:33.700 --> 05:35.135
EMPLOYER, AND SO, WHAT WALMART

05:35.135 --> 05:36.303
DOES, OTHER PEOPLE TEND TO

05:36.303 --> 05:37.070
FOLLOW.

05:37.070 --> 05:37.837
>> Srennivasan: SO, IS THAT

05:37.837 --> 05:38.805
SOMETHING THAT TARGET AND OTHER

05:38.805 --> 05:40.173
SORT OF COMPETITORS MIGHT DO, AS

05:40.173 --> 05:40.807
WELL?

05:40.807 --> 05:42.209
>> A LOT OF COMPETITORS ARE

05:42.209 --> 05:43.710
ALREADY PAYING MORE, SOMETHING

05:43.710 --> 05:46.012
LIKE COSTCO OR SOME OF THE OTHER

05:46.012 --> 05:46.947
RETAILERS.

05:46.947 --> 05:47.681
BUT THERE ARE DEFINITELY

05:47.681 --> 05:48.915
COMPETITORS LIKE TARGET, BEST

05:48.915 --> 05:50.183
BUY, THOSE KINDS OF COMPANIES

05:50.183 --> 05:51.585
THAT ARE LIKELY TO FOLLOW SUIT

05:51.585 --> 05:53.787
AS THEY FIGHT FOR WORKERS.

05:53.787 --> 05:54.654
>> Srennivasan: SO, WHY DID

05:54.654 --> 05:55.989
WALMART DO THIS AT THIS

05:55.989 --> 05:56.556
MOMENT?

05:56.556 --> 05:57.657
ONE OF THE THINGS YOU POINTED

05:57.657 --> 05:59.659
OUT IN YOUR STORY IS THAT NOW 29

05:59.659 --> 06:01.194
STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY

06:01.194 --> 06:02.963
ALREADY HAVE MINIMUM WAGES ABOVE

06:02.963 --> 06:04.130
THE FEDERAL BASE.

06:04.130 --> 06:04.998
>> RIGHT.

06:04.998 --> 06:06.399
AND MY ARGUMENT WAS, WHAT TOOK

06:06.399 --> 06:07.133
THEM SO LONG?

06:07.133 --> 06:09.469
BECAUSE BASICALLY THEY HAD TO DO

06:09.469 --> 06:11.104
THIS ANYWAY; THE TIME WAS

06:11.104 --> 06:12.672
COMING.

06:12.672 --> 06:14.541
AS YOU MENTIONED, 29 STATES

06:14.541 --> 06:17.043
ALREADY HAD HIGHER STATE WAGES

06:17.043 --> 06:19.246
THAN THE FEDERAL MINIMUM, AND

06:19.246 --> 06:20.180
THERE'S A LOT OF POLITICAL

06:20.180 --> 06:23.350
PRESSURE FROM WORKERS, FROM THE

06:23.350 --> 06:24.584
GOVERNMENT, FROM THE STATES

06:24.584 --> 06:26.453
THEMSELVES AND THE ECONOMY.

06:26.453 --> 06:27.988
WAGES ARE RAISING, ESPECIALLY

06:27.988 --> 06:29.656
FOR UNEMPLOYED WORKERS, NOT AS

06:29.656 --> 06:31.791
FAST AS OTHER PARTS OF THE

06:31.791 --> 06:32.492
ECONOMY.

06:32.492 --> 06:34.027
BUT JOBS ARE GETTING... THE

06:34.027 --> 06:35.195
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS BEEN GOING

06:35.195 --> 06:37.097
DOWN AND JOBS ARE GETTING MORE

06:37.097 --> 06:37.764
COMPETITIVE.

06:37.764 --> 06:38.999
>> Srennivasan: YOU KNOW, WAGE

06:38.999 --> 06:39.933
STAGNATION HAS BEEN ONE OF THOSE

06:39.933 --> 06:40.834
THINGS THAT ECONOMISTS HAVE BEEN

06:40.834 --> 06:41.735
STRUGGLING WITH BECAUSE BASIC

06:41.735 --> 06:44.504
ECONOMICS SAYS IF UNEMPLOYMENT

06:44.504 --> 06:45.972
DECREASES-- MEANING THERE IS

06:45.972 --> 06:47.073
LESS PEOPLE WITHOUT JOBS-- SO

06:47.073 --> 06:48.908
THE DEMAND FOR THEM INCREASES.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.343
AND THEY SHOULD BE GETTING PAID

06:50.343 --> 06:51.478
MORE OR THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO

06:51.478 --> 06:52.379
COMMAND MORE, RIGHT?

06:52.379 --> 06:53.246
BUT THAT HASN'T HAPPENED IN THE

06:53.246 --> 06:53.913
PAST YEARS.

06:53.913 --> 06:54.547
WHY NOT?

06:54.547 --> 06:55.315
>> I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S

06:55.315 --> 06:56.449
CONFOUNDING ECONOMISTS.

06:56.449 --> 06:57.517
THEY'RE SEEING THE UNEMPLOYMENT

06:57.517 --> 06:59.352
RATE GOING DOWN, THEY'RE SEEING

06:59.352 --> 07:00.220
COMPETITION GOING UP.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.321
BUT IF YOU TALK TO ANY

07:01.321 --> 07:02.622
BUSINESSES, THEY'RE SAYING

07:02.622 --> 07:03.757
"WE'RE HAVING A HARD TIME

07:03.757 --> 07:05.592
FINDING GOOD PEOPLE," YET AT THE

07:05.592 --> 07:06.559
SAME TIME THEY'RE KEEPING THEIR

07:06.559 --> 07:07.294
WAGES LOW.

07:07.294 --> 07:08.528
SO, MAYBE THIS IS NOW AN

07:08.528 --> 07:09.963
EXPERIMENT SAYING MAYBE IF

07:09.963 --> 07:11.131
WE BRING UP THE WAGES, MAYBE

07:11.131 --> 07:12.299
WE'LL GET BETTER QUALIFIED

07:12.299 --> 07:12.899
WORKERS.

07:12.899 --> 07:13.633
>> Srennivasan: WELL, PLACES

07:13.633 --> 07:14.901
LIKE THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OR

07:14.901 --> 07:15.869
OTHER BUSINESS GROUPS ARE

07:15.869 --> 07:17.103
USING THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY

07:17.103 --> 07:17.804
TO SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:17.804 --> 07:19.773
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE MARKET

07:19.773 --> 07:21.308
AT WORK, THAT THE GOVERNMENT

07:21.308 --> 07:22.609
SHOULDN'T BE CREATING A FEDERAL

07:22.609 --> 07:24.577
MANDATE TO TRY TO ASK EVERYBODY

07:24.577 --> 07:26.446
TO SAY $10.10 IS THE MINIMUM.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.681
LOOK, WALMART DID THIS ON THEIR

07:27.681 --> 07:28.315
VERY OWN."

07:28.315 --> 07:29.182
>> AND I THINK THAT'S THE

07:29.182 --> 07:30.884
POLITICAL GAINS THAT YOU GET OUT

07:30.884 --> 07:32.552
OF THIS, BECAUSE ALL THOSE

07:32.552 --> 07:33.787
BUSINESS GROUPS ARE THE ONES

07:33.787 --> 07:34.888
THAT WERE COMING OUT AGAINST

07:34.888 --> 07:36.022
RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE.

07:36.022 --> 07:37.824
THE NATIONAL RETAIL FEDERATION

07:37.824 --> 07:38.825
WAS SAYING, "NO, WE SHOULDN'T

07:38.825 --> 07:39.826
RAISE WAGES."

07:39.826 --> 07:41.061
AND THEN, THE SECOND WALMART

07:41.061 --> 07:42.796
SAYS "WE'RE GOING TO RAISE

07:42.796 --> 07:43.897
WAGES," THEN ALL THOSE BUSINESS

07:43.897 --> 07:45.165
GROUPS RALLIED AROUND WALMART

07:45.165 --> 07:46.900
AND SAID "GOOD JOB WITH YOUR

07:46.900 --> 07:47.567
DECISION."

07:47.567 --> 07:48.768
SO, I GUESS IF WALMART CAN

07:48.768 --> 07:50.704
HEAD THEM OFF BEFORE IT GETS

07:50.704 --> 07:52.739
TO $10.10 BY OFFERING $9

07:52.739 --> 07:55.141
THIS YEAR, THEN THEY SET THE

07:55.141 --> 07:55.875
CONVERSATION.

07:55.875 --> 07:56.810
THEY DECIDE WHAT THEY WANT

07:56.810 --> 07:57.644
FOR THEIR BUSINESS.

07:57.644 --> 07:58.378
>> Srennivasan: AND HOW MANY

07:58.378 --> 07:59.379
PEOPLE DOES THIS ACTUALLY

07:59.379 --> 08:01.181
IMPACT INSIDE WALMART?

08:01.181 --> 08:02.816
I MEAN, IS... EVEN IF THEY GET

08:02.816 --> 08:05.418
$9 THIS YEAR OR $10, ARE THEY...

08:05.418 --> 08:06.753
DOES THIS INCREASE THEIR ABILITY

08:06.753 --> 08:08.621
TO SPEND MONEY, COMPARATIVELY

08:08.621 --> 08:09.356
SPEAKING?

08:09.356 --> 08:10.256
>> YEAH, YOU HIT ON AN

08:10.256 --> 08:11.091
INTERESTING POINT, BECAUSE ONE

08:11.091 --> 08:12.759
OF THE BIGGEST PROPONENTS SAY

08:12.759 --> 08:15.762
WALMART EMPLOYS 1.3 MILLION--

08:15.762 --> 08:16.696
1.4 MILLION, DEPENDING IF YOU

08:16.696 --> 08:18.164
INCLUDE SAM'S CLUB OR NOT-- IN

08:18.164 --> 08:19.566
THE U.S.

08:19.566 --> 08:20.734
SO, YOU PUT EXTRA DOLLARS IN

08:20.734 --> 08:21.901
THEIR POCKETS, AND A LOT OF

08:21.901 --> 08:22.836
THOSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SPEND

08:22.836 --> 08:23.970
THAT MONEY BACK AT WALMART.

08:23.970 --> 08:24.704
>> Srennivasan: ALL RIGHT,

08:24.704 --> 08:25.839
SHELLY BANJO FROM QUARTZ, THANKS

08:25.839 --> 08:26.272

08:58.838 --> 09:00.273

NINE YEARS AGO, AFTER BETTY AND

RHIANNA ON HER OWN.

10:27.660 --> 10:29.095

10:29.095 --> 10:30.463
A REAL STRUGGLE FOR ME.

10:30.463 --> 10:35.134
I HAD TO DECIDE TO BUY MEDICINES

10:58.091 --> 11:00.093
THE MONEY TO HEAT HER HOME.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.895

11:01.895 --> 11:04.664
AND IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.199
IT'S LIKE $3 AND SOMETHING A

11:06.199 --> 11:07.200
GALLON.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.535
SO, IF YOU GET 100 GALLONS OF

FUEL OIL, IT'S OVER $300.

11:33.960 --> 11:36.362
YOU TURN ON THE TV, AND YOU HEAR

11:36.362 --> 11:37.297
THAT THE ECONOMY IS GETTING

11:37.297 --> 11:38.865
BETTER AND THAT GAS PRICES ARE

11:38.865 --> 11:39.632
LOWER.

11:39.632 --> 11:41.167

13:18.564 --> 13:19.866
BUT IN RECENT YEARS, FEDERAL

13:19.866 --> 13:21.200
SPENDING ON PROGRAMS FOR THE

13:21.200 --> 13:22.669
POOR HAS BEEN CUT.

13:22.669 --> 13:23.870
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, THE FEDERAL

13:23.870 --> 13:25.972
UTILITY BILL SUBSIDY ONLY PAYS

13:25.972 --> 13:28.541
UP TO $400 A YEAR IN NORTH

13:28.541 --> 13:30.109
CAROLINA; WE MET FAMILIES WHO

13:30.109 --> 13:32.045
OWE MORE THAN THAT EVERY MONTH.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.646
SO, INCREASINGLY, LOCAL

13:33.646 --> 13:34.981
GOVERNMENTS ARE PARTNERING WITH

13:34.981 --> 13:37.183
PRIVATE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS

13:37.183 --> 13:39.218
TO TRY TO FIND NEW WAYS TO HELP

13:39.218 --> 13:41.421
POOR FAMILIES COPE WITH COOL

13:41.421 --> 13:43.423
TEMPERATURES.

13:43.423 --> 13:44.824
PHILLIP HARDIN IS ECONOMIC

13:44.824 --> 13:45.992
SERVICES DIRECTOR FOR THE

BUNCOMBE COUNTY HEALTH AND HUMAN

13:47.627 --> 13:49.262
SERVICES DEPARTMENT, WHICH

13:49.262 --> 13:50.730
INCLUDES ASHEVILLE.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.398
INSTEAD OF DIRECTLY DOLING OUT

13:52.398 --> 13:54.233
FEDERAL HEATING DOLLARS, HIS

13:54.233 --> 13:55.935
DEPARTMENT CONTRACTS WITH

13:55.935 --> 13:58.204
NONPROFITS LIKE EBLEN CHARITIES

13:58.204 --> 14:00.006
TO DO IT INSTEAD.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.941
HE SAYS THOSE NONPROFITS OFTEN

14:01.941 --> 14:03.743
HAVE MORE LATITUDE IN

14:03.743 --> 14:05.445
DISTRIBUTING GOVERNMENT AID.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.180
>> SO, THEY CAN COMBINE FUNDS IN

14:07.180 --> 14:10.216
A LOT OF WAYS, YOU KNOW, THAT IF

14:10.216 --> 14:11.718
THEY'RE ADMINISTERING THREE OR

14:11.718 --> 14:14.020
FOUR DIFFERENT POTS OF FUNDS

14:14.020 --> 14:17.657
FROM US THAT COULD HELP WITH

14:17.657 --> 14:19.726
HEATING COSTS, THEN YOU MAY BE

14:19.726 --> 14:22.295
ABLE TO PULL FROM MORE THAN ONE

14:22.295 --> 14:23.362
FUNDING SOURCE.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.030
>> Reporter: SO, THEY CAN

14:24.030 --> 14:26.132
BASICALLY STITCH TOGETHER STATE,

14:26.132 --> 14:27.867
FEDERAL RESOURCES, ALSO USE A

14:27.867 --> 14:29.902
LITTLE BIT OF PRIVATE FUNDS AND

14:29.902 --> 14:32.071
HOPEFULLY GIVE PEOPLE ENOUGH TO

14:32.071 --> 14:33.539
PAY A BILL.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.441
>> THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

14:35.441 --> 14:36.109
YEAH.

14:36.109 --> 14:37.110
I MEAN, THEY... AND THEN THEY

14:37.110 --> 14:38.010
HAVE THEIR OWN FUNDING, AS YOU

14:38.010 --> 14:39.278
MENTIONED.

14:39.278 --> 14:41.380
YOU KNOW, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT,

14:41.380 --> 14:44.317
FROM A COUNTY GOVERNMENT AGENCY,

14:44.317 --> 14:46.119
WE DON'T GO OUT AND RECRUIT OR

14:46.119 --> 14:47.754
SOLICIT DONATIONS.

14:47.754 --> 14:48.621
>> Reporter: AFTER BETTY LANNING

14:48.621 --> 14:50.323
CAME LOOKING FOR HELP, EBLEN

14:50.323 --> 14:51.958
WORKED OUT A DEAL TO COVER HER

14:51.958 --> 14:53.392
REGULAR HEATING BILLS.

14:53.392 --> 14:54.761
GOVERNMENT DOLLARS COVER A

14:54.761 --> 14:56.596
LITTLE MORE THAN HALF THE COST;

14:56.596 --> 14:58.598
EBLEN'S PRIVATE FUNDS AND OTHER

14:58.598 --> 15:00.199
DONATIONS, INCLUDING FUNDS FROM

15:00.199 --> 15:02.168
THE LOCAL ENERGY COMPANY, MAKE

15:02.168 --> 15:03.302
UP THE REST.

15:03.302 --> 15:04.504
SO, DOES THAT BASICALLY MEAN

15:04.504 --> 15:05.838
THAT GOVERNMENT ISN'T DOING

15:05.838 --> 15:06.839
ENOUGH?

15:06.839 --> 15:08.241
>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW IF I

15:08.241 --> 15:09.208
COULD SAY THAT.

15:09.208 --> 15:10.676
I'M CERTAINLY NOT ONE TO POINT A

15:10.676 --> 15:11.944
FINGER AND SAY, "YOU'RE NOT

15:11.944 --> 15:12.812
DOING ENOUGH," BUT I THINK

15:12.812 --> 15:13.813
THERE'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY

15:13.813 --> 15:14.981
TO DO MORE.

15:16.015 --> 15:17.283
NEEDS ARE ALWAYS GOING TO

15:17.283 --> 15:18.785
OUTDISTANCE RESOURCES.

15:18.785 --> 15:19.585
I THINK, SINCE THE BEGINNING OF

15:19.585 --> 15:21.320
TIME, I THINK THAT THAT'S ALWAYS

15:21.320 --> 15:22.388
GOING TO HAPPEN.

15:22.388 --> 15:23.122
>> Reporter: PHILLIP HARDIN,

15:27.360 --> 15:28.795
ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITIES THAT

15:28.795 --> 15:29.962
DON'T HAVE CHARITABLE

15:29.962 --> 15:31.197

15:34.634 --> 15:36.969
DON'T EXIST.

15:45.211 --> 15:46.779
PAYING HEATING BILLS DOESN'T

15:46.779 --> 15:47.780
SOLVE THE WHOLE PROBLEM IN

WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA, WHERE

15:49.282 --> 15:51.117
MANY LOW-INCOME FAMILIES LIVE IN

15:51.117 --> 15:53.452
DRAFTY OLDER HOUSES OR POORLY

15:53.452 --> 15:55.655
INSULATED MOBILE HOMES.

15:57.623 --> 15:58.591

15:59.292 --> 16:00.126

16:21.080 --> 16:22.815
TECHNICIAN JACK HEUER SAYS THOSE

16:22.815 --> 16:24.383
SIMPLE MEASURES WILL SAVE NEARLY

16:24.383 --> 16:26.919
$300 A YEAR FOR THE FAMILY

LIVING IN THIS SINGLE-WIDE

16:35.061 --> 16:37.163
FINANCED WITH FEDERAL FUNDS, AND

16:37.163 --> 16:38.497
THE GOVERNMENT REQUIRES ANY

16:38.497 --> 16:40.132
IMPROVEMENTS TO BASICALLY PAY

16:40.132 --> 16:42.602
FOR THEMSELVES AFTER 15 YEARS.

16:42.602 --> 16:43.870
IN THIS CASE, THE PROJECT WILL

16:43.870 --> 16:48.341
BE PAID FOR IN ABOUT 12 YEARS.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.942
BUT FEDERAL RESOURCES FOR

16:49.942 --> 16:51.444

16:51.444 --> 16:52.712
TRIMMED, AS WELL.

WEATHERIZE 200 HOMES A YEAR.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.591

17:49.769 --> 17:52.905
I WOULD HAVE TO MOVE MY

17:52.905 --> 17:54.106
GRANDDAUGHTER IN WITH SOMEBODY

17:54.106 --> 17:55.441
OR... I DON'T KNOW HOW I WOULD

17:55.441 --> 17:56.542
DO IT.

17:57.310 --> 17:58.144
>> Sreenivasan: OF COURSE,

17:58.144 --> 17:59.445
MILLIONS OF POOR PEOPLE ACROSS

17:59.445 --> 18:00.947
THE COUNTRY FACE SIMILAR

18:00.947 --> 18:02.515
CHALLENGES PAYING THEIR HEATING

18:02.515 --> 18:03.182
BILLS.

18:03.182 --> 18:04.483
HOW WIDESPREAD IS THE PROBLEM,

18:04.483 --> 18:05.885
AND WHAT'S BEHIND IT?

18:05.885 --> 18:07.153
YESTERDAY, WE SPOKE TO MARK

18:07.153 --> 18:08.487
WOLFE IN WASHINGTON.

18:08.487 --> 18:09.655
HE'S THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF

18:09.655 --> 18:11.357
THE NATIONAL ENERGY ASSISTANCE

18:11.357 --> 18:13.326
DIRECTORS' ASSOCIATION.

18:13.326 --> 18:15.428
MARK WOLFE, HOW SIGNIFICANT IS

18:15.428 --> 18:17.396
FUEL INSECURITY IN THESE WINTER

18:17.396 --> 18:18.931
MONTHS?

18:18.931 --> 18:21.834
>> WELL, IT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.402
THE AVERAGE FAMILY SPENDS ABOUT

18:23.402 --> 18:26.005
2% TO 3% OF THEIR INCOME ON HOME

18:26.005 --> 18:27.606
HEATING.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.241
FOR A LOW-INCOME FAMILY, THOUGH,

18:29.241 --> 18:31.077
THEY SPEND MAYBE 10% TO 15% OF

18:31.077 --> 18:32.578
THEIR INCOME ON HOME HEATING,

18:32.578 --> 18:34.180
AND THE REASON IS SIMPLE: THEY

18:34.180 --> 18:35.881
JUST HAVE LESS MONEY.

18:35.881 --> 18:37.817
SO THAT, IF YOU'RE POOR, IT

18:37.817 --> 18:38.651
DOESN'T MEAN YOU USE LESS

18:38.651 --> 18:39.785
ENERGY; YOU STILL HAVE A HOUSE

18:39.785 --> 18:40.820
TO HEAT.

18:40.820 --> 18:41.921
AND IF ANYTHING, YOUR HOUSE

18:41.921 --> 18:43.422
MIGHT BE OLDER, MIGHT BE

18:43.422 --> 18:44.357
LEAKY.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.958
SO, YOUR BILL IS VERY HIGH

18:45.958 --> 18:47.593
RELATIVE TO INCOME, WHERE, FOR A

18:47.593 --> 18:49.095
MIDDLE-INCOME FAMILY, IT'S MUCH

18:49.095 --> 18:50.162
LOWER.

18:50.162 --> 18:51.597
SO, WE THINK ABOUT HOME ENERGY,

18:51.597 --> 18:53.299
YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT JUST THE

18:53.299 --> 18:54.767
BURDEN IT PLACES ON POOR

18:54.767 --> 18:56.502
FAMILIES TO STAY CONNECTED TO

18:56.502 --> 18:58.404
THE GRID AND TO CONTINUE TO BUY

18:58.404 --> 18:59.572
HOME HEATING OIL.

18:59.572 --> 19:00.706
AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE

19:00.706 --> 19:03.509
ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM HAS

19:03.509 --> 19:06.412
BEEN CUT FROM $5.1 BILLION IN

19:06.412 --> 19:10.116
2010 TO ABOUT $3.3 BILLION NOW.

19:10.116 --> 19:11.584
SO, WE'VE LOST CLOSE TO $2

19:11.584 --> 19:14.787
BILLION IN ASSISTANCE TO HELP

19:14.787 --> 19:15.588
FAMILIES.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.291
PLACES, SAY, FOR EXAMPLE, IN

19:19.291 --> 19:20.793
THE DEEP SOUTH WORSE OFF BECAUSE

19:20.793 --> 19:21.794
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE

19:22.561 --> 19:23.896
PREPARE FOR IT LIKE THE

NORTHEAST DOES?

19:25.564 --> 19:26.265
>> WELL, IT'S A LITTLE BIT

19:26.265 --> 19:26.766
DIFFERENT.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.234
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS.

19:28.234 --> 19:29.001
YOU KNOW, THERE'S FEDERAL

19:29.001 --> 19:30.369
FUNDING THAT'S SORT OF BASE

19:30.369 --> 19:32.972
FUNDING, WE CALL IT.

19:32.972 --> 19:34.373
AND THEN, STATES' UTILITIES

19:34.373 --> 19:36.075
ADD MONEY TO THAT.

19:36.075 --> 19:37.476
MOST OF THE EXTRA MONEY THAT'S

19:37.476 --> 19:39.311
ADDED TO ENERGY ASSISTANCE IS IN

19:39.311 --> 19:40.146
THE NORTHEAST AND MIDWEST

19:40.146 --> 19:41.047
STATES.

19:41.047 --> 19:42.748
ALSO IN THOSE STATES, THEY HAVE

19:42.748 --> 19:44.417
VERY STRONG SHUTOFF PROTECTION.

19:44.417 --> 19:45.451
SO, YOU FALL BEHIND IN YOUR

19:45.451 --> 19:47.453
BILL, SAY, IN MASSACHUSETTS,

19:47.453 --> 19:48.487
YOU CAN'T BE SHUT OFF.

19:48.487 --> 19:50.256
IT'S A PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN.

19:50.256 --> 19:51.624
AS YOU GO SOUTH, ESPECIALLY

19:51.624 --> 19:52.758
THE SOUTHERN STATES AND THE

19:52.758 --> 19:54.393
WESTERN STATES, THERE REALLY

19:54.393 --> 19:55.795
ARE NO SHUTOFF PROTECTIONS

19:55.795 --> 19:57.163
OR THEY'RE MUCH WEAKER.

19:57.163 --> 19:58.364
SO, IF YOU'RE A LOW-INCOME

19:58.364 --> 20:00.766
FAMILY, SAY, IN NORTH CAROLINA,

20:00.766 --> 20:01.834
IT'S MUCH HARDER.

20:01.834 --> 20:02.868
YOU FALL BEHIND IN YOUR BILL,

20:02.868 --> 20:04.036
THE STATE HAS LESS MONEY TO

20:04.036 --> 20:04.970
WORK WITH.

20:04.970 --> 20:06.072
THERE IS FEWER UTILITY

20:06.072 --> 20:07.273
SUPPORTS, AND THEY'RE MORE

20:07.273 --> 20:08.874
LIKELY TO GET INTO A SHUTOFF

20:08.874 --> 20:10.843
SITUATION OR FALL FURTHER BEHIND

20:10.843 --> 20:11.811
IN THEIR BILL BECAUSE THERE'S

20:11.811 --> 20:12.912
JUST LESS MONEY TO HELP THEM

20:12.912 --> 20:13.679
WITH.

20:13.679 --> 20:15.815
I MEAN, THIS IS NOT LIKE CURING

20:15.815 --> 20:16.415
CANCER.

20:16.415 --> 20:18.184
THIS IS A VERY, VERY

20:18.184 --> 20:19.218
STRAIGHTFORWARD PROBLEM.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.486
IT'S A BILL.

20:20.486 --> 20:21.654
AND IN THE NORTHEAST AND MIDWEST

20:21.654 --> 20:22.922
STATES, THEY HAVE MORE MONEY TO

20:22.922 --> 20:23.856
WORK WITH THAN, SAY, IN THE

20:23.856 --> 20:24.857
SOUTH OR WESTERN STATES.

20:24.857 --> 20:25.891
>> Sreenivasan: OKAY, SO THIS

20:25.891 --> 20:26.892
GETS INTO A LITTLE BIT OF THE

20:26.892 --> 20:28.260
PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION OF WHAT'S

20:28.260 --> 20:29.595
THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT AND

20:29.595 --> 20:31.030
WHAT'S THE ROLE OF ASSISTANCE IN

20:31.030 --> 20:32.798
POVERTY, RIGHT?

20:32.798 --> 20:33.666
>> WELL, EXACTLY.

20:33.666 --> 20:36.035
IN A SENSE, THERE'S A BROAD

20:36.035 --> 20:39.638
AGREEMENT THAT PROGRAMS LIKE

20:39.638 --> 20:42.074
SNAP OR FOOD STAMPS, MEDICAID,

20:42.074 --> 20:43.375
THEY'RE ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS IN

20:43.375 --> 20:44.543
THE SENSE THAT IF YOU'RE

20:44.543 --> 20:46.078
ELIGIBLE BASED ON INCOME, THERE

20:46.078 --> 20:47.713
WILL ALWAYS BE MONEY TO HELP

20:47.713 --> 20:48.414
YOU.

20:48.414 --> 20:50.382
ENERGY ASSISTANCE IS A

20:50.382 --> 20:51.650
DISCRETIONARY GRANT PROGRAM,

20:51.650 --> 20:52.318
WHICH MEANS THAT WHEN THE

20:52.318 --> 20:53.719
APPROPRIATION RUNS OUT, THE

20:53.719 --> 20:54.887
PROGRAM ENDS.

20:54.887 --> 20:56.689
SO THAT THERE'S A REAL

20:56.689 --> 20:57.423
DIFFERENCE.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.158
IT'S A SOCIETAL AGREEMENT TO

20:59.158 --> 21:00.426
HELP PEOPLE WITH FOOD, TO

21:00.426 --> 21:02.228
HELP OLD AGE... ELDERLY PEOPLE

21:02.228 --> 21:03.229
WITH SOCIAL SECURITY.

21:03.229 --> 21:05.397
THERE'S NOT A BROAD SOCIETAL

21:05.397 --> 21:06.532
AGREEMENT TO HELP PEOPLE WITH

21:06.532 --> 21:08.300
ENERGY, AND THAT'S THE REAL KEY

21:08.300 --> 21:09.435
DIFFERENCE.

21:09.435 --> 21:10.603
ONE OF THE OTHER DIFFERENCES IN

21:10.603 --> 21:11.637
ENERGY, THOUGH-- AND THIS IS

21:11.637 --> 21:14.073
WHERE I THINK WE GET INTO

21:14.073 --> 21:15.374
THIS SITUATION OF FAMILIES

21:15.374 --> 21:16.408
GETTING TO UNAFFORDABLE

21:16.408 --> 21:18.611
CASES-- IT'S NOT JUST THE

21:18.611 --> 21:20.279
PRICE OF ENERGY, IT'S ALSO

21:20.279 --> 21:21.614
HOW MUCH YOU USE.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.983
SO, IF THIS TURNS OUT... THIS

21:23.983 --> 21:25.618
WINTER TURNS OUT TO CONTINUE

21:25.618 --> 21:27.219
TO BE AS COLD AS IT IS, THEN

21:27.219 --> 21:28.587
FAMILIES WILL JUST NEED MORE

21:28.587 --> 21:29.789
MONEY TO PAY THEIR ENERGY

21:29.789 --> 21:31.290
BILL, AND THERE'S NOTHING TO

21:31.290 --> 21:32.258
HELP THEM.

21:32.258 --> 21:33.058
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

21:33.058 --> 21:34.393
SO, THEY HAVE TO SUBSTITUTE.

21:34.393 --> 21:36.195
AND LOW-INCOME FAMILIES BUY

21:36.195 --> 21:38.164
LESS MEDICINE, LESS FOOD BECAUSE

21:38.164 --> 21:39.231
THEY HAVE TO PAY THEIR ENERGY

21:39.231 --> 21:39.999
BILL.

21:39.999 --> 21:42.001
SO, IT'S A COMPLICATED

21:42.001 --> 21:43.736
QUESTION, BUT WE'VE ANSWERED IT

21:43.736 --> 21:45.604
IN THE AREA OF FOOD.

21:45.604 --> 21:47.540
WE'VE ANSWERED IT WITH, IN SOME

21:47.540 --> 21:48.841
CASES, IF YOU'RE LOW-INCOME,

21:48.841 --> 21:50.209
GETTING HOUSING ASSISTANCE.

21:50.209 --> 21:51.777
WE HAVEN'T REALLY ANSWERED IT

21:51.777 --> 21:52.611
WITH ENERGY.

21:52.611 --> 21:53.412
>> Srennivasan: ALL RIGHT, MARK

21:53.412 --> 21:54.213
WOLFE, THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF

21:54.213 --> 21:55.948
THE NATIONAL ENERGY ASSISTANCE

21:55.948 --> 21:57.049
DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION.

21:57.049 --> 21:58.617
THANKS SO MUCH.

21:58.617 --> 21:59.718
>> THANK YOU.

22:01.787 --> 22:02.721
>> Sreenivasan: HOW ARE SOME

22:02.721 --> 22:04.123
AMERICANS COPING WITH HIGH

22:04.123 --> 22:05.624
UTILITY BILLS THIS WINTER?

SUNDAY.

22:22.074 --> 22:23.142
>> Sreenivasan: A REPORT

22:23.142 --> 22:24.476
PUBLISHED EARLIER THIS WEEK IN

22:24.476 --> 22:26.045
THE MEDICAL JOURNAL "THE LANCET"

22:26.045 --> 22:27.379
WARNS THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE--

22:27.379 --> 22:28.914
PRIMARILY IN ASIA AND AFRICA--

22:28.914 --> 22:30.749
ARE POTENTIALLY AT RISK FROM A

22:30.749 --> 22:32.751
NEW STRAIN OF MALARIA.

22:32.751 --> 22:34.019
IT'S RESISTANT TO ONE OF THE

22:34.019 --> 22:35.554
MAIN DRUGS USED TO TREAT THE

22:35.554 --> 22:37.323
OFTEN FATAL DISEASE.

22:37.323 --> 22:38.924
I.T.V.'S SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT

22:38.924 --> 22:41.460
ALOK JHA HAS OUR REPORT.

22:41.460 --> 22:42.294
>> Reporter: MALARIA IS ONE OF

22:42.294 --> 22:43.495
THE WORLD'S MOST DEADLY

22:43.495 --> 22:44.730
DISEASES.

22:44.730 --> 22:46.131
CAUSED BY A PARASITE SPREAD BY

22:46.131 --> 22:48.801
MOSQUITOES, IT INFECTED 200

22:48.801 --> 22:50.803
MILLION PEOPLE LAST YEAR ALONE

22:50.803 --> 22:53.305
AND KILLED OVER 600,000.

22:53.305 --> 22:54.607
VACCINES AND DRUGS THAT WERE

22:54.607 --> 22:55.874
USED TO FIGHT THE PARASITE IN

22:55.874 --> 22:58.110
THE MID-20th CENTURY SOON BECAME

22:58.110 --> 22:59.878
USELESS AS THE BUG DEVELOPED

22:59.878 --> 23:01.513
RESISTANCE.

23:01.513 --> 23:03.182
A NEW DRUG, ARTEMISININ, GAVE

23:03.182 --> 23:05.351
HOPE IN RECENT DECADES, BUT NEW

23:05.351 --> 23:07.086
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THAT, TOO,

23:07.086 --> 23:08.754
IS LOSING ITS POWER.

23:08.754 --> 23:10.356
>> WE NOW KNOW PART OF THE

23:10.356 --> 23:12.024
MOLECULAR MACHINERY OF THE

23:12.024 --> 23:14.994
PARASITE THAT WORKS TO OVERCOME

23:14.994 --> 23:16.061
THIS DRUG.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.329
>> Reporter: IN 2005,

23:17.329 --> 23:19.431
ARTEMISININ-RESISTANT MALARIA

23:19.431 --> 23:20.733
PARASITES WERE DISCOVERED IN

23:20.733 --> 23:21.867
CAMBODIA.

23:21.867 --> 23:23.435
IT'S NOW SPREAD INTO FOUR

23:23.435 --> 23:25.938
OTHER COUNTRIES: LAOS; MYANMAR,

23:25.938 --> 23:28.274
FORMERLY BURMA; THAILAND; AND

23:28.274 --> 23:29.642
VIETNAM.

23:29.642 --> 23:31.343
TODAY'S REPORT IN "THE LANCET"

23:31.343 --> 23:33.312
SHOWS THAT THE RESISTANCE IS NOW

23:33.312 --> 23:35.347
PREVALENT IN MYANMAR, AND CASES

23:35.347 --> 23:37.850
HAVE APPEARED JUST 15 MILES FROM

23:37.850 --> 23:39.184
THE INDIAN BORDER.

23:39.184 --> 23:41.153
IF THE SPREAD CONTINUES AND

23:41.153 --> 23:43.322
REACHES INDIA OR AFRICA, THE

23:43.322 --> 23:45.157
CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE DIRE.

23:45.157 --> 23:46.258
>> I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY

23:46.258 --> 23:48.360
IMPERATIVE THAT WE GET ON TOP OF

23:48.360 --> 23:49.228
THIS.

23:49.228 --> 23:51.063
WE DO HAVE THIS EARLY WARNING.

23:51.063 --> 23:53.065
NOW IS THE TIME TO ACT, TO

23:53.065 --> 23:54.900
ACTUALLY TAKE ACTION AND MAKE

23:54.900 --> 23:56.669
SURE THAT THIS DOES NOT SPREAD.

23:56.669 --> 23:57.936
BECAUSE IF IT DOES, WE'RE GOING

23:57.936 --> 24:00.706
TO SEE MILLIONS OF CHILDREN IN

24:00.706 --> 24:03.342
AFRICA DYING FROM THIS.

24:03.342 --> 24:04.009
>> Reporter: THE NUMBER OF

24:04.009 --> 24:05.277
DEATHS FROM MALARIA HAS BEEN

24:05.277 --> 24:07.413
FALLING IN RECENT YEARS, BUT THE

24:07.413 --> 24:08.914
SPREAD OF ARTEMISININ-RESISTANT

24:08.914 --> 24:10.783
PARASITES COULD EASILY REVERSE

24:10.783 --> 24:11.884
THAT TREND.

BEFORE WE LEAVE YOU TONIGHT.

24:24.163 --> 24:25.964
THE WINTER OF 2015 JUST WON'T

24:25.964 --> 24:26.665
LET UP.

24:26.665 --> 24:28.100
FRIGID TEMPERATURES ONCE AGAIN

24:28.100 --> 24:29.468
ARE EXPECTED OVER MUCH OF THE

24:29.468 --> 24:31.103
NATION TOMORROW.

24:49.688 --> 24:51.590
WHAT WERE ONCE WHOLE TOWNS ARE

24:51.590 --> 24:53.659
NOW PILES OF RUBBLE.

24:55.427 --> 24:56.428
IT LOOKS LIKE AN ENORMOUS

24:56.428 --> 24:57.529
EARTHQUAKE RIPPED THROUGH

24:57.529 --> 24:59.698
HERE, BUT THIS IS ALL THE RESULT

24:59.698 --> 25:01.600
OF THE FEROCIOUS SUMMER WAR

25:01.600 --> 25:04.503
BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS.

25:06.138 --> 25:07.473
MONTHS LATER, AND IT STILL

25:07.473 --> 25:09.575
LOOKS LIKE "THE DAY AFTER."
