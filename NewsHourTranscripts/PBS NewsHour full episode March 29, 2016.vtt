JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:05.772 --> 00:07.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
Presidential candidates set
their sights on

00:10.677 --> 00:17.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wisconsin. Ted Cruz gets a
critical endorsement,
while Bernie Sanders aims to
continue his

00:17.517 --> 00:19.286 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
winning streak.

00:19.319 --> 00:23.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead this
Tuesday: Iraqi
Christians flee in staggering
numbers, as

00:23.724 --> 00:28.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISIS' grip tightens, but a small
militia group
is planning to fight back.

00:28.428 --> 00:31.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAFAA KHAMRO, Nineveh Plains
Forces (through
translator): Now we have only
one unit. We

00:31.598 --> 00:36.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need the help of the Kurds. We
have to increase
our numbers. If we have enough
forces, we

00:36.670 --> 00:38.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can protect the Christians in
this Nineveh
area.

00:38.839 --> 00:45.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And from group
homes to dorm
rooms: how one foster care
student beats the

00:45.078 --> 00:47.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
odds and wants to help others do
the same.

00:47.848 --> 00:50.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES TURNER, Former Foster
Youth: These kids
will be driven because they want
to make a

00:51.018 --> 00:55.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
name for themselves. You know,
foster care
and the group homes and foster
homes are gold

00:55.355 --> 00:56.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
mines for our nation.

00:56.857 --> 01:03.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:03.964 --> 01:06.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:06.333 --> 01:17.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: A crucial
endorsement, a criminal
charge, a critical contest, it
was all the

01:17.611 --> 01:24.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stuff of another long and
sometimes strange
day in the presidential campaign
of 2016.

01:24.484 --> 01:29.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All five major presidential
candidates descended
on Wisconsin today, the site of
the primary

01:29.923 --> 01:35.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
season's next big contest.
Governor Scott
Walker, who briefly sought the
Republican

01:35.195 --> 01:41.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nomination himself last year,
delivered his
in-demand endorsement to one of
the men attempting

01:41.335 --> 01:43.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to knock off front-runner Donald
Trump.

01:43.737 --> 01:48.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. SCOTT WALKER (R),
Wisconsin: I just really
decided, after all these years
of the Obama-Clinton

01:48.542 --> 01:54.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
failures, that it's time that we
elect a strong
new leader. And I have chosen to
endorse Ted

01:54.214 --> 02:00.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Cruz. Ted Cruz is the
best-positioned by far
to both win the nomination of
the Republican

02:00.354 --> 02:05.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Party and to then go on and
defeat Hillary
Clinton in the fall this year.

02:05.826 --> 02:10.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Cruz, in turn,
launched another
round of criticism at Trump,
this time pegged

02:10.931 --> 02:16.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to news that Trump campaign
manager Corey
Lewandowski was charged today
with assaulting

02:16.703 --> 02:19.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a reporter after a press
conference earlier
this month.

02:19.940 --> 02:23.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
When you have a campaign that is
built on

02:23.610 --> 02:30.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
personal insults, on attacks,
and now physical
violence, that has no place in a
political

02:30.417 --> 02:35.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign and has no place in our
democracy.
And I think it is a really
unfortunate development,

02:36.023 --> 02:43.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but I do think it helps clarify
for the voters
what the Trump campaign is all
about.

02:43.897 --> 02:48.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Trump's campaign
maintained that
Lewandowski is absolutely
innocent of this

02:48.668 --> 02:53.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
charge and denied that a tape
released by
the Jupiter, Florida, Police
Department showed

02:53.974 --> 02:56.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him grabbing reporter Michelle
Fields.

02:56.510 --> 03:03.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later in the day, on the way to
a town hall
in House Speaker Paul Ryan's
hometown of Janesville,

03:03.350 --> 03:05.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump responded to questions
about the charges.

03:05.318 --> 03:08.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
If you look at her, my look and
according

03:08.688 --> 03:13.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a lot of people, she's
grabbing at me,
and he's acting as an
intermediary and trying

03:13.126 --> 03:14.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to block her from doing that.

03:14.895 --> 03:20.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The news conference was over. It
was done.
It was finished, and she was
running up and

03:20.767 --> 03:24.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
grabbing and asking questions.
And she wasn't
supposed to be doing that.

03:24.104 --> 03:29.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Recent Wisconsin
polling shows
Trump, Cruz and Ohio Governor
John Kasich

03:29.643 --> 03:35.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a statistical tie. Kasich,
who held a town
hall in Waukesha this afternoon,
says he is

03:36.016 --> 03:37.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the strongest candidate for the
fall.

03:37.951 --> 03:40.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate:
I'm the only one that
consistently beats Hillary

03:40.587 --> 03:44.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Clinton. Nobody else
consistently beats her.
I beat her by 11 points in the
last poll.

03:45.025 --> 03:49.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that's probably going to
matter: Who is
it that can win? I think that's
why we're

03:49.696 --> 03:51.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
having a primaries.

03:51.598 --> 03:56.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Democrats Hillary
Clinton and
Bernie Sanders are also in a
tight race. Clinton

03:56.236 --> 04:00.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
focused today on gun violence
prevention in
Milwaukee, a city that has seen
increasing

04:00.240 --> 04:02.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rates of gun deaths.

04:02.142 --> 04:06.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
This needs to be a voting issue,
not number

04:06.880 --> 04:10.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
20 on the list, but number one
the list, especially
in zip codes like this one.

04:10.550 --> 04:12.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

04:12.352 --> 04:23.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Every
child deserves
to have a healthy, happy life,
regardless

04:23.897 --> 04:31.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the zip code he or she lives
in. And so
let's be committed to doing
everything we

04:31.338 --> 04:34.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can, in our own ways, to end
this epidemic.

04:34.107 --> 04:40.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: In Appleton,
Wisconsin, Sanders'
increasingly sharp criticism of
Clinton escalated

04:40.213 --> 04:43.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
again today, as he seeks to
paint her as out
of touch.

04:43.316 --> 04:47.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
I'm not wasting my time going to
rich people's

04:47.053 --> 04:50.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
homes begging them for their
campaign contributions.

04:50.056 --> 04:52.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

04:52.192 --> 05:03.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: I would
rather be here
with you in Appleton than
begging billionaires

05:03.069 --> 05:03.770 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for their money.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

05:05.539 --> 05:08.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: And this is
one of the
real differences of opinion that
Secretary

05:08.642 --> 05:15.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton and I have. It's how we
have chosen
to raise the money we need to
run our campaigns.

05:15.582 --> 05:21.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: With 42 Republican
and 86 Democratic
delegates up for grabs, the
candidates plan

05:21.855 --> 05:25.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to blanket the state between now
and next
Tuesday.

05:25.592 --> 05:31.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will begin a series of
discussions on key
issues in the presidential race
later in the

05:31.097 --> 05:32.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
program.

05:32.999 --> 05:36.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: U.S.
officials ordered families of
American diplomats

05:36.503 --> 05:43.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and military personnel to leave
parts of Turkey.
The order covers the U.S.
Consulate in Adana,

05:43.376 --> 05:48.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plus Incirlik Air Base, and two
military sites
in Western cities.

05:48.114 --> 05:54.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Washington, Pentagon
spokesman Peter Cook
cited ongoing security concerns,
without giving

05:54.054 --> 05:55.789 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
details.

05:55.822 --> 05:58.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER COOK, Pentagon Press
Secretary: This
was a decision made out of an
abundance of

05:58.391 --> 06:03.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
caution, given the overall
picture, the security
threats that -- that we looked
at in the region.

06:03.964 --> 06:11.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's no specific threat that
triggered
this, but a broader decision
based on what

06:11.204 --> 06:13.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we have seen in the region.

06:13.039 --> 06:18.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Officials also
restricted official
travel in Turkey, and updated an
existing

06:18.378 --> 06:20.547 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
warning on travel in general.

06:20.580 --> 06:26.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: In Pakistan,
authorities report
they're holding more than 200
suspects in

06:26.086 --> 06:31.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the wake of Sunday's suicide
bombing in Lahore.
They say they rounded up, and
then released,

06:31.291 --> 06:37.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
5,000 others. A Taliban faction
claimed responsibility
for the attack aimed at
Christians celebrating

06:37.063 --> 06:38.832 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Easter.

06:38.865 --> 06:42.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: An Egyptian man
hijacked a
jetliner on a domestic flight
today and forced

06:42.936 --> 06:48.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it to fly to Cyprus. Over the
next hours,
he let most of the passengers
go, and then

06:48.408 --> 06:51.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
finally gave himself up.

06:51.044 --> 06:54.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Diana Magnay of Independent
Television News
has our report.

06:54.481 --> 07:02.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANA MAGNAY: EgyptAir Flight
181, eight hostages
left on board eight hours into
this crisis.

07:02.055 --> 07:09.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Three men raced down the steps,
and Cypriot
security forces run toward the
plane.

07:09.329 --> 07:14.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then this remarkable image: One
man scrambles
from the cockpit window and
swings down the

07:14.634 --> 07:20.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
side of the aircraft in what
looks like a
practiced move. Then, moments
later, it's

07:21.007 --> 07:26.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over. The man thought to be the
hijacker stumbles
almost as he leaves the plane,
then walks

07:26.680 --> 07:32.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very casually towards waiting
security forces.

07:32.552 --> 07:38.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's been named as Egyptian
national Seif
Eldin Mustafa, pictured here in
a bizarre

07:38.124 --> 07:43.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
selfie with a British passenger
thought to
be from Aberdeen. In this photo,
the belt

07:43.363 --> 07:49.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he claimed was packed with
explosives is on
clear display. It was later
found to be fake,

07:49.069 --> 07:51.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just a collection of mobile
phone covers.

07:51.838 --> 07:57.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Cyprus' president didn't
seem too worried
either, making light of earlier
media reports

07:57.277 --> 08:03.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the hijacker had asked to
see his Cypriot
ex-wife. "Isn't everything
always about a

08:03.249 --> 08:06.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
woman?" he replied.

08:06.286 --> 08:11.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that this man could make it
through security
and divert a major airliner
without even a

08:11.424 --> 08:17.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weapon is clearly no laughing
matter, particularly
not for Egypt five months after
the downing

08:17.497 --> 08:23.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Russian flight in Sinai,
with major
concerns over airport security
still overshadowing

08:23.403 --> 08:25.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
its tourism industry.

08:25.238 --> 08:29.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Egyptian
authorities said eight
Americans were among the
foreigners on board

08:29.309 --> 08:31.044 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the flight.

08:31.077 --> 08:34.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The United Nations
Children's
Agency warned today that more
than 300,000

08:34.581 --> 08:40.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
children in Yemen face
malnutrition and famine.
UNICEF also said all sides in
the year-old

08:40.820 --> 08:46.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
war have forced children to
fight as soldiers.
And it said millions of Yemenis
lack access

08:46.593 --> 08:48.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to water and health care.

08:48.561 --> 08:52.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, the White
House announced a new effort to
stop the epidemic

08:52.932 --> 08:58.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of addiction to opioid
painkillers and heroin.
President Obama attended a
summit on the problem

08:58.905 --> 09:04.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Atlanta. He said he wants to
double the
number of addicts who get
medication for their

09:04.577 --> 09:06.413 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
problem.

09:06.446 --> 09:09.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
The most important thing we can
do is to reduce

09:09.115 --> 09:17.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
demand for drugs. And the only
way that we
reduce demand is if we're
providing treatment

09:17.624 --> 09:22.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and thinking about this as a
public health
problem, and not just a criminal
problem.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.330 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

09:24.364 --> 09:29.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also today, 60
medical schools
announced greater focus on
limiting the use

09:29.436 --> 09:31.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of opioid painkillers.

09:31.304 --> 09:36.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: There's a new twist
in the battle
over a transgender law in North
Carolina which

09:36.242 --> 09:41.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bars local governments from
allowing transgender
bathrooms and other
accommodations.

09:41.881 --> 09:46.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State Attorney General Roy
Cooper, a Democrat,
announced today he won't defend
the statute

09:46.686 --> 09:52.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in court. He called it a
national embarrassment.
Republican Governor Pat McCrory
signed the

09:52.192 --> 09:53.960 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
law last week.

09:53.993 --> 09:58.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Illinois
Republican Mark Kirk
met today with Supreme Court
nominee Merrick

09:58.932 --> 10:05.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Garland, the first GOP senator
to do so. He
praised the judge and criticized
colleagues

10:05.605 --> 10:09.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who've refused to meet with him
or to hold
confirmation hearings.

10:09.342 --> 10:12.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MARK KIRK (R), Illinois: I
think when
you just say I'm not going to
meet him at

10:12.946 --> 10:18.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all, that's too closed-minded.
We need for
rational, adult, open-minded
consideration

10:18.151 --> 10:21.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the constitutional process,
which Judge
Garland is a part of.

10:21.988 --> 10:27.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kirk is facing a
tough Senate
reelection fight in a
Democratic-leaning state.

10:27.393 --> 10:32.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On Wall Street,
stocks rallied
after Federal Reserve Chair
Janet Yellen reaffirmed

10:32.699 --> 10:37.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a go-slow approach on interest
rates. The
Dow Jones industrial average
gained more than

10:38.004 --> 10:46.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
97 points to close at 17633. The
Nasdaq rose
nearly 80 points, and the S&amp;P
500 added 18.

10:46.646 --> 10:53.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And actress Patty
Duke died
today of an intestinal
infection. As a teenager,

10:53.453 --> 11:01.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Duke won an Oscar as Helen
Keller in the 1962
film "The Miracle Worker." And
in the mid-1960s,

11:01.494 --> 11:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she played identical twins in
"The Patty Duke
Show" on TV. Later, she became
an advocate

11:07.100 --> 11:10.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for mental health. Patty Duke
was 69 years
old.

11:10.770 --> 11:16.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Still to come on the
"NewsHour":
the Supreme Court's first major
split decision

11:16.075 --> 11:23.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since Justice Scalia's death;
the DOJ cracks
an iPhone and reignites privacy
concerns;

11:23.583 --> 11:30.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
facing ISIS, Iraqi Christians
must decide
to flee or fight; and much more.

11:30.623 --> 11:40.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We turn now to
the Supreme
Court, where today's 4-4 split
was an unlikely

11:40.667 --> 11:46.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We turn now to
the Supreme
Court, where today's 4-4 split
was an unlikely

11:46.706 --> 11:52.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
win for labor unions, and a
stark example
of the impact of Justice
Scalia's death.

11:52.845 --> 11:58.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on today's highly
anticipated decision,
and the new dynamics of the
divided court,

11:58.451 --> 12:03.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we are joined by Marcia Coyle,
chief Washington
correspondent for "The National
Law Journal."

12:03.256 --> 12:05.024 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, welcome back, Marcia.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, "The National Law
Journal":
Thanks, Judy.

12:07.026 --> 12:08.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Actually, two
interesting developments
at the court today, but let's
start with that

12:08.761 --> 12:10.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
labor union case first.

12:10.630 --> 12:15.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remind us of the -- what the
arguments were
on each side. And this took
place when Justice

12:15.168 --> 12:16.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Scalia was still alive.

12:16.135 --> 12:17.904 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: That's correct.

12:17.937 --> 12:22.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The arguments were heard earlier
this year.
The case was brought by a group
of California

12:22.709 --> 12:28.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
public schoolteachers who were
not members
of the public employee union in
California.

12:28.581 --> 12:36.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They claimed that having to pay
what are called
agency fees or fair share fees
to the union

12:36.189 --> 12:42.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that actually is required by law
to represent
all of the public school
teachers violated

12:42.195 --> 12:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the teachers' First Amendment
speech and association
rights.

12:46.866 --> 12:52.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During the oral argument, Judy,
it appeared
that the court was going to rule
for the teachers.

12:52.372 --> 12:59.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It looked like the decision
might well have
been 5-4, with the five
conservative justices

12:59.679 --> 13:03.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the majority and needing
Justice Scalia
to make that majority.

13:04.017 --> 13:08.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, today, we
learned that
the court is divided. The eight
justices on

13:08.988 --> 13:11.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the court are divided, one-line
statement.

13:11.724 --> 13:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: A very common way
they handle
4-4 ties or splits. It's called
a per curiam

13:20.633 --> 13:26.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decision, an unsigned decision
in which the
court simply states that the
decision below

13:26.606 --> 13:30.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is affirmed by an equally
divided court. We
don't know who voted how.

13:30.877 --> 13:32.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, this means
what?

13:32.645 --> 13:38.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: It means that
agency shop fees
are constitutional in this
country under a

13:38.818 --> 13:42.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
40-year-old Supreme Court
decision.

13:42.255 --> 13:47.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It doesn't mean the end of the
issue. There
are other challenges pending in
the lower

13:47.794 --> 13:51.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
courts, so it may be a temporary
victory for
the union.

13:51.330 --> 13:55.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Marcia, can
we presume,
as long as there is not a ninth
justice who

13:55.535 --> 13:59.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is confirmed and sitting on the
court, that
there could very well be more
4-4, evenly

14:00.006 --> 14:00.673 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
split decisions?

14:00.707 --> 14:02.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: I think so, Judy.

14:02.709 --> 14:08.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We never know for sure, but I
think the second
thing that happened today is an
example of

14:08.247 --> 14:12.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how the court is struggling to
resolve some
of these very difficult
high-profile issues

14:12.952 --> 14:14.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it has before it.

14:14.754 --> 14:17.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And this is -- we
learned that
the court is asking for another
briefing on

14:17.924 --> 14:21.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
this Affordable Care Act
contraceptive case
that it had heard recently.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: That's right.

14:23.696 --> 14:28.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was a challenge brought by
a number of
religious nonprofits that claim
that notifying

14:28.735 --> 14:36.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the government that they object
to contraceptive
health insurance for their
employees, because

14:36.309 --> 14:41.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it requires them to notify the
government
of who their insurer is, makes
them complicit

14:41.314 --> 14:45.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in providing the insurance, a
violation of
their religious beliefs.

14:45.985 --> 14:51.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The court's order today really
is -- kind
of reflects the arguments we
heard last week,

14:51.691 --> 14:57.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in which you had several
justices, the chief
justice, Justices Kennedy and
Alito, sort

14:57.630 --> 15:04.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of accepting the charge that the
government
is hijacking the religious
nonprofit's insurance

15:04.704 --> 15:11.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plans, and the more liberal
justices accepting
the government's argument, there
is no hijacking,

15:11.644 --> 15:16.449 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there's probably no
accommodation that would
be acceptable to these
nonprofits.

15:16.482 --> 15:23.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the court has asked both
sides to suggest
alternatives that wouldn't
involve the religious

15:24.023 --> 15:28.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nonprofits in making any kind of
notification
to the government, but still
providing the

15:28.327 --> 15:31.964 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
insurance through the insurance
plan.

15:31.998 --> 15:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, quickly, it
looks like
they're looking for some middle
ground.

15:34.333 --> 15:36.135 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: It does.

15:36.169 --> 15:41.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The court does in the like to
divide 4-4,
because it doesn't resolve the
question. And

15:41.140 --> 15:45.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this case, it would leave the
law uneven
throughout the country.

15:45.044 --> 15:48.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The eight-member
court working
its way through these cases.

15:48.881 --> 15:49.749 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Definitely.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Marcia Coyle,
thank you.

15:52.518 --> 16:00.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: My pleasure, Judy.

16:00.493 --> 16:09.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A pitched battle
between the Obama
Justice Department and one of
the world's

16:09.168 --> 16:13.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
biggest tech companies appeared
to end abruptly
this week, when the government
decided to

16:13.773 --> 16:21.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drop its insistence that Apple
crack the code
for an iPhone used in the San
Bernardino shootings.

16:21.147 --> 16:27.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Apple had refused, insisting
such cooperation
would constitute a major breach
of privacy.

16:27.053 --> 16:31.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The impending standoff ended
yesterday when
the government announced it had
been able

16:31.324 --> 16:34.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to crack the phone after all,
without Apple's
help.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But questions remain.

16:36.729 --> 16:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For that, we turn to Devlin
Barrett, who covers
the Justice Department for The
Wall Street

16:40.766 --> 16:46.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Journal, and Fred Kaplan, a
columnist with
Slate. He's the author of "The
Dark Territory:

16:46.272 --> 16:48.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Secret History of Cyber
War."

16:49.008 --> 16:54.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Devlin, starting with you, did
one or the
other of the parties in this
case back away,

16:54.947 --> 16:56.716 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
just back up?

16:56.749 --> 16:58.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT, The Wall Street
Journal: The
government backed away. The
government said

16:58.517 --> 17:01.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- but it also got what it
wanted, in a sense,
because it got into the phone it
had been

17:01.420 --> 17:03.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
trying to get into for months.

17:03.289 --> 17:07.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what you saw happen was
that the government
spent two months saying it can't
get into

17:07.560 --> 17:12.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this phone without Apple, and
then at the
last minute, essentially, it
said, actually,

17:12.431 --> 17:16.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
someone has just come to us and
told us that
we can get into it without
Apple, and that's

17:16.302 --> 17:18.137 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what happened.

17:18.170 --> 17:21.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, Fred Kaplan, the
obvious question
for so many of us is, who broke
into the phone

17:21.741 --> 17:25.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for them, and how did they find
them, and
had they -- would they have been
able to find

17:25.778 --> 17:27.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them before without all of this
legal mishmash?

17:28.014 --> 17:33.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED KAPLAN, Slate: Well, it
seems to be an
Israeli cyber-security firm
called Cellebrite,

17:33.252 --> 17:41.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which consists mainly of retired
professionals
from the -- an outfit called
Unit 822, which

17:42.028 --> 17:52.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a -- the cyber-warfare branch
of the Israeli
intelligence agency, sort of the
Israeli NSA.

17:52.271 --> 17:56.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can imagine. Here's the FBI
saying, we
can't break into this phone.
Here's Apple

17:56.809 --> 18:01.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying, we don't want anybody to
break into
this phone. This is the most
secure phone

18:01.047 --> 18:06.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
out there. You have got
hundreds, maybe thousands
of hackers around the world who
look at this

18:06.085 --> 18:08.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and say, hmm, let me give this a
try.

18:08.654 --> 18:14.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, the law that the
FBI was invoking
to get Apple to open it
themselves, which

18:14.927 --> 18:22.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a 1789 law called the All
Writs Act, states
that if somebody else can do it,
if you can

18:22.802 --> 18:27.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
find some way to do it without
demanding that
a company like Apple do it, then
you have

18:27.440 --> 18:29.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to drop your suit.

18:29.141 --> 18:32.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why the FBI withdrew.
They had
to. They really didn't want to.
They thought

18:32.378 --> 18:39.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they had a good case here
and were ultimately
trying to test a new legal
principle to accommodate

18:39.785 --> 18:42.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for this new stronger era of
encryption.

18:42.588 --> 18:47.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, Devlin, let's
pick up on
that, because if indeed there is
another way

18:47.526 --> 18:52.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the hack into phones like this,
Apple's argument
had been there's a slippery
slope here, and

18:52.565 --> 18:57.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if we agree to do this, then
everybody -- then
we will have to do it in the
future. Is the

18:57.236 --> 18:59.005 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
slippery slope still in place?

18:59.038 --> 19:04.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT: The legal
argument is still
unresolved, and the battle will
go on. The

19:04.143 --> 19:08.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
war will go on even if the
battle ends on
this phone has ended.

19:08.047 --> 19:13.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there is in -- from a
technologist's point
of view, a real issue of, if you
do what the

19:13.819 --> 19:19.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government wants, there will
always be more
vulnerabilities to systems than
technologists

19:19.058 --> 19:20.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would like to see.

19:20.893 --> 19:24.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government's argument is,
you shouldn't
have devices that are
warrant-proof, that

19:24.530 --> 19:30.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even with a judge's order, we
can't -- meaning
the government, can't get into
and can't look

19:30.202 --> 19:32.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at and can't see if there is
evidence of a
crime in those devices.

19:32.538 --> 19:36.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But they didn't have
the -- they
didn't -- they weren't able to
set that legal

19:36.409 --> 19:38.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
precedent that they were
seeking, if that's
true.

19:38.344 --> 19:41.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT: No, but there's
ever reason
to expect that there will be
another phone

19:41.647 --> 19:43.349 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with a similar issue very soon.

19:43.382 --> 19:49.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's already a bunch of other
phones on
lesser cases that are in dispute
right now.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everyone expects that this fight
will only
continue.

19:51.757 --> 19:54.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, let's talk about
other cases,
Fred Kaplan.

19:54.326 --> 19:59.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is also -- there is a drug
case in Brooklyn
where we're expecting in a
couple weeks, if

19:59.165 --> 20:02.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not sooner, to hear about
whether the government
can get access to that phone.

20:02.935 --> 20:06.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED KAPLAN: Yes. There are
several drug cases
like that.

20:06.238 --> 20:11.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, local law enforcement
agencies,
they don't know how to hack into
these phones.

20:11.944 --> 20:18.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The FBI alone doesn't know how.
If this phone
had -- if there were some reason
to believe

20:18.984 --> 20:23.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that this phone had truly urgent
material
on it that the government had to
get hold

20:23.689 --> 20:29.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of for national security
purpose, the FBI
could have put in a request for
technical

20:29.161 --> 20:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
assistance to the National
Security Agency,
which would have been able to
open up this

20:34.934 --> 20:36.602 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
phone.

20:36.635 --> 20:41.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Things like that have happened
before. The
fact that the FBI didn't do this
suggests

20:41.107 --> 20:45.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to me that the issue wasn't the
phone, but
they were trying to create a new
legal precedent.

20:45.978 --> 20:48.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: What do you think
about that,
Devlin Barrett?

20:48.447 --> 20:52.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT: The FBI has
denied that. The
FBI has denied that the
government had any

20:52.418 --> 20:54.186 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
answers on this.

20:54.220 --> 20:58.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, I think Fred and a lot of
other people
are incredibly skeptical of that
explanation.

20:58.858 --> 21:02.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think one of the big tests of
this case
has been the FBI's credibility,
because some

21:03.028 --> 21:06.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of what they said has been
contradicted by
other things that they have
said. So it will

21:06.732 --> 21:08.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be interesting to see going
forward.

21:08.667 --> 21:11.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, Washington and Silicon
Valley have
a very tense relationship right
now.

21:11.637 --> 21:13.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, what about...

21:13.372 --> 21:14.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT: It will be
interesting to
see how this affects that
relationship. It

21:14.807 --> 21:16.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
worsens it, probably.

21:16.642 --> 21:19.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: What about Apple's
credibility?
This is one of these questions
where it seems

21:19.678 --> 21:22.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- so, there was a real argument
to be made
that Apple was being difficult.

21:22.481 --> 21:24.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT: Well, right.

21:24.216 --> 21:27.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's plenty of folks in
government
who believe that what Apple is
arguing is

21:28.020 --> 21:32.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ultimately a bad thing for
society. You know,
there are -- as Fred said, there
are outstanding

21:32.324 --> 21:36.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cases all over the country where
prosecutors
and detectives can't get into
phones.

21:36.128 --> 21:40.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are plenty of people who
say, that's
not a good outcome. There should
be a better

21:40.266 --> 21:45.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
solution to this. Do you really
want a situation
where, if someone you love is
murdered and

21:45.571 --> 21:50.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the evidence of that crime may
be on the victim's
phone, that you can't even get
into the victim's

21:50.743 --> 21:53.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
phone? That's the argument
against what Apple
has been saying.

21:53.445 --> 21:58.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Fred Kaplan, what --
if this were
a smaller company, not the
all-powerful Apple,

21:58.450 --> 22:04.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a smaller tech company with a
similar request
being made, do you think that
it's possible

22:04.123 --> 22:06.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that it would have had the same
outcome?

22:06.058 --> 22:12.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED KAPLAN: Well, look, you
know, in previous
cases, Apple has agreed to
unlock phones about

22:12.364 --> 22:16.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
70 times, usually under FISA
court orders.

22:16.368 --> 22:23.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this instance, I'm told that
it could have
quietly done something to give
the FBI the

22:23.475 --> 22:29.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
information that wouldn't have
opened up all
of their phones to
vulnerabilities, that wouldn't

22:29.381 --> 22:33.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have required them to write a
whole new operating
system. I'm not sure of that.

22:33.719 --> 22:42.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the thing is, there has been
an almost-century-long
history of telecoms cooperating
with intelligence

22:43.028 --> 22:50.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agencies, going back to Western
Union, AT&amp;T
and continuing into the Internet
age today.

22:50.903 --> 22:56.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Apple is a bit more libertarian
in its attitudes
than some of the other
companies.

22:56.842 --> 23:02.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The FBI was trying to sustain
this arrangement
where companies do cooperate.
Apple is trying

23:02.581 --> 23:11.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to create a new road to go out
on. I think
you're right that this conflict
is not over.

23:11.257 --> 23:13.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There will be another case.

23:13.092 --> 23:17.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At some point, the courts are
going to have
to decide about this. All of
these cases are

23:17.296 --> 23:22.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
based on laws that were written
long before
the age of cell phones and
digital technology.

23:22.801 --> 23:24.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Right.

23:24.570 --> 23:28.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED KAPLAN: It will be very
interesting to
see how the law ends up on this.
There's no

23:28.641 --> 23:30.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- everything is ambiguous.

23:30.342 --> 23:33.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, and perhaps
Congress is
going to end up weighing in as
well.

23:33.579 --> 23:37.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fred Kaplan, Devlin Barrett,
thank you both
very much.

23:37.416 --> 23:44.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEVLIN BARRETT: Thank you.

23:44.089 --> 23:50.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FRED KAPLAN: Thank you.

23:50.763 --> 23:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

23:55.134 --> 24:00.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
where candidates
stand on immigration and how
it's impacting

24:00.639 --> 24:06.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters; a young man in foster
care tries to
beat the odds; and how race
plays into the

24:06.845 --> 24:09.982 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
heroin crisis.

24:10.015 --> 24:15.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: Iraq's Christians
have fled the
country in startling numbers
since the U.S.

24:15.220 --> 24:22.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
invasion in 2003. That exodus
has been accelerated
by the ISIS onslaught over the
last two years.

24:22.761 --> 24:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now some are standing their
ground to fight
back.

24:27.366 --> 24:32.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Jane
Ferguson reports
from Irbil and the Nineveh Plain
in Northern

24:32.838 --> 24:34.606 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Iraq.

24:34.640 --> 24:41.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Iraqi Christians
celebrate
Easter's Holy Week, a time of
rebirth, hope,

24:42.014 --> 24:46.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
salvation. But many here see
little hope in
their ancestral lands. They have
fled ISIS'

24:46.985 --> 24:53.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grip for the nearby safety of
Irbil city,
and they have no idea if they
can ever go

24:53.192 --> 24:55.227 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
home.

24:55.260 --> 25:00.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Father Douglas Bazi has worked
to raise awareness
around the world of the plight
of Iraq's Christians.

25:01.033 --> 25:06.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yet even he understands why most
choose to
leave a nation they struggle to
feel a part

25:06.071 --> 25:07.873 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of.

25:07.906 --> 25:11.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FATHER DOUGLAS BAZI, Iraq: The
bigger problem
here is when the Christians
feeling that we

25:11.210 --> 25:20.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are not belong to this land
again -- anymore.
Without -- with this feeling, I
am not feeling

25:20.886 --> 25:26.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that I belong to Iraq. So, why I
am here?
Why should I be target every
time?

25:26.959 --> 25:33.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And don't -- please, don't blame
my people
when they, because always they
say, oh, it's

25:33.699 --> 25:40.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a shame, the Middle East without
-- without
Christians. It's really a shame.
The Christians,

25:40.339 --> 25:42.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they are leaving.

25:42.141 --> 25:47.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, why you put shame on my
people? Why not
put shame to those actually
force people to

25:47.746 --> 25:49.481 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
leave?

25:49.515 --> 25:52.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: The number of
Christians in
the Middle East has fallen from
14 percent

25:52.851 --> 26:02.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the population in 1910 to 4
percent in
2010. Before 2003, there were
around 1.5 million

26:02.961 --> 26:09.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Christians in Iraq. Now it is
believed less
than 200,000 remain.

26:09.201 --> 26:13.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And many of those have been
displaced from
their villages by the Islamic
State. These

26:13.906 --> 26:18.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Christians fled their town as
ISIS fighters
approached, losing everything
they have ever

26:19.011 --> 26:22.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
known in just a few terrifying
hours.

26:22.714 --> 26:28.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now they live in Father Douglas'
church yard.
They cannot go home, but they
have nowhere

26:28.487 --> 26:34.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
else to go. Compared to many
refugees in this
war, they are lucky. The global
Christian

26:34.726 --> 26:39.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community is supporting them,
and some have
been offered new lives in
Europe.

26:39.765 --> 26:45.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Hekmat Peter doesn't just
want to go home.
He wants to go back in time, to
when neighbors

26:45.904 --> 26:47.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lived in harmony.

26:47.706 --> 26:52.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEKMAT PETER, Iraq (through
translator): We
don't want a place for Christian
people only,

26:52.511 --> 26:58.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but like we used to live. Our
town was surrounded
by 30 villages of Muslims. So we
want to live

26:58.917 --> 27:02.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
together in peace, like we did
for many years.

27:02.955 --> 27:09.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Fighting back
will not solve
the problem either, says Father
Douglas. He

27:09.161 --> 27:13.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
believes resolutely that
Christians should
never take up arms against their
attackers.

27:13.866 --> 27:19.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FATHER DOUGLAS BAZI: We don't
believe in war
at all. We don't believe that
the rights should

27:19.771 --> 27:26.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
be taken by weapon. And,
actually, as a Christian,
we don't have militia belong to
the Christian.

27:26.278 --> 27:29.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, as a Christian, we don't
have a militia.

27:29.214 --> 27:34.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those people, if they want to go
to the military
and to serve there and be paid,
this is their

27:34.686 --> 27:39.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
choice. We are never giving a
blessing to
war.

27:39.892 --> 27:46.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JANE FERGUSON: These men
disagree. They are
Christians who have come
together into a small

27:46.565 --> 27:51.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
band of soldiers, coached by
Americans and
local Kurdish fighters called
the Peshmerga.

27:51.904 --> 27:57.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They named themselves the
Nineveh Plains Forces,
after this area north of Mosul
where many

27:57.776 --> 28:04.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Christian villages were
attacked. With less
than 300 men fighting, their
presence here

28:04.149 --> 28:09.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is almost entirely symbolic. But
their commander
believes they can help their
people.

28:09.955 --> 28:14.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAFAA KHAMRO, Nineveh Plains
Forces (through
translator): Now we have only
one unit. We

28:14.126 --> 28:19.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need the help of the Kurds. We
have to increase
our numbers. If we have enough
forces, we

28:19.197 --> 28:22.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can protect the Christians in
this Nineveh
area.

28:22.568 --> 28:28.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Commanders here
say these soldiers
don't have enough heavy weaponry
to be stationed

28:28.607 --> 28:33.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the front line permanently.
Instead, they
wait here about a mile from the
front line.

28:33.412 --> 28:41.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when there is an attack by
ISIS, they
move there quickly to back up
Peshmerga forces.

28:41.987 --> 28:48.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For these soldiers, the fight is
very personal.
This 23-year-old volunteer calls
himself George.

28:48.327 --> 28:53.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His whole family fled their
village, and he
says ISIS fighters are now
living in his home.

28:53.966 --> 28:57.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And how does it feel to have
ISIS living in
your house?

28:57.135 --> 29:06.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE, Nineveh Plains Forces:
It's a bad
feeling, so aggravated, so
angry, so mad.

29:06.311 --> 29:13.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, since they started here and
created this
force, I hear about it, and I
came and volunteered

29:13.719 --> 29:23.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to defend, to do everything. I
really want
to kill some of them. So, it's
like an angry

29:23.862 --> 29:27.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inside of me, angry what they
did to us.

29:27.799 --> 29:32.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: He thinks there
is too much
bad blood here for things to be
the same again.

29:32.971 --> 29:39.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Da'esh, or ISIS, are defeated
and they
are pushed out of Mosul, is it
going to be

29:39.077 --> 29:43.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
difficult for Christian
communities here to
live side by side with their
neighbors?

29:43.148 --> 29:46.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEORGE: Yes, I think it's going
to be hard
and difficult.

29:47.019 --> 29:51.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: George blames his
Muslim neighbors
for not standing up to ISIS.

29:51.089 --> 30:01.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE: They saw a lot of, like,
bad things,
and killing, kidnapping. So, I
don't think

30:01.233 --> 30:07.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so. I don't think they can
communicate with
them again.

30:07.973 --> 30:14.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: The men practice
house searches
amongst the remnants of the very
communities

30:14.613 --> 30:16.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they hope to protect.

30:16.948 --> 30:23.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This Christian town emptied out
in August
2014 when ISIS rushed in here
and took over.

30:23.755 --> 30:29.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Soon after, the Kurdish
Peshmerga forces pushed
them out. But the 1,000 or so
Christian families

30:29.561 --> 30:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who lived here never came back.
The town now
lies abandoned.

30:34.499 --> 30:38.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some houses are being used to
house Peshmerga
and Christian forces. And the
front line is

30:38.970 --> 30:45.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about one mile in that
direction. That's where
ISIS positions are. It's now
eerily silent

30:45.310 --> 30:50.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
here, except for some warplanes
that fly overhead.

30:50.315 --> 30:55.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A couple of miles away, where
the Nineveh
Plains meet mountains, the Saint
Hormuzd Monastery

30:55.253 --> 31:02.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
retains the defensive position
it has kept
for over 1,500 years. From its
peaceful courtyard,

31:02.327 --> 31:05.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the front line of fighting can
be seen in
the distance.

31:05.564 --> 31:10.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's a crumbling relic of
Christianity,
empty of the vibrant people it
once was built

31:10.969 --> 31:18.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to serve, looking out over a
land many in
its community feel is slipping
away from them.

31:18.376 --> 31:26.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Jane
Ferguson
in Northern Iraq.

31:26.918 --> 31:39.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back to this
country and the
2016 presidential race.

31:39.998 --> 31:46.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want to take a closer look at
significant
issues shaping the campaigns,
tonight, immigration.

31:46.538 --> 31:53.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The plans for reform range from
a tall border
wall funded by Mexico to a path
to citizenship

31:53.445 --> 31:57.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the 11 million undocumented
immigrants
living here now.

31:57.849 --> 32:03.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We dig into the issue and to the
role of Latino
voters with Mark Krikorian. He's
executive

32:03.989 --> 32:10.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
director of the Center for
Immigration Studies,
and the author of the book "The
New Case Against

32:10.061 --> 32:15.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Immigration, Both Legal and
Illegal." Frank
Sharry, he's founder of the
immigration reform

32:15.801 --> 32:21.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
group America's Voice. And
Brittney Parker,
she's a senior officer at the
Commonwealth

32:21.973 --> 32:28.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Foundation. It's a nonpartisan,
nonprofit
think tank that promotes free
market ideas.

32:28.380 --> 32:31.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome all three of you
to the "NewsHour."

32:31.283 --> 32:33.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mark Krikorian, let me start
with you first.

32:33.685 --> 32:38.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's talk about the Republican
candidates
for president. What are they
saying? How are

32:38.423 --> 32:45.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they differing? At this point,
it's -- you
have got Ted Cruz, Donald Trump
and John Kasich.

32:45.363 --> 32:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do they differ on the
subject of immigration?

32:47.599 --> 32:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK KRIKORIAN, Executive
Director, Center
for Immigration Studies: There's
actually

32:48.433 --> 32:50.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a pretty wide range between
them.

32:50.168 --> 32:54.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kasich is actually probably much
closer to
the Democratic candidates, wants
to amnesty

32:54.840 --> 33:01.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
illegal immigrants and increase
immigration.
Ted Cruz is actually, in a
sense, kind of

33:01.279 --> 33:09.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in between, because Trump has
said in his
published platform he wants to
reduce immigration,

33:09.120 --> 33:10.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
among other things.

33:10.956 --> 33:15.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not sure he's read his own
platform, but
at least that's what it says in
print. Cruz

33:15.660 --> 33:20.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is kind of in the middle. He's
called for
no increases in immigration,
reforms in certain

33:20.065 --> 33:24.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
programs, toughening of
enforcement. So, there
is actually a pretty entered
range, whereas,

33:24.469 --> 33:27.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the Democratic side, the two
candidates
pretty much agree on everything.

33:27.505 --> 33:30.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Brittney Parker,
how do you
see the Republican candidates on
immigration?

33:30.709 --> 33:35.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRITTNEY PARKER, Commonwealth
Foundation:
Well, the thing is that,
unfortunately for

33:35.080 --> 33:40.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kasich, who is probably most in
line with
the majority of Republican
primary voters,

33:40.585 --> 33:46.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
despite what Trump would say, is
not many
people know what Kasich's
immigration platform

33:46.758 --> 33:51.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is. He just doesn't capture the
headlines
the way that Cruz or Trump does.

33:51.663 --> 33:56.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cruz, much more in between the
two candidates
-- I agree with Mark on that --
but increasingly

33:56.301 --> 34:01.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
moving to more hard-line
immigration stance,
especially compared to where he
used to be

34:01.606 --> 34:03.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just a few years ago.

34:03.441 --> 34:05.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Frank
Sharry, as somebody
who is coming at this from the
other side

34:05.744 --> 34:10.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the political spectrum, how
do you see
voters so far in these
Republican primaries

34:10.348 --> 34:12.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
responding to these candidates?

34:12.183 --> 34:14.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANK SHARRY, Founder, America's
Voice: Look,
the animating issue in the
immigration debate

34:14.352 --> 34:19.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right now is what to do about 11
million undocumented
immigrants who live and work in
America.

34:19.324 --> 34:24.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump has gone far beyond
anything we have
seen, and by saying that he's
going to round

34:24.896 --> 34:30.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up and deport people within 18
to 24 months,
a remarkable thing. The wall
gets a lot of

34:30.902 --> 34:36.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attention, but the idea that we
would have
that kind of mass roundup of
people who are

34:36.474 --> 34:41.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
settled in America, it would be
one of the
most outrageous human rights
violations in

34:41.446 --> 34:43.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the modern world.

34:43.214 --> 34:44.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But he's still
doing well in
the primaries. He's ahead in
delegates.

34:44.215 --> 34:46.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRANK SHARRY: He's still doing
well.

34:46.051 --> 34:50.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, let's remember Mitt Romney
had a hard-line
policy in 2012. It cost him
big-time with

34:50.355 --> 34:55.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Latino voters, arguably cost him
the election.
And that's why the RNC said, we
need a kinder,

34:55.226 --> 34:56.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
gentler approach.

34:57.028 --> 34:58.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Krikorian,
let me ask
you to put the shoe on the other
foot. Looking

34:58.830 --> 35:03.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the Democratic primaries, how
do you see
the differences between Hillary
Clinton and

35:03.768 --> 35:05.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bernie Sanders, and how do you
see that breaking...

35:05.637 --> 35:06.137 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

35:06.171 --> 35:08.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK KRIKORIAN: Yes.

35:08.039 --> 35:11.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The interesting thing is, there
really isn't
any daylight between them.
Hillary was -- seems

35:11.576 --> 35:17.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be moving farther and farther
to the left
on a variety of issues,
obviously, not just

35:17.115 --> 35:22.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immigration, to compete with
Sanders. And
they both have said in a recent
debate explicitly,

35:22.721 --> 35:27.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they said that there is no one
they would
deport who wasn't convicted of a
violent crime.

35:27.926 --> 35:32.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In other words, they have said
that every
illegal immigrant here and every
new illegal

35:32.697 --> 35:37.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immigrant would be allowed to
stay as long
as they're not convicted of a
violent crime.

35:37.736 --> 35:42.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's really an extreme, very
extreme position.
And it's essentially the same
between the

35:42.540 --> 35:44.309 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two of them.

35:44.342 --> 35:48.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Brittney Parker,
as a Puerto
Rican woman who follows these
issues very

35:48.813 --> 35:55.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
closely, how do you see the
Democratic divide,
and how concerned are you for
the Republican

35:55.186 --> 36:00.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Party that it is not
representing the views
of those who believe the country
needs to

36:00.525 --> 36:04.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be more forgiving and more
understanding when
it comes to immigration?

36:04.729 --> 36:09.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRITTNEY PARKER: Being part of
the Latino
community, immigration is a top
issue. Almost

36:09.467 --> 36:13.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
everyone in the Hispanic
community knows someone
affected by immigration.

36:13.171 --> 36:18.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And part of the problem that
you're seeing
on the right isn't even the
hard-line stances,

36:18.376 --> 36:23.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which, let's be honest, we're
not going to
deport 12 million people. It's
the rhetoric.

36:23.281 --> 36:27.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the selling of outrage in
regards to
these issues.

36:27.252 --> 36:31.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a complete turnoff. It just
pushes away
-- people away before they can
even start

36:31.656 --> 36:34.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to have the conversation about
how to fix
the broken immigration system.

36:34.893 --> 36:42.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Frank Sharry,
respond to that,
and also to what one often hears
about Democrats,

36:42.801 --> 36:45.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they may be taking the
Latino, the Hispanic
vote for granted.

36:45.970 --> 36:47.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRANK SHARRY: Yes, I'm actually
pleased.

36:47.839 --> 36:53.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Mark is right that both
Hillary Clinton
and Bernie Sanders are really
leaning in,

36:53.378 --> 36:57.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they're trying to show the
Latino community
that they're on their side, in
hopes of a

36:57.282 --> 37:05.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
big turnout. And I do think
that, you know,
they're exploiting a Republican
lurch to the

37:05.056 --> 37:06.791 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right.

37:06.825 --> 37:10.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have never seen the
difference between
the two parties so wide. And the
Latino vote

37:10.095 --> 37:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is going to be of consequence in
a number
of key swing states, Florida,
Colorado, Nevada,

37:15.767 --> 37:21.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Carolina, New Mexico,
Virginia. Honestly,
this could be -- the fact that
the Republicans

37:21.606 --> 37:26.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have gone so far towards the
extreme on immigration
could really hurt them with a
critical population

37:26.744 --> 37:27.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's going to help decide the
election.

37:27.946 --> 37:29.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does that worry
you, Mark Krikorian?

37:29.747 --> 37:32.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK KRIKORIAN: Well, first of
all, I mean,
I'm personally Republican. My
organization

37:32.517 --> 37:35.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
isn't. So, I mean, I'm looking
at this from
the outside.

37:35.386 --> 37:40.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what Frank is talking about
could actually
happen. I mean, there's no
question that Donald

37:40.458 --> 37:44.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's rhetoric, at the very
least, raises
hackles on the parts of a lot of
people.

37:44.996 --> 37:50.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, all the political
predictions
about this election have been
wrong up until

37:50.235 --> 37:55.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now. I think there's a real
possibility that
the Democratic candidates, in
their attempt

37:55.874 --> 38:01.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to pander to Hispanic voters, or
at least
to Hispanic activist
organizations, are actually

38:01.713 --> 38:07.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
turning away a lot of their own
voters who
were otherwise predisposed to
vote for a Democrat.

38:07.218 --> 38:11.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's what you're seeing, a
lot of Trump
support coming from people who
are otherwise

38:11.489 --> 38:17.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats. So, I think -- I
really -- I don't
think it's obvious what effect
immigration

38:17.729 --> 38:20.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is going to have. We're all
speculating on
this. And you're obviously
always speculating

38:20.999 --> 38:22.534 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
until there is an election.

38:22.567 --> 38:25.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is much more fluid and much
less predictable
than at any time in the past.

38:25.803 --> 38:28.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Brittney Parker,
do you agree
with that?

38:28.806 --> 38:34.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRITTNEY PARKER: I agree that
we're not sure
what is going to happen, what
exactly the

38:34.145 --> 38:36.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
role immigration is going to
play in this
election.

38:36.314 --> 38:40.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I would say that almost
every major poll
that's come out does show that
the majority

38:40.952 --> 38:47.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Americans support -- do not
support deportation
of the 12 million, and support
some type of

38:47.625 --> 38:49.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
immigration reform.

38:49.527 --> 38:53.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, yes, about 40 percent of
Republican primary
voters are supporting Donald
Trump and his

38:53.998 --> 39:01.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
espoused rhetoric on deportation
and lessening
legal immigration, but that
still leaves 60

39:01.372 --> 39:06.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
percent of Republican primary
voters who are
not in agreement with his stance
and the general

39:07.011 --> 39:12.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
electorate. That leaves
moderates, libertarians,
independents, Democrats, who
tend to disagree

39:12.350 --> 39:14.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with Donald Trump on this issue
of immigration.

39:14.485 --> 39:18.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You just made the
point, Mark
Krikorian, that you are a
Republican personally.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's not representative of
your organization.

39:20.758 --> 39:24.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what does it mean for the
Republican Party
if Donald Trump were elected and
carried out

39:24.829 --> 39:25.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what he says he's going to do?

39:25.897 --> 39:27.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK KRIKORIAN: I don't know. We
will see.

39:27.732 --> 39:32.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, he's not going to
be deporting
everybody. This is -- the
interesting thing

39:32.170 --> 39:37.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, you know, when they take
these exit polls
about people supporting a path
to citizenship,

39:37.609 --> 39:41.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of the people who are
answering yes
to that are also Trump's voters.

39:41.112 --> 39:47.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In other words, I think people
are misunderstanding
what this poll question about do
you support

39:47.118 --> 39:52.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a path to citizenship means. I
support a path
to citizenship for some portion
of illegal

39:52.223 --> 39:53.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
immigrants, so I could be
answering yes.

39:53.992 --> 39:57.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question is, what do we do
before that?
How do we make sure that, if we
do have an

39:58.029 --> 40:05.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amnesty, it's the last amnesty?
And that -- no
one trusts regular politicians
to legalize

40:05.236 --> 40:09.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
illegal immigrants without
creating a new
problem in the future. And that
is what a

40:09.474 --> 40:11.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lot of Trump's appeal is.

40:11.175 --> 40:13.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Frank Sharry,
what's the main
question for you going into this
election

40:13.678 --> 40:15.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
when it comes to immigration?

40:15.513 --> 40:21.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANK SHARRY: Are Latinos going
to turn out?
Are Democrats and progressives
going to invest

40:21.953 --> 40:23.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Latino turnout?

40:23.755 --> 40:29.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it could be a real
game-changer for
Democrats and progressives in
this election.

40:29.661 --> 40:33.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Will Donald Trump get the
nomination, and
what will he represent to
Latinos who are

40:33.464 --> 40:39.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deeply offended when he calls
hardworking
Mexicans criminals and drug
dealers and rapists,

40:39.570 --> 40:43.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when he says -- he threatens to
take citizenship
away from their kids who were
born here?

40:43.308 --> 40:48.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we're going to see a
referendum on
immigration, on race and
inclusion, where

40:48.479 --> 40:50.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hispanic voters going to be
decisive in elections.

40:50.481 --> 40:56.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we have
months to go
and much more to unfold about
this issue.

40:56.287 --> 41:04.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We thank you, all three, Frank
Sharry, Mark
Krikorian and Brittney Parker.
Thank you.

41:04.228 --> 41:10.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRITTNEY PARKER: Thank you.

41:10.168 --> 41:17.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Only 2 percent of
children living
in foster care will earn a
college degree

41:17.675 --> 41:20.044 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by the time they turn 25.

41:20.078 --> 41:24.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have the story tonight of a
student in
Florida working to defy those
odds and to

41:24.615 --> 41:26.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
change them for others as well.

41:26.918 --> 41:32.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s April Brown has
our profile,
the second in a series of
stories on foster

41:32.457 --> 41:33.791 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
care.

41:33.825 --> 41:38.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of our weekly series
on education,
Making the Grade.

41:38.062 --> 41:43.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Last year at his
high school
in Orlando, Florida, James
Turner was known

41:43.201 --> 41:49.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by many for his blazing speed in
the 400-meter
dash. He was dedicated and
driven, and several

41:49.340 --> 41:54.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
college track coaches had taken
notice. But
what many didn't know was that
James was running

41:54.746 --> 41:57.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a far more difficult race off
the track.

41:57.148 --> 42:00.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES TURNER, Former Foster
Youth: You know,
before 5, they said I had 17 --
I lived in

42:00.485 --> 42:02.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
17 different foster homes.

42:02.553 --> 42:06.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: James Turner has
never really
had what most people take for
granted: what

42:06.524 --> 42:12.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they call in foster care a
forever family.
Placed in care at just 18 months
old, James

42:12.330 --> 42:17.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was separated from all three of
his siblings
by the time he was 5, and has
had little contact

42:17.268 --> 42:19.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with any of his family ever
since.

42:19.604 --> 42:24.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At 8, he almost was adopted by a
family he
loved that was moving to
Jamaica, but, at

42:24.776 --> 42:30.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the last minute, he decided he
couldn't leave
his school, his neighborhood and
his country.

42:30.047 --> 42:35.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's a decision he still
regrets. James says
the next foster home was a
violent place.

42:35.453 --> 42:42.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES TURNER: The dad of the
home, he beat
me a lot and his kids also and
other kids

42:42.393 --> 42:46.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he took into the system.
And he said
-- his excuse was -- and I
remember he was

42:46.564 --> 42:50.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
always telling us, "Well, my
foster mom did
it, so I'm going to do it to
you."

42:50.435 --> 42:54.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: In another foster
home, James
says the father set mousetraps
in front of

42:54.572 --> 42:58.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the refrigerator after he caught
the children
sneaking extra food.

42:58.142 --> 43:01.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES TURNER: And I remember,
the guy, he
showed us with a carrot. He
said, if you come

43:01.145 --> 43:04.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out here at night and take food
from the refrigerator
again, this is what will happen
to your finger.

43:05.016 --> 43:07.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we watched the carrot get
broken in half.

43:07.752 --> 43:12.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: By the age of 12,
James was mainly
living in group homes, something
that often

43:12.757 --> 43:17.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happens, according to Betsey
Bell, who runs
Orlando's Foundation for Foster
Children,

43:17.528 --> 43:19.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an organization that has helped
James since
high school.

43:19.464 --> 43:23.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETSEY BELL, Foundation for
Foster Children:
As kids grow older, if they are
not adopted

43:23.267 --> 43:29.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out by age 9, then their chance
of being adopted
and being part of a forever
family are much

43:29.307 --> 43:33.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
smaller. And so what we see,
though, is, at
that same time, when kids are
getting older,

43:33.411 --> 43:36.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they are in group homes, because
there is
just not enough foster homes.

43:36.848 --> 43:41.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: As he grew up,
James changed
group homes and schools several
times. But

43:41.486 --> 43:44.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he learned how to advocate for
himself and
for other kids in care.

43:44.889 --> 43:48.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETSEY BELL: He was the big
brother. He was
the one that kids would go to,
that they knew

43:48.493 --> 43:49.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
James would help them.

43:49.994 --> 43:53.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: However, James
found few adults
he could really trust.

43:53.297 --> 43:59.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES TURNER: I find myself
always examining
people and observing things. I
think it scarred

43:59.303 --> 44:04.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me for the rest of my life,
because I cannot
-- I cannot go throughout a day
without having

44:04.442 --> 44:07.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to -- trying to figure somebody
out who is
directly involved in my life.

44:07.979 --> 44:12.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: That slowly began
to change when
James arrived at Orlando's Boone
High School.

44:12.817 --> 44:17.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wanted to go out for track,
but didn't
have track shoes. The staff at
the Foundation

44:17.054 --> 44:19.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for Foster Children got him a
pair.

44:19.457 --> 44:24.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then he met the school's
college counselor,
Weeze Cullen. He told her he
wanted to go

44:24.629 --> 44:28.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
straight to Florida State
University after
graduation and earn a business
degree.

44:28.332 --> 44:30.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WEEZE CULLEN, College Counselor,
Boone High
School: I think it's much more
common for

44:30.768 --> 44:34.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
students in the foster system to
be working
on just graduating high school.

44:34.438 --> 44:38.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: In fact, national
studies show
only about half of students in
foster care

44:38.776 --> 44:44.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the U.S. graduate from high
school. Fewer
than one in 10 enroll in college
at all, fewer

44:44.282 --> 44:46.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
still in four-year schools.

44:46.918 --> 44:51.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But James drove himself to beat
those odds,
and he and Cullen began
outlining a plan to

44:51.856 --> 44:57.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get him to FSU. However, some
unexpected hurdles
emerged, because it seemed few
case workers

44:57.995 --> 45:01.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were familiar with how to apply
for college
and financial aid.

45:01.299 --> 45:04.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WEEZE CULLEN: I think they were
unfamiliar
because they don't send students
to four-year

45:04.435 --> 45:11.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
schools. And so I'm not sure
that that's something
they spend a lot of time doing
because it

45:11.876 --> 45:13.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just doesn't happen.

45:13.110 --> 45:15.046 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: But, for James, it
did happen.

45:15.079 --> 45:17.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN THRASHER, President,
Florida State University:
I wanted to take this
opportunity to offer

45:18.015 --> 45:19.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
my congratulations to James.

45:19.984 --> 45:24.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: And even university
president
John Thrasher wanted to
congratulate him.

45:24.055 --> 45:28.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Your sense of self really
is shaped by
powerful forces you may or may
not think about.

45:28.726 --> 45:33.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
APRIL BROWN: Today, the
19-year-old recently
began his second semester and
says he wouldn't

45:33.631 --> 45:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have made it if not for Cullen.

45:35.633 --> 45:41.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES TURNER: FSU, I thought,
was out of reach.
And she made it more reasonable,
and she made

45:41.038 --> 45:42.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it seem a lot more possible.

45:42.974 --> 45:47.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: James' tuition and
fees are paid
for by the state because he went
through Florida's

45:47.278 --> 45:53.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
foster care system. He also was
admitted into
a program specifically designed
to ease the

45:53.584 --> 45:57.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
transition to college for
first-generation
students.

45:57.321 --> 46:03.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FSU's Center for Academic
Retention and Enhancement,
known as CARE, helps with
financial aid and

46:03.361 --> 46:08.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has dedicated advisers and other
resources
available for the student's
entire college

46:08.132 --> 46:10.001 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
career.

46:10.034 --> 46:11.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALLY MCRORIE, Provost, Florida
State University:
There are so many needs that
they have that

46:11.102 --> 46:12.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the typical college student
doesn't have.

46:12.970 --> 46:15.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Sally McRorie is
FSU's provost.

46:15.539 --> 46:23.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALLY MCRORIE: We have students
in this group
who are food-insecure, so we
have had a food

46:23.314 --> 46:28.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bank, a food pantry. We have
students who
have nowhere to go on break when
the resident

46:28.986 --> 46:30.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
halls are closed down.

46:30.755 --> 46:34.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: That's frequently a
problem for
foster youth like James. When he
decided to

46:34.091 --> 46:38.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
return to Orlando for winter
break, he didn't
know at first where he'd stay.
But then two

46:38.796 --> 46:43.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
families he met last spring at a
fund-raiser
for the Foundation for Foster
Children opened

46:43.501 --> 46:46.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their doors to him. James spent
his holidays
visiting both.

46:46.537 --> 46:52.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES TURNER: It's so weird to
be in a family
setting again after being in
group homes for

46:52.543 --> 46:57.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so long. So, these families that
are opening
up their home to me, they don't
know that

46:57.581 --> 47:00.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're serving a great -- they
are doing
something so great.

47:00.584 --> 47:06.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: On our way back to
Tallahassee
and FSU, James shared his most
ambitious plan

47:06.190 --> 47:10.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
yet. He wants to use his
business degree to
reform the state's foster care
system and

47:10.961 --> 47:14.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hopes to develop an app and a
Web site specifically
for the kids.

47:14.665 --> 47:19.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES TURNER: That they can
relate and share
their experiences at different
group homes.

47:19.070 --> 47:23.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They can even rate group homes.
They can rate
caseworkers. They can rate
staff. They can

47:23.340 --> 47:27.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rate all this stuff. They can
rate their judges.
They can rate their experiences
that they

47:27.311 --> 47:33.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had in different foster homes
and foster parents,
and talk about how different
caseworkers are

47:33.284 --> 47:35.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doing different things, making
other people
aware.

47:35.519 --> 47:40.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: But he says, above
all, he wants
to help make sure kids in the
system get one

47:40.091 --> 47:41.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thing they all need.

47:41.926 --> 47:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES TURNER: Just someone to
care. It's as
simple as that, someone who
cares, at least

47:48.699 --> 47:50.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
one person who cares.

47:50.534 --> 47:54.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Today, James has
given up on
running competitively, focusing
his free time

47:54.238 --> 47:56.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
instead on speaking to both
large groups...

47:56.874 --> 48:00.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAMES TURNER: At age
1-and-a-half, I was entered
into foster care, but didn't
know until the

48:00.978 --> 48:01.779 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
age of 6.

48:01.812 --> 48:03.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: ... and smaller
ones.

48:03.347 --> 48:05.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES TURNER: We're already
ahead of the game.
We just got to get there.

48:05.149 --> 48:09.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Like here at the
Florida United
Methodist Children's Home
outside Orlando.

48:09.553 --> 48:13.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
James never lived in this group
home, but
he offered their foster youth
guidance on

48:13.557 --> 48:15.426 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
life in college.

48:15.459 --> 48:18.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES TURNER: You get into
college, and people
have to live with each other.
You hear these

48:18.596 --> 48:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
little people, these little
girls and these
guys complaining about their
roommate. And

48:22.933 --> 48:26.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was like, dude, I lived in
group homes my
all my life. I had roommates
worse than this.

48:26.203 --> 48:27.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Like, this is nothing. You know
what I mean?

48:27.772 --> 48:30.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: His story has also
inspired many
at Florida State.

48:30.374 --> 48:34.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALLY MCRORIE: These students
deserve our
help. They will be great, just
like James.

48:34.645 --> 48:40.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They will be great spokespeople.
They will
be movers and shakers in their
future communities.

48:40.384 --> 48:43.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all they need is the chance
and a little
bit of help to do that.

48:43.420 --> 48:46.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: That's a sentiment
James couldn't
agree with more.

48:46.123 --> 48:49.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES TURNER: These kids will be
driven because
they want to make a name for
themselves. You

48:49.794 --> 48:54.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, foster care and the group
homes and
foster homes are gold mines for
our nation.

48:54.765 --> 48:59.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: And, at this point
in his life,
James has found a different kind
of forever

48:59.570 --> 49:01.305 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
family.

49:01.338 --> 49:03.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES TURNER: Every kid, you
know, that was
in foster care, every kid that
can relate

49:03.107 --> 49:08.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with what I can relate to, you
know, they
are my family now, and they are
adopted into

49:08.145 --> 49:09.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
me, and I'm adopted into them.

49:09.547 --> 49:16.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm April
Brown in Florida.

49:16.520 --> 49:27.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
a "NewsHour"
essay.

49:27.698 --> 49:32.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As we reported earlier,
President Obama today
announced plans to expand drug
treatment centers

49:32.670 --> 49:38.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and increase the use of drugs
that reverse
the effect of opioids like
heroin, OxyContin

49:38.542 --> 49:40.377 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Percocet.

49:40.411 --> 49:44.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Communities across the country
are developing
new approaches to this epidemic
in an attempt

49:44.481 --> 49:49.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to support addicts, helping them
into treatment,
instead of arrests.

49:49.086 --> 49:55.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New York's Cardozo Law School
Professor Ekow
Yankah compares today's approach
to heroin

49:55.159 --> 50:00.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
users to the tough-on-crime
response a few
decades ago to those using crack
cocaine.

50:00.164 --> 50:04.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EKOW YANKAH, Professor, Cardozo
School of
Law: That Kroger, the Midwestern
grocery chain,

50:04.301 --> 50:08.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has decided to make the heroin
overdose drug
naloxone available without a
prescription

50:08.939 --> 50:11.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a sign of how ominous the
current epidemic
has grown.

50:11.942 --> 50:17.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Faced with a rising wave of
addiction, misery,
crime and death, our nation has
linked arms

50:17.515 --> 50:23.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to save souls. Senators and
CEOs, Midwestern
pharmacies and even
tough-on-crime Republican

50:23.754 --> 50:29.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presidential candidates now
speak with moving
compassion about the real people
crippled

50:29.059 --> 50:30.928 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by addiction.

50:30.961 --> 50:35.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It wasn't always this way.
Thirty years ago,
America was facing a similar
wave of addiction,

50:35.366 --> 50:39.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
death and crime, and the
response could not
have been more different.
Television brought

50:39.770 --> 50:45.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us endless images of thin,
black, ravaged
bodies, always with desperate,
dried lips.

50:45.910 --> 50:48.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We learned the words crack baby.

50:48.545 --> 50:53.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back then, when addiction was a
black problem,
there was no wave of national
compassion.

50:53.150 --> 50:59.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, we were warned of super
predators,
young, faceless black men
wearing bandannas

50:59.723 --> 51:01.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and sagging jeans.

51:01.458 --> 51:06.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No matter how far from our lives
crack was,
we're guilty by association. By
the time I

51:06.430 --> 51:11.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was in college in the early
1990s, my short
dreadlocks meant older women
would cross the

51:11.268 --> 51:13.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
street to avoid me.

51:13.103 --> 51:18.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
African-Americans were cast as
pathological.
Their plight was evidence of
collective moral

51:18.175 --> 51:24.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
failure, of welfare mothers and
rock-slinging
thugs and a reason to cut off
all help. Blacks

51:24.315 --> 51:28.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
would just have to pull
themselves out of
the crack epidemic. Until then,
the only answer

51:28.886 --> 51:32.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
lay in cordoning off the
wreckage with militarized
policing.

51:32.656 --> 51:37.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, police chiefs facing
heroin addiction
are responding not by invoking
war, but by

51:37.661 --> 51:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to save lives and get
people into rehab.
Suddenly, crime is understood as
a sign of

51:42.833 --> 51:46.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
underlying addiction, rather
than a scourge
to be eradicated.

51:46.971 --> 51:51.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One former narcotics officers
said: "These
are people. They have a purpose
in life, and

51:51.075 --> 51:53.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we can't look at it any other
way."

51:53.043 --> 51:58.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he couldn't quite put his
finger on just
what had changed. His words
reflect our collective

51:58.382 --> 52:04.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
self-denial. It is hard to
describe how bittersweet
many African-Americans feel
witnessing this.

52:04.455 --> 52:10.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Glad to be rid of a failed war
on drugs? Yes,
but also weary and embittered.
When the faces

52:10.494 --> 52:15.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of addiction had dark skin, the
police didn't
see sons and daughters, sister
and brothers.

52:15.065 --> 52:21.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They saw brothas, young thugs to
be locked
up, not people with a purpose in
life.

52:21.205 --> 52:26.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No one laments the violence the
crack bomb
set off more than
African-Americans. But how

52:26.477 --> 52:32.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we respond to the crimes
accompanying addiction
depends on how much we care
about those affected.

52:32.783 --> 52:37.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
White heroin addicts get
overdose treatment,
rehabilitation and
reincorporation. Black

52:37.955 --> 52:42.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
drug users got jail cells and
just say no.

52:42.226 --> 52:47.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would be perverse to want to
go back, and
this is not just about racial
guilt. The hope

52:47.231 --> 52:52.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that we really can learn from
our meanest
moments. This stark moment gives
us the opportunity

52:52.202 --> 52:55.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to quit our dedication to
ignoring racism.

52:55.439 --> 53:00.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Next time we or even you are
faced with an
indictment of institutionalized
racism, maybe

53:00.344 --> 53:04.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we can swallow the knee-jerk
dismissal or
the condescending
finger-wagging, and imagine

53:05.015 --> 53:09.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
if you would accept such
treatment of your
own. We don't have to wait until
a problem

53:09.153 --> 53:11.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has a white face to answer with
humanity.

53:12.022 --> 53:17.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tune in tonight on
"Frontline":
a rare look at what life is
really like inside

53:17.795 --> 53:19.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Saudi kingdom.

53:19.563 --> 53:25.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Saudi Arabia Uncovered" shows
the ruling
regime uses harsh tactics to
quell protests

53:25.135 --> 53:30.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and goes to great lengths to
prevent any imagery
of dissent from making its way
to the outside

53:30.707 --> 53:34.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
world. "Frontline" airs tonight
on most PBS
stations.

53:34.778 --> 53:36.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
