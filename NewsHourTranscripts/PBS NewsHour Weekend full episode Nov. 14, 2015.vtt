HUGE SENSE OF SHOCK HERE.

08:57.670 --> 08:59.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

08:59.205 --> 09:00.740 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE MILITARY FORCES ON THE

09:00.740 --> 09:01.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STREET.

09:01.608 --> 09:02.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE YOU SEEING INCREASED POLICE

PRESENCE IN MOST OF THE

09:03.943 --> 09:05.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

09:05.912 --> 09:06.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

09:06.413 --> 09:08.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: I HAVE TO SAY,

09:08.014 --> 09:09.149 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'M QUITE SURPRISED THAT I

HAVEN'T ACTUALLY SEEN THIS MANY

09:10.850 --> 09:12.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLICEMEN AS I HAVE EXPECTED TO,

09:12.519 --> 09:14.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN ABOUT

09:14.154 --> 09:15.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
1500 SOLDIERS WHO HAVE BEEN

09:15.655 --> 09:17.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEPLOYED TO PARIS.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WHAT IS QUITE SIGNIFICANT IS

09:19.325 --> 09:21.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT AREA WHERE'S YOU'D EXPECT

09:21.628 --> 09:22.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE TO COME TOGETHER HAVE

09:22.996 --> 09:25.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN CLOSED DOWN, MONUMENTS SUCH

09:25.064 --> 09:28.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS THE LOUVRE, THE EIFFEL TOWER.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE PLACES HAVE BEEN CLOSED

09:29.169 --> 09:29.669 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOWN.

09:29.669 --> 09:30.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE POLICE HAVE BEEN URGING

09:30.637 --> 09:32.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE NOT TO GATHER IN GROUPS

09:32.372 --> 09:33.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR

09:33.673 --> 09:35.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAUSING A TARGET FOR OTHER

09:35.442 --> 09:36.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POTENTIAL TERRORISTS WHO MIGHT

09:36.276 --> 09:37.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE HERE.

09:37.043 --> 09:39.712 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT PEOPLE ARE DEIFYING THAT

09:39.712 --> 09:44.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORDER IN VARIOUS PLACES, SUCH AS

09:44.384 --> 09:46.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PLACE DE REPUBLIQUE, A PLACE

09:46.719 --> 09:48.254 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH IS SYMBOLIC OF FRANCE AND

09:48.254 --> 09:49.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'VE BEEN GATHERING AROUND

09:49.456 --> 09:51.925 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

09:54.861 --> 09:55.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRANCE AND BASICALLY PEOPLE ON

09:55.995 --> 09:57.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE STREETS ARE SAYING THEY NEED

09:57.263 --> 09:58.198 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE UNIFIED.

09:58.198 --> 10:00.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY CAN'T START TO HATE BECAUSE

10:00.667 --> 10:02.202 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S WHAT THE TERRORISTS ARE

10:02.202 --> 10:04.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRYING TO CREATE WITH THE

10:04.471 --> 10:07.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTIONS THEY CARRIED OUT

10:07.640 --> 10:08.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

MENTIONED THEY ARE STILL

"CHARLIE HEBDO" ATTACK.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT IS IT THAT THEY THINK NEEDS

10:14.514 --> 10:16.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE DONE TO TRY TO KEEP

10:16.182 --> 10:18.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEMSELVES SECURE?

10:18.718 --> 10:20.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: I THINK THAT

10:20.119 --> 10:21.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE ARE COMPLETELY CONFUSED

10:21.721 --> 10:24.224 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THAT-- THAT QUESTION.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE KNOW HOW

10:25.959 --> 10:28.061 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU DO GENERATE SECURITY.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WAS TALKING TO ONE MAN AT THE

10:30.797 --> 10:32.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACE DE REPUBLIQUE, AND HE SAID

10:32.332 --> 10:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU HAVE TO LOVE PEOPLE.

10:33.733 --> 10:35.301 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT PEOPLE

10:35.301 --> 10:36.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE THINK THAT THIS, PERHAPS,

10:36.803 --> 10:40.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THE START OF SOME KIND OF

10:40.306 --> 10:42.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HORRENDOUS WAR THAT IS NOT ONE

10:42.342 --> 10:46.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS DEFINED BY SORTS OF

10:46.746 --> 10:48.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERNATIONAL WARS WE'VE HAD

10:48.114 --> 10:49.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEFORE, BUT ONES THAT ARE GOING

10:49.315 --> 10:50.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE CARRIED OUT IN TERMS OF

10:50.817 --> 10:53.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SENSE THAT PERHAPS THIS IS START

10:56.456 --> 10:58.658 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF SOMETHING ELSE, THE ISLAMIC

10:58.658 --> 11:01.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

11:03.396 --> 11:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

BUT WE SHOULDN'T EXAGGERATE THAT

13:21.067 --> 13:22.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS SOME KIND OF GAME

13:22.969 --> 13:23.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGER.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISIS HAS HAD TIES TO EXTERNAL

13:25.905 --> 13:29.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOVEMENTS AND EXTREME GROUPS IN

13:29.208 --> 13:30.343 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EUROPE OR THE UNITED STATES FAIR

13:30.343 --> 13:31.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONG TIME.

13:31.110 --> 13:33.446 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THIS IS A MOMENT IN WHICH IT

13:33.446 --> 13:35.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS REASON TO TRY TO ACTIVATE

13:35.615 --> 13:37.617 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE FORCES.

13:37.617 --> 13:38.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: IS THIS A SIGN

13:38.885 --> 13:40.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IT'S FEEL THE PRESSURE,

13:40.486 --> 13:43.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT PERHAPS THE ATTACKS FROM

13:43.523 --> 13:45.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE U.S., THE COALITION FORCE,

13:45.391 --> 13:47.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAYBE EVEN PARTS OF THE RUSSIAN

13:47.760 --> 13:51.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AIR CAMPAIGN ARE AFFECTING IT?

13:51.397 --> 13:52.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THEY MAY WELL BE UNDER

13:52.832 --> 13:53.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESSURE.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PART OF IT IS PROBABLY THE AIR

13:54.767 --> 13:57.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAMPAIGN WHICH WE LEAD, AGAIN

13:57.937 --> 13:58.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH FRENCH, AUSTRALIAN,

13:58.971 --> 14:01.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRITISH AND OTHER PARTICIPATION.

14:01.140 --> 14:03.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PART OF IT IS THAT ON THE

14:03.142 --> 14:05.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROUND, THE KURDS HAVE MADE

14:05.812 --> 14:12.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN PLACES LIKE

14:12.585 --> 14:13.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SINJAR.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.954 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PART OF IT IS, I THINK, QUITE

14:14.954 --> 14:17.924 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRANKLY, THEY NEED DEMONSTRATIVE

14:17.924 --> 14:19.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTION IN TERMS OF IT

14:19.358 --> 14:21.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FUND-RAISING, THE KIND OF

14:21.127 --> 14:21.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEDIA-GRABBING POLITICAL ACTION

14:21.861 --> 14:25.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU GET THROUGH THIS KIND OF

14:25.398 --> 14:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALMOST RANDOM, VERY, VERY

14:27.100 --> 14:29.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VISIBLE BLOODY ATTACK IN A CITY

14:29.035 --> 14:29.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE PARIS.

14:29.635 --> 14:33.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO ALL OF THESE FACTORS COME

14:33.139 --> 14:34.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOGETHER, AND THERE ARE REASONS

14:34.640 --> 14:36.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY IT SHOULD ACT NOW.

14:36.776 --> 14:37.643 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: DOES THIS HELP

14:37.643 --> 14:41.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THEIR RECURRING EFFORT TO NOT

14:41.214 --> 14:43.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST SAY AS YOU MENTIONED

14:43.583 --> 14:44.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIGH-VISIBILITY ATTACK BUT TO

14:44.450 --> 14:46.219 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHOEVER IS ON

14:46.219 --> 14:47.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BUBBLE IN THESE COUNTRIES

14:47.820 --> 14:48.788 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND RADICALIZE THEM.

14:48.788 --> 14:51.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YOU RAISE A VERY GOOD POINT

14:51.390 --> 14:54.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE, YES, IT SOUNDS IN SOME

14:54.026 --> 14:56.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAYS ALMOST LIKE IT SHOULD BE

14:56.596 --> 14:57.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OPPOSITE.

14:57.263 --> 14:59.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT IS TRUE THAT PEOPLE WHO

14:59.232 --> 15:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE ALIENATED, PEOPLE WHO

15:01.000 --> 15:04.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALREADY ARE ON THE EDGE ARE

15:04.670 --> 15:06.005 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEING WILLING TO JOIN A MOVEMENT

15:06.005 --> 15:07.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE ISIS.

15:07.774 --> 15:11.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE ALREADY GOING TO BE

15:11.344 --> 15:12.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOTIVATED IN SEEING THIS KIND OF

15:12.845 --> 15:15.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY HIGH-PROFILE EVENT, NOT

15:15.681 --> 15:17.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONLY LEADS TO MORE VOLUNTEERS.

15:17.116 --> 15:18.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT LEADS PEOPLE TO CONTRIBUTE

15:18.618 --> 15:19.118 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MONEY.

15:19.118 --> 15:22.455 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE TALKING A VERY, VERY SMALL

MARGIN OF PEOPLE.

15:25.024 --> 15:26.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETIMES WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

15:26.325 --> 15:28.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE NUMBERS OF VOLUNTEERS,

15:28.294 --> 15:31.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THEM BEING SO

15:31.197 --> 15:31.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIGH.

15:31.697 --> 15:33.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN COMPARATIVE TERMS, THEY'RE

15:33.299 --> 15:36.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALMOST INCREDIBLY SMALL COMPARED

15:36.135 --> 15:38.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO OTHER IDEOLOGICAL MOVEMENTS

15:38.571 --> 15:40.840 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEIR ABILITY TO ATTRACT

YOUNG EXTREMISTS.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.277 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THEY'RE STILL HIGH ENOUGH TO

15:44.277 --> 15:46.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CREATE THE KIND OF NIGHTMARE

15:46.646 --> 15:48.714 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'VE SEEN IN PARIS

15:48.714 --> 15:49.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SUDDENLY DEFEAT ISIS IN SYRIA

16:02.862 --> 16:04.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

YOU STEP UP YOUR MILITARY ACTION

REALLY COUNTS IS THE

18:06.652 --> 18:09.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT DID LEND A SENSE OF

18:09.121 --> 18:10.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
URGENCY, AND THEY MADE SOME

18:10.523 --> 18:11.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEADWAY, BUT I WOULD SAY THEY

18:11.557 --> 18:13.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE LOOKING FOR A LOT MORE

18:13.693 --> 18:14.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOMENTUM THAN THEY MAYBE WERE

18:14.961 --> 18:17.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABLE TO GET BECAUSE THERE ARE

18:17.563 --> 18:19.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STILL SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

18:19.098 --> 18:21.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REMAINING ISSUES

18:21.167 --> 18:22.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ARE THEY

18:22.234 --> 18:24.270 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOPING TO ACCOMPLISH AND WHAT'S

18:24.270 --> 18:26.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STANDING IN BETWEEN TODAY AND

18:26.072 --> 18:26.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT POINT?

18:26.739 --> 18:29.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THEY DID COME UP WITH A

18:29.475 --> 18:30.843 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIMETABLE FOR ACTION ON A

18:30.843 --> 18:32.078 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICAL TRANSITION IN SYRIA,

18:32.078 --> 18:32.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH IS IMPORTANT.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S A PRETTY OPTIMISTIC

18:34.480 --> 18:34.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIMETABLE.

18:34.981 --> 18:36.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WANT TO GET OPPOSITION

18:36.782 --> 18:39.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROUPS TOGETHER BY JANUARY 1,

18:39.819 --> 18:41.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND GET THEM TALKING WITH THE

18:41.120 --> 18:45.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNMENT OF SYRIA AND THE

18:45.691 --> 18:47.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASHAR AL-ASSAD IN THE NEXT SIX

18:47.226 --> 18:48.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MONTHS AFTER THAT, TO TRY TO

18:48.627 --> 18:50.029 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COME UP WITH A UNITY GOVERNMENT

18:50.029 --> 18:51.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND CONSTITUTION AND THEN

18:51.364 --> 18:52.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTIONS IN 18 MONTHS.

18:52.398 --> 18:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S A PRETTY AMBITIOUS

18:54.700 --> 18:55.901 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIMETABLE, AND SECRETARY KERRY

18:55.901 --> 18:57.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT, AND EVERYONE

18:57.003 --> 18:58.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THE TABLE I THINK

18:58.371 --> 19:00.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT'S A LONG

19:00.706 --> 19:03.009 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOT BUT THAT'S A CONCRETE

19:03.009 --> 19:04.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIMETABLE AND THAT REPRESENTS

19:04.043 --> 19:05.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROGRESS HERE.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY ALSO, YOU KNOW, AGREED

19:07.480 --> 19:09.281 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY IN PARALLEL SEEK A

19:09.281 --> 19:09.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CEASE-FIRE.

19:09.782 --> 19:11.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT AGAIN, FOR THAT TO HAPPEN

19:11.150 --> 19:12.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE

19:12.485 --> 19:14.620 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT WHAT THE FATE OF BASHAR

19:14.620 --> 19:15.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AL-ASSAD IS GOING TO BE, WHAT

19:15.721 --> 19:16.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROLE HE'S GOING TO PLAY.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.124 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY HAVE TO IDENTIFY WHO

19:18.124 --> 19:19.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE GOING TO TREAT AS A

19:19.859 --> 19:21.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERRORIST GROUP AND WHO THEY'RE

19:21.060 --> 19:23.095 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO TREAT AS A LEGITIMATE

19:23.095 --> 19:24.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPOSITION GROUP THAT GETS TO

19:24.463 --> 19:26.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE IN THE

19:26.065 --> 19:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRANSITION TALKS.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THOSE ARE VERY BIG TASKS

19:28.634 --> 19:29.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY ACCEPT FOR

19:29.802 --> 19:30.669 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEMSELVES IN THE NEXT SIX

19:30.669 --> 19:31.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MONTHS.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: AND THERE

19:32.104 --> 19:33.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISN'T ANYBODY FROM ASSAD'S

19:33.305 --> 19:34.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNMENT AT THIS TABLE IN

19:34.573 --> 19:35.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE CONVERSATIONS.

19:35.508 --> 19:38.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS RUSSIA SUPPOSED TO BE THE

19:38.077 --> 19:39.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROXY THAT TAKES THE MESSAGE

19:39.512 --> 19:40.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BACK?

19:40.012 --> 19:41.213 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S RIGHT, THEY'RE NOT AT

19:41.213 --> 19:42.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TABLE AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN

19:42.448 --> 19:43.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THE TABLE.

19:43.382 --> 19:45.184 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE GROUP IS GOING TO MEET AGAIN

19:45.184 --> 19:46.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEXT MONTH, AND IT'S NOT CLEAR

19:46.385 --> 19:47.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF THEY WILL BE AT THE TABLE AT

19:47.787 --> 19:48.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT POINT.

19:48.320 --> 19:51.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE-- THE U.N. ENVOY,

19:51.123 --> 19:52.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPECIAL ENVOY TO SYRIA WAS HERE,

19:52.792 --> 19:56.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HE IS GOING TO BE

19:56.362 --> 19:57.163 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPEARHEADING THE PROCESS OF

19:57.163 --> 19:59.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRYING TO GET THE OPPOSITION

19:59.365 --> 20:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROUPS AND ASSAD TO THE TABLE TO

20:00.800 --> 20:02.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRY TO START TALKING BUT UNTIL

20:02.134 --> 20:03.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE IN A POSITION TO DO

20:03.335 --> 20:04.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE A

20:04.603 --> 20:06.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTY TO THE TALKS AND THAT'S A

20:06.505 --> 20:08.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIG IMPEDIMENT.

20:08.541 --> 20:09.909 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECRETARY KERRY SAID WE'RE NOT

20:09.909 --> 20:11.343 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRYING TO IMPOSE A SOLUTION ON

20:11.343 --> 20:12.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYONE BUT AS LONG AS THEY'RE

20:12.244 --> 20:13.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT AT THE TABLE AND WE HAVE

20:13.612 --> 20:15.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERESTS IN SYRIA THAT WE'RE

20:15.114 --> 20:16.982 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRYING TO EXECUTE ON-- NAMELY,

20:16.982 --> 20:19.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT ASSAD MUST GO-- AND THE

20:19.018 --> 20:19.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIANS HAVE INTERESTS THAT

20:19.819 --> 20:21.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE TRYING TO EXECUTE ON AND

20:21.520 --> 20:23.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY SAY THAT ASSAD IS NOT THE

20:23.789 --> 20:25.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBLEM HERE AND HE CAN BE PART

20:25.091 --> 20:26.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF A SOLUTION, IT'S HARD TO SEE

20:26.358 --> 20:28.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEM MAKING A MUCH MORE

20:28.894 --> 20:29.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIGNIFICANT HEADWAY.

20:29.428 --> 20:30.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: IS THERE ANY

20:30.262 --> 20:31.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PART OF THIS CONVERSATION THAT

20:31.831 --> 20:33.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCLUDES PERHAPS INCREASED

20:33.299 --> 20:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COORDINATION OF MILITARY

20:34.400 --> 20:36.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTIVITIES BETWEEN THE RUSSIAN

20:36.969 --> 20:38.404 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AIRSTRIKES HAPPENING AND THE

20:38.404 --> 20:39.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. AIRSTRIKES HAPPENING IN

20:39.605 --> 20:40.106 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYRIA?

20:40.106 --> 20:42.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THEY DID TALK ABOUT THAT.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT CAME UP, AND BASICALLY THEY

20:44.610 --> 20:47.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE BEEN INVOLVED, AS YOU

20:47.480 --> 20:48.614 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW-- THEY'RE BASICALLY NOT

20:48.614 --> 20:50.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOMBING AT EACH OTHER OR FLYING

20:50.116 --> 20:51.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT EACH OTHER.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THERE STILL IS A LEVEL OF

20:52.518 --> 20:54.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COORDINATION I THINK THAT RUSSIA

20:54.019 --> 20:54.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS SEEKING THAT THEY'RE NOT

20:54.987 --> 20:55.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GETTING FOR THE UNITED STATES

20:55.888 --> 20:57.323 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT'S

20:57.323 --> 20:59.024 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALSO A KEY STICK POINT HERE, AND

20:59.024 --> 21:00.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A REASON THAT THEY'RE NOT MAKING

21:00.893 --> 21:02.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS MUCH PROGRESS AS THEY WANT TO

21:02.328 --> 21:04.530 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THE OTHER PIECE, ON THE

21:04.530 --> 21:05.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIPLOMATIC PIECE BECAUSE THERE

21:05.231 --> 21:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS A FEELING THERE COULD BE MORE

21:07.333 --> 21:10.503 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COORDINATION AND RUSSIA AND HAS

21:10.503 --> 21:12.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFFICER, THE FOREIGN MINISTER,

21:12.004 --> 21:13.839 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID AT THE END OF THE TALKS

21:13.839 --> 21:15.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WOULD BE IN EVERYONE'S

21:15.141 --> 21:16.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTEREST IF THERE WAS MORE

21:16.142 --> 21:16.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COORDINATION BETWEEN THEM AND

21:16.942 --> 21:17.643 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE UNITED STATES AND THE REST

21:17.643 --> 21:18.544 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE COALITION

21:18.544 --> 21:19.645 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: BESIDES THE

21:19.645 --> 21:20.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITARY POSTURE OF ALL THE

21:20.846 --> 21:21.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SYRIA THAT ARE STILL THERE.

21:29.221 --> 21:30.656 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S AN ELEMENT THEY TALKED

21:30.656 --> 21:34.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LOT ABOUT, AND A PIECE OF

21:34.260 --> 21:36.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A

21:36.629 --> 21:37.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAY TOWARDS THIS POLITICAL

21:37.363 --> 21:37.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROCESS.

21:37.863 --> 21:38.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK THEY ACKNOWLEDGE IN

21:38.597 --> 21:40.032 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORDER TO GET THE OPPOSITION

21:40.032 --> 21:41.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROUPS TO THE TABLE AND FORD

21:41.367 --> 21:42.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE A LEGITIMATE PROCESS THAT

21:42.735 --> 21:43.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERYONE FEELS IS IN THE

21:43.569 --> 21:44.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTEREST OF THE SYRIAN PEOPLE,

21:44.970 --> 21:46.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO MORE

21:46.305 --> 21:47.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THAT.

21:47.406 --> 21:49.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY DID ACTUALLY AGREE IN

21:49.275 --> 21:51.343 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERMS OF THE POLITICAL PROCESS

21:51.343 --> 21:55.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
