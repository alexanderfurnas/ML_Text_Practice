JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.206 --> 00:12.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Floating wreckage
proves EgyptAir Flight 804
crashed in the

00:12.379 --> 00:19.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mediterranean, but there remain
more questions
than answers as to what brought
down the plane.

00:19.119 --> 00:25.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead: Food labels are
about to get a
makeover. The first lady and the
FDA overhaul

00:25.125 --> 00:30.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rules to include added sugar and
other changes
to promote healthier eating.

00:30.530 --> 00:37.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Then: The candidates talk
foreign policy,
as worries rise about party
unity. Mark Shields

00:37.237 --> 00:41.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and David Brooks take on that
and more of
the week's news.

00:41.575 --> 00:47.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And ahead of President Obama's
trip to Vietnam,
a look at how the U.S.
ambassador to the country

00:47.314 --> 00:51.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is doing away with traditional
modes of diplomacy
and jumping into the culture.

00:51.952 --> 00:58.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TED OSIUS, U.S. Ambassador to
Vietnam: The
fact that I show respect for
Vietnamese language

00:58.558 --> 01:02.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and culture and history, the
Vietnamese people,
the fact that I show that
respect, that I

01:03.030 --> 01:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clearly enjoy being here, I
think that has
helped my mission.

01:07.100 --> 01:15.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:15.108 --> 01:17.878 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:17.978 --> 01:28.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: They have found
some of what's
left of EgyptAir Flight 804, and
new clues

01:28.989 --> 01:33.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
may be emerging in the
investigation. The
passenger plane vanished from
the radar early

01:34.027 --> 01:39.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yesterday, en route from Paris
to Cairo, with
66 people on board.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Yang reports on the day's
developments.

01:41.435 --> 01:49.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: At a Cairo mosque,
families of
passengers aboard EgyptAir
Flight 804 prayed,

01:49.509 --> 01:51.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and wept, for loved ones.

01:51.378 --> 01:55.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABDEL RAHMAN AL NASERY, Cousin
of Passenger
(through translator): He was my
cousin. He

01:55.148 --> 01:59.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was like an elder brother to me.
This is very
hard for the family, and God
bless all who

01:59.720 --> 02:01.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
died on the plane.

02:01.655 --> 02:07.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Their hopes dashed by
the discovery
of wreckage from the Airbus
A-320 announced

02:07.127 --> 02:08.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on Egyptian state television.

02:09.096 --> 02:15.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): We
have just received
an official report from the
Egyptian army.

02:15.402 --> 02:19.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Military airplanes have been
able to locate
wreckage and belongings of the
airplane.

02:19.373 --> 02:23.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The Greek defense
minister recounted
the grisly details.

02:23.210 --> 02:27.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PANOS KAMMENOS, Greek Defense
Minister (through
translator): We have been
briefed about the

02:27.848 --> 02:32.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
discovery of a body part, two
seats and luggage
at the scene of the search,
slightly to the

02:33.053 --> 02:35.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
south of where the plane's
signal was lost.

02:35.188 --> 02:39.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: A European satellite
image showed
an oil slick spreading over the
area where

02:39.960 --> 02:45.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the plane disappeared. Debris
was spotted
floating in the Mediterranean
about 180 miles

02:45.699 --> 02:52.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
north of Alexandria, Egypt. It's
an area were
the sea is up to two miles'
deep, but still

02:52.572 --> 02:55.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
no firm evidence of what
happened.

02:55.876 --> 03:02.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Late today, what could be a
significant clue:
The Aviation Herald, an online
aviation community,

03:02.849 --> 03:07.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reported that an automated
monitoring system
on the plane sent signals
indicating smoke

03:07.988 --> 03:14.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the front of the cabin and
then failures
of two key control systems
before going silent.

03:14.995 --> 03:21.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Egyptian officials had initially
suggested
a terror attack as the likeliest
explanation,

03:21.668 --> 03:26.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but the Greek defense minister
said today
it's just too early to tell.

03:26.339 --> 03:31.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PANOS KAMMENOS (through
translator): There
is no possibility to assess the
situation.

03:31.411 --> 03:35.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We cannot be part of the
speculation, because
the investigation committee must
be allowed

03:35.415 --> 03:37.250 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do its work.

03:37.350 --> 03:41.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The French navy is
helping scour
the sea, and its investigators
said no possible

03:41.988 --> 03:44.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
causes are being ruled out.

03:44.291 --> 03:48.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEAN-MARC AYRAULT, French
Minister of Foreign
Affairs (through translator):
All hypotheses

03:48.695 --> 03:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are being examined. There is no
specific one
being favored. We have to find
the debris

03:53.300 --> 03:58.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and analyze it, and of course
the black boxes,
because we want to know the
truth, the whole

03:58.338 --> 04:00.173 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
truth.

04:00.273 --> 04:04.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: So far, there's no
hard evidence
of an explosion. But from Cairo
to Paris and

04:04.911 --> 04:07.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
beyond, speculation centers on
terrorism.

04:07.647 --> 04:14.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN SIMON, Dartmouth College:
They can't
pretend that it wasn't or
completely suspend

04:14.187 --> 04:15.889 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
judgment. They have to check the
locks.

04:15.989 --> 04:20.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Steven Simon served
on President
Obama's National Security
Council. He says

04:20.427 --> 04:23.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
officials have to investigate it
as a possible
terror attacks.

04:23.530 --> 04:28.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN SIMON: They will look to
see if any
of the identities of any of the
people on

04:28.368 --> 04:36.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the airplane, the crew, the
maintenance team,
anybody who had anything to do
with that airplane

04:36.176 --> 04:43.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
while it was on the ground in
Paris, they
will just go through, you know,
those records

04:43.116 --> 04:49.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a fine-tooth comb, looking
for dots to
connect, if indeed there are
any.

04:49.256 --> 04:54.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: At the same time, he
says, Europe
has to work on beefing up
counterterrorism

04:54.361 --> 04:56.229 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
efforts.

04:56.329 --> 05:00.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN SIMON: It's sort of a
cumulative process.
You can't throw a lot of money
at something

05:00.767 --> 05:08.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and expect radical changes in
six months.
This is going to be a
transformative process

05:08.909 --> 05:12.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the European context which
will take a
while to complete.

05:12.112 --> 05:19.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: As the search for
what, or perhaps
who, brought down Flight 804
presses ahead.

05:19.186 --> 05:21.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

05:21.955 --> 05:27.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So far, there's
been no claim
by any outside group that it had
a hand in

05:27.360 --> 05:29.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bringing down the plane.

05:29.296 --> 05:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here to talk through some of the
many questions
still out there is our science
correspondent

05:33.500 --> 05:36.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and aviation analyst, Miles
O'Brien.

05:36.403 --> 05:43.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Miles, first, this automated
data that became
known this afternoon, what do
you make of

05:43.243 --> 05:44.644 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that?

05:44.744 --> 05:46.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, just a
quick bit of background
for our viewers.

05:46.947 --> 05:53.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is -- as an aircraft flies
around, it's
essentially live-streaming its
condition,

05:53.286 --> 05:57.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its health of various systems.
It's mostly
for maintenance, so when the
plane lands,

05:57.190 --> 06:01.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they know what parts to have
ready and what
to fix it to get it back in the
air again.

06:01.228 --> 06:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were a series of faults
apparently right
before the plane disappeared
from radar, beginning

06:06.766 --> 06:12.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with some problems with the
windshield in
the cockpit, smoke in the
lavatory and in

06:12.172 --> 06:17.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the avionics bay, which is
beneath the cockpit,
and then some failures of the
computer systems.

06:17.544 --> 06:21.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are literally hundreds of
computer systems
controlling this aircraft. They
all have to

06:21.448 --> 06:27.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
operate in concert. This is
certainly consistent
with a catastrophic event.
Whether it is a

06:27.120 --> 06:33.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bomb or some major mechanical
failure remains
to be seen. It also is
consistent with that

06:33.260 --> 06:36.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
initial left turn reported on
Greek radar.

06:36.830 --> 06:41.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The plane took a 90-degree left
turn initially
when it apparently was in
trouble, and that

06:41.935 --> 06:47.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is standard operating procedure
for a flight
crew dealing with a
decompression event and

06:47.407 --> 06:49.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
trying to do a rapid descent.

06:49.242 --> 06:54.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The idea is not to fly into the
airway beneath
you and potentially hit oncoming
traffic.

06:54.714 --> 06:59.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, this is -- in
other words,
you're saying this is consistent
with the

06:59.853 --> 07:03.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
little bit, the little that's
known about
what the plane did before it
plunged into

07:03.456 --> 07:05.125 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the water?

07:05.225 --> 07:07.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It is consistent
with a crew
dealing with a rapid
decompression.

07:07.761 --> 07:12.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The cause of that rapid
decompression, we
don't know. Was it a bomb or was
it a major

07:12.532 --> 07:14.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mechanical failure are the open
questions.

07:15.035 --> 07:18.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Miles, what about
the material
they found floating in the
water? They said

07:18.872 --> 07:25.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two seats, a body part and some
other luggage
and so forth. Do we know
anything based on

07:25.612 --> 07:27.247 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that?

07:27.347 --> 07:29.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It's a reminder,
of course,
of the human tragedy of all
this.

07:29.416 --> 07:34.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's customary in these
cases that you
see seat cushions and life vests
and baggage

07:34.754 --> 07:41.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because it -- obviously, it
floats. Typically,
it's not very helpful unless, by
some chance,

07:41.227 --> 07:44.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the baggage happened to be close
to where
the initial failure occurred.

07:44.698 --> 07:49.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's useful, however, is
knowing where it
is, knowing the ocean currents,
knowing how

07:49.402 --> 07:54.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
long it's been in the water. You
can backtrack
to the point of impact. And
that's where you

07:54.474 --> 07:57.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
begin your search for the main
body of wreckage
and the black boxes.

07:57.777 --> 08:01.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, we heard in
John Yang's
report that that part of the
Mediterranean

08:01.815 --> 08:07.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is something like two miles'
deep. What does
that tell us about the
difficulty of this

08:07.387 --> 08:09.089 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ongoing search?

08:09.189 --> 08:12.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: That it is
difficult. It's
a big challenge, fishing these
boxes out.

08:13.059 --> 08:17.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We go through this time and
again. There is
technology off the shelf used by
the military

08:17.464 --> 08:22.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right now which has ejectable,
floatable,
deployable flight data
recorders. There is

08:22.702 --> 08:27.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
technology which makes it
possible to stream
this data back in real time, not
unlike the

08:27.440 --> 08:29.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stream that we have just been
talking about.

08:30.043 --> 08:34.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the 21st century, the fact
that we have
to listen for pings two miles
beneath the

08:34.180 --> 08:39.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
surface of the ocean to find out
a critical
question -- the answer to a
critical question

08:39.185 --> 08:41.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a bit scandalous. We should
do something
about it.

08:41.755 --> 08:46.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Miles, a lot
of people
are saying now that we need to
assume there

08:46.926 --> 08:52.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was terrorism involved. Does it
make sense
to do that, in the absence of a
hard answer

08:52.632 --> 08:53.967 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right now?

08:54.067 --> 08:56.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, I think we
-- I would
caution our viewers.

08:56.369 --> 09:01.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If, in fact, there was some sort
of mechanical
failure here, that's a very
important thing

09:01.641 --> 09:08.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to know as soon as possible.
This is a fleet
of aircraft in excess of 6,000
the world over.

09:08.314 --> 09:12.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's an extreme -- it's a
workhorse, and if
there is some fundamental flaw
here which

09:12.152 --> 09:14.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
caused this, we need to know
about it yesterday.

09:14.821 --> 09:19.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you're saying
-- but are
we any closer? You're saying
it's just coming

09:19.492 --> 09:21.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very slowly as we get any closer
to answers.

09:21.795 --> 09:26.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: You know, absent
a claim of
credit -- and we haven't seen
that just yet

09:26.166 --> 09:32.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- we're in the dark on this,
and it's -- you
know, eventually, maybe a piece
of fleeting

09:32.472 --> 09:36.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wreckage will offer a clue as to
whether there
was a bomb on board, but I'm
afraid we are

09:36.876 --> 09:40.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to have to wait for those
black boxes,
the flight data recorder and
cockpit voice

09:40.680 --> 09:42.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
recorder, to be discovered at
the bottom of
the sea.

09:42.849 --> 09:45.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, in the
meantime, hold
off on any assumptions?

09:46.019 --> 09:47.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: I think so.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Miles O'Brien, we
thank you.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: You're welcome,
Judy.

09:51.558 --> 09:55.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: Health
officials reported the number of
pregnant

09:55.795 --> 10:01.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
women in the U.S. infected with
the Zika virus
has tripled, to 157.

10:01.534 --> 10:06.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention
said that it's now including all
women who

10:06.239 --> 10:12.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
test positive, regardless of
symptoms. So
far, fewer than a dozen have had
miscarriages

10:12.212 --> 10:14.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or babies born with birth
defects.

10:14.781 --> 10:19.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, President Obama got a
briefing
on Zika today, and he urged
Congress to get

10:19.919 --> 10:21.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
moving to provide funds.

10:21.855 --> 10:23.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Understand that this is not
something where

10:24.023 --> 10:30.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we can build a wall to prevent.
Mosquitoes
don't go through customs. To the
extent that

10:30.430 --> 10:34.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're not handling this thing on
the front
end, we're going to have bigger
problems on

10:34.801 --> 10:36.569 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the back end.

10:36.669 --> 10:43.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for those of you who are
listening, tell
your members of Congress, get on
the job on

10:43.109 --> 10:44.744 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

10:44.844 --> 10:49.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. Senate
has passed
a $1.1 billion bill to fight the
virus. A

10:49.249 --> 10:53.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House-passed bill totals just
over half that,
$622 million.

10:53.786 --> 10:59.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A shooting near the White House
put the executive
mansion on lockdown for a time
today. Federal

10:59.792 --> 11:05.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
law enforcement officials say a
uniformed
Secret Service officer shot a
man who drew

11:05.298 --> 11:10.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a gun. He was taken to a
hospital in critical
condition. President Obama
wasn't at the White

11:10.904 --> 11:12.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
House at the time.

11:12.772 --> 11:18.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Iraq, Baghdad is under a
curfew tonight
after protesters stormed the
Green Zone and

11:18.344 --> 11:24.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
security forces fired tear gas
and gunshots.
Dozens were wounded, with at
least one person

11:24.117 --> 11:29.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shot in the head. It was the
second time in
three weeks that protesters had
broken into

11:29.289 --> 11:36.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the heavily fortified zone.
Meanwhile, Iraqi
troops retook the western town
of Rutba, allowing

11:36.262 --> 11:41.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the main road from Amman to
Baghdad to be
reopened.

11:41.167 --> 11:47.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Political turmoil shook Israel
today and deepened
divisions in the ruling Cabinet.
Defense Minister

11:47.206 --> 11:53.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Moshe Ya'alon abruptly resigned,
removing
one of the government's last
moderate voices.

11:53.580 --> 11:59.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said he no longer trusts
Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and his
hard-line supporters.

11:59.752 --> 12:05.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOSHE YA'ALON, Israeli Defense
Minister (through
translator): In all my
positions, I worked

12:05.858 --> 12:11.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in harmony and in a serious way.
But, to my
great dismay, extremist and
dangerous elements

12:11.864 --> 12:17.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have taken over Israel and the
Likud Party,
and are shaking the house and
threatening

12:17.103 --> 12:20.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to hurt its inhabitants. This is
not the Likud
Party I joined.

12:20.974 --> 12:26.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ya'alon warned
that racism
and violence is seeping into the
Israeli army

12:26.479 --> 12:31.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and doing it damage. Prime
Minister Netanyahu
said that he regretted the
resignation. It's

12:31.517 --> 12:36.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been reported that he plans to
name hard-line
former Foreign Minister Avigdor
Lieberman

12:36.623 --> 12:38.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as the new defense minister.

12:38.558 --> 12:44.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Turkey, the Parliament voted
today to strip
lawmakers of their immunity from
prosecution.

12:44.697 --> 12:51.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pro-Kurdish legislators charged
that the goal
is to prosecute them for
allegedly supporting

12:51.104 --> 12:57.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outlawed Kurdish rebels. It is
the latest
move against political opponents
of the Turkish

12:57.143 --> 12:58.945 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government.

12:59.045 --> 13:04.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A new president has taken office
in Taiwan.
Tsai Ing-wen's political party
supports formal

13:04.917 --> 13:11.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
independence from China. But
after a swearing-in
ceremony at the presidential
building in Taipei,

13:11.758 --> 13:13.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
she chose her words carefully.

13:13.693 --> 13:18.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TSAI ING-WEN, Taiwanese
President (through
translator): The new government
will conduct

13:18.698 --> 13:23.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
cross-strait affairs in
accordance with relevant
legislation. The two governing
parties across

13:23.536 --> 13:28.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the strait must set aside the
baggage of history,
and engage in positive dialogue,
for the benefit

13:28.241 --> 13:29.676 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the people on both sides.

13:29.776 --> 13:34.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tsai is the first
woman to
serve as president of Taiwan.

13:34.747 --> 13:40.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another wave of heavy rain added
to the misery
in Sri Lanka today. Flooding in
the capital,

13:40.119 --> 13:46.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Colombo, has displaced more than
185,000 people.
Today, trucks plowed through the
water to

13:46.659 --> 13:52.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ferry out evacuees. Helicopters
were sent
in to rescue others from their
rooftops. The

13:52.899 --> 13:58.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rain also triggered mudslides
this week, and
hundreds of people are still
missing.

13:58.938 --> 14:06.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
India has set a record for its
hottest temperature
ever, nearly 124 degrees
Fahrenheit. It happened

14:06.479 --> 14:13.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today in the western city of
Phalodi, as authorities
issued a severe heat alert for
several states,

14:13.519 --> 14:16.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and called in emergency water
supplies.

14:16.189 --> 14:21.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Today,
we are facing
a very difficult situation.
There is heavy

14:21.794 --> 14:26.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
traffic, and large quantities of
water are
being consumed from the big
water tankers.

14:26.199 --> 14:30.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People are drinking a lot of
water, and the
demand is still rising. We have
to fill up

14:30.503 --> 14:32.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this tank at least three to four
times a day.

14:32.705 --> 14:38.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: India's heat is
always worst
in April, May and June, before
monsoon rains

14:38.678 --> 14:43.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bring relief. Hundreds of people
have died
this week, and thousands of
farmers have lost

14:43.750 --> 14:45.585 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their crops.

14:45.685 --> 14:50.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, Oklahoma
Governor Mary
Fallin vetoed a bill that makes
it a felony

14:50.189 --> 14:56.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for doctors to perform an
abortion. Her fellow
Republicans pushed through the
measure yesterday.

14:56.662 --> 14:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would have been the first law
of its kind
in the country.

15:00.066 --> 15:06.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
San Francisco's police chief,
Greg Suhr, has
been forced out, after a series
of police

15:06.873 --> 15:12.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
killings of unarmed minorities.
The latest
came yesterday, when officers
shot dead a

15:12.512 --> 15:19.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
black woman in a stolen car.
Suhr was also
criticized for not acting faster
against police

15:19.385 --> 15:25.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who sent racist text messages.
Deputy Chief
Toney Chaplin will take over on
an interim

15:25.124 --> 15:26.926 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
basis.

15:27.026 --> 15:31.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street ended the week with
a modest rally.
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 65

15:31.831 --> 15:40.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
points to close above 17500. The
Nasdaq rose
57, and the S&amp;P 500 added 12.

15:40.173 --> 15:45.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
revamped
nutrition labels aim to kick our
sugar habit;

15:45.778 --> 15:50.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks
analyze this
week's news; thawing relations
ahead of the

15:50.983 --> 16:03.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president's visit to Vietnam;
and much more.

16:03.696 --> 16:08.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The labels on the food we buy
will be getting
a new look. The Food and Drug
Administration

16:08.701 --> 16:14.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rolled out rules today with a
greater emphasis
on displaying clearly how much
added sugar

16:14.440 --> 16:16.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is in the foods we eat.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's William Brangham.

16:17.977 --> 16:21.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The changes to
these food
labels won't go into effect
until later this

16:21.781 --> 16:24.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
summer, but here's what you will
see when
you go to the store.

16:24.317 --> 16:28.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the left is the label we all
see today.
On the right is the new one. The
first thing

16:28.554 --> 16:32.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that jumps out is that the
calories are going
to be displayed much more
prominently. But

16:32.458 --> 16:37.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the bigger change is further
down. A new line
is being added showing how many
grams of added

16:37.463 --> 16:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sugars have been put into the
food beyond
what was there already.

16:40.666 --> 16:45.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the label will also tell you
the percentage
of the recommended daily amount
of sugar that

16:45.338 --> 16:48.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is taken up with these added
sugars.

16:48.140 --> 16:51.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So what does this all mean and
will it make
any difference?

16:51.244 --> 16:54.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Allison Aubrey of National
Public Radio is
here to help us sort it out.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.681 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome, Allison.

16:55.781 --> 16:56.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY, National Public
Radio: Hi,
William. Good to be here.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Thanks.

16:58.985 --> 17:03.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have heard these rules
described as radical
and wrongheaded by some people
and as a huge

17:03.522 --> 17:07.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leap forward for the positive by
others. As
a reporter who has covered a lot
of this,

17:07.860 --> 17:09.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
where do you come down on that?

17:09.762 --> 17:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: I wouldn't say
this is radical.
I would say that this reflects
the evolved

17:14.033 --> 17:18.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
science, that this is incredibly
well-grounded
in science. It's very clear now,
many studies

17:18.537 --> 17:23.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
showing that excess sugar leads
to not only
weight gain, but also higher
risk of heart

17:23.743 --> 17:25.544 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
disease.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would say the only thing that
is surprising
here is that the food and
beverage industry

17:27.780 --> 17:30.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really didn't get its way.
Public health won
out.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's not a
terribly common
thing these days.

17:32.919 --> 17:34.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Not at all. Not
at all.

17:34.887 --> 17:39.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, what is
the FDA hoping
for here? Are they trying to
create some sense

17:39.325 --> 17:42.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of sticker shock, that people
will go into
the store, pull some product off
the shelf

17:42.728 --> 17:46.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and say, whoa, I didn't realize
there was
that much added sugar, and then
now maybe

17:46.499 --> 17:48.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
make a different choice? Is that
goal here?

17:48.501 --> 17:51.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: You know, maybe
sticker shock
in the beginning, but here's
what I think

17:51.270 --> 17:53.072 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is at play.

17:53.172 --> 17:56.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the label is a lot
simpler. Right?
So, gone are all these
recommendations about

17:56.309 --> 18:00.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how much Vitamin A and Vitamin C
you're getting
in the product. What's really
amplified, as

18:00.513 --> 18:04.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we just saw on the label you
pointed out,
are calories. Calories are still
a big deal.

18:04.150 --> 18:09.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not a perfect way to figure
out what
to eat, but it's a very clear
and easy way

18:09.255 --> 18:12.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to figure out how much you're
getting. And
calories still matter.

18:12.491 --> 18:17.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other thing, as you pointed
out, the sugar
thing is just absolutely huge.
And the added

18:17.663 --> 18:19.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sugar thing is really important.
Let me just
give you an example.

18:20.032 --> 18:26.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, if you were to take a
20-ounce sugary
soda, that has 65 grams of
sugar. That's 16

18:26.672 --> 18:27.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
teaspoons of sugar.

18:27.573 --> 18:28.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Wow.

18:28.908 --> 18:30.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Now you're going
to see that
on the label.

18:30.810 --> 18:35.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What you're also going to see
is, it's going
to say, this product contains
130 percent

18:35.147 --> 18:40.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the sugar you're supposed to
be eating
in a day. In other words, this
is more sugar

18:40.252 --> 18:43.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than you're supposed to be
eating in a day.
That's really what they're
trying to communicate

18:43.756 --> 18:44.724 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, that is
sticker shock.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: It will be at
first for many
people, because I think people
are largely

18:48.995 --> 18:50.796 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
unaware.

18:50.896 --> 18:55.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, nobody's taking their
coffee cup and
putting 12 teaspoons of sugar in
it. But where

18:55.668 --> 19:01.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're getting a lot of the sugar
is the added
sugar that is hidden in foods,
so, yogurts,

19:01.340 --> 19:06.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
oatmeal, cereals, all kinds of
processed foods,
lots and lots of hidden sugars.
And this is

19:06.412 --> 19:09.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just going to make it easier to
see how much
is there.

19:09.281 --> 19:14.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What does
science tell us
about what changes people's
behaviors? I'm

19:14.286 --> 19:17.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just curious, do you think this
is actually
going to work to steer people to
healthier

19:18.090 --> 19:19.892 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
choices?

19:19.992 --> 19:22.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Well, I think
the very first
thing you have to do to change
behavior is

19:22.528 --> 19:26.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to give people good information,
right? So,
that's the number one step.

19:26.399 --> 19:30.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's really the goal here.
I mean, 20
years ago, people weren't really
reading these

19:30.903 --> 19:37.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
food labels. The USDA has data
showing that
a lot of people, an increased
number, a significant

19:37.309 --> 19:39.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
number of people are now reading
the food
labels.

19:39.478 --> 19:44.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, the idea is better
information, that's
at least the first step to
behavior change.

19:45.017 --> 19:48.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then you need the people
around you to
support you. I think that also
gets into the

19:48.888 --> 19:53.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
role of powerful people
promoting this. Of
course, the first lady has been
talking about

19:53.826 --> 19:58.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this nonstop during her years in
the White
House, and that has made a big
difference.

19:58.330 --> 20:03.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has really used her platform
and really
used her megaphone to raise
awareness about

20:03.569 --> 20:05.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these issues and bring attention
to them.

20:05.638 --> 20:09.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The grocery
industry somewhat
made its peace with this, but
the sugar industry,

20:09.975 --> 20:11.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as you might imagine, has not.

20:11.877 --> 20:16.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said that the FDA is --
quote -- "setting
a precedent that is not grounded
in science."

20:17.049 --> 20:19.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is the industry's beef with
this, so
to speak?

20:19.485 --> 20:22.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Yes, I should
point out by
saying, like, almost every
nutrition scientist

20:22.254 --> 20:24.023 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
would disagree with that fact.

20:24.123 --> 20:29.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the bottom line is that
they're already
making changes. The food
industry has seen

20:29.995 --> 20:33.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the writing on the wall for a
while. I mean,
the World Health Organization,
the American

20:33.899 --> 20:38.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Heart Association for years now
has been saying
we need to cut back on sugar.
Only recently

20:38.637 --> 20:40.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
did we work this into the
dietary guidelines.

20:40.973 --> 20:45.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The writing has been on the
wall. The industry
is already making changes. You
will see yogurts

20:46.011 --> 20:50.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
frequently now in the grocery
store, not just
the premium and high-end brands,
but the everyday

20:50.182 --> 20:54.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
brands saying this product has
25 percent
less sugar now. So the industry
knows how

20:55.020 --> 20:57.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to adapt, and, ultimately, they
will.

20:57.256 --> 21:01.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Allison Aubrey
of National Public Radio, thank
you very much.

21:02.094 --> 21:14.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Thanks, William.
Great to
be here.

21:14.140 --> 21:21.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now we turn
to the presidential
campaign, where the party
front-runners have

21:21.547 --> 21:25.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been trading barbs this week,
among other
things, on foreign policy.

21:25.284 --> 21:30.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During a CNN interview Thursday,
Hillary Clinton
criticized Donald Trump's
handling of issues,

21:30.489 --> 21:33.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saying Trump is not qualified to
be president.

21:33.325 --> 21:38.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Whether it's attacking Great
Britain, praising

21:38.831 --> 21:47.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the leader of North Korea, a
despotic dictator
who has nuclear weapons, whether
it is saying

21:47.373 --> 21:54.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pull out of NATO, let other
countries have
nuclear weapons, the kinds of
positions he

21:54.346 --> 22:02.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is stating and the consequences
of those positions
and even the consequences of his
statements

22:02.922 --> 22:06.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
are not just offensive to
people. They are
potentially dangerous.

22:06.825 --> 22:11.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Trump shot back
Thursday night
at a fund-raiser for New Jersey
Governor Chris

22:12.064 --> 22:13.699 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Christie.

22:13.799 --> 22:16.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Today, we had a terrible
tragedy. And she

22:16.669 --> 22:22.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
came up and she said that Donald
Trump talked
about radical Islamic terrorism,
which she

22:22.508 --> 22:24.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't want to use. She used a
different
term.

22:24.376 --> 22:29.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm saying to myself, what
just happened
about 12 hours ago? A plane got
blown out

22:29.215 --> 22:34.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the sky. And if anything --
if anybody
thinks it wasn't blown out of
the sky, you're

22:35.054 --> 22:36.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
100 percent wrong, folks, OK?

22:37.056 --> 22:41.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And then, today,
there was
more tough talk at the National
Rifle Association's

22:41.427 --> 22:46.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
annual convention in Louisville.
Trump brought
up the mass shooting in San
Bernardino last

22:46.932 --> 22:48.734 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

22:48.834 --> 22:51.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: If we had guns on
the other
side, it wouldn't have been that
way. I would've

22:51.604 --> 22:52.171 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
-- boom.

22:52.271 --> 22:53.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

22:53.973 --> 23:01.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: If we had guns on
the other
side, it wouldn't have been that
way.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

23:03.449 --> 23:06.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And then you have
the gun-free
zones, gun-free zones. We're
getting rid of

23:06.485 --> 23:08.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gun-free zones, OK, I can tell
you.

23:08.754 --> 23:10.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

23:10.723 --> 23:14.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Trump, who has
previously supported
some gun restrictions, received
the NRA's

23:14.960 --> 23:16.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
endorsement today.

23:16.929 --> 23:20.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, meantime, was
off the campaign
trail today, while her opponent,
Bernie Sanders,

23:20.933 --> 23:22.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
stumped in New Mexico.

23:22.868 --> 23:26.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that all brings us to the
analysis of
Shields and Brooks. That's
syndicated columnist

23:27.072 --> 23:30.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and New York Times
columnist
David Brooks.

23:30.576 --> 23:32.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's great to have you both.
Thank you for
being here.

23:33.012 --> 23:38.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, David, Donald Trump wins the
endorsement
of the National Rifle
Association. Not a surprise.

23:38.450 --> 23:40.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What does it mean for him?

23:40.119 --> 23:44.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, he's
beginning to get
the lay-down from the Republican
base.

23:45.090 --> 23:49.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's happening is -- I have
had so many
conversations this week, the
last couple of

23:49.261 --> 23:53.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
weeks -- he's becoming
normalized. A lot of
people who a week ago thought he
was the biggest

23:53.499 --> 23:57.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
monster since -- coming out of
the swamps,
now think, well, you know, he's
a little more

23:58.003 --> 24:01.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conservative than I would -- or
less conservative
than I would like, but I think
we can educate

24:01.640 --> 24:03.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
him, we can bring him along.

24:03.542 --> 24:08.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, now he's just a normal
candidate. And
that's part of the general
lay-down in front

24:08.447 --> 24:13.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of him. And he has got to be
thinking, man,
this is easy. But it's -- it's
pretty much

24:13.285 --> 24:17.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happening, not across the board.
A lot of
people are just laying low, but
he's gathering

24:17.890 --> 24:19.692 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the base.

24:19.792 --> 24:23.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the one thing that I think
was a misstep
was, he listed his Supreme Court
choices this

24:23.595 --> 24:24.096 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
week.

24:24.196 --> 24:26.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

24:26.131 --> 24:28.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And, to me, his
fall campaign
is not about winning over the
Ted Cruz people.

24:29.034 --> 24:32.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's about getting all the
disaffected people
across the ideological spectrum,
including

24:32.671 --> 24:35.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
potentially some Sanders
disaffected people.

24:35.874 --> 24:41.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so making him on social
issues and on
court issues a very traditional
orthodox conservative,

24:41.113 --> 24:46.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seems to me, scares away a lot
of people who
are really his potential in the
fall.

24:46.418 --> 24:48.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see,
Mark, what
he's doing?

24:48.487 --> 24:51.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, he's appealing to the
NRA, saying,
we're not going to have any more
gun-free

24:51.757 --> 24:59.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
zones, and then this -- this --
what David
brings up, trotting out the
names of 11 judges

24:59.164 --> 25:03.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who he says are potential for
the Supreme
Court if he's elected.

25:03.669 --> 25:08.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, I just see
this on the
part of Trump -- the judges, I
see it a little

25:08.440 --> 25:12.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bit differently. That is, just
he's reaching
out to the base. He's trying to
reassure them,

25:12.511 --> 25:14.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
look, you know, I'm OK.

25:14.480 --> 25:19.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's providing cover to
them. Hey, look
-- you know, they don't want to
support him.

25:19.251 --> 25:23.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have got doubts about him.
They're afraid
of what he might do by Columbus
Day or Labor

25:23.889 --> 25:29.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Day, to the point where he not
only embarrasses
and hurts Republicans, but
embarrasses and

25:29.928 --> 25:32.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hurts them for having endorsed
him or stood
with him.

25:32.698 --> 25:37.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So he's just kind of providing
cover: Well,
he was going to give us the
right kind of

25:37.336 --> 25:39.204 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
judges.

25:39.304 --> 25:43.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The gun-free zones I mean, this
is a man of
enormous flexibility. He didn't
just say that

25:43.142 --> 25:48.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was for an assault weapons
ban. He wrote
it in a book. When you write it
in a book,

25:48.447 --> 25:55.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's something -- it's just not
off the cuff.
And now he's totally changed his
position

25:55.888 --> 25:57.623 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on that.

25:57.723 --> 26:03.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The gun-free zones, Judy, to me,
it's just
-- it's irrational, that somehow
packing heat,

26:04.096 --> 26:11.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bringing a concealed weapon into
an elementary
school area or on a campus is
going to increase

26:11.303 --> 26:13.138 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
personal safety.

26:13.238 --> 26:20.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That absolutely bizarre, boom,
at San Bernardino
-- he can't leave San
Bernardino, for good

26:20.913 --> 26:25.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reason. It was a political
masterstroke on
his part. I mean, San
Bernardino, the tragedy

26:25.651 --> 26:30.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that happened, the mass murder,
what did he
say after? I'm for banning
Muslims of any

26:30.322 --> 26:32.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kind from coming into the United
States.

26:32.558 --> 26:38.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what did it do? It was a 2-1
approval
among Republican voters. And his
numbers went

26:38.163 --> 26:42.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up. So, I mean, he's going to
play that card,
and that's what he's doing.

26:42.234 --> 26:44.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: There's a couple
of other things
going on here.

26:44.837 --> 26:50.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is just the -- like, does
the president
have power to end all gun-free
zones around

26:50.576 --> 26:53.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
schools? School -- there is a
federal law
that George W. -- H.W. Bush
passed.

26:53.979 --> 26:55.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.

26:55.848 --> 26:58.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But the schools --
the localities
and the states have some say in
all this.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.118 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right. Right.

27:00.219 --> 27:02.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And so he does --
he doesn't
really have the power.

27:02.187 --> 27:07.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's like a symbolic issue. So
much is symbolic.
Even his reaction to the
airplane that crashed,

27:07.326 --> 27:11.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he -- in narcissistic fashion,
frankly, he
chose the reality that was
useful for him

27:11.463 --> 27:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at that moment. And reality
bends around him.

27:14.766 --> 27:18.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so we don't know what
happened to that
plane. But he said -- and then
we just saw

27:18.470 --> 27:24.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that clip -- if you disagree
with me on this
unknown thing, you're 100
percent wrong. And

27:24.643 --> 27:26.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's the reality force field
that he creates
around himself.

27:26.945 --> 27:29.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But he seems --
as Mark was
saying -- and I guess you're
both making this

27:29.982 --> 27:34.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point -- he seems to be able to
say whatever
he believes at that moment, but
then to say

27:35.087 --> 27:37.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
something different later.

27:37.322 --> 27:44.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And is he being held accountable
by the voters?
Or are his people just so
enamored of what

27:44.630 --> 27:47.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're hearing and what they're
seeing, Mark,
that it doesn't really matter
what he says?

27:47.232 --> 27:51.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I think the
National Rifle
Association would have endorsed
a ham sandwich

27:51.904 --> 27:53.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
against Hillary Clinton.

27:53.839 --> 27:58.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, he could have got up and
said anything.
This is -- his past positions
mean nothing.

27:58.644 --> 28:02.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were going to endorse him.
And his past
positions mean nothing to him. I
think the

28:02.814 --> 28:07.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
man could pass a polygraph. I
mean, he has
already done this on Libya.

28:07.586 --> 28:12.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just now it turns out that his
position on
Libya, where he's criticized
Secretary Clinton

28:12.791 --> 28:17.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the United States toppling
-- or being
involved in the toppling of
Gadhafi, and then

28:17.930 --> 28:25.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaving the country to its own
resources,
which proved sad and inadequate,
that this

28:25.137 --> 28:32.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was a tragedy, now it turns out
that Donald
Trump was all for going into
Libya, for bringing

28:32.945 --> 28:34.713 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
full force.

28:34.813 --> 28:38.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, I think this is a
cumulative thing. And
maybe it doesn't matter in the
primary. I

28:38.750 --> 28:45.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think, when you're talking about
a crisis,
a national crisis -- and every
campaign has

28:45.357 --> 28:51.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them -- we had it in October in
2008 with
the financial crisis and the
collapse. And

28:51.363 --> 28:55.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Barack Obama looked steady,
looked sure-footed.

28:55.801 --> 29:01.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
John McCain, the elder
statesman, the senior
guy, didn't -- wasn't -- yes, it
was his party,

29:01.974 --> 29:06.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and he was in a terrible bind
with George
Bush in the White House, but he
didn't look

29:06.178 --> 29:07.946 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sure.

29:08.046 --> 29:12.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I don't think that Donald
Trump, this
sort of reckless impulsiveness
is going to

29:12.751 --> 29:13.619 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wear well.

29:13.719 --> 29:14.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, the problem
is...

29:14.786 --> 29:15.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You don't? You
don't think...

29:15.253 --> 29:15.854 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

29:15.954 --> 29:17.656 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, I don't.

29:17.756 --> 29:21.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there will be a time. If
a question
becomes, you know, what should
the United

29:21.426 --> 29:27.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States do and, you know, he says
it -- tweets
at 6:00 in the morning, send the
82nd Airborne

29:27.466 --> 29:33.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in, there may -- I think there
is a question
of restraint and judgment and
seriousness

29:33.839 --> 29:35.641 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and maturity.

29:35.741 --> 29:37.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, the problem
is, this is
a binary choice. This is an
election of one

29:37.209 --> 29:37.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
person against another.

29:37.843 --> 29:39.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: I agree.

29:39.878 --> 29:41.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And so large
majorities of Americans
think that he is not honest and
trustworthy.

29:41.913 --> 29:43.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the exact same percentage
think Hillary
Clinton...

29:43.348 --> 29:43.949 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

29:44.049 --> 29:45.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's true.

29:46.051 --> 29:48.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: A large percentage
do not think
he shares their values. The
exact same percentage

29:48.353 --> 29:53.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think Hillary Clinton -- a large
-- or a significant
majority disapprove of him, but
nearly as

29:53.358 --> 29:55.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
many disapprove of Hillary.

29:55.227 --> 29:59.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in a weird -- he's going
down, but somehow
Hillary is following him
straight down. The

29:59.665 --> 30:04.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary thing is a mystery to
me. She was
up at 66 percent approval rating
when she

30:04.403 --> 30:08.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was secretary of state. It
hasn't been that
long. She's just fallen in half.

30:08.840 --> 30:15.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so her approval ratings have
just taken
this long, slow slide. And so
she's at parity,

30:15.147 --> 30:18.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
basically, with him, except on
the temperament
issue, which is why she's
hitting that over

30:18.650 --> 30:20.052 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
and over.

30:20.152 --> 30:22.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Where he is --
he's something
like 70 percent say...

30:22.287 --> 30:23.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: She's at 21
percent advantage
over him.

30:24.022 --> 30:25.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Over him on that.

30:25.891 --> 30:29.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: On the secretary
of state, just
in fairness to her, when you're
secretary

30:29.227 --> 30:34.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of state, she had the support
and endorsement
of a lot of partisan
Republicans.

30:34.332 --> 30:38.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And once it became obvious she
was a presidential
candidate -- but, no, I do not
argue that

30:38.303 --> 30:43.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she has slipped. What we have is
two candidates
who are unpopular. Hillary
Clinton, however,

30:43.475 --> 30:51.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is seen as smart and experienced
and someone
who is knowledgeable. And, you
know, I think

30:51.783 --> 30:55.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the question on Donald Trump,
the jury is
still out on that.

30:55.754 --> 30:57.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean on...

30:57.656 --> 31:00.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: On those
qualities. I mean,
I think they both -- they have
the liabilities

31:01.026 --> 31:03.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that you mentioned and David
mentioned of
trustworthiness and honesty.

31:04.096 --> 31:06.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But they both
have positives
as well.

31:06.198 --> 31:09.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we also need to mention, of
course, that
there is still another Democrat
out there

31:09.367 --> 31:15.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Hillary Clinton is running
against in
Bernie Sanders, David, who was
out this week

31:15.741 --> 31:20.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still saying he's in it until
the end. His
campaign put out a statement
yesterday saying

31:20.545 --> 31:25.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there are growing doubts about
Hillary Clinton
as the party's nominee.

31:25.851 --> 31:30.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where does this Democratic race
stand? People
are -- should we be asking, is
it really over

31:30.355 --> 31:31.556 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or not?

31:31.656 --> 31:33.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, I think it's
over just
on the delegates.

31:33.525 --> 31:37.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she has won, I don't know,
60 percent
of the votes. And she's about 9
-- on the

31:37.162 --> 31:40.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average of polls, she's about 9
percentage
points up in California. So,
probably, she's

31:40.932 --> 31:43.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to be the nominee. Almost
certainly,
she's going to be the nominee.

31:43.468 --> 31:47.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I sort of sympathize where
Sanders is,
because the Democratic
establishment is now

31:47.105 --> 31:50.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying to him, you have got to
get out of
the race or you got to tone down
your rhetoric

31:50.242 --> 31:52.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because you're beating our
candidate.

31:52.144 --> 31:56.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he can say, well, yes, I'm
beating your
candidate. So, if he keeps
winning, and so

31:56.581 --> 32:00.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why should he get out? Winners
don't have
to get out. They can keep going.
That's like

32:00.285 --> 32:02.087 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the rule.

32:02.187 --> 32:06.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so he can -- both because
he's doing pretty
well, reasonably well, second,
because he

32:06.591 --> 32:12.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
believes in not only his
candidacy, but his
ideas and more specifically
reforms of the

32:12.364 --> 32:17.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
process. And so -- and, by the
way, I do not
think this is going to hurt the
Democratic

32:17.502 --> 32:19.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
candidate in the fall.

32:19.404 --> 32:23.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2008, 60 percent of Clinton
-- only 60
percent of Clinton supporters
said they would

32:23.241 --> 32:28.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vote for Barack Obama. Sanders
people are
much more positively inclined
toward Clinton

32:29.047 --> 32:31.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than Clinton people were toward
Obama.

32:31.650 --> 32:35.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And by six months from now,
believe me, all
this will be forgotten, and I
think the Democratic

32:35.887 --> 32:37.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Party is a much more unified
party.

32:37.722 --> 32:40.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But is there
still -- I mean,
what do you make of the race
that's still

32:40.225 --> 32:41.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there between Bernie Sanders and
Hillary Clinton?

32:42.027 --> 32:44.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: What I make of it
is this, Judy.

32:44.663 --> 32:51.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders 12 months ago
launched a quixotic,
improbable campaign. He was at 3
percent in

32:51.803 --> 32:58.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the polls. Well-known pundits
and wise people
sneered, even snickered at his
candidacy.

32:59.010 --> 33:02.347 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She was 65 percent to 3 percent.

33:02.447 --> 33:07.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over the past 12 months, Bernie
Sanders has
filled auditoriums of 27,000,
25,000, 20,000

33:07.919 --> 33:14.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
people regularly. He has
consistently won
primaries. He's dominated the
debate. He's

33:14.860 --> 33:17.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
raised $200 million.

33:17.596 --> 33:22.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are three surviving
candidates, three.
There is only one who is
favorable in the

33:22.968 --> 33:28.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eyes of the voters. That's
Bernie Sanders.
There is only one who trounces
Donald Trump

33:28.807 --> 33:30.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by large margins. That's Bernie
Sanders.

33:31.076 --> 33:36.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We had four primaries in the
month of May.
He's won three of them. So the
idea -- is

33:37.015 --> 33:42.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there anybody on the Democratic
leadership,
in the party, or the White House
who understands

33:42.587 --> 33:46.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's done so well? And you let
him get out
on his terms. He wants to make
his fight.

33:46.858 --> 33:51.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I agree with David. The numbers
are very much
in Secretary Clinton's, -- the
likelihood

33:51.229 --> 33:57.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of her being nominated is
overwhelming, but
Bernie Sanders has enlisted
millions of people.

33:57.769 --> 34:03.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She needs those people in the
fall, especially
young people that are -- have
been indifferent

34:03.308 --> 34:05.143 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to her candidacy.

34:05.243 --> 34:08.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why -- of course he's
going to
make the fight and make -- carry
it through.

34:08.847 --> 34:11.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he should. And they ought to
give him
some space and time and respect.

34:12.050 --> 34:15.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But my question
is, what happens
to all that enthusiasm that is
out there right

34:16.087 --> 34:21.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now for Bernie Sanders? Does it
just sort
of shift over to Hillary
Clinton? It's not

34:21.660 --> 34:23.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to happen overnight,
presumably.

34:23.528 --> 34:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: At the convention,
Bernie Sanders
stands up, and he says, this is
the fight

34:28.500 --> 34:30.302 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we have fought.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have fought the good fight.
We have kept
the faith. We have not finished
the course,

34:32.871 --> 34:37.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but the rest of the course is,
we have to
stand to stop Donald Trump from
ever being

34:37.609 --> 34:41.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
elected president. We have to
stand with Hillary
Clinton. I will do everything in
my power

34:41.846 --> 34:45.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the next three months to
make sure that
Hillary Clinton is the next
president of the

34:45.383 --> 34:47.118 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
United States.

34:47.218 --> 34:48.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: He could tone down
some of the
rhetoric. She has not stolen the
nomination

34:48.420 --> 34:48.853 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
from him.

34:48.954 --> 34:50.689 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MARK SHIELDS: No.

34:50.789 --> 34:51.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: The process may
not have been
totally honest -- or not totally
fair. But

34:51.990 --> 34:53.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it was -- she won fair and
square.

34:53.825 --> 34:58.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I happen to think a lot of those
voters will
go away. I think the fall
campaign is going

34:58.163 --> 35:03.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be so negative, that it will
drive down
turnout, and the sort of people
who are likely

35:03.568 --> 35:07.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to not -- to say just say I wash
my hands
of this are especially his young
-- Sanders'

35:07.339 --> 35:08.039 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
young voters.

35:08.139 --> 35:09.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, we end up...

35:10.075 --> 35:14.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's why it's
important that
they keep him in the tent, very
much in the

35:14.713 --> 35:16.982 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tent, and honor what he has
done.

35:17.082 --> 35:20.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we have got
a few more
weeks to watch the primaries.
They're not

35:20.752 --> 35:21.619 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
over yet.

35:21.720 --> 35:31.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mark Shields, David Brooks,
thank you.

35:31.663 --> 35:36.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

35:36.601 --> 35:42.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
NPR's Bob Boilen
explores the songs that have
changed musicians'

35:42.407 --> 35:44.509 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lives.

35:44.609 --> 35:50.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: President Obama
departs for a trip
to Asia tomorrow, his first
stop, Vietnam.

35:50.281 --> 35:55.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Obama will be the third
consecutive president
to visit the nation after
America's war there

35:55.553 --> 36:02.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ended in 1975. Relations between
the U.S.
and Vietnam are warming as
mutual interests

36:02.160 --> 36:04.062 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
become clearer.

36:04.162 --> 36:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a move apparently timed to
the president's
trip, Vietnam this week released
a long-held

36:09.000 --> 36:10.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
political prisoner.

36:10.902 --> 36:15.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. ambassador to Vietnam
has pressed
the government there on human
rights and other

36:15.373 --> 36:17.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
matters since he took his post.

36:17.709 --> 36:23.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Mike Cerre
sent us this
profile of the U.S.' man in
Hanoi.

36:24.015 --> 36:38.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: Breakfast at the
U.S. ambassador's
residence in Hanoi, with a side
order of Vietnamese

36:38.496 --> 36:40.432 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
language lessons.

36:40.532 --> 36:41.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
®MD-BO-TED OSIUS, U.S.
Ambassador to Vietnam:
I can speak what is a pretty
difficult language,

36:41.800 --> 36:47.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and I speak it pretty well.

36:48.039 --> 36:54.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, more often than not,
people like
to get out and mix it up, really
learn what's

36:54.779 --> 36:58.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going on in the countries where
they serve
and make a difference.

36:58.450 --> 37:05.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: The closest most
locals will ever
come to a U.S. ambassador abroad
is a passing

37:05.123 --> 37:08.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
motorcade or a heavily staged
official event.

37:08.827 --> 37:12.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But given the tortured relations
between the
United States and Vietnam over
the years,

37:13.098 --> 37:18.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. Ambassador Ted Osius is
dispensing with
traditional protocols to help
create a new

37:19.037 --> 37:23.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reference point on U.S.-Vietnam
relations.

37:23.875 --> 37:29.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His mission in Vietnam started
with a 1,200-mile
bike ride, the length of the
country, as a

37:29.147 --> 37:34.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. consular officer in 1995,
soon after
official relations between the
two countries

37:34.786 --> 37:41.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
were restored. His bike
diplomacy continues
to be his signature style for
interacting

37:41.893 --> 37:46.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the Vietnamese people, as
well as local
government officials.

37:46.131 --> 37:50.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
While crossing the former
demilitarized zone,
once separating North from South
Vietnam,

37:50.635 --> 37:56.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a local woman offered a rare,
but indelible
Vietnamese perspective on what
they call here

37:56.841 --> 37:58.309 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the American war.

37:58.409 --> 38:02.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TED OSIUS: And I asked her, "So,
why are there
so many ponds right here?"

38:02.213 --> 38:07.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she said, "Well, that's
where the Americans
dropped bombs."

38:07.685 --> 38:18.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she said -- she went on to
say: "They
dropped bombs on my village.
They dropped

38:18.630 --> 38:20.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bombs, and I lost family
members."

38:20.698 --> 38:25.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I said: "Well, I need you to
know I'm
American and I work for the U.S.
Embassy."

38:25.203 --> 38:35.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she said well, "Today --
today, you and
I are brother and sister."

38:35.980 --> 38:43.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: Save for the war
museum, mostly
for tourists, it's almost
impossible to find

38:43.421 --> 38:49.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any traces or mention of the
war, let alone
get anyone wanting to talk about
it, especially

38:49.827 --> 38:52.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the younger Vietnamese, who have
little knowledge
of the war.

38:52.397 --> 38:56.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TED OSIUS: So, they have known a
lot of war.
Ours was one.

38:56.467 --> 39:02.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In some ways, it more seared
into our consciousness
than into theirs. Yes, it was
very painful

39:02.640 --> 39:08.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for both sides. Yes, they lost a
huge number
of people, but they in many ways
have been

39:08.479 --> 39:11.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
quicker to move on and look
toward the future
than we have.

39:11.916 --> 39:18.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: He relies on his
Facebook page
to circumvent official channels
and the government-controlled

39:18.189 --> 39:23.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
media to communicate as directly
as he can
with the Vietnamese people on
significant

39:24.028 --> 39:27.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
issues, like TPP, the new
Trans-Pacific Partnership
trade agreement.

39:27.966 --> 39:30.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TED OSIUS: But you're not doing
this alone.

39:30.201 --> 39:34.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than half of our exports to
Vietnam are
agricultural. And there will be
many more

39:34.572 --> 39:40.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opportunities for our exporters
to get into
this market when the Vietnamese
lower their

39:40.245 --> 39:47.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tariffs. The idea that jobs will
be sucked
out of the United States and
will go to Vietnam,

39:47.919 --> 39:49.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't think is correct.

39:49.320 --> 39:51.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: So those jobs have
already left
the United States?

39:51.522 --> 39:58.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TED OSIUS: We're talking about
industries
like making shoes or apparel
that involve

39:58.930 --> 40:05.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of people, and those jobs
will shift
within this region, for the most
part.

40:05.169 --> 40:10.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: Also on the agenda
for the first
presidential state visit, a
broadening of

40:10.108 --> 40:11.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
defense agreements

40:12.010 --> 40:16.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TED OSIUS: The Chinese have been
very aggressive,
and in some ways, they have been
pushing the

40:16.781 --> 40:24.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Southeast Asian countries
towards us, because
they have been so aggressive in
building islands,

40:24.856 --> 40:30.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in challenging the status quo in
the South
China Sea. And the United States
stands for

40:31.095 --> 40:32.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
respect for international law.

40:32.997 --> 40:38.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: As much as the
Vietnam tries to
put the war behind it, a new
generation of

40:38.770 --> 40:46.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vietnamese are still dealing
with some its
dangerous legacies, unexploded
ordnance, and

40:46.411 --> 40:51.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
environmental contamination from
the Agent
Orange defoliant, suspected of
causing crippling

40:51.649 --> 40:54.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
health issues for successive
generations of
Vietnamese.

40:54.786 --> 40:59.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TED OSIUS: If you're honest
about the past,
you can have a very different
kind of future

40:59.457 --> 41:01.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than if you try to whitewash the
past.

41:02.093 --> 41:07.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is in the cleanup of dioxin,
popularly
known as Agent Orange. And we
have had some

41:07.498 --> 41:13.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
real success in Da Nang, in
cleaning up the
dioxin that was left.

41:13.137 --> 41:19.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE CERRE: He and the
administration are
also hoping to leverage the TPP
negotiations

41:19.177 --> 41:24.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make progress on one of the
more sensitive
issues between the two
countries, human rights.

41:24.315 --> 41:30.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TED OSIUS: This is really
important. Yes,
I have it. I always -- I carry
this card.

41:30.955 --> 41:34.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's examples of demonstrable
progress on
human rights.

41:34.992 --> 41:40.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have given this card to
members of the politburo.
I point out, these are the
things that we're

41:40.431 --> 41:45.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
asking you to do. We couldn't be
more clear.
It fits on a card. The
Vietnamese could still

41:45.603 --> 41:50.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
choose -- rather than have
economic growth,
rather than have trade with us
in Europe,

41:50.942 --> 41:53.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they can choose to throw
bloggers in jail.

41:53.378 --> 41:58.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: For Ambassador
Osius, human rights
begins at home.

41:58.516 --> 42:01.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TED OSIUS: I'm white. My
husband's black.
And our kids are brown.

42:02.053 --> 42:09.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we represent, I think, one
of the things
that's really great about
America.

42:09.494 --> 42:16.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: Ambassador Osius
isn't the first
gay U.S. ambassador, but he and
his spouse,

42:16.501 --> 42:22.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clayton Bond, have become very
visible leaders
of the LGBT movement in the
Diplomatic Corps

42:22.306 --> 42:28.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and now sweeping across
Southeast Asia, especially
here in Vietnam, where a ban on
same-sex marriages

42:29.013 --> 42:32.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was lifted shortly after they
arrived less
than two years ago.

42:32.884 --> 42:36.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this more of a personal
agenda or an official
agenda?

42:36.554 --> 42:43.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TED OSIUS: Well, it's about
representing equality.
And it's about representing
human rights.

42:43.461 --> 42:49.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's very much an official
agenda. The
agenda of this administration is
to keep pressing

42:50.067 --> 42:58.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the envelope on human rights.
And that includes
the rights of LGBTI persons.
Because my family

42:58.242 --> 43:05.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I are visible, we do more by
example than
through just talking. We show
that you can

43:05.383 --> 43:08.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be a same-sex couple and raise
children, and
do it successfully.

43:08.953 --> 43:12.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NGUYEN QUI DUC, Cafe Owner: So,
anyone who
thinks that the ambassador's
sexuality is

43:12.824 --> 43:18.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a distraction, I think they
should come here
and see how it's been embraced
by people.

43:18.429 --> 43:25.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: Nguyen Qui Duc, a
former NPR and
BBC correspondent, owns a cafe
on the same

43:25.369 --> 43:30.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
block as the ambassador's
residence, and is
a close observer of the
Vietnamese reaction

43:30.408 --> 43:33.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the ambassador's diplomatic
and personal
style.

43:33.211 --> 43:39.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NGUYEN QUI DUC: It's a nonissue,
as long as
he does his work and carries
himself with

43:39.584 --> 43:41.419 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
dignity.

43:41.519 --> 43:47.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TED OSIUS: The fact that I show
respect for
Vietnamese language and culture
and history,

43:47.525 --> 43:52.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Vietnamese people, the fact
that I show
that respect, that I clearly
enjoy being here,

43:52.497 --> 43:54.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that has helped my
mission.

43:54.499 --> 43:58.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I really love being here. I feel
like I won
the lottery, because I really
care about this

43:58.703 --> 44:05.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country. To be able to come here
and do this
job at this time in history is a
really rare

44:05.476 --> 44:07.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
privilege. I feel lucky every
day.

44:08.079 --> 44:17.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MIKE CERRE: For the "PBS
NewsHour," Mike Cerre
reporting in Hanoi, Vietnam.

44:17.522 --> 44:26.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight:
Many of you
may know Bob Boilen as the host
and creator

44:26.797 --> 44:32.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of NPR's "All Songs Considered,"
one of the
most downloaded music podcasts.

44:32.970 --> 44:38.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the popular 9:30 Club here in
Washington,
D.C., recently, Jeffrey Brown
sat down with

44:38.242 --> 44:43.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Boilen, whose own band was the
first to play
at that club 35 years ago.

44:44.081 --> 44:49.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His new book, "Your Song Changed
My Life,"
recounts the history of modern
music through

44:49.520 --> 44:51.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
voices Boilen has encountered.

44:51.589 --> 44:59.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Your book, "Your
Song Changed
My Life," right, that's true. I
mean, a lot

44:59.130 --> 45:04.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of people would say that, but
why? Have you
figured out what it is that --
about music

45:04.769 --> 45:06.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that has that impact?

45:06.337 --> 45:09.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BOB BOILEN, Author, "Your Song
Changed My
Life": I think it's so visceral.

45:09.774 --> 45:13.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Music is so different than
everything else.
It's not tangible. You don't see
it. It hits

45:13.511 --> 45:18.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you on a level that is deeper
than what we
do and see in everyday life. I
think it's

45:19.050 --> 45:26.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pure emotion and tone, and a
lyric. Somebody
saying a lyric that repeats over
and over

45:26.424 --> 45:28.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can be a call to action for
somebody.

45:28.893 --> 45:33.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I tell stories of people whose
lives were
changed by a song, and often in
those formative

45:33.564 --> 45:41.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years, what some people call the
reminiscence
bump, where you're more likely
to be susceptible

45:41.105 --> 45:46.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to something, with hormones
raging, or the
first time you ever like heard
somebody go,

45:46.177 --> 45:50.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yes, you know, like, those
things are impactful
because they're firsts. And...

45:50.181 --> 45:52.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You were looking
for those
moments from people.

45:52.483 --> 45:57.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB BOILEN: Well, then it wasn't
hard to find,
either because so many musicians
-- there

45:57.188 --> 46:01.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are 35 in my book, from -- you
know, you get
Jimmy Page or a new artist like
Hozier or

46:01.692 --> 46:03.494 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
St. Vincent.

46:03.594 --> 46:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You get artists who became
musicians because
something like that happened to
them, where

46:09.400 --> 46:13.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they heard a song on the radio
while they
were 8 years old strapped to the
back seat

46:13.671 --> 46:15.439 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of a car.

46:15.539 --> 46:19.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or, for Jimmy Page, he moved
into a house
that was empty and there was a
guitar in that

46:19.243 --> 46:20.277 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
house, the only thing, right?

46:20.378 --> 46:21.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, with a page
of Led Zeppelin.

46:21.846 --> 46:23.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOB BOILEN: Led Zeppelin, yes.

46:23.781 --> 46:27.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then sees a kid at school
playing a guitar.
And this is the '50s. It's not
like today,

46:27.551 --> 46:29.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where everybody's got a guitar.
This was a
rare thing.

46:29.754 --> 46:36.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It happens to all
of us, as
lovers of music, but it also
happens to the

46:36.160 --> 46:38.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
musicians themselves. That's
what made them
who they are.

46:38.963 --> 46:40.765 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
BOB BOILEN: Yes.

46:40.865 --> 46:44.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those musicians go on to
spawn a whole
crop of new ones. I see it all
the time, like

46:44.769 --> 46:50.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
someone like Courtney Barnett,
who is a musician
from Australia that many people
might not

46:50.141 --> 46:57.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know. She's 23 years old, one of
the best
musical poets of this
generation, I think.

46:57.615 --> 47:01.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think people who love Dylan
could connect
to Courtney Barnett, for
example. She was

47:01.986 --> 47:07.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
influenced by, you know, a band
in America
that's been a band for 20 years,
Wilco. So,

47:07.925 --> 47:14.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's interesting to see someone
23 being influenced
by someone, say, in their 40s
who has been

47:14.131 --> 47:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
making music since they were
that age.

47:16.333 --> 47:18.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, I just love those
connections that happen.

47:18.469 --> 47:24.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Did you see
themes emerge when
you're talking to all these
different musicians,

47:24.542 --> 47:26.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anything that really stood out
or surprised
you?

47:26.711 --> 47:32.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB BOILEN: Well, I think one
thing is that
parents, listen, you have a
large influence

47:32.550 --> 47:33.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on what your kids are going to
like.

47:33.984 --> 47:37.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for my generation, I was
rebelling against
my parents' music.

47:37.488 --> 47:39.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

47:39.423 --> 47:42.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB BOILEN: But that's not true
anymore. Most
kids embrace their parents'
music. Most kids

47:42.259 --> 47:45.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
look back with some sense of, I
want to know
more.

47:45.596 --> 47:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm curious what's going to
happen in the
land of playlists. Like, is your
kid going

47:49.700 --> 47:53.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to inherit your playlists? Not
likely.

47:53.137 --> 47:55.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What is going to
happen? I
mean, because we're sitting here
talking amid

47:55.806 --> 48:01.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so many changes in the world of
music, right,
the industry, the way we take in
music, how

48:01.345 --> 48:02.680 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we listen to it.

48:02.780 --> 48:05.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BOB BOILEN: I think that we will
still have
the auditory experience.

48:05.316 --> 48:10.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We will still have that
experience of sitting
next to your mother or father,
hearing a song,

48:10.888 --> 48:15.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and -- but you're not going to
get that physical
thing that, for me, was really
important.

48:15.960 --> 48:22.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I miss the album. I miss
the physical
thing that I can hold and --
while I listen.

48:22.500 --> 48:26.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, that said, people today
have the choice
to listen to anything and
everything. They

48:26.771 --> 48:30.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can listen to Louis Armstrong,
or they can
listen to, you know, Alice
Cooper, and they

48:30.841 --> 48:34.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can do it all in the same three
minutes of
each other without having to
purchase anything,

48:34.945 --> 48:41.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
without having to run to the
local library
or go to somebody's cousin's
brother's house.

48:41.786 --> 48:47.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think that's exceptional.
And so the
understanding of what music is
and its history

48:47.925 --> 48:50.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is much deeper than it will ever
be.

48:50.661 --> 48:55.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And you talk
about people's
moments when they -- moments of
discovery.

48:55.699 --> 48:57.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What about your own?

48:57.668 --> 49:00.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB BOILEN: Well, I grew up at
the time when
the Beatles came to be, and it
may seem almost

49:01.005 --> 49:04.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cliche for some, oh, the
Beatles, you know?

49:04.175 --> 49:12.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here's a band that in 1964 were
writing really
cute, catchy songs, and then
three, 3.5 years

49:12.983 --> 49:22.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
later, from '64 to '67, were
writing unimaginable
sounds, with a record like "Sgt.
Pepper's

49:22.426 --> 49:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lonely Hearts Club Band," lyrics
that were
no longer about how I love you
and how I want

49:29.166 --> 49:30.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to hold your hand.

49:31.035 --> 49:36.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It was much deeper life
philosophy. And the
orchestrations were just
mind-boggling. And

49:36.240 --> 49:40.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I love that progression in the
music. I love
what happens when a band can be
one thing

49:40.811 --> 49:45.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one time, and grow up and become
something
else. And I'm always looking for
that group

49:45.382 --> 49:46.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that wants to keep innovating.

49:46.617 --> 49:49.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just find that fascinating,
endlessly fascinating.

49:49.587 --> 49:52.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sometimes,
cliches are true,
right? The Beatles.

49:52.389 --> 49:53.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BOB BOILEN: Yes. Yes.

49:53.624 --> 49:55.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Bob
Boilen, thanks
so much.

49:55.659 --> 49:57.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOB BOILEN: Yes. Pleasure.

49:57.561 --> 50:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in other
music news, John
Berry, a founding member of the
band Beastie

50:01.966 --> 50:07.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Boys, died yesterday. Berry left
after their
first album, but is credited
with coming up

50:07.671 --> 50:24.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the band's name. John Berry
was 52 years
old.

50:24.822 --> 50:30.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online right
now: Sunday
marks the birthday of Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle,

50:30.561 --> 50:35.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
creator of Sherlock Holmes. But
the famous
author was also a physician, and
somewhat

50:35.532 --> 50:38.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of a medical detective in his
own right.

50:38.235 --> 50:42.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In his honor, we share one of
his greatest
true detective stories.

50:42.406 --> 50:48.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, the "NewsHour" took part
in a BioBlitz
today. It's an event focuses on
finding as

50:48.579 --> 50:54.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many living species as possible
in a defined
area in a short period of time.

50:54.118 --> 50:59.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were live on Facebook and
caught up with
National Geographic's Anand
Varma showing

50:59.590 --> 51:02.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
off what we might be looking
over.

51:02.293 --> 51:04.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: What have you got here?

51:04.528 --> 51:09.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: This is a snail. And this
is actually
a kind of roach. It's related to
the cockroach

51:09.199 --> 51:13.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you in your home, but it's
actually native
to the forest here. So, there's
lots of different

51:14.004 --> 51:22.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kinds of insects that live out
in the forest.
So, it's not just -- not just
ants and pollinators,

51:22.646 --> 51:24.682 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
but -- yes.

51:24.782 --> 51:30.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very cool. All
that and more

tries to win over establishment

On "PBS NewsHour" Saturday: from
discovering
your heritage to improving your
health, the

52:01.151 --> 52:06.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
growing industry that relies on
the collection
of DNA samples.

52:06.123 --> 52:11.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Researchers have
already gathered
blood and urine samples from
12,000 local

52:11.228 --> 52:17.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
residents, and stored those
samples in a huge
biobank, a refrigerated
repository for human

52:17.101 --> 52:20.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tissue, in this case the size of
a football
field.

52:20.904 --> 52:27.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then the specimen's DNA is
sequenced, as needed.
The study is ambitious,
collecting specimens

52:27.144 --> 52:33.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over generations, and unique, in
its focus
on one community. However, there
are ethical

52:33.917 --> 52:38.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concerns. Donors receive a
T-shirt and a $10
dollar Wal-Mart gift card for
their samples

52:39.056 --> 52:43.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and nothing more, even if their
samples help
discover a cure for cancer or
any disease.

war, found a new life in the
U.S., and are
now returned home.

52:57.341 --> 52:59.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
