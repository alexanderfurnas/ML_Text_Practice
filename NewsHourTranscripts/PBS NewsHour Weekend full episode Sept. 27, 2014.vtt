EDITION FOR SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER

00:12.613 --> 00:13.847
27...

00:13.847 --> 00:15.148
NEW AIR STRIKES ON ISLAMIC STATE

00:15.148 --> 00:16.316
POSITIONS.

00:16.316 --> 00:17.484
WE’LL DISSECT THE SITUATION ON

00:17.484 --> 00:18.986
THE BATTLEFIELD THROUGHOUT SYRIA

00:18.986 --> 00:20.954
AND IRAQ.

00:20.954 --> 00:22.589
AND ON THIS AMERICAN GRADUATE

00:22.589 --> 00:24.524
DAY, WILL AN EXTRA HOUR OF

00:24.524 --> 00:26.093
READING HELP UNDERPERFORMING

00:26.093 --> 00:27.160
STUDENTS?

00:27.160 --> 00:28.795
AND IS IT THE ROLE OF STATES TO

00:28.795 --> 00:30.030
MANDATE IT?

00:30.030 --> 00:31.131
>> THIS IS THE MECHANISM THAT

00:31.131 --> 00:33.033
WILL HELP CLOSE THAT GAP BETWEEN

00:33.033 --> 00:34.668
THE STUDENTS THAT ARE LIVING IN

00:34.668 --> 00:36.303
POVERTY AND STUDENTS THAT ARE

00:36.303 --> 00:38.005
NOT LIVING IN POVERTY.

00:38.005 --> 00:39.039
>> Sreenivasan: NEXT ON PBS

00:39.039 --> 00:40.340
NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:41.275 --> 00:42.442
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING,

00:42.442 --> 00:43.844
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.012
I’M HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:45.012 --> 00:46.413
BECAUSE OF WNET’S AMERICAN

00:46.413 --> 00:48.048
GRADUATE DAY INITIATIVE, WE ARE

00:48.048 --> 00:49.683
COMING TO YOU TONIGHT FROM

00:49.683 --> 00:51.485
ANOTHER STUDIO IN NEW YORK CITY.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.120
WARPLANES FROM THE UNITED STATES

00:53.120 --> 00:54.521
AND ALLIED NATIONS STRUCK

00:54.521 --> 00:56.156
ISLAMIC STATE FIGHTERS TODAY IN

00:56.156 --> 00:57.257
A TOWN NEAR THE SYRIAN-TURKISH

00:57.257 --> 00:57.824
BORDER.

00:57.824 --> 00:59.459
THE JIHADISTS HAVE BEEN BATTLING

00:59.459 --> 01:00.928
KURDISH FORCES THERE, CAUSING

01:00.928 --> 01:02.562
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SYRIANS

01:02.562 --> 01:03.964
TO FLEE INTO TURKEY.

01:03.964 --> 01:05.599
TWO ISIS TANKS REPORTEDLY WERE

01:05.599 --> 01:07.000
DESTROYED DURING TODAY’S ALLIED

01:07.000 --> 01:08.168
BOMBINGS.

01:08.168 --> 01:09.803
BUT ISIS FIGHTERS LATER SHELLED

01:09.803 --> 01:11.204
THE TOWN, WOUNDING SEVERAL

01:11.204 --> 01:12.372
CITIZENS.

01:12.372 --> 01:14.007
TODAY, FOR THE FIRST TIME,

01:14.007 --> 01:15.409
BRITISH FIGHTER JETS FLEW

01:15.409 --> 01:16.810
MISSIONS OVER NORTHERN IRAQ.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.612
WE’LL HAVE MUCH MORE ON THE

01:18.612 --> 01:20.013
CONFLICT IN A MOMENT.

01:20.013 --> 01:21.648
IN HONG KONG TODAY, POLICE

01:21.648 --> 01:23.050
ARRESTED SEVERAL DOZEN PRO-

01:23.050 --> 01:24.451
DEMOCRACY DEMONSTRATORS WHO HAD

01:24.451 --> 01:26.253
SCALED A FENCE AND OCCUPIED A

01:26.253 --> 01:27.654
PLAZA OUTSIDE A GOVERNMENT

01:27.654 --> 01:28.822
BUILDING.

01:28.822 --> 01:30.223
THE WEEK-LONG PROTESTS FOLLOWED

01:30.223 --> 01:31.858
A RULING THAT THE CENTRAL

01:31.858 --> 01:33.493
GOVERNMENT IN BEIJING WOULD HAVE

01:33.493 --> 01:34.895
TO APPROVE ALL CANDIDATES

01:34.895 --> 01:36.530
SEEKING TO BECOME HONG KONG’S

01:36.530 --> 01:37.698
CHIEF EXECUTIVE.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.099
THOUSANDS OF OTHERS GATHERED

01:39.099 --> 01:40.834
NEAR THE SCENE AND CHANTED IN

01:40.834 --> 01:42.235
SUPPORT OF THE DEMONSTRATORS.

01:42.235 --> 01:43.870
IN EGYPT TODAY, HOSNI MUBARAK

01:43.870 --> 01:45.672
WAS TAKEN BY STRETCHER INTO A

01:45.672 --> 01:47.307
COURTROOM TO HEAR WHETHER HE

01:47.307 --> 01:48.942
WOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:48.942 --> 01:50.744
THE DEATH OF MORE THAN 800

01:50.744 --> 01:52.145
PROTESTERS DURING THE 2011

01:52.145 --> 01:53.947
UPRISING THAT LED TO HIS OUSTER,

01:53.947 --> 01:55.582
BUT THE VERDICT WAS DELAYED.

01:55.582 --> 01:56.984
THE 86-YEAR-OLD WAS CONVICTED

01:56.984 --> 02:01.588
AND SENTENCED TO LIFE IN 2012 ON

02:01.588 --> 02:03.223
THE SAME CHARGES BUT THE CASE

02:03.223 --> 02:05.325
WAS RECENTLY RE-TRIED.

02:05.325 --> 02:06.960
BACK IN THIS COUNTRY, CARBON

02:06.960 --> 02:08.595
EMISSIONS ARE ON THE RISE.

02:08.595 --> 02:10.230
DATA RELEASED YESTERDAY BY THE

02:10.230 --> 02:11.865
DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY SHOWED A

02:11.865 --> 02:13.500
2.7% INCREASE DURING THE FIRST

02:13.500 --> 02:15.302
SIX MONTHS OF 2014 COMPARED TO

02:15.302 --> 02:16.937
THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.605
EARLIER THIS WEEK, THE PRESIDENT

02:18.605 --> 02:20.040
TOUTED AMERICA’S REDUCED CARBON

02:20.040 --> 02:21.675
EMISSIONS BUT SAID THE NATION

02:21.675 --> 02:23.076
NEEDED TO DO MORE.

02:23.076 --> 02:24.478
THE INCREASE IS WIDELY

02:24.478 --> 02:25.879
ATTRIBUTED TO GROWING ECONOMIC

02:25.879 --> 02:27.280
ACTIVITY AT THE NATION’S

02:27.280 --> 02:28.982
FACTORIES.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.817
THE WHITE HOUSE IS REPORTEDLY

02:30.817 --> 02:32.753
PREPARING AN EXECUTIVE ORDER

02:32.753 --> 02:34.388
THAT WOULD REQUIRE ALL FEDERAL

02:34.388 --> 02:36.023
AGENCIES TO DISCLOSE WHERE THEY

02:36.023 --> 02:37.824
FLY DRONES IN THIS COUNTRY AND

02:37.824 --> 02:39.626
WHAT THEY ARE DOING WITH THE

02:39.626 --> 02:40.394
DATA THEY GATHER.

02:40.394 --> 02:41.828
THE ORDER WOULD NOT AFFECT

02:41.828 --> 02:43.063
MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE

02:43.063 --> 02:43.663
OPERATIONS OVERSEAS.

02:43.663 --> 02:45.365
ALL THIS ACCORDING TO A REPORT

02:45.365 --> 02:46.633
IN THEWASHINGTON POST.

02:46.633 --> 02:48.702
MORE THAN 700 FLIGHTS IN AND OUT

02:48.702 --> 02:50.337
OF CHICAGO WERE CANCELED TODAY,

02:50.337 --> 02:51.738
STILL A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT

02:51.738 --> 02:53.774
OVER YESTERDAY WHEN AN ESTIMATED

02:53.774 --> 02:55.575
2,000 FLIGHTS TO AND FROM O’HARE

02:55.575 --> 02:57.244
AND MIDWAY WERE GROUNDED.

02:57.244 --> 02:59.046
THIS WAS THE SCENE DEPICTED IN

02:59.046 --> 03:00.747
THE SKIES OVER THE CHICAGO AREA

03:00.747 --> 03:02.049
YESTERDAY MORNING.

03:02.049 --> 03:03.450
THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE

03:03.450 --> 03:04.484
TODAY.

03:04.484 --> 03:05.519
THE DISRUPTION WAS CAUSED BY A

03:05.519 --> 03:07.320
FIRE AT AN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL

03:07.320 --> 03:08.755
CENTER-- A FIRE APPARENTLY SET

03:08.755 --> 03:10.090
BY A DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEE WHO

03:10.090 --> 03:11.491
LATER REPORTEDLY TRIED TO KILL

03:11.491 --> 03:12.793
HIMSELF.

03:12.793 --> 03:12.759
A 54 YEAR-OLD MENTALLY ILL

03:12.759 --> 03:16.129
INMATE WHO HAD BEEN HELD IN

03:16.129 --> 03:17.764
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT IN A NORTH

03:17.764 --> 03:19.566
CAROLINA PRISON FOR MORE THAN A

03:19.566 --> 03:22.302
MONTH DIED OF DEHYDRATION, THIS

03:22.302 --> 03:23.703
ACCORDING TO PRISON RECORDS

03:23.703 --> 03:25.105
OBTAINED BY THE ASSOCIATED

03:25.105 --> 03:26.273
PRESS.

03:26.273 --> 03:27.908
THE SAME RECORDS SAID THE

03:27.908 --> 03:29.076
INMATE, A DIAGNOSED

03:29.076 --> 03:30.477
SCHIZOPHRENIC, HAD FLOODED HIS

03:30.477 --> 03:31.645
CELL TWICE.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.280
PRISON OFFICIALS ARE ALLOWED TO

03:33.280 --> 03:35.348
TURN OFF THE WATER IN CELLS, BUT

03:35.348 --> 03:36.983
THEY HAVEN’T SAID WHETHER THEY

03:36.983 --> 03:39.052
DID SO IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE

03:39.052 --> 03:40.220
INMATE DIED.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.788
SINCE THE DEATH LAST MARCH,

03:41.788 --> 03:43.423
SEVEN PRISON EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN

03:43.423 --> 03:44.825
FIRED OR HAVE RESIGNED.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.226
AND HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE

03:46.226 --> 03:47.394
INVESTIGATING WHETHER

03:47.394 --> 03:49.029
ENTEROVIRUS 68 IS LINKED TO

03:49.029 --> 03:50.197
POLIO-LIKE SYMPTOMS NOW

03:50.197 --> 03:51.598
AFFLICTING NINE CHILDREN IN

03:51.598 --> 03:52.766
COLORADO.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.167
PRELIMINARY TESTS FOUND THAT

03:54.167 --> 03:56.236
FOUR OF THE NINE HAD THE VIRUS.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.038
MORE THAN 275 PEOPLE IN 40

03:58.038 --> 03:59.673
STATES HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH

03:59.673 --> 04:01.141
THE VIRUS, WHICH TYPICALLY

04:01.141 --> 04:02.542
CAUSES RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS AND

04:02.542 --> 04:05.145
HIGH FEVER.

04:14.654 --> 04:15.922
>> Sreenivasan: TO TRY TO GIVE

04:15.922 --> 04:16.690
YOU AN OVERALL PICTURE OF THE

04:16.690 --> 04:18.091
SITUATION ON THE BATTLEFIELD

04:18.091 --> 04:19.726
THROUGHOUT IRAQ AND SYRIA, WE

04:19.726 --> 04:21.361
ARE JOINED NOW FROM WASHINGTON

04:21.361 --> 04:22.529
BY ANTHONY CORDESMAN.

04:22.529 --> 04:23.530
HE IS WITH THE CENTER FOR

04:23.530 --> 04:24.931
STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL

04:24.931 --> 04:26.133
STUDIES AND WAS THE DIRECTOR OF

04:26.133 --> 04:27.367
INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT IN THE

04:27.367 --> 04:28.235
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF

04:28.235 --> 04:29.002
DEFENSE.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.403
SO LET’S START IN NORTHEASTERN

04:30.403 --> 04:32.205
SYRIA, WHERE THE U.S. HAS BEEN

04:32.205 --> 04:33.607
STRIKING ISLAMIC STATE POSITIONS

04:33.607 --> 04:35.242
NEAR ITS HEADQUARTERS IN RAQQA,

04:35.242 --> 04:36.877
AND WHERE INTENSE FIGHTING HAS

04:36.877 --> 04:38.211
OCCURRED THIS WEEK BETWEEN

04:38.211 --> 04:39.846
KURDISH FORCES AND ISIS IN

04:39.846 --> 04:41.448
KOBANE NEAR THE TURKISH BORDER.

04:41.448 --> 04:44.317
WHAT’S THE LATEST FROM SYRIA?

04:44.317 --> 04:45.785
>> THE NUMBER OF STRIKES HAVE

04:45.785 --> 04:46.953
BEEN RELATIVELY LIMITED.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.755
THIS IS NOT, AS YET, AN

04:48.755 --> 04:50.757
INTENSIVE AIR CAMPAIGN, PROBABLY

04:50.757 --> 04:53.994
AROUND 250 STRIKES, AND A LITTLE

04:53.994 --> 04:58.064
OVER 40 CRUISE MISSILES.

04:58.064 --> 05:01.568
THE AREA IN THE TURKISH BORDER

05:01.568 --> 05:04.504
IS A PARTICULARLY TROUBLED AREA

05:04.504 --> 05:06.706
BECAUSE THE ISLAMIC STATE IS

05:06.706 --> 05:10.210
PUSHING HARD TO ESSENTIALLY PUSH

05:10.210 --> 05:12.512
THE SYRIAN KURDS OUT OF THE AREA

05:12.512 --> 05:14.881
TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE BORDER

05:14.881 --> 05:16.316
AREAS WITH TURKEY.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.218
THAT GIVES THEM LEVERAGE OVER

05:18.218 --> 05:18.952
TURKEY.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.587
IT’S PUSHING OUT AN OPPONENT

05:20.587 --> 05:22.389
WHICH HAD BEEN ALLIED WITH THE

05:22.389 --> 05:23.557
IRAQI KURDS.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.358
AT THE SAME TIME, THERE HAVE

05:25.358 --> 05:27.060
BEEN STRIKES INSIDE SYRIA WHICH

05:27.060 --> 05:30.363
HAVE ATTACKED KEY COMMAND POSTS,

05:30.363 --> 05:31.698
REFINERIES, THE ECONOMIC

05:31.698 --> 05:33.333
LIFELINE TO THE ISLAMIC STATES.

05:33.333 --> 05:37.637
BUT THESE ARE STILL EARLY DAYS.

05:37.637 --> 05:40.774
IT’S NOT YET AN INTENSIVE OR

05:40.774 --> 05:42.409
SUSTAINED CAMPAIGN THAT’S GOING

05:42.409 --> 05:44.678
TO MAKE A CRITICAL DIFFERENCE.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.445
>> Sreenivasan: HOW ABOUT THE

05:45.445 --> 05:46.580
SITUATION IN NORTHERN IRAQ?

05:46.580 --> 05:47.647
A LOT OF AMERICANS ARE FAMILIAR

05:47.647 --> 05:49.149
WITH THE RESCUE OPERATION THAT

05:49.149 --> 05:50.250
WE PARTICIPATED IN TO TRY TO

05:50.250 --> 05:51.484
HELP THE YAZIDIS GET

05:51.484 --> 05:53.720
OFF THE SINJAR MOUNTAIN AREA.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.522
BUT ISIS STILL CONTROLS MOSUL

05:55.522 --> 05:58.024
AND MUCH OF THAT REGION.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.826
>> NO ONE HAS SUGGESTED AT ANY

05:59.826 --> 06:01.528
POINT IN THE ADMINISTRATION OR

06:01.528 --> 06:03.330
IN THE U.S. JOINT CHIEFS THAT

06:03.330 --> 06:05.899
THESE AIRSTRIKES ARE GOING TO

06:05.899 --> 06:07.300
DRIVE THE ISLAMIC STATE OUT OF

06:07.300 --> 06:11.004
NORTHERN AND WESTERN IRAQ.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.472
SO FAR, THE AIRSTRIKES, WHEN

06:12.472 --> 06:14.107
THEY’VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN IRAQ,

06:14.107 --> 06:17.877
HAVE LARGELY BEEN CLOSE-AIR

06:17.877 --> 06:19.846
SUPPORT, SUPPORT REALLY HELPING

06:19.846 --> 06:22.048
SPECIFIC IRAQI OR KURDISH FORCES

06:22.048 --> 06:24.684
THAT WERE THREATENED BY THE

06:24.684 --> 06:25.986
ISLAMIC STATE.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.287
THERE HAVE ONLY BEEN TWO VERY

06:27.287 --> 06:28.588
MINOR ATTEMPTS AT A

06:28.588 --> 06:30.090
COUNTER-OFFENSIVE TO DRIVE

06:30.090 --> 06:32.659
INSIDE.

06:32.659 --> 06:34.227
THE AREAS OCCUPIED THE ISLAMIC

06:34.227 --> 06:36.029
STATE, AND BOTH OF THESE HAVE

06:36.029 --> 06:37.197
REALLY FAILED.

06:37.197 --> 06:38.999
AND IN AREAS WHERE THERE HAVE

06:38.999 --> 06:41.434
BEEN SOME GAINS IN HOLDING THE

06:41.434 --> 06:43.903
OFFENSIVES, YOU STILL SEE THE

06:43.903 --> 06:45.705
ISLAMIC STATE FIND OTHER WAYS TO

06:45.705 --> 06:47.340
GO ON THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST

06:47.340 --> 06:49.009
OTHER TOWNS AND PLACES.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.978
>> ISIS ALSO CONTROLS SEVERAL

06:51.978 --> 06:53.780
CITIES WITHIN ABOUT 50 MILES OF

06:53.780 --> 06:55.582
BAGHDAD, AND THIS WEEK WE HEARD

06:55.582 --> 06:57.217
NEW REPORTS ABOUT THEIR FIGHTERS

06:57.217 --> 06:58.385
DEFEATING IRAQI GOVERNMENT

06:58.385 --> 07:00.020
TROOPS EVEN CLOSER TO THE

07:00.020 --> 07:01.721
CAPITAL, SO, MY QUESTION IS, IS

07:01.721 --> 07:03.356
BAGHDAD ITSELF IN ANY DANGER?

07:03.356 --> 07:05.959
>> MOST OF WHAT WE’RE SEEING ARE

07:05.959 --> 07:08.428
ATTACKING OF SMALL TOWNS ALONG

07:08.428 --> 07:11.298
THE RIVER THAT WERE HELD BY

07:11.298 --> 07:15.535
SMALL, ISOLATED IRAQI ARMY

07:15.535 --> 07:16.703
GARRISONS.

07:16.703 --> 07:19.005
SOME OF THESE HAD 400, SOME OF

07:19.005 --> 07:21.641
THEM HAD 800 PEOPLE.

07:21.641 --> 07:23.943
THEY’RE NOT IN THE SHIITE AREAS.

07:23.943 --> 07:25.812
THEY’RE NOT IN THE URBAN AREAS

07:25.812 --> 07:27.080
IN BAGHDAD.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.082
THEY’RE NOT DEALING WITH THE

07:29.082 --> 07:31.084
LARGER IRAQI FORCES.

07:31.084 --> 07:33.453
BUT IT IS DISTURBING THAT THESE

07:33.453 --> 07:36.589
HAVE BEEN GAINS THAT ARE TO THE

07:36.589 --> 07:38.391
WEST, TO SOME EXTENT TO THE

07:38.391 --> 07:40.193
IMMEDIATE SOUTH, AND IN A FEW

07:40.193 --> 07:41.995
AREAS TO THE NORTH OF BAGHDAD.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.563
YES, THEY’RE STILL IN RURAL

07:43.563 --> 07:45.365
AREAS, BUT IN EACH CASE WHERE

07:45.365 --> 07:47.167
THERE’S BEEN A PUSH AGAINST THE

07:47.167 --> 07:52.806
IRAQI FORCES, THEY HAVEN’T BEEN

07:52.806 --> 07:54.607
SUPPLIED, AREAS OR ATTEMPTS TO

07:54.607 --> 07:56.009
RELIEVE THEM UNDER PRESSURE

07:56.009 --> 07:57.177
HAVEN’T WORKED.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.578
THEY’VE APPEALED FOR SUPPORT

07:58.578 --> 07:59.979
FROM THE IRAQI FORCES.

07:59.979 --> 08:01.848
THEY’VE BEEN GIVEN ALL KINDS OF

08:01.848 --> 08:03.850
PROMISES, AND NOTHING HAS BEEN

08:03.850 --> 08:05.018
DELIVERED.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.820
AND THIS REFLECTS A MUCH BROADER

08:06.820 --> 08:07.987
ISSUE.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.622
THE U.S. ASSESSMENTS ARE THAT

08:09.622 --> 08:11.458
THERE ARE ABOUT 26 BRIGADES--

08:11.458 --> 08:13.526
THAT’S A LARGE FORCE-- STILL

08:13.526 --> 08:16.296
LEFT IN THE IRAQI FORCES.

08:16.296 --> 08:17.630
IT’S ALSO THAT ABOUT HALF

08:17.630 --> 08:19.733
OF THOSE ARE SECTARIAN, OR

08:19.733 --> 08:21.501
SHIITE.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.602
THEY’RE NOT REALLY

08:22.602 --> 08:24.537
SUPPORTING THE NATIONAL FORCES

08:24.537 --> 08:26.005
OR THEY’RE SIMPLY NOT MILITARILY

08:26.005 --> 08:27.540
EFFECTIVE.

08:27.540 --> 08:29.008
AND VIRTUALLY ALL OF

08:29.008 --> 08:32.779
THE OTHERS ARE GOING TO REQUIRE

08:32.779 --> 08:34.180
ADVISORY SUPPORT, ARMS SUPPLIES,

08:34.180 --> 08:35.815
BETTER COMMAND AND CONTROL, TO

08:35.815 --> 08:37.884
BE EFFECTIVE SO AS YET, WE’RE

08:37.884 --> 08:39.586
HOLDING BUT THE AIRSTRIKES ARE

08:39.586 --> 08:42.722
NOT REALLY CRIPPLING THE ISLAMIC

08:42.722 --> 08:44.991
STATE IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY.

08:44.991 --> 08:46.159
>> Sreenivasan: ANTHONY

08:46.159 --> 08:47.560
CORDESMAN JOINING US FROM

09:03.910 --> 09:05.311
WE EXAMINE A ONE-OF-A-KIND

09:05.311 --> 09:07.113
PROGRAM IN THE NATION TO HELP

09:07.113 --> 09:08.281
BOOST READING SKILLS.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.916
FLORIDA NOW REQUIRES ITS 300

09:09.916 --> 09:11.084
LOWEST-PERFORMING ELEMENTARY

09:11.084 --> 09:13.153
SCHOOLS TO ADD AN HOUR TO THEIR

09:13.153 --> 09:14.954
SCHOOL DAY, AN HOUR FOCUSED ON

09:14.954 --> 09:16.356
READING, AND NOTHING ELSE.

09:16.356 --> 09:18.158
AS YOU’D EXPECT, A LIVELY DEBATE

09:18.158 --> 09:19.959
IS UNDERWAY ABOUT THE WISDOM AND

09:19.959 --> 09:22.028
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PLAN.

SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT ALISON

09:31.971 --> 09:33.139
STARTED SECOND GRADE.

09:33.139 --> 09:34.941
AND EVERY DAY AFTER SCHOOL HE

09:34.941 --> 09:36.743
DOES HOMEWORK WITH HIS AUNT AND

09:36.743 --> 09:37.911
GUARDIAN ANTONIA WILLIAMS.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.546

09:45.118 --> 09:46.719
WHEN HE FIRST COMES HOME I

09:46.719 --> 09:47.887
NORMALLY HAVE...

09:47.887 --> 09:48.655
LET HIM HAVE A 20-MINUTE BREAK.

09:48.655 --> 09:49.656
HE GETS A SNACK.

09:49.656 --> 09:50.623
>> YOU WANT APPLE?

09:50.623 --> 09:51.524
>> AND THEN WE START HIS

09:51.524 --> 09:52.492
HOMEWORK.

09:52.492 --> 09:53.726
I’LL GIVE HIM A BREAK IN BETWEEN

09:53.726 --> 09:55.595
BECAUSE IT’S A LOT FOR A SECOND

09:55.595 --> 09:57.397
GRADER TO RETAIN AND TO

09:57.397 --> 09:59.032
COMPREHEND, SO THIS IS OUR...

09:59.032 --> 10:00.667
THIS IS OUR DAILY SCHEDULE.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.068
>> Reporter: A SCHEDULE THAT

10:02.068 --> 10:03.703
ALREADY INCLUDES AN EXTRA HOUR

10:03.703 --> 10:05.505
OF READING, AND ONLY READING FOR

10:05.505 --> 10:08.641
JAYLON AND FOR EVERY OTHER

10:08.641 --> 10:10.043
STUDENT AT HIS SCHOOL,

10:10.043 --> 10:11.311
PHILLIS WHEATLEY ELEMENTARY

10:11.311 --> 10:12.946
SCHOOL IN APOPKA, FLORIDA, JUST

10:12.946 --> 10:14.581
NORTHWEST OF ORLANDO IN ORANGE

10:14.581 --> 10:15.748
COUNTY.

10:15.748 --> 10:17.383
>> ANTONIA, WHAT DID YOU THINK

10:17.383 --> 10:19.018
WHEN YOU FIRST HEARD THAT

10:19.018 --> 10:20.653
JAYLON’S SCHOOL WAS GOING TO

10:20.653 --> 10:22.288
REQUIRE ONE EXTRA HOUR OF

10:22.288 --> 10:23.456
READING AT SCHOOL EVERY DAY.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.858
>> I WAS LIKE, "YES."

10:24.858 --> 10:25.658
>> Reporter: YEAH?

10:25.658 --> 10:26.459
>> I WAS, LIKE, "YES."

10:26.459 --> 10:28.294
I MEAN, WHAT ELSE WOULD A CHILD

10:28.294 --> 10:30.063
BE DOING THAT HOUR AFTER SCHOOL,

10:30.063 --> 10:31.564
YOU KNOW?

10:31.564 --> 10:32.832
YES, IT WOULD BE A LONGER DAY

10:32.832 --> 10:34.133
AND I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT HIM

10:34.133 --> 10:35.368
BEING FOCUSED AND STAYING ON

10:35.368 --> 10:37.270
TASK FOR SUCH A LONG TIME.

10:37.270 --> 10:38.505
BUT HE’S IN A STRUCTURED

10:38.505 --> 10:39.806
ENVIRONMENT.

10:39.806 --> 10:40.874
YOU KNOW, IT’S NOT LIKE THEY’RE

10:40.874 --> 10:41.908
ON THE PLAYGROUND FOR AN EXTRA

10:41.908 --> 10:42.842
HOUR.

10:42.842 --> 10:43.977
THEY’RE READING.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.011
>> Reporter: HAS HE ASKED YOU

10:45.011 --> 10:46.012
WHY HE STAYS AN EXTRA HOUR?

10:46.012 --> 10:46.913
>> I DON’T EVEN THINK HE

10:46.913 --> 10:47.981
REALIZES IT.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.215
>> Reporter: THE EXTRA HOUR OF

10:49.215 --> 10:50.316
READING AT WHEATLEY ELEMENTARY

10:50.316 --> 10:51.751
IS NOT VOLUNTARY.

10:51.751 --> 10:53.319
THIS SCHOOL YEAR IN FLORIDA, THE

10:53.319 --> 10:54.921
300 LOWEST-PERFORMING ELEMENTARY

10:54.921 --> 10:56.523
SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED TO ADD AN

10:56.523 --> 10:59.058
HOUR OF READING INSTRUCTION,

10:59.058 --> 11:00.760
A RANKING DETERMINED BY THE

11:00.760 --> 11:01.928
STATE’S STANDARDIZED READING

11:01.928 --> 11:03.096
TEST.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.898
IT IS ESTIMATED TO COST JUST

11:04.898 --> 11:06.699
OVER $5 MILLION FOR THE 20

11:06.699 --> 11:07.867
TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS

REQUIRED TO ADD THE HOUR IN

ORANGE COUNTY, THE 10TH LARGEST

11:11.304 --> 11:12.939
SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE COUNTRY.

11:12.939 --> 11:14.741
IT’S AN EXPANSION OF A LAW

11:14.741 --> 11:16.543
PASSED IN 2012 THAT FOCUSED ON

11:16.543 --> 11:17.710
THE 100 LOWEST-PERFORMING

11:17.710 --> 11:18.878
SCHOOLS.

11:18.878 --> 11:20.280
AND THAT INCLUDED PHILLIS

11:20.280 --> 11:21.447
WHEATLEY ELEMENTARY.

11:21.447 --> 11:23.249
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS?

11:23.249 --> 11:24.884
>> Reporter: SEAN BROWN IS THE

11:24.884 --> 11:26.052
SCHOOL’S PRINCIPAL.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.210
READ SOME MORE.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.279
>> WE WANT TO HONE IN ON THE

11:53.279 --> 11:54.914
READING SKILLS AND THEN JUST

11:54.914 --> 11:56.316
PUSH THE STUDENTS ACADEMICALLY

11:56.316 --> 11:57.717
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

11:57.717 --> 11:58.885

11:58.885 --> 12:00.520
SCHOOL WHERE ALL STUDENTS GET

12:00.520 --> 12:01.988
FREE BREAKFAST AND LUNCH,

12:01.988 --> 12:03.389
PHILLIS WHEATLEY ELEMENTARY IS

12:03.389 --> 12:05.191
IN A NEIGHBORHOOD WITH A HIGH

12:05.191 --> 12:07.260
CRIME RATE, AND IS THE TYPE OF

12:07.260 --> 12:08.428
SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS THINK

12:08.428 --> 12:09.829
COULD PARTICULARLY BENEFIT FROM

12:09.829 --> 12:11.230
THE EXTRA READING TIME.

12:11.230 --> 12:11.998
>> DO YOU THINK YOUR STUDENTS

12:11.998 --> 12:13.032
NEED THIS EXTRA HOUR?

12:13.032 --> 12:14.334
>> YES, I DO.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.401
>> Reporter: WHY IS THAT?

12:15.401 --> 12:16.336
IS IT BECAUSE THEY’RE SO FAR

12:16.336 --> 12:17.370
BEHIND?

12:17.370 --> 12:18.304
IS IT JUST NOT ENOUGH TIME

12:18.304 --> 12:19.339
DURING THE DAY TO TEACH THESE

12:19.339 --> 12:20.306
KIDS?

12:20.306 --> 12:21.274
>> THERE’S SEVERAL REASONS.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.076
I KNOW THAT WITH POVERTY, A LOT

12:23.076 --> 12:24.377
OF OUR STUDENTS, THEY’RE SO MUCH

12:24.377 --> 12:27.180
FURTHER BEHIND A STUDENT THAT

12:27.180 --> 12:28.648
HAS TWO PARENTS OR A STUDENT

12:28.648 --> 12:30.450
THAT HAS A HIGH WORKING-CLASS

12:30.450 --> 12:31.918
FAMILY.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.720
SO THIS IS THE MECHANISM THAT

12:33.720 --> 12:35.455
WILL HELP CLOSE THAT GAP BETWEEN

12:35.455 --> 12:37.256
THE STUDENTS THAT ARE LIVING IN

12:37.256 --> 12:38.891
POVERTY AND STUDENTS THAT ARE

12:38.891 --> 12:40.293
NOT LIVING IN POVERTY.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.694
>> Reporter: AND PRINCIPAL BROWN

12:41.694 --> 12:43.096
IS CONVINCED IT WORKS.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.164
AFTER A YEAR WITH THE BONUS HOUR

12:45.164 --> 12:46.799
IN 2012, WHEATLEY SAW THE

12:46.799 --> 12:48.201
PERCENTAGE OF CHILDREN READING

12:48.201 --> 12:50.003

12:52.805 --> 12:54.607
QUARTERS OF THE SCHOOLS WITH THE

12:54.607 --> 12:56.409
EXTRA HOUR SHOWED AN INCREASE IN

12:56.409 --> 12:59.946
STUDENTS READING AT GRADE LEVEL.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.648
>> THE RESULTS HAVE TURNED OUT

13:01.648 --> 13:02.815
TO BE DRAMATIC.

13:02.815 --> 13:03.983
>> Reporter: REPUBLICAN STATE

13:08.655 --> 13:10.456
THE SON OF TWO PUBLIC SCHOOL

13:10.456 --> 13:12.258

13:12.258 --> 13:14.060
ABOUT ADDING EXTRA TIME FROM A

13:14.060 --> 13:15.461
PRINCIPAL AT A STRUGGLING

13:15.461 --> 13:16.629
ORLANDO SCHOOL.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.431
>> IN TALKING TO HIM HE

13:18.431 --> 13:20.500
SAID, "IF I JUST HAD MORE TIME

13:20.500 --> 13:22.135
WITH THESE CHILDREN, I COULD

13:22.135 --> 13:23.936
MAKE A BIG, BIG DIFFERENCE WITH

13:23.936 --> 13:25.104
THEM."

13:25.104 --> 13:27.173
AND HE SAID, "IT’S NOT THAT THEY

13:27.173 --> 13:28.808
CAN’T LEARN, IT’S THEY DON’T

13:28.808 --> 13:30.443
HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO LEARN."

13:30.443 --> 13:32.512
BUT IT HAS TO BE DONE RIGHT.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.147
ALISON, YOU CAN’T HAVE PIZZA

13:34.147 --> 13:35.782
PARTIES DURING THAT EXTRA HOUR.

13:35.782 --> 13:38.051
YOU HAVE TO DO IT AT THE RIGHT

13:38.051 --> 13:39.218
TIME.

13:39.218 --> 13:40.486
YOU HAVE TO HAVE DEDICATED

13:40.486 --> 13:41.387
TEACHERS WHO KNOW WHAT THEY’RE

13:41.387 --> 13:42.288
DOING.

13:42.288 --> 13:43.222
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SCHOOL SYSTEM

13:43.222 --> 13:44.290
THAT IS BEHIND IT.

ENSURE SCHOOLS AREN’T PENALIZED

13:50.096 --> 13:52.298

14:09.682 --> 14:10.850
OTHER NATIONS, INDUSTRIALIZED

14:10.850 --> 14:12.485
NATIONS, SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO

14:12.485 --> 14:14.887

14:14.887 --> 14:16.756
THAN WE DO HERE ON AVERAGE IN

THESE CHILDREN IN A LIMITED

14:27.366 --> 14:28.534
AMOUNT OF TIME.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.336
IT’S LIKE TRYING TO PUT 25

14:35.608 --> 14:37.610
A PIECE OF FOOL’S GOLD AND HE

14:37.610 --> 14:40.246
BELIEVES IT’S REAL GENUINE GOLD.

14:40.246 --> 14:41.881
>> Reporter: RICK ROACH IS ONE

14:41.881 --> 14:43.516
OF EIGHT ELECTED SCHOOL BOARD

14:43.516 --> 14:44.917
MEMBERS IN ORANGE COUNTY.

14:44.917 --> 14:46.552
A TEACHER AND GUIDANCE COUNSELOR

14:46.552 --> 14:48.354
FOR 14 YEARS IN THE COUNTY,

14:48.354 --> 14:49.756
ROACH ALSO TRAINED TEACHERS

14:49.756 --> 14:51.390
AROUND THE COUNTRY AND HAS

14:51.390 --> 14:53.192
SERVED ON THE SCHOOL BOARD SINCE

14:53.192 --> 14:54.360
1998.

14:54.360 --> 14:55.294
HE’S NOT CONVINCED THAT THE

14:55.294 --> 14:56.562
EXTRA MANDATED TIME IS THE

14:56.562 --> 14:57.830
SOLUTION THAT IT SEEMS.

14:57.830 --> 14:59.232
>> I DON’T THINK IT HAS TRUE

14:59.232 --> 15:00.633
EDUCATIONAL VALUE.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.001
AND I THINK IT COULD BE MORE

15:02.001 --> 15:03.703
HELPFUL IF YOU JUST TAKE YOUR

15:03.703 --> 15:06.038
EYES OFF OF A TEST SCORE.

15:06.038 --> 15:07.673
IT DOESN’T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT

15:07.673 --> 15:09.742
THAT CHILD COMES OUT OF THERE A

15:09.742 --> 15:11.544
BETTER READER OR HAS DEVELOPED A

15:11.544 --> 15:12.712
LOVE OF READING.

15:12.712 --> 15:14.347
IT SIMPLY MEANS THEY’VE JAMMED

15:14.347 --> 15:17.850
UP A RAW SCORE ON A SINGLE

15:17.850 --> 15:19.018
MEASURE TEST.

15:19.018 --> 15:20.419
>> Reporter: AND THERE’S THE

15:20.419 --> 15:22.221
QUESTION: WHO GETS TO DECIDE THE

15:22.221 --> 15:24.023
BEST WAY TO HELP KIDS LEARN?

15:24.023 --> 15:26.092
WHAT WAS THE DEBATE LIKE OR THE

15:26.092 --> 15:27.727
DISCUSSION LIKE WHEN IT FIRST

15:27.727 --> 15:29.529
CAME UP, "SHOULD WE HAVE KIDS

15:29.529 --> 15:31.330
READ FOR AN EXTRA HOUR AFTER

15:31.330 --> 15:32.498
SCHOOL?"

15:32.498 --> 15:33.666
>> PLEASE...

15:33.666 --> 15:34.834
(laughing)

15:34.834 --> 15:36.903
I HAVE TO LAUGH AT THAT ONE.

15:36.903 --> 15:38.638
THERE WAS NO DEBATE ON THAT.

15:38.638 --> 15:42.175
THERE WAS SIMPLY...

15:42.175 --> 15:43.976
THE COMMAND CAME DOWN FROM THE

15:43.976 --> 15:45.778
HILL, "THOU SHALT PUT AN EXTRA

15:45.778 --> 15:47.180
HOUR INTO THE SCHOOL."

15:47.180 --> 15:48.981
THERE WAS NO DEBATE, THE BOARD

15:48.981 --> 15:50.149
DIDN’T DISCUSS THAT.

15:50.149 --> 15:51.784
LOCAL... THERE WAS NO LOCAL

15:51.784 --> 15:52.952
FEEDBACK INTO THAT.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.754
NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT

15:54.754 --> 15:56.556
MANY PEOPLE WHO MAKE THESE LAWS

15:56.556 --> 15:58.357
NEVER TAUGHT ONE DAY IN A

15:58.357 --> 15:59.358
CLASSROOM.

15:59.358 --> 16:00.359
I WOULDN’T FOR A MINUTE SERVE ON

16:00.359 --> 16:01.694
AN AVIATION BOARD OR A MEDICAL

16:01.694 --> 16:02.962
BOARD.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.363
>> Reporter: THERE ARE OTHER

16:04.363 --> 16:05.765
CONCERNS AS WELL: DISTRICT

16:05.765 --> 16:07.400
OFFICIALS FIND OUT WHICH SCHOOLS

16:07.400 --> 16:09.202
ARE REQUIRED TO ADD THE EXTRA

16:09.202 --> 16:10.837
READING HOUR JUST WEEKS BEFORE

16:10.837 --> 16:12.004
SCHOOL STARTS.

16:12.004 --> 16:13.806

16:27.620 --> 16:28.554

16:28.554 --> 16:30.356
FOR THE MOST PART, EVERYONE IS

16:30.356 --> 16:32.158
REQUIRED TO STAY THE EXTRA HOUR.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.560
SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER RICK ROACH

16:34.560 --> 16:35.962
QUESTIONS WHETHER IT REALLY

16:35.962 --> 16:37.063
WORKS.

16:37.063 --> 16:38.698
HE SAYS THE NUMBERS THAT

16:38.698 --> 16:40.333
SUPPORTERS POINT TO ONLY TELL

16:40.333 --> 16:42.134
PART OF THE STORY AND THAT

16:42.134 --> 16:43.536
SIMILAR STUDENTS WITHOUT THE

16:43.536 --> 16:45.171
EXTRA HOUR OF READING ALSO

16:45.171 --> 16:46.806
SHOWED IMPROVEMENT OVER THE SAME

16:46.806 --> 16:47.974
TIME PERIOD.

16:47.974 --> 16:49.609
IF SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS

16:49.609 --> 16:51.410
AND IT HELPS ANYBODY, ISN’T IT

16:51.410 --> 16:52.812
WORTH CONTINUING AND TRYING?

16:52.812 --> 16:54.614
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK FEW PEOPLE

16:54.614 --> 16:56.249
WOULD DISAGREE WITH THE FACT

16:56.249 --> 16:58.050
THAT WE’RE GOING TO GIVE KIDS

16:58.050 --> 16:59.852
WHO MAY BE LOW READERS EXTRA

16:59.852 --> 17:03.189
TIME TO READ.

17:03.189 --> 17:05.391
BUT THERE’S A CONSEQUENCE TO

17:05.391 --> 17:06.459
THAT.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.527
YOU MAY IN FACT DRIVE UP A

17:08.527 --> 17:10.329
READING SCORE, BUT YOU ALSO LOSE

17:10.329 --> 17:13.065
OTHER... OTHER FEATURES AS WELL.

17:13.065 --> 17:14.867
IF THEY’D GAVE US SOME OPTIONS,

17:14.867 --> 17:16.669
THAT SAME MONEY WOULD BUY SEVEN

17:16.669 --> 17:17.837
TEACHERS PER SCHOOL.

17:17.837 --> 17:20.573
YOU COULD REDUCE CLASS SIZE.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.208
IT WOULD HAVE BOUGHT 14

17:22.208 --> 17:24.377
PARAPROFESSIONALS.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.012
YOU COULD’VE EXTENDED THE YEAR

17:26.012 --> 17:28.080
BY 20 DAYS AND KEPT THE SAME

17:28.080 --> 17:31.083
NUMBER OF HOURS IF YOU LET LOCAL

17:31.083 --> 17:32.318
CONTROL COME INTO PLAY FOR THE

17:32.318 --> 17:33.419
SAME MONEY.

17:33.419 --> 17:34.587
>> Reporter: THE CRITICISM I’VE

17:34.587 --> 17:35.988
HEARD FROM A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT

17:35.988 --> 17:37.590
FOLKS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN

17:37.590 --> 17:39.425
EDUCATION, THAT THEY WORK ON THE

17:39.425 --> 17:40.293
LOCAL LEVEL.

17:40.293 --> 17:41.627
THEY’RE IN THE SCHOOLS.

17:41.627 --> 17:42.828
AND THE IDEA THAT THEY HAVE TO

17:42.828 --> 17:43.963
TAKE THIS MONEY, COME UP WITH IT

17:43.963 --> 17:45.932
AND PUT IT JUST ON READING,

17:45.932 --> 17:47.233
EVERYBODY SUPPORTS READING BUT

17:47.233 --> 17:48.601
PERHAPS THAT’S NOT WHAT THEIR

17:48.601 --> 17:50.369
SCHOOL NEEDS.

17:50.369 --> 17:51.871
IF THE VAST MAJORITY OF YOUR

17:51.871 --> 17:56.509
STUDENTS HAVE ON OUR TESTS, YOU

17:56.509 --> 17:58.945
KNOW, STANDARDIZED TESTS, SHOWN

17:58.945 --> 18:01.580
THAT THEY CANNOT READ AT GRADE

18:01.580 --> 18:05.084
LEVEL, THEN THEY NEED READING

18:05.084 --> 18:06.619
INSTRUCTION.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.087
THAT’S A SIMPLE FACT OF LIFE.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.188
>> THUMBS UP IF YOU REMEMBER AND

18:09.188 --> 18:10.790
YOU UNDERSTAND.

THE ISSUE OF FUNDING; WHO PAYS

18:13.292 --> 18:16.595
FOR IT NOW AND IN THE FUTURE?

18:16.595 --> 18:17.596
WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR THIS

18:17.596 --> 18:19.832
PROGRAM TO BE GUARANTEED

18:19.832 --> 18:21.200

18:22.835 --> 18:24.170
YEAR, IF THE DISTRICT CAN COME

18:24.170 --> 18:26.605
UP WITH THE MONEY.

18:26.605 --> 18:29.141
>> I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT IS MY

18:29.141 --> 18:30.977
COMMITMENT, NOW THAT WE ARE

18:30.977 --> 18:32.845
SEEING THE PERFORMANCE THAT...

18:32.845 --> 18:35.548
THAT WE WILL IN FACT DEDICATE

18:35.548 --> 18:37.116
THE FUNDING FOR THIS IN ORDER TO

18:37.116 --> 18:38.684
GET THIS ACCOMPLISHED.

18:38.684 --> 18:40.419

18:40.419 --> 18:41.587
WE CAN KEEP THE STUDENTS HERE

18:41.587 --> 18:43.089
LONGER, WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE A

18:43.089 --> 18:44.523
DIFFERENCE.

18:44.523 --> 18:46.625
>> ALRIGHT, YA’LL LOOK FABULOUS.

18:49.195 --> 18:50.463
COMMITTED TO KEEPING THE EXTRA

18:50.463 --> 18:52.264

18:54.200 --> 18:55.868
KEEP THAT TIME-- WHETHER

18:55.868 --> 18:57.570
MANDATED TO, OR NOT.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.005
AND IT ISN’T LOST ON ANYONE THAT

18:59.005 --> 19:00.673

19:12.385 --> 19:14.020
EXTRA READING TIME HELP, AND

19:14.020 --> 19:15.821
WHAT ARE OTHER STATES DOING TO

19:15.821 --> 19:16.989
IMPROVE READING PROFICIENCY?

19:16.989 --> 19:18.624
EARLIER I SPOKE WITH PATTI

CENTER FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION IN

19:21.894 --> 19:23.462
WASHINGTON.

19:23.462 --> 19:25.264
WE ALWAYS HEAR ABOUT THIS THIRD

19:25.264 --> 19:26.132
GRADE THRESHOLD, THAT IT’S

19:26.132 --> 19:27.266
REALLY IMPORTANT TO TRY TO GET A

19:27.266 --> 19:28.434
KID UP TO GRADE LEVEL BY THIRD

19:28.434 --> 19:30.202
GRADE-- WHY?

19:30.202 --> 19:31.837
>> WELL, A LOT OF RESEARCH

19:31.837 --> 19:33.239
SUGGESTS THAT THIRD GRADE

19:33.239 --> 19:36.876
READING IS A THRESHOLD YEAR.

19:36.876 --> 19:40.813
SOME STUDIES SAY THAT THE

19:40.813 --> 19:43.349
LIKELIHOOD OF A THIRD GRADER WHO

19:43.349 --> 19:46.118
IS NOT READING ON GRADE LEVEL

19:46.118 --> 19:49.955
HAS A LIKELIHOOD OF DROPPING OUT

19:49.955 --> 19:51.824
THAT IS THREE OR FOUR TIMES

19:51.824 --> 19:53.793
GREATER THAN A CHILD WHO IS

19:53.793 --> 19:54.994
READING ON GRADE LEVEL.

19:54.994 --> 19:56.395
SO THERE’S A LOT AT STAKE.

>> Sreenivasan: SO IN ADDITION

19:57.430 --> 19:58.798
TO THE EXTRA HOUR OF READING

19:58.798 --> 20:00.499
TIME, WHAT ARE SOME OTHER STATES

20:00.499 --> 20:01.300
DOING?

20:01.300 --> 20:02.401
A WHAT ARE SOME DIFFERENT

20:02.401 --> 20:03.402
TECHNIQUES TO TRY TO GET KIDS UP

20:03.402 --> 20:06.672

20:08.007 --> 20:09.675
GRADE READING IS SO HIGH THAT WE

20:09.675 --> 20:12.211
HAVE-- OVER 30 STATES HAVE SOME

20:12.211 --> 20:15.381
KIND OF POLICY TO INTERVENE,

20:15.381 --> 20:17.483
IDENTIFY, AND MAKE SURE CHILDREN

20:17.483 --> 20:18.584
GET THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO BE

20:18.584 --> 20:20.386
ON GRADE LEVEL.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.021
THEY DO TAKE DIFFERENT FORMS.

20:22.021 --> 20:24.423
ABOUT 15 STATES REQUIRE THAT A

20:24.423 --> 20:26.392
THIRD GRADER WHO IS NOT READING

20:26.392 --> 20:29.862
ON GRADE LEVEL WILL BE RETAINED.

20:29.862 --> 20:30.963
NOW, THAT’S A RATHER

20:30.963 --> 20:32.331
CONTROVERSIAL POLICY, BECAUSE

20:32.331 --> 20:34.300
THERE’S OTHER RESEARCH THAT

20:34.300 --> 20:36.469
POINTS TO GRADE RETENTION AS A

20:36.469 --> 20:38.804
PREDICTOR OF LATER DROPPING OUT.

20:38.804 --> 20:40.906
BUT IN DOING SO, IN MAKING THAT

20:40.906 --> 20:42.842
POLICY, THOSE STATES ALSO PUT

20:42.842 --> 20:44.844
PRESSURE ON THE SYSTEM TO

20:44.844 --> 20:47.079
PROVIDE EARLY INTERVENTIONS,

20:47.079 --> 20:48.447
MAKE SURE THAT KIDS HAVE THE

20:48.447 --> 20:49.882
SUPPORT SO THAT THEY ARE ON

20:49.882 --> 20:51.250
GRADE LEVEL AND THEY ARE NOT

20:51.250 --> 20:52.751
RETAINED AND THEY CAN MOVE ON TO

20:52.751 --> 20:55.287
FOURTH GRADE WITH THEIR PEERS.

20:55.287 --> 20:56.956
OTHER STATES REQUIRE SUMMER

20:56.956 --> 20:58.791
SCHOOL.

20:58.791 --> 21:01.093
SOME STATES REQUIRE AFTER-HOURS

21:01.093 --> 21:02.728
INSTRUCTION, WHETHER AFTER

21:02.728 --> 21:04.930
SCHOOL OR ON SATURDAY FOR

21:04.930 --> 21:06.499
STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN

21:06.499 --> 21:08.868
IDENTIFIED AS READING.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.803
SOME HAVE AT-HOME READING

21:10.803 --> 21:12.438
PROGRAMS THAT THEY WORK WITH

21:12.438 --> 21:13.606
PARENTS WITH.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.274
SO THERE’S A RANGE OF

21:15.274 --> 21:17.076
INTERVENTIONS THAT STATES ARE

21:17.076 --> 21:19.178
TRYING TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR

21:19.178 --> 21:20.813
CHILDREN TO MAKE SURE THAT

21:20.813 --> 21:22.781
EVERYBODY IS ON TRACK, READING

21:22.781 --> 21:24.283
ON GRADE LEVEL, AND ABLE TO

21:24.283 --> 21:25.518
SUCCEED IN FOURTH GRADE AND

21:25.518 --> 21:26.652
BEYOND.

21:26.652 --> 21:27.920
>> Sreenivasan: SO INCREASING

21:27.920 --> 21:29.455
THE AMOUNT OF TIME SPEND READING

21:29.455 --> 21:32.091
DURING THE DAY, DOES THAT WORK?

21:32.091 --> 21:34.193
>> INTERESTING ABOUT TIME IS

21:34.193 --> 21:36.762
THAT, DOES IT WORK?

21:36.762 --> 21:37.763
WELL, I’LL GIVE IT A QUALIFIED

21:37.763 --> 21:39.398
YES.

21:39.398 --> 21:41.433
IT WORKS BUT IT DOES DEPEND ON

21:41.433 --> 21:42.801
HOW THAT TIME IS USED.

21:42.801 --> 21:44.403
SO IF YOU JUST MERELY INCREASE

21:44.403 --> 21:47.006
THE TIME DURING THE DAY AND DO

21:47.006 --> 21:48.507
NOTHING ELSE, YOU NEED TO KNOW

21:48.507 --> 21:50.009
HOW YOU’RE GOING TO FILL THAT.

21:50.009 --> 21:52.344
IS THAT FILLED WITH QUALITY

21:52.344 --> 21:53.379
INSTRUCTION?

21:53.379 --> 21:54.914
IS THAT STAFFED WITH QUALIFIED

21:54.914 --> 21:57.449
PEOPLE?

21:57.449 --> 21:59.185
AND SOMETHING ELSE I ALWAYS

21:59.185 --> 22:02.021
LIKE TO CAUTION PEOPLE ABOUT,

22:02.021 --> 22:03.088
WHEN YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT ADDING

22:03.088 --> 22:04.690
TIME TO THE SCHOOL DAY OF YOUNG

22:04.690 --> 22:07.660
CHILDREN, LITTLE KIDS GET TIRED.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.128
SO YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

22:09.128 --> 22:10.829
THEY’RE ALSO GETTING SOME RECESS

22:10.829 --> 22:12.097
DURING THE DAY, THAT THEY HAVE

22:12.097 --> 22:14.066
SNACKS AND THAT THEY’RE ENGAGED.

22:14.066 --> 22:15.467
WHEN ALL OF THOSE PIECES ARE IN

22:15.467 --> 22:17.670
PLACE WE HAVE SEEN IT DOES MAKE

22:17.670 --> 22:19.138
A DIFFERENCE.

22:19.138 --> 22:20.105
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ABOUT THE

22:20.105 --> 22:21.440
COST INVESTMENT?

22:21.440 --> 22:22.875
OBVIOUSLY, IT COSTS MORE MONEY

22:22.875 --> 22:24.476
AND WOULD THAT MONEY, SAY, BE

22:24.476 --> 22:26.245
BETTER SPENT HIRING MORE

22:26.245 --> 22:28.447
TEACHERS OR USED DIFFERENTLY?

22:28.447 --> 22:29.848
>> YOU’RE RIGHT TO POINT OUT IT

22:29.848 --> 22:31.317
IS VERY COSTLY BECAUSE IT DOES

22:31.317 --> 22:33.319
REQUIRE EXTRA STAFFING.

22:33.319 --> 22:35.487
IT REQUIRES MORE TIME THAT

22:35.487 --> 22:37.122
BUILDINGS ARE OPEN,

22:37.122 --> 22:38.324
TRANSPORTATION COSTS AND SO

22:38.324 --> 22:40.125
FORTH.

22:40.125 --> 22:41.927
SO ADDING TIME CAN BE ONE OF THE

22:41.927 --> 22:43.762
MOST EXPENSIVE INVESTMENTS THAT

22:43.762 --> 22:45.064
A STATE OR DISTRICT MAKES IN

22:45.064 --> 22:47.933
THEIR PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

22:47.933 --> 22:51.437
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO INVEST

22:51.437 --> 22:53.639
THAT MONEY, AS YOU POINT OUT.

22:53.639 --> 22:56.809
YOU KNOW, THE RESEARCH ON THE

22:56.809 --> 22:58.544
QUALITY OF TEACHERS AND

22:58.544 --> 22:59.945
INSTRUCTION IS VERY, VERY

22:59.945 --> 23:02.081
COMPELLING ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT

23:02.081 --> 23:04.149
CAN HAVE ON STUDENT LEARNING.

23:04.149 --> 23:06.385
INVESTMENTS IN THE LEADERSHIP,

23:06.385 --> 23:08.387
THE PRINCIPAL CAN MAKE A LOT OF

23:08.387 --> 23:09.888
DIFFERENCE, AND THE QUALITY OF

23:09.888 --> 23:11.257
THE CURRICULUM.

23:11.257 --> 23:12.491
ALL OF THESE PIECES ARE

23:12.491 --> 23:16.128
INGREDIENTS IN PROVIDING A

23:16.128 --> 23:18.697
PUBLIC EDUCATION THAT WILL MAKE

23:18.697 --> 23:20.866
SURE ALL STUDENTS ARE SUCCEEDING

23:20.866 --> 23:22.534
AND WILL THRIVE AFTER HIGH

23:22.534 --> 23:23.936
SCHOOL.

23:23.936 --> 23:25.771
HOW YOU INVEST THOSE, THERE’S NO

23:25.771 --> 23:28.140
MAGIC FORMULA.

23:28.140 --> 23:30.476
AND THAT’S ONE OF THE BENEFITS

23:30.476 --> 23:31.944
WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY.

23:31.944 --> 23:33.212
WE DON’T HAVE A SINGLE SYSTEM.

23:33.212 --> 23:35.047
WE HAVE 50 STATE SYSTEMS.

23:35.047 --> 23:36.582
WITHIN THAT WE HAVE 14,000

23:36.582 --> 23:38.150
SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

23:38.150 --> 23:40.586
AND SO ALL OF THEM-- AND EACH OF

23:40.586 --> 23:42.621
THEM-- CAN TAKE DIFFERENT

23:42.621 --> 23:45.391
APPROACHES TO THIS IN PUTTING

23:45.391 --> 23:46.759
THIS RECIPE TOGETHER.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.160
AND THEY DO.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.862
WHEN THEY DO THAT, AS

23:49.862 --> 23:51.764
RESEARCHERS, WE CAN LEARN WHAT

23:51.764 --> 23:52.798
IS WORKING BEST.

23:52.798 --> 23:54.433
WE CAN SHARE THAT INFORMATION

23:54.433 --> 23:57.069
AND LEARN FROM EACH OTHER.

23:57.069 --> 23:58.003
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,
