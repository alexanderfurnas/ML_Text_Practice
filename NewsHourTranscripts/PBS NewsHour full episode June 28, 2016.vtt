GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill.
Judy Woodruff is away.

00:07.608 --> 00:12.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: A
raucous meeting
of the European Union's
Parliament exposes

00:12.546 --> 00:17.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the deep divide created by the
United Kingdom's
decision to leave.

00:17.551 --> 00:22.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead this Tuesday: House
Republicans
conclude their two-year
investigation into

00:22.723 --> 00:27.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Benghazi attacks, but find
no new evidence
of wrongdoing by Hillary
Clinton.

00:27.928 --> 00:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we get rare access to a
controversial
correctional facility housing
sex offenders

00:33.166 --> 00:35.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
long after their sentences have
been served.

00:35.769 --> 00:38.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRAIG BOLTE, Juvenile Sex
Offender: Once the
doors close, you know really
quickly that

00:38.405 --> 00:40.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you are going to die here, and
that's your
only way out.

00:41.008 --> 00:47.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

(BREAK)

00:50.284 --> 01:01.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A terror attack in
Istanbul, Turkey,
this evening has killed at least
28 people

01:01.728 --> 01:07.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
at the main airport. The
regional governor
says as many as three suicide
bombers opened

01:07.134 --> 01:09.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fire, then blew themselves up.

01:09.603 --> 01:14.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Within minutes, amateur video
showed lines
of ambulances arriving and
police rushing

01:14.675 --> 01:19.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in. Many of the 60 wounded were
ferried to
a nearby hospital.

01:20.013 --> 01:24.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
European leaders convened today,
hoping to
calm the chaos over Britain's
vote to leave

01:24.618 --> 01:30.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the E.U. What they got was a
kind of verbal
victory lap by the backers of
Brexit.

01:31.024 --> 01:32.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Margaret Warner has our report.

01:32.893 --> 01:37.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NIGEL FARAGE, U.K. Independence
Party Leader:
When I came here 17 years ago
and I said that

01:37.597 --> 01:43.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wanted to lead a campaign to
get Britain
to leave the European Union, you
all laughed

01:44.004 --> 01:48.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at me. Well, I have to say,
you're not laughing
now, are you?

01:48.308 --> 01:53.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: It was a day of
high drama
at the E.U. Parliament in
Brussels. Nigel

01:53.547 --> 01:58.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Farage, a leader of the Brexit
movement, the
head of the U.K.'s Independence
Party and

01:58.952 --> 02:02.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a member of the E.U. Parliament,
taunted his
fellow lawmakers.

02:03.023 --> 02:09.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NIGEL FARAGE: You, as a
political project,
are in denial. You're in denial
that your

02:09.096 --> 02:16.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
currency is failing. You are in
denial -- well,
just -- well, just look at the
Mediterranean.

02:16.570 --> 02:22.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will make one prediction this
morning: The
United Kingdom will not be the
last member

02:22.275 --> 02:24.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
state to leave the European
Union.

02:24.444 --> 02:30.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Marine Le Pen,
the leader
of France's far-right National
Front, came

02:30.350 --> 02:32.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to Farage's defense.

02:32.219 --> 02:34.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARINE LE PEN, President,
National Front Party
(through translator): This is
perhaps the

02:34.221 --> 02:38.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most important historic event in
the continent
since the fall of the Berlin
Wall.

02:38.425 --> 02:42.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Meanwhile, the
timetable
for negotiating Britain's exit
dominated much

02:42.963 --> 02:48.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the day. The president of the
European
Commission urged London to
invoke Article

02:48.235 --> 02:51.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
50 of the E.U. treaty quickly to
start the
process.

02:51.571 --> 02:54.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER, President,
European Commission
(through translator): I would
like the United

02:54.941 --> 02:59.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kingdom to clarify its position,
not today
or tomorrow at 9:00 a.m., but
swiftly.

02:59.513 --> 03:04.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But British
Prime Minister
David Cameron said Britain won't
invoke Article

03:04.184 --> 03:10.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
50 and start negotiating the
exit until he
steps down this fall. But he
pressed his European

03:10.123 --> 03:12.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
counterparts today for the best
possible terms.

03:12.692 --> 03:16.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CAMERON, British Prime
Minister: I want
that process to be as
constructive as possible.

03:16.263 --> 03:21.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I hope the outcome can be as
constructive
as possible, because, of course,
while we

03:21.368 --> 03:25.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are leaving the European Union,
we must not
be turning our backs on Europe.

03:25.205 --> 03:29.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: In Berlin,
however, German
Chancellor Angela Merkel told
her Parliament

03:30.010 --> 03:32.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Britain cannot expect to
get everything
it wants.

03:33.013 --> 03:37.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA MERKEL, German Chancellor
(through
translator): We will make sure
that the negotiations

03:37.918 --> 03:43.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will not follow the principle of
cherry-picking.
There has to be and there will
be a clear

03:43.356 --> 03:47.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
distinction whether a country
wants to be
a part of the E.U. family or
not.

03:47.727 --> 03:52.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Back in London,
there was
more domestic political fallout.
Labor leader

03:52.532 --> 03:58.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeremy Corbyn, who opposed the
Brexit, lost
a nonbinding confidence vote
within his own

03:58.138 --> 04:03.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
party today. But he again
insisted again he
will not resign.

04:03.110 --> 04:07.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As for economic fallout, the
British treasury
chief, George Osborne, warned it
will take

04:07.881 --> 04:13.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tax hikes and spending cuts to
stabilize the
country's financial position.
And London's

04:13.186 --> 04:18.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mayor Sadiq Khan called for
giving the capital
greater autonomy to protect
itself against

04:18.892 --> 04:20.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
economic uncertainty.

04:20.060 --> 04:23.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

04:23.697 --> 04:29.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Back in this
country, the Justice
Department announced Volkswagen
will spend

04:29.136 --> 04:34.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
roughly $15 billion to settle an
emissions
cheating scandal. It includes
$10 billion

04:34.975 --> 04:42.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to buy back or repair 475,000
V.W. and Audi
vehicles. Another $2.7 billion
will go to

04:42.415 --> 04:48.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
offset excess pollution. And
officials said
$2 billion will fund research
into zero-emission

04:48.922 --> 04:50.690 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
vehicles.

04:50.724 --> 04:54.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SALLY YATES, U.S. Deputy
Attorney General:
Volkswagen turned over 500,000
American drivers

04:54.494 --> 05:00.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into unwitting accomplices in an
unprecedented
assault on our country's
environment. While

05:00.934 --> 05:06.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
this announcement is an
important step forward
in achieving justice for the
American people,

05:06.106 --> 05:09.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
let me be clear, it is by no
means the last
step.

05:09.843 --> 05:14.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Volkswagen still
faces billions
of dollars in potential fines
and penalties,

05:14.981 --> 05:17.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and possible criminal charges.

05:17.050 --> 05:22.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Efforts to push new Zika funding
through Congress
bogged down today. Senate
Democrats blocked

05:22.489 --> 05:27.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Republican bill containing
$1.1 million.
They objected to restrictions on
the use of

05:27.961 --> 05:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
birth control grants. Today's
outcome kills
any chance of action before the
Fourth of

05:32.699 --> 05:34.601 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
July recess.

05:34.634 --> 05:38.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the world's number one
golfer, Jason Day,
has withdrawn from the Summer
Olympics in

05:39.005 --> 05:44.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rio de Janeiro over the threat
of Zika. The
Australian star said he won't
risk infecting

05:44.344 --> 05:49.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his wife with the virus, which
can cause birth
defects. Day is the latest
high-profile athlete

05:50.016 --> 05:52.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to pass on the Summer Games.

05:52.852 --> 05:58.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And markets rebounded after a
two-day rout
caused by the Brexit vote. The
Dow Jones industrial

05:58.425 --> 06:07.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average gained 269 points to
close at 17409.
The Nasdaq rose 97 points, and
the S&amp;P 500

06:07.667 --> 06:09.436 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
added 35.

06:09.469 --> 06:14.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Republicans
release a two-year report on
Benghazi -- what

06:14.140 --> 06:20.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did it find?; a look at why
Great Britain's
Brexit vote divided generations;
how juvenile

06:20.313 --> 06:30.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sex offenders are getting locked
up decades
after their sentences end; and
much more.

06:30.357 --> 06:37.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sex offenders are getting locked
up decades
after their sentences end; and
much more.

06:37.264 --> 06:41.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After years of investigations,
interviews,
and hearings, the House special
committee

06:41.735 --> 06:47.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looking into the 2012 attack in
Benghazi,
Libya, released 800 pages of
findings today.

06:47.774 --> 06:52.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The assault, which resulted in
the deaths
of four Americans, including the
U.S. ambassador,

06:52.912 --> 06:58.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
slams the Obama administration
for lax security
and a sluggish response, but it
doesn't lay

06:58.285 --> 07:02.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
blame at then-Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton's
doorstep.

07:02.622 --> 07:07.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Congressman Trey
Gowdy, the panel's
chairman, said Clinton, now the
Democrats'

07:07.193 --> 07:10.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
presumptive presidential
nominee, was never
the focus on the inquiry.

07:10.797 --> 07:14.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. TREY GOWDY (R), South
Carolina: Speaker
Boehner asked me to find out
what happened

07:14.167 --> 07:18.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to four of our fellow citizens,
and I believe
that that is what I have done.

07:18.571 --> 07:22.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You are welcome to read that
report. I hope
you will. I know you will. If
you at the end

07:23.009 --> 07:27.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of reading that report can
conclude that it
is about one person, instead of
about four

07:27.647 --> 07:31.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people, I will be shocked. I
think the American
people ought to look at it. They
ought to

07:31.584 --> 07:35.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look at it because fellow
Americans died and
fellow Americans were injured
and fellow Americans

07:35.989 --> 07:41.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
went to heroic lengths to save
other Americans.
What conclusions they draw after
reading it

07:41.461 --> 07:43.296 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is up to them.

07:43.330 --> 07:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The White House, and
Clinton herself,
said the investigation was
always politically

07:46.700 --> 07:50.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
motivated. She weighed in during
a campaign
stop today in Denver.

07:50.503 --> 07:55.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
After more than two years and $7
million spent

07:55.041 --> 08:01.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the Benghazi committee out of
taxpayer
funds, it had to today report
that it had

08:01.948 --> 08:10.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
found nothing, nothing to
contradict the conclusions
of the independent
accountability board or

08:10.056 --> 08:14.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the conclusions of the prior
multiple earlier
investigations.

08:14.761 --> 08:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will leave it to others to
characterize
this report, but I think it's
pretty clear

08:20.133 --> 08:21.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it's time to move on.

08:21.935 --> 08:24.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Lisa Desjardins has
been reading
into the report and its
findings. She joins

08:24.938 --> 08:26.740 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me now.

08:26.773 --> 08:29.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether politically motivated or
not, Lisa,
what new did we learn, if
anything, from this

08:29.843 --> 08:31.644 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
report?

08:31.678 --> 08:35.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, this
report in all
800 pages has highlights of 22
new facts that

08:35.181 --> 08:36.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the committee says it learned.

08:36.983 --> 08:39.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you look through those
facts, there's
two kinds. I think the most
important ones

08:39.552 --> 08:44.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are about the failures in the
Defense Department
and in the intelligence
community that led

08:44.891 --> 08:49.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Benghazi and led to the
Americans there
not being protected, including
some as simple

08:49.662 --> 08:55.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as then-Secretary of Defense
Leon Panetta
ordering that three different
teams be deployed

08:55.769 --> 08:59.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the area, but yet those
orders weren't
conveyed for an hour-and-a-half,
and even

08:59.406 --> 09:01.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at that point, they weren't
followed.

09:01.241 --> 09:05.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think the most critical
part is about
the security sector here and
failures on that

09:05.845 --> 09:09.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
level. Now, the second group has
to deal with
how the Obama administration and
Secretary

09:09.649 --> 09:13.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton and all of that staff
reacted and
then how they dealt with
Congress later.

09:13.987 --> 09:18.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Eleven hours of
hearings, we remember,
before this committee as they
tried to get

09:18.324 --> 09:22.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the bottom of this, and yet
you would think
that, if Hillary Clinton would
speak to the

09:22.796 --> 09:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
committee for that long, that
this report
would at least be in part about
Hillary Clinton,

09:26.699 --> 09:27.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but it seems not to be.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: No.

09:29.602 --> 09:31.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I went through this report
carefully as
much as I could in the eight
hours I had today

09:31.938 --> 09:36.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after it came out. When you look
at it, Hillary
Clinton actually is not the
number one official

09:36.176 --> 09:40.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
named in it. That's actually
Susan Rice, who
was then the U.N. ambassador,
now national

09:40.980 --> 09:42.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
security adviser.

09:42.749 --> 09:46.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's because Susan
Rice had
the most forward amount of
statements claiming

09:46.986 --> 09:52.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Benghazi was, in fact, led
or caused
by protests, which later we know
the administration

09:52.625 --> 09:56.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had reason to believe was
untrue, but there
may have been miscommunication
or was it on

09:56.830 --> 09:59.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
purpose? This report doesn't
answer those
questions.

09:59.399 --> 10:02.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Republicans on
the committee
itself don't even seem to
necessarily agree.

10:03.002 --> 10:06.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have heard Kirk (sic) Gowdy
saying strenuously
this wasn't political, but there
are other

10:06.372 --> 10:07.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
members who disagree.

10:07.373 --> 10:09.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

10:09.275 --> 10:12.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think Democrats on the
committee certainly
say this was political and
politically constructed.

10:12.979 --> 10:18.985 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They say there were many
witnesses whose testimony
wasn't released because it
supported the administration

10:19.018 --> 10:21.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and particularly supported
Hillary Clinton.

10:21.421 --> 10:25.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, I think those who talk
about Benghazi,
the hashtag #Benghazi, people
might even not

10:25.658 --> 10:29.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know what really happened there,
are asking,
did Hillary Clinton know about
this attack?

10:29.629 --> 10:35.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Did she let it happen? Did she
cover it up?
This report doesn't indicate she
did any of

10:35.101 --> 10:36.936 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now, of course, I
just called
him Kirk Gowdy, and not Trey
Gowdy, so there's

10:38.905 --> 10:40.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a big difference there.

10:40.773 --> 10:43.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he's obviously the chairman
of the committee.
But there were Democrats who put
out their

10:43.209 --> 10:47.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
own report yesterday trying to
get ahead of
this, saying, what, no problem,
nothing to

10:48.014 --> 10:49.782 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
see here?

10:49.816 --> 10:51.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: They're saying
even more
than that. They're saying that
the Republicans

10:51.618 --> 10:56.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really constructed this. And
they're also
saying this was a waste of
taxpayer dollars.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know this was about a $7
million committee.

10:58.525 --> 11:03.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, for those who point to this
was a huge
failure of intelligence defense
in a sector

11:03.830 --> 11:08.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the world where we have
serious and growing
terrorist threats, they say it
was well worth

11:08.801 --> 11:12.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it. But you also look at this,
Gwen. Another
two-year investigation that we
know of in

11:12.839 --> 11:18.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
recent years, the 9/11
Commission, that lasted
two years, that was about $12
million. So

11:18.578 --> 11:20.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you can compare those side by
side.

11:20.413 --> 11:23.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You have been
covering politics
for a while. You know the way
these things

11:23.082 --> 11:28.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work. Was it really about the
findings in
this report or is it about the
fact that the

11:28.054 --> 11:30.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
word Benghazi itself has become
such a hot
button?

11:30.723 --> 11:32.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That completely
depends on
who you ask.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.460 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think, when
you heard Trey
Gowdy speaking, he is saying, I
really was

11:36.062 --> 11:39.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trying to get to the bottom of
this. I didn't
want this to become political.

11:39.766 --> 11:45.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then we heard from the House
majority
leader, who -- Mr. McCarthy, who
indicated

11:45.738 --> 11:51.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that it was successful because
it brought
out the e-mail server
information about Hillary

11:51.044 --> 11:54.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton. That's why we know she
had that private
e-mail server is because of
this. Kevin McCarthy

11:54.948 --> 11:58.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
indicated that was a win. That
led to his
downfall.

11:58.585 --> 12:03.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think what happened here
is, we actually
don't know a lot about who said,
did what,

12:03.623 --> 12:08.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who was to blame for what. But
because of
this investigation, we have seen
many political

12:08.561 --> 12:10.630 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
figures take significant hits.

12:10.663 --> 12:15.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And it's led to
other investigations,
as investigations in Washington
often do.

12:15.101 --> 12:16.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Sure.

12:16.235 --> 12:23.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Lisa Desjardins,
thank you very
much.

12:23.276 --> 12:29.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: My pleasure.

12:29.248 --> 12:33.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We return now to the
story of
Brexit, and a look at the
generational divisions

12:33.720 --> 12:36.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
among British voters in last
week's referendum.

12:36.689 --> 12:38.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan is in London.

12:38.925 --> 12:44.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Carshalton,
less than 15
miles from the center of London,
unlike their

12:44.797 --> 12:50.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
downtown neighbors, these South
London voters
decided it was best for Britain
to leave the

12:50.103 --> 12:53.506 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
European Union.

12:53.539 --> 12:58.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After Sunday services at All
Saints Anglican
Church comes Sunday tea, this
week with a

12:58.177 --> 13:00.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
spoonful of Brexit.

13:00.313 --> 13:03.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Wortley is happy that
the U.K. is
getting out of the E.U.

13:03.850 --> 13:07.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY WORTLEY, England: They
take our money,
they don't give it all back to
us, and what

13:07.220 --> 13:10.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they do give back to us, they
tell us what
we should spend it on.

13:10.390 --> 13:13.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
Forty-seven-year-old Tracey
Hall-Green works in financial
services, an

13:13.793 --> 13:19.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
area already hit by the Brexit.
But she says
that the E.U. was providing
diminishing returns.

13:19.365 --> 13:23.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACEY HALL-GREEN, England: More
and more
weak countries are joining.
Initially, there

13:23.569 --> 13:29.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were seven countries, so that
was fine, but
now there are 28. And there's
strong powers,

13:29.375 --> 13:33.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then there's a lot of other
ones which
are bankrupt, like Greece.

13:33.046 --> 13:35.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: As for the
current market
turmoil?

13:35.381 --> 13:40.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACEY HALL-GREEN: If there's a
blip, I'm
quite happy to take a bit of a
hit in the

13:40.820 --> 13:42.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interim for the good of the
country.

13:42.588 --> 13:45.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In nearby
Sutton, Martin
O'Leary was taking a smoke break
outside a

13:45.992 --> 13:47.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pub where he was watching a
soccer match.

13:48.027 --> 13:49.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And you voted which way?

13:49.395 --> 13:51.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN O'LEARY, England: I voted
to leave
the European market, yes.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How come?

13:53.299 --> 14:00.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN O'LEARY: First of all, I
think most
of it was mainly immigration,
but also it's

14:00.473 --> 14:09.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like the schooling system. It's
like my granddaughter
can't be guaranteed to go to a
school near

14:09.615 --> 14:15.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here. She's 4 or 5. It's just
overpopulating
our schools, our hospitals, and
everything.

14:15.722 --> 14:21.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We caught up
with Paul Scully,
who represents this bedroom
community in Parliament.

14:21.160 --> 14:25.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His family was getting ready for
brunch. We
sat down on his patio. And he
told us why

14:25.765 --> 14:29.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a majority his constituents
voted the way
they did.

14:29.035 --> 14:33.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why is it better for someone in
this neighborhood
if Britain is no longer part of
the E.U.?

14:33.706 --> 14:36.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SCULLY, European Parliament
Member: I
think there's three things.
There's the economy.

14:36.876 --> 14:41.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are opportunities around
the world,
whereas the European economy
isn't growing

14:41.481 --> 14:42.515 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at all.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: He also
mentioned immigration.

14:44.450 --> 14:48.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SCULLY: Where people can
come from Greece,
where youth unemployment is 50
percent, to

14:48.354 --> 14:54.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
London on the hope of a job,
whereas if you
have got a skilled worker,
skilled I.T. consultant

14:54.360 --> 14:59.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from India or you have got a
nurse from the
Philippines or from Australia,
they have got

14:59.332 --> 15:04.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to apply and go through a lot of
bureaucracy
to have the hope of coming here
to do a job

15:04.303 --> 15:05.972 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that we really want them to do.

15:06.005 --> 15:07.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, finally,
sovereignty.

15:07.907 --> 15:14.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SCULLY: They don't want an
unelected,
unaccountable bureaucrat in
Brussels, in Belgium,

15:14.280 --> 15:18.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talking -- telling us what we
should be doing
and creating regulations and
directives.

15:18.184 --> 15:23.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Bill Main-ian
and his friends
at the local U.K. Independence
Party, or UKIP,

15:23.723 --> 15:26.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaigned for nine months to
convince voters
to leave the E.U.

15:26.993 --> 15:32.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL MAIN-IAN, England: In a
word, sovereignty.
In a word, democracy. In a word,
destiny.

15:32.632 --> 15:36.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Bill wasn't
able to convince
his own children.

15:36.102 --> 15:39.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After your daughter came home
from the polls
and you figured out that she
didn't vote the

15:39.539 --> 15:41.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
same way you do, what was that
conversation
like?

15:41.741 --> 15:43.476 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

15:43.509 --> 15:46.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL MAIN-IAN: Look, once they
understood
the issues, they made it on the
other side,

15:46.345 --> 15:49.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I respect that. Wouldn't agree
with it, but
I would respect it.

15:49.982 --> 15:54.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It wasn't just
the Main-ian
household. Across the country,
there was a

15:54.086 --> 15:59.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
generational divide; younger
voters wanted
to remain, older voters wanted
to leave.

15:59.058 --> 16:01.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WOMAN: I'm really quite
terrified about the
whole thing.

16:01.527 --> 16:05.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Haley and her
husband, Dan,
who didn't want to give us their
last names,

16:05.598 --> 16:10.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are in their 20s and live in
London. Unlike
Haley's parents, they voted to
stay in the

16:10.903 --> 16:12.638 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
E.U.

16:12.672 --> 16:17.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I'm not really sure
what's going to
happen and that uncertainty is
really -- is

16:17.777 --> 16:19.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
really unsettling.

16:19.145 --> 16:23.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
Nineteen-year-old Phoebe
Jordan is also worried.

16:23.115 --> 16:33.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHOEBE JORDAN, England: In two
years, I will
be leaving university, which is
the same time

16:33.459 --> 16:34.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we will be leaving the E.U. And
I'm nervous
about jobs, working abroad. I
think it makes

16:34.527 --> 16:36.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

HARI SREENIVASAN: Swati Dhingra,
a professor
at the London School of
Economics, says the

fears of Jordan and her peers
are well-founded.

SWATI DHINGRA, London School of

The large, persistent negative
effects of

16:42.034 --> 16:47.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wages on young college graduates
if they enter
during a downturn, even 15 years
afterwards,

16:47.240 --> 16:51.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have 2.5 percent lower
income. So, in
that sense, these are persistent
effects which

16:51.777 --> 16:54.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
stay with the younger
population, and they
are the ones who are going to be
growing up

16:54.814 --> 16:56.549 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with that.

16:56.582 --> 16:58.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Quite a few of
the young
people say this is going to
jeopardize our

16:58.584 --> 17:00.386 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
futures.

17:00.419 --> 17:05.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL MAIN-IAN: Their future
actually I think
has been guaranteed because of
the patriotic

17:05.858 --> 17:11.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaigning that our side of the
debate has
been doing. They may not see it
now. Perhaps

17:11.631 --> 17:19.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in five, 10, 15 years' time,
they may recall
their position and may be
grateful.

HARI SREENIVASAN: Back at All
Saints Church,
Hillary Wortley says Britain's
young voters

17:24.277 --> 17:26.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have only themselves to blame
for the outcome.

17:26.245 --> 17:30.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY WORTLEY: A lot of the
young people
didn't vote and that's why
they're angry now.

17:30.116 --> 17:34.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My nephew didn't vote because he
thought he
could vote online, and when he
found out he

17:34.553 --> 17:37.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
couldn't, he couldn't be
bothered to move
down to the polling station.

17:37.556 --> 17:40.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The message

healing after division.

GWEN IFILL: Next: the difficult
question of
how to deal with people
convicted of sex crimes,

18:11.891 --> 18:17.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
specifically what to do with
young juvenile
offenders. Should they be locked
up indefinitely?

18:17.163 --> 18:22.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do they belong in facilities
designed for
some of society's worst adult
offenders?

18:22.301 --> 18:26.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
William Brangham traveled to
Minnesota for
this report, part of our Broken
Justice series.

18:26.906 --> 18:31.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This facility
in the rural
town of Moose Lake is where
Minnesota puts

18:31.644 --> 18:36.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the sex offenders it says are
too dangerous
to live on the outside.

18:36.449 --> 18:40.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Twenty-nine-year-old Craig Bolte
is one of
them. He's been locked up for
nearly half

18:40.619 --> 18:46.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his life. It started when he was
15, when
he pled guilty to sexually
assaulting a younger

18:46.192 --> 18:51.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
member of his family, and also
admitted to
sexual contact with another
minor. He says

18:51.764 --> 18:53.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these were very troubling years
for him.

18:53.532 --> 18:56.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRAIG BOLTE, Juvenile Sex
Offender: I was
sexually abused on numerous
occasions as a

18:56.235 --> 19:01.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
child when I was a young child,
and that is
by no means an excuse. I'm
responsible for

19:01.340 --> 19:03.209 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
my actions. I still hurt people.

19:03.242 --> 19:07.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Bolte was
originally sentenced
to three years, but he's now
been behind bars

19:07.313 --> 19:14.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here in Minnesota for 14, locked
up with hundreds
of rapists, child abusers, and
other sex offenders.

19:14.253 --> 19:18.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're all being kept by what's
known as
civil commitment law, which
allows a state

19:18.424 --> 19:23.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to deem someone an ongoing
threat and even
after their sentences are served
keep them

19:23.262 --> 19:25.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
locked up indefinitely.

19:25.097 --> 19:29.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRAIG BOLTE: I have been in for
about 10 years
now. All in all, I have been
locked up for

19:29.468 --> 19:31.437 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
14 years, 10 years of it here.

19:31.470 --> 19:38.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The "PBS
NewsHour" was granted
rare access to Minnesota's sex
offender program.

19:38.377 --> 19:43.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We could film interviews inside
this one room,
but, almost everywhere else, we
could only

19:43.149 --> 19:48.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take still photos. Most everyone
agrees that
there are people locked up in
Minnesota's

19:48.054 --> 19:52.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
program who are very likely to
reoffend. These
are people who say they simply
cannot control

19:52.758 --> 19:54.493 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their behavior.

19:54.527 --> 19:58.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that concern is why
legislatures in 20
states have set up programs like
this to hold

19:58.097 --> 20:03.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these people. But others say
these programs
also end up snaring juvenile
offenders who

20:03.269 --> 20:07.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they argue have no business
being held for
years past their sentences.

20:07.073 --> 20:11.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC JANUS, Mitchell Hamline
School of Law:
It's outrageous. That's one of
the more outrageous

20:11.343 --> 20:13.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
features of this program.

20:13.212 --> 20:16.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Eric Janus is
a law professor
and longtime critic of
Minnesota's sex offender

20:16.749 --> 20:22.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policies. He says juvenile sex
offenders are
almost never the kind of
lifetime sexual predator

20:22.855 --> 20:24.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that society needs to worry
about.

20:24.857 --> 20:30.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC JANUS: Probably a fairly
high percentage
of adolescent sexual offending
is basically

20:30.629 --> 20:36.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
due to immaturity and
experimentation, and
so it's not deviant sexuality.
It's not that

20:36.902 --> 20:45.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are attracted to violent
sex or involuntary
sex. It's that they are
immature, and that's

20:45.511 --> 20:47.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the kind of thing that they will
grow out
of.

ELIZABETH LETOURNEAU, Moore
Center for the
Prevention of Child Sexual
Abuse, John Hopkins

20:49.181 --> 20:51.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
University: Juvenile sexual
behavior, like
every other kind of behavior,
changes very

20:51.283 --> 20:53.152 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rapidly.

20:53.185 --> 20:55.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Elizabeth
Letourneau is
one of the nation's leading
experts on juvenile

20:55.521 --> 21:00.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sex offenders. She directs the
Moore Center
for the Prevention of Child
Sexual Abuse at

21:00.092 --> 21:02.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Hopkins University.

21:02.128 --> 21:07.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She says civilly committing
juvenile sex offenders
makes little sense, first
because it's incredibly

21:07.399 --> 21:13.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
costly. Minnesota spends about
$125,000 per
offender per year, which is
roughly triple

21:13.706 --> 21:18.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the cost of regular prison. But,
most importantly,
she says it doesn't make sense
because juvenile

21:18.944 --> 21:22.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
offenders are likely not
lifetime offenders.

21:22.081 --> 21:27.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH LETOURNEAU: Among
youth who are
adjudicated for a sexual
offense, so they

21:27.586 --> 21:33.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been arrested, processed,
97 percent
to 98 percent will not reoffend
sexually.

21:33.692 --> 21:36.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, truly, the vast majority...

21:36.195 --> 21:37.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Almost all of
them.

21:38.030 --> 21:41.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH LETOURNEAU: ... will
not -- almost
all youth, if they are caught
committing a

21:41.767 --> 21:43.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sexual offense, will not do it
again.

21:43.869 --> 21:47.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Emily Piper is
the commissioner
of Minnesota's Department of
Human Services,

21:48.007 --> 21:50.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which oversees the state's sex
offender program.

21:50.976 --> 21:56.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She says only 4 percent of
Minnesota's registered
sex offenders are currently
civilly committed,

21:56.482 --> 22:00.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and she argues the state is
rightly incarcerating
the most troubling of those.

22:00.619 --> 22:02.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMILY PIPER, Commissioner,
Minnesota Department
of Human Services: The sex
offenders in our

22:02.488 --> 22:09.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
program have some of the most
horrible criminal
histories and horrible crimes in
their past

22:09.295 --> 22:11.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of any sex offenders in our
state.

22:11.430 --> 22:15.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: However, there
are currently
67 men like Craig Bolte who have
been locked

22:15.734 --> 22:18.504 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up for crimes they committed as
juveniles.

22:18.537 --> 22:22.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many of these young men, dozens
of them, who
were put in for crimes they
committed when

22:22.274 --> 22:26.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they were juveniles, and now
they are in their
30s, and 40s and 50s, is this
the right place

22:26.912 --> 22:28.647 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for them?

22:28.681 --> 22:31.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMILY PIPER: You know, I would
say many of
the people that are committed as
juveniles

22:31.951 --> 22:36.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
don't have a lot of life
experience outside
of being confined.

22:36.655 --> 22:42.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so when we're working with
them, we need
to make sure that we're
appropriately and

22:42.861 --> 22:45.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
adequately reintegrating them
into our society.

22:45.397 --> 22:49.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's the
stated goal of
the program, to give mental
health treatment

22:49.235 --> 22:54.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the offenders, and release
those who are
deemed ready for life on the
outside.

22:54.540 --> 23:00.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in the last two decades, not
one person
has ever been fully released
back home. More

23:00.045 --> 23:06.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than 40 have died while in
commitment. The
oldest man here is 94. Several
are older than

23:06.318 --> 23:08.153 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
70.

23:08.187 --> 23:09.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRAIG BOLTE: Once the doors
close, you know
really quickly that you are
going to die here,

23:10.022 --> 23:11.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and that's your only way out.

23:11.590 --> 23:14.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Alfonso Rodriguez Jr. is
on death row.

23:14.260 --> 23:18.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The use of
civil commitment
took off in Minnesota as a
result of a particularly

23:18.864 --> 23:25.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
harrowing case. Alfonso
Rodriguez Jr. spent
23 years in prison for rape and
attempted

23:25.170 --> 23:29.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kidnapping. But six months after
getting out,
Rodriguez struck again,
kidnapping college

23:30.009 --> 23:31.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
student Dru Sjodin.

23:31.677 --> 23:33.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDA WALKER, Mother of Dru
Sjodin: This was
at her brother's wedding in
2002.

23:33.679 --> 23:36.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: LINDA WALKER
is Dru's mother.

23:36.181 --> 23:40.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDA WALKER: We're almost
positive that he
had her for three hours,
brutally raped and

23:40.886 --> 23:48.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tortured her, then walked her
down in a ravine,
and slit her throat and left her
to die.

23:48.060 --> 23:52.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Outraged that
someone like
Rodriguez had been set free,
Walker helped

23:52.197 --> 23:57.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
create the national sex offender
database,
where communities are notified
if former offenders

23:57.069 --> 23:58.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
move into their area.

23:58.971 --> 24:05.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And her advocacy in Minnesota
helped expand
that state's use of civil
commitment. In 2003,

24:05.344 --> 24:10.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
less than 200 men were civilly
committed in
the state, but in the wake of
Dru's rape and

24:10.182 --> 24:13.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
murder, that number has more
than tripled
to 725 today.

24:13.919 --> 24:20.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDA WALKER: I realized that we
needed more
tools in our chest to protect
our society

24:20.592 --> 24:26.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from those that choose to
violate and to rape
our women and children.

24:26.598 --> 24:30.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So you don't
think that
there is any rehabilitation for
this level

24:30.736 --> 24:31.303 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of criminal?

24:31.337 --> 24:32.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LINDA WALKER: I do not.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: There's
nothing that can
be done?

24:34.440 --> 24:36.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LINDA WALKER: I do not believe
there is, no.

24:36.675 --> 24:42.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I feel horrible for Dru
Sjodin's mother.
I sympathize with where she is
at and what's

24:42.348 --> 24:47.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happened to her daughter, but
Craig isn't
even close to Alfonso whoever
did what he

24:48.020 --> 24:48.654 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
did.

24:48.687 --> 24:49.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Rodriguez.

24:50.022 --> 24:51.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: He's -- it's a total
different animal,
in my opinion.

24:51.824 --> 24:57.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Craig Bolte's
mom, Michele,
is now one of his biggest
advocates, even

24:57.996 --> 25:02.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
though she and her husband were
the ones who
first turned their son into the
police years

25:02.134 --> 25:03.802 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ago.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Honestly, when I look
back, I feel
like I gave my child a life
sentence.

25:05.704 --> 25:09.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Michele was
just 14 when
she gave birth to Craig. She
says it was early

25:09.975 --> 25:14.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on, when Craig was a toddler,
that he was
first sexually abused by an
older family member

25:14.480 --> 25:16.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who lived with them.

25:16.315 --> 25:21.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: My family has a history
of sexual abuse.
I was abused. My brother was
abused. Now my

25:21.820 --> 25:23.622 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
son was abused.

25:23.655 --> 25:27.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: She says it's
that history
that led to Craig's childhood
abuse of other

25:27.092 --> 25:32.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kids, but she now believes her
29-year-old
son deserves a second chance to
live in society.

25:32.965 --> 25:39.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: You can't sentence a
child murderer
for life. But you can, in the
state of Minnesota,

25:39.204 --> 25:42.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sentence a child sex offender
for life. I
mean, it's just a total double
standard. It

25:42.808 --> 25:45.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
makes no sense, because you hide
behind that
it's treatment.

25:45.644 --> 25:49.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In 2011, a
class-action
lawsuit was brought against the
state by a

25:49.348 --> 25:54.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
group of offenders in
Minnesota's program,
including Craig Bolte, arguing
they were not

25:54.420 --> 25:58.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
getting any meaningful treatment
and were
instead being held indefinitely.

25:58.424 --> 26:03.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, last year, federal district
judge in
Saint Paul sided with them,
saying that Minnesota's

26:03.429 --> 26:08.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
sex offender program was
unconstitutional,
ruling -- quote -- "It's a
punitive system

26:08.600 --> 26:13.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that segregates and indefinitely
detains a
class of potentially dangerous
individuals

26:13.772 --> 26:16.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
without the safeguards of the
criminal justice
system."

26:16.875 --> 26:21.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The state has appealed the
decision, and a
ruling is expected this fall. In
the meantime,

26:21.246 --> 26:25.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state officials say they have
already started
making changes. Five offenders
have been moved

26:25.384 --> 26:30.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into less restrictive settings,
and new reviews
are being done of all offenders
to determine

26:30.422 --> 26:33.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who's a potential candidate for
release and
who isn't.

26:33.592 --> 26:40.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even Dru Sjodin's mother, Linda
Walker, admits
that maybe some juvenile cases
should be reexamined,

26:40.265 --> 26:45.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but she hopes that, in all its
reforms, Minnesota
will err on the side of caution
before releasing

26:45.971 --> 26:47.706 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
anyone.

26:47.739 --> 26:51.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDA WALKER: We're constantly
taking the
victims out of the equation
every time that

26:51.076 --> 26:56.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we sit and analyze these people,
and what
about their freedom? They don't
get it back.

26:56.849 --> 26:58.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dru is never going to get hers
back.

26:58.750 --> 27:02.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Craig Bolte
says he's a
changed man, and that he's
hopeful for the

27:02.855 --> 27:05.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first time that he might one day
get out.

27:05.791 --> 27:08.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a lot of people who will
hear what
you have to say, and that
they're simply not

27:08.794 --> 27:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to forgive what you did.
And so they
say, look, lock him up and throw
away the

27:14.833 --> 27:16.168 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
key.

27:16.201 --> 27:18.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is your response to that?
What do you
say to those people?

27:18.337 --> 27:22.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRAIG BOLTE: I say, let me prove
it. Let me
show you what kind of man I am
today. Let

27:22.174 --> 27:24.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me prove that I'm not the kid
that I was that
did those things.

27:24.743 --> 27:28.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In addition to
the changes
in Minnesota, Missouri and Texas
have also

27:28.981 --> 27:32.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
recently begun reviewing their
civil commitment
programs for sex offenders.

27:32.784 --> 27:36.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham
in Moose Lake, Minnesota.

27:36.555 --> 27:41.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We continue our
Broken Justice
series tomorrow, with a report
on educational

27:41.927 --> 27:56.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
options for young people inside
the juvenile
justice system.

27:56.742 --> 27:58.544 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Stay with us.

27:58.577 --> 28:02.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": how
one college
is closing the graduation gap
between first

28:02.748 --> 28:08.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
generation students and their
peers; celebrated
author Sherman Alexie writes his
first children's

28:08.720 --> 28:15.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
book using Native American
themes; and remembering
legendary basketball coach Pat
Summitt.

28:15.193 --> 28:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: As the Supreme Court
wraps up
an eventful term, a look back
with a lawyer

28:21.266 --> 28:27.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who has argued his share of
cases, retiring
Solicitor General Donald
Verrilli.

28:27.239 --> 28:31.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy sat down with him recently
on his final
day on the job, after the
court's ruling on

28:31.710 --> 28:37.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immigration and affirmative
action, but before
yesterday's landmark decision on
abortion

28:37.082 --> 28:37.716 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rights.

28:37.749 --> 28:39.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Here is that exit interview.

28:39.351 --> 28:42.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Don Verrilli,
thank you very
much for talking with us.

28:42.321 --> 28:43.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD VERRILLI, Solicitor
General of the
United States: Thank you, Judy.
It's great

28:43.589 --> 28:45.424 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be here.

28:45.457 --> 28:49.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So you have been
the solicitor
general for the past five years
for a Democratic

28:49.061 --> 28:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration arguing cases
before a majority
conservative Supreme Court. How
do you think

28:55.133 --> 28:56.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it's gone, on balance?

28:56.868 --> 28:59.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD VERRILLI: Well, on
balance, pretty
well. We have won some, we have
lost some,

28:59.404 --> 29:04.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but I think we have won most of
the big, important
cases, health care, marriage
equality.

29:04.543 --> 29:09.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think on most of the cases
that really matter
as an historical -- from an
historical perspective,

29:09.748 --> 29:11.617 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we have done pretty well.

29:11.650 --> 29:16.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So you would
argue the administration
has done better than the
conservative point

29:16.455 --> 29:18.290 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of view?

29:18.323 --> 29:21.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD VERRILLI: Well, I guess
what I would
say about that is that we
managed to persuade

29:21.093 --> 29:26.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a court, a majority of whose
members, before
Justice Scalia passed away, you
would say

29:26.431 --> 29:32.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are conservative, that we had
the right answer
on the law on the big cases.

29:32.504 --> 29:38.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, just last
week, the justices
handed down a decision on the
president's

29:38.677 --> 29:42.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
immigration plan, which you
argued.

29:42.547 --> 29:49.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's being seen as dealing a
pretty significant
blow to this president's legacy.
How do you

29:49.287 --> 29:53.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see what happens going forward
on immigration
after that decision?

29:53.659 --> 29:55.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD VERRILLI: Yes.

29:55.661 --> 30:01.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, about the decision itself,
you know, whether
one agrees with the position of
the administration

30:01.833 --> 30:06.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or whether one disagrees with
the position,
I think probably everybody would
agree that

30:06.738 --> 30:13.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it isn't ideal to have that
question left
in limbo with a 4-4 tie,
affirming a divided

30:13.645 --> 30:15.881 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
vote of a lower court.

30:15.914 --> 30:20.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think anybody thinks
that's an ideal
outcome here. And what that I
means, I think,

30:20.585 --> 30:25.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that the legal question
remains open for
the future about the president's
authority,

30:25.624 --> 30:30.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then the question as a
policy matter about
what we're going to do about the
significant

30:31.029 --> 30:35.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problem that the -- this policy
was trying
to address, what we're going to
do about that

30:35.801 --> 30:36.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
remains open for the future.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So many
unresolved questions.

30:38.770 --> 30:41.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD VERRILLI: Yes. I think
very little
was resolved by this.

30:41.306 --> 30:45.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we know there
was another
important ruling the court
handed down last

30:45.277 --> 30:48.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
week on affirmative action,
another case you
argued.

30:49.014 --> 30:55.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Were you surprised by Justice
Kennedy, the
majority opinion essentially in
favor of using

30:55.654 --> 30:58.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
race as some consideration in
college admissions?

30:58.890 --> 31:02.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD VERRILLI: Well, we were
very pleased
that the court, Justice
Kennedy's opinion

31:02.861 --> 31:06.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the court, accepted the
argument that
we put forward on behalf of the
United States

31:06.998 --> 31:10.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and accepted the argument that
the University
of Texas put forward.

31:11.002 --> 31:16.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think I was a little bit
surprised that
it was as definitive as a
victory as it was.

31:16.108 --> 31:20.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had thought there was some
chance that that
case might be sent back to the
lower courts

31:20.045 --> 31:22.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for more factual development,
but it was a
definitive victory.

31:22.848 --> 31:26.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It is said that
there is a
measure of independence for the
solicitor

31:26.718 --> 31:32.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
general, representing the
administration before
the Supreme Court, but I think
there are also

31:32.390 --> 31:39.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those who would argue that is
really not possible,
when the solicitor general is a
sub-Cabinet

31:39.698 --> 31:41.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
figure serving under a
president.

31:41.867 --> 31:45.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you see this question of
independence
or not for your job?

31:45.570 --> 31:51.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD VERRILLI: Well, you know,
the independence
is quite real, and I think every
solicitor

31:51.309 --> 31:56.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
general has had the benefit of
it, and I think
every president has respected
it.

31:56.047 --> 32:03.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This president has respected it
to an enormous
degree. I have very little
interaction with

32:03.655 --> 32:08.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the White House on the work of
the office.
I don't go over there and have
regular meetings.

32:08.527 --> 32:13.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't send them reports. They
let me make
the judgment about what I think
the best answer

32:13.999 --> 32:15.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is for the United States.

32:15.867 --> 32:20.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, there are a couple times
every year where
I think the right answer for the
United States,

32:20.438 --> 32:23.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the position we're going to take
is something
that might surprise them. And I
will call

32:23.675 --> 32:29.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the White House counsel and give
them a heads-up
at that point. But I do get a
significant

32:29.214 --> 32:30.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
degree of independence.

32:30.982 --> 32:35.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A different
question: How do
you see this question of whether
the Supreme

32:35.620 --> 32:41.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Court has become too
politicized? We know
there's a lot of comment about
that, a lot

32:41.626 --> 32:47.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of -- a number of people who say
it's just
-- it's gone too far, it's
affecting too many

32:47.666 --> 32:49.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cases.

32:49.034 --> 32:50.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this something the American
people should
be worried about?

32:50.502 --> 32:52.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD VERRILLI: You know, I
really don't
see it that way.

32:52.571 --> 32:59.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You do hear that critique a lot
of the court.
I don't see it that way, because
I think that

32:59.144 --> 33:04.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presidents pick justices because
of what they
expect from the justice's
judicial philosophy.

33:04.916 --> 33:07.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So maybe you can say it's
political in that
sense.

33:07.419 --> 33:11.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I really genuinely don't
think that the
justices are making political
judgments. I

33:11.523 --> 33:16.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
genuinely think they're making
the judgments
that their judicial philosophy
leads them

33:16.728 --> 33:22.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make. And it does sometimes
sort out, the
bottom line does sometimes sort
out on what

33:22.601 --> 33:24.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
looks like partisan terms.

33:24.502 --> 33:27.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know -- but I agree
with the chief
justice when he says it's not a
partisan process,

33:27.873 --> 33:31.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's not a political process,
just from my
observation over five years.

33:31.643 --> 33:38.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It just seems
particularly
evident right now with this
empty seat on

33:38.383 --> 33:41.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the court, with the death of
Justice Scalia
and the disagreement over who
should fill

33:42.020 --> 33:47.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that slot. We're seeing 4-4
decisions time
and again.

33:47.492 --> 33:49.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD VERRILLI: Sure.

33:49.294 --> 33:53.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, as I said about the
immigration decision,
whichever -- whatever you think
about the

33:53.265 --> 34:01.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration's policy here, a
4-4 resolution
of it is not an ideal thing.
Having that seat

34:01.606 --> 34:05.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
filled, I think this case
illustrates why
it's important.

34:05.844 --> 34:10.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What are the
important decisions
that you see the court likely
handing down

34:10.815 --> 34:13.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the next year or two that
have the most
effect on the American people?

34:13.852 --> 34:18.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD VERRILLI: So, the thing
that I see
continuing over time that the
court's been

34:18.590 --> 34:22.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
struggling with during my five
years in the
job and is going to continue to
struggle with

34:22.861 --> 34:31.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is the balance between
individual privacy
and the government's use of
technology in

34:31.603 --> 34:33.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
law enforcement and national
security.

34:33.505 --> 34:38.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You see this over and over
again. You know,
the advances in technology have
made our traditional

34:38.443 --> 34:43.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
notions of privacy and our legal
notions of
privacy almost obsolete. And
they really need

34:43.915 --> 34:49.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be refashioned to meet the
challenges that
government's use of technology
poses.

34:50.021 --> 34:53.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that clash has come up over
and over again
in the last five years, and I
think that's

34:54.025 --> 35:00.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to intensify over time. I
just think
it's going to be a significant
part of what

35:00.932 --> 35:04.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Supreme Court and the lower
federal courts
have got to grapple with in the
coming years.

35:04.703 --> 35:08.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's asking a lot
of these
justices to understand this new
technology,

35:08.473 --> 35:09.341 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
isn't it?

35:09.374 --> 35:11.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD VERRILLI: It's a huge
challenge.

35:11.242 --> 35:14.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they try to be very careful
and incremental
and prudent about it for
precisely that reason,

35:14.346 --> 35:19.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that I think they're feeling a
little bit
at sea, because they're not
experts on the

35:19.484 --> 35:23.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
technology. And so they do try
to be careful
about it, but it's a big
challenge.

35:23.888 --> 35:27.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The solicitor
general of the
United States for a few more
hours.

35:27.325 --> 35:28.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD VERRILLI: Right.

35:28.460 --> 35:29.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Don Verrilli,
thank you very
much.

35:29.394 --> 35:32.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD VERRILLI: Thank you.

35:32.931 --> 35:45.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Most colleges are
out for the
summer, but some students will
return in the

35:45.577 --> 35:50.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
fall facing a continuing
challenge: Can they
afford the cost to complete
their degree?

35:50.782 --> 35:55.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
April Brown takes us to Georgia,
where one
school is working to improve the
odds. It's

35:55.286 --> 35:58.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
part of our weekly education
series, Making
the Grade.

35:58.857 --> 36:02.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELICA SANCHEZ, Student:
Georgia State is
definitely a school that I fell
in love with

36:02.227 --> 36:04.329 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
even before I came to college.

36:04.362 --> 36:09.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: When Angelica
Sanchez was a high
school senior, she knew she was
going to college,

36:09.067 --> 36:12.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but she wasn't sure she'd ever
be able to
get to Georgia state.

36:12.070 --> 36:16.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELICA SANCHEZ: My parents
didn't go to
college, but my brother my
sister and I -- we

36:16.775 --> 36:18.510 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are first generation students.

36:18.543 --> 36:22.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Apart from finding
the funding,
Sanchez, like many other first
generation

36:22.213 --> 36:25.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
college-goers, needed help
navigating the
new world of higher education.

36:26.017 --> 36:31.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELICA SANCHEZ: I was actually
really worried,
just because my parents are very
traditional,

36:31.956 --> 36:34.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so they don't -- and they don't
really know
what college is.

36:34.192 --> 36:39.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: About 10 years ago,
the university
realized it had a persistent
achievement gap.

36:39.297 --> 36:44.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many of its low-income, minority
and first
generation students were
graduating less often

36:44.202 --> 36:48.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and dropping out more frequently
than their
white counterparts. That's when
the school

36:48.406 --> 36:50.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
started aggressively using data
to find solutions.

36:50.975 --> 36:53.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM RENICK, Vice Provost,
Georgia State University:
Our overall graduation rates
hovered around

36:54.012 --> 36:55.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
30 percent, far too low.

36:55.447 --> 36:58.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Tim Renick is vice
provost at
Georgia State.

36:58.450 --> 37:01.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM RENICK: We knew we had to
change, we knew
we had to serve students better,
but we also

37:01.953 --> 37:05.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
knew that we didn't have a lot
of resources.
What we did have is the data.

37:05.557 --> 37:10.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: They had a lot of
data, and began
analyzing it to figure out what
was tripping

37:10.295 --> 37:12.097 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up students.

37:12.130 --> 37:15.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM RENICK: We went back, we
looked at over
two-and-a-half million Georgia
State grades,

37:15.967 --> 37:20.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
140,000 student records. And
what we found
in the data were about 800
different things,

37:20.905 --> 37:27.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
800 things that, in a
statistically significant
way, correlated to students
flunking out or

37:27.445 --> 37:29.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dropping out of Georgia State.

37:29.214 --> 37:32.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Those 800 things,
from whether
students register for the right
classes to

37:32.317 --> 37:37.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their grades, are monitored for
every student
by academic advisers like Tony
Davis.

37:37.956 --> 37:39.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do we know that they're on
track?

37:39.724 --> 37:43.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY DAVIS, Georgia State
University: So,
what's happened is the
department -- so the

37:43.628 --> 37:49.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nursing department in this case
has identified
several key courses as marker
courses, so

37:49.634 --> 37:54.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they need to be taken within a
certain time
frame, and they're looking for a
minimum grade.

37:54.038 --> 37:57.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: The program also
tells Davis
whether a student is at high
risk.

37:57.509 --> 38:02.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY DAVIS: You can see with
this student
that she's missed several
markers. This is

38:02.614 --> 38:07.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a big red flag. Is the student
not passing
her courses? Is the student
withdrawing from

38:07.719 --> 38:11.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her courses, which usually
indicates a bigger
issue of some kind. That lets me
know I need

38:11.890 --> 38:13.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to reach out to this student.

38:13.591 --> 38:18.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would be just as easy as
clicking this,
messaging her, and voicing my
concern.

38:18.263 --> 38:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Data and other
research also
allowed Georgia State to figure
out that sometimes

38:22.534 --> 38:27.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just a few hundred dollars can
help students
stay in school or overcome other
barriers

38:27.172 --> 38:28.840 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to success.

38:28.873 --> 38:31.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TYLER MULVENNA, Student: It was
very difficult
to be able to pay for
everything.

38:31.543 --> 38:35.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Tyler Mulvenna is
one of the
recipients of the Panther
Retention Grant,

38:35.880 --> 38:40.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
named after the school mascot.
Tyler, who
is the first in his family to go
to college,

38:40.585 --> 38:46.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says the $900 he received
allowed him to focus
more on his classes after
struggling with

38:46.124 --> 38:49.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
school, a full-time job, an
internship, and
a long commute.

38:49.661 --> 38:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TYLER MULVENNA: I wouldn't be
living in Atlanta
now. I couldn't be working
40-hour weeks while

38:55.400 --> 39:00.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doing that and commuting at the
same time.
I think that I would have ran
myself ragged.

39:00.538 --> 39:05.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Georgia State spent
$3 million
last year on Panther Retention
Grants, and

39:05.443 --> 39:10.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is upping that to $4 million in
the next academic
year. The school estimates its
return on those

39:10.381 --> 39:15.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investments is more than 200
percent. But
it's the improved student
outcomes that has

39:15.820 --> 39:19.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
earned the school national
praise from President
Obama, among others.

39:19.357 --> 39:22.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
We're going to have to make sure
more students

39:22.694 --> 39:28.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
all the way across the
graduation stage. Georgia
State University, just to cite
one example,

39:28.099 --> 39:32.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is developing a new system to
give small grants
to students who might be a
little behind on

39:32.370 --> 39:34.205 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their bills.

39:34.239 --> 39:36.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: And educators
across the country
are taking a closer look at the
school's other

39:36.908 --> 39:41.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
targeted interventions that have
closed the
graduation gap between
low-income, minority

39:41.713 --> 39:44.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and first generation
college-goers and their
white peers.

39:44.616 --> 39:47.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW NICHOLS, The Education
Trust: They
have made a significant amount
of progress

39:47.452 --> 39:49.153 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a short amount of time.

39:49.187 --> 39:53.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Andrew Nichols is a
researcher
at the nonprofit Education
Trust. He says

39:53.324 --> 39:57.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the achievement and graduation
gaps are a
problem in colleges across the
country.

39:57.128 --> 40:01.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW NICHOLS: Nationally, the
graduation
rates for students who enroll at
four-year

40:01.199 --> 40:06.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
institutions is about 60
percent. The graduation
rates for low-income students at
those institutions

40:06.571 --> 40:11.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is about 50 percent. For
African-Americans,
it is about 40 percent, and for
Latinos, it

40:11.309 --> 40:13.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is about 55 percent.

40:13.211 --> 40:16.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Even though Georgia
State's deep
dive into data has garnered a
lot of attention,

40:16.648 --> 40:21.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nichols says many institutions
may not be
able to implement or afford such
a detailed

40:21.953 --> 40:26.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
system. But he does point out
that Georgia
State has also been very good at
scaling and

40:26.724 --> 40:30.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tweaking some more frequently
used tools to
improve student success.

40:30.295 --> 40:35.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW NICHOLS: They looked at
courses that
had high rates of withdrawal and
failure.

40:35.900 --> 40:40.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they identified these
courses and redesigned
their curriculum completely.
They were leveraging

40:40.905 --> 40:45.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a lot of more common
interventions, such as
summer bridge programs, using
supplemental

40:45.643 --> 40:47.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
instruction and freshman
learning communities.

40:47.912 --> 40:51.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Fortune Onwuzuruike
is now a
senior and president of the
student government

40:51.649 --> 40:56.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
association. But as an incoming
freshman,
he was very skeptical about
Georgia State's

40:56.354 --> 40:58.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
summer bridge program.

40:58.122 --> 41:00.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FORTUNE ONWUZURUIKE, Student: I
thought it
was a horrible idea, because
it's straight

41:00.158 --> 41:04.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
out of high school going
straight into college,
it's like, I didn't even get to
enjoy my summer.

APRIL BROWN: He quickly became a
convert.

41:06.531 --> 41:10.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FORTUNE ONWUZURUIKE: It really
is a head start.
You get seven additional credits
to your bachelor's

41:10.068 --> 41:12.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
degree, so you are already ahead
of -- in
front of the freshman class
that's coming

41:12.437 --> 41:16.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in. You also get to meet
different people,
get a head start in getting
involved on campus,

41:16.407 --> 41:18.209 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
knowing your way around campus.

41:18.242 --> 41:21.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Rising sophomore
Angelica Sanchez
says the program that really
helped her feel

41:21.446 --> 41:24.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
comfortable at Georgia State was
its freshman
learning community.

41:24.716 --> 41:29.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELICA SANCHEZ: It was really
amazing to
be able to be part of a program
that had familiar

41:29.887 --> 41:34.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
faces, just like high school
did, and the
people who are in all your
classes were the

41:34.859 --> 41:40.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
same people who had the same
interests as
you. So it was really easy to
find friends,

41:40.598 --> 41:43.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and it made you felt like you
belonged on
campus.

41:43.301 --> 41:47.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Sanchez is now very
confident
that, with the school's support,
she and thousands

41:47.939 --> 41:50.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of her peers will make it to
graduation.

41:50.708 --> 42:01.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

GWEN IFILL: Now we continue our
summer reading
series, as Jeffrey Brown looks
at how a writer

42:11.729 --> 42:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and an award-winning illustrator
are updating
the look of children's
literature.

42:16.033 --> 42:21.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In "Thunder Boy
Jr.," a young
Native American boy tells us
early on, "I

42:21.773 --> 42:26.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hate his name." Why? Well, he is
named after
his own father, and he wants his
own name,

42:26.944 --> 42:29.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his own identity.

42:29.147 --> 42:33.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Award-winning author Sherman
Alexie has written
numerous popular books for teens
and adults.

42:33.718 --> 42:39.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Thunder Boy Jr.," illustrated
by Yuyi Morales,
is Alexie's first picture book.

42:39.924 --> 42:44.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At BookExpo America in Chicago
recently, I
asked him why he wanted to write
it.

42:44.562 --> 42:47.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERMAN ALEXIE, Author, "Thunder
Boy Jr.":
Because I have two sons. And I
just kept thinking

42:47.064 --> 42:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about the way picture books
meant to them.

42:49.367 --> 42:54.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, their favorites were "Taxi
Dog" and
"Go Dog Go" and the hundreds,
the thousands

42:54.672 --> 42:58.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of times I read those books to
them, and how
important those picture books
were to my sons.

42:58.443 --> 43:00.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I thought, I want to try to
capture that.

43:00.244 --> 43:04.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. So, how did
you approach
it? What was different about
doing something

43:04.182 --> 43:05.983 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like this?

43:06.017 --> 43:09.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERMAN ALEXIE: Oh. Well, the
big thing is,
you spend -- probably you want
the book to

43:09.120 --> 43:13.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be about 70 percent for the kid
and about
30 percent for the adult reading
to the kid.

43:13.891 --> 43:15.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Because you have
the parent
in mind.

43:15.860 --> 43:17.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHERMAN ALEXIE: Exactly. You
have to.

43:17.195 --> 43:18.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. Thank you, I
guess all
parents are saying.

43:18.463 --> 43:20.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHERMAN ALEXIE: Yes. You have
to.

43:20.264 --> 43:24.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So -- and that balance is really
difficult,
finding that balance, where you
make the book

43:24.836 --> 43:27.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hold up to repeated readings for
the kid and
the adult.

43:27.905 --> 43:29.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, can you give
me an example?

43:29.774 --> 43:35.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERMAN ALEXIE: This book ended
up being -- I
tried to get the intellectual
idea in place

43:36.013 --> 43:39.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first. Like, what is this book
going to mean,
and how is that going to apply
to two different

43:39.884 --> 43:41.586 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
levels?

43:41.619 --> 43:44.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the thing that got to me was
the idea
of identity, especially in
relation to being

43:44.956 --> 43:49.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
named after your father. I'm
named after my
father. I'm Sherman Alexie Jr.
And he died

43:49.727 --> 43:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 2003. And at his funeral, the
coffin lowered
into the grave, and I was
staring at a tombstone

43:55.633 --> 43:56.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with my name on it.

43:56.801 --> 43:58.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Wow.

43:58.503 --> 44:03.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERMAN ALEXIE: And it had never
occurred
to me. The existential weight of
being named

44:03.274 --> 44:07.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after your father hit me in such
a way. And
I thought, I knew I would have
to write about

44:07.245 --> 44:09.013 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

44:09.046 --> 44:12.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, even though it
seems odd, it
ended up being that that moment
became the

44:12.850 --> 44:17.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
genesis of this picture book,
the idea of
the weight of being named after
your father

44:17.388 --> 44:21.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and what happens when you don't
want to be
named after him anymore. What
happens when

44:21.125 --> 44:25.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you want to turn away from his
legacy and
create your own, even when
you're 5 years

44:25.663 --> 44:26.631 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
old?

44:26.664 --> 44:28.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. And that's
what this is.

44:28.132 --> 44:33.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's a young boy, Thunder
Boy Jr., son
of Thunder Boy Sr., right?

44:33.437 --> 44:34.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHERMAN ALEXIE: Yes.

44:34.805 --> 44:37.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Saying, I want --
but I'm not
Thunder Boy, right?

44:37.408 --> 44:38.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHERMAN ALEXIE: Yes.

44:38.743 --> 44:40.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And trying to
figure out who
he is, in a sense.

44:40.144 --> 44:43.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHERMAN ALEXIE: This idea of the
kid in search
of his own identity.

44:43.147 --> 44:46.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a loving, supportive
Native American
family. And I thought that was
important to

44:46.951 --> 44:48.719 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
show as well.

44:48.753 --> 44:51.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And he goes
through all his
experiences and says, maybe I
should be named

44:51.222 --> 44:52.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this, maybe I should be named
that.

44:52.990 --> 44:57.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERMAN ALEXIE: Yes. And it's a
mix of, you
know, contemporary and tribally
influenced

44:57.828 --> 44:59.597 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
names.

44:59.630 --> 45:03.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, he's a grass dancer, so
maybe his name
should be Drum, Drums and More
Drums. But

45:03.501 --> 45:08.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he also loves going to garage
sales with his
mom, so he says, maybe my name
should be Old

45:08.239 --> 45:09.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Toys Are Awesome.

45:09.240 --> 45:11.008 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

45:11.042 --> 45:14.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERMAN ALEXIE: So he's a kid.
He's a Native
American kid. He's both at the
same time.

45:14.579 --> 45:18.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: How important is
that aspect
to it, of being a Native
American kid?

45:18.349 --> 45:23.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SHERMAN ALEXIE: Oh, it's
absolutely vital,
especially in this era where we
need diverse

45:23.254 --> 45:28.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
books. Children's books really
are not representing
the diversity of the United
States.

45:28.259 --> 45:32.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're just beginning to. So
the idea of
having a book where a
brown-skinned kid, not

45:32.663 --> 45:37.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just a Native American, most
especially a
Native American, because I am,
but any kid

45:37.735 --> 45:42.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's brown-skinned can look at
this character,
at Thunder Boy Jr., and his
family and see

45:42.173 --> 45:49.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his reflection, much in the same
way in 1969
when I first picked up Ezra Jack
Keats' picture

45:49.880 --> 45:51.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
book "The Snowy Day."

45:51.148 --> 45:53.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I was wondering
about that.
Of course, yes.

45:53.084 --> 45:55.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERMAN ALEXIE: Yes. That was
the only book
that existed for me where the
kid even remotely

45:55.286 --> 46:00.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
resembled me. It was an
African-American kid
wandering through the city after
a blizzard.

46:00.958 --> 46:08.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I so strongly identified
with his solitude,
his sense of adventure, his
wandering, and

46:08.366 --> 46:10.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I had never felt that with a
book before.

46:10.334 --> 46:15.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The absence that
you feel of
these kinds of books in our
culture, it's

46:15.840 --> 46:19.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interesting, because the growth
of books for
children, this huge number of
books.

46:19.977 --> 46:23.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SHERMAN ALEXIE: Oh, it's
exponential. It's
the largest rapidly growing
market.

46:23.547 --> 46:27.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. And yet you
still don't
see enough diversity?

46:27.151 --> 46:35.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERMAN ALEXIE: And I think, if
every giant
cultural system is like, you --
trying to

46:35.993 --> 46:39.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change direction is like trying
to change
a cruise ship's direction. And
we have just

46:39.964 --> 46:44.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
started that cultural process of
changing
the cruise ship called
publishing and called

46:44.368 --> 46:47.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
children's publishing to start
looking at
the diversity of the country.

46:47.972 --> 46:52.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can see it played out in all
sorts of ways
right now, the demographics of
voters, the

46:52.843 --> 47:00.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
demographics of each state. I
mean, the number
of brown kids in the country is
exponentially

47:00.484 --> 47:04.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
growing. So we need to address
these kids
culturally. We need to make them
feel like

47:04.722 --> 47:06.457 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they belong.

47:06.490 --> 47:08.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let me just ask
you in our
last minute here, the other
discussion in

47:08.426 --> 47:14.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the culture is, are kids -- is
anybody reading
anymore? And, you know, kids
seem to be reading,

47:14.465 --> 47:16.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but what happens to them after
that? What
do you see?

47:17.001 --> 47:20.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERMAN ALEXIE: Well, you know,
I was one
of the Chicken Littles about
e-books, very

47:20.705 --> 47:23.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
much so. I thought it spelled
doomed.

47:23.507 --> 47:29.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the thing is, e-books have
actually plateaued
and in some cases declined in
sales. So I

47:29.380 --> 47:34.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think -- I think e-books are
just going to
be another way to sell books.
And they're

47:34.218 --> 47:40.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not going to take over. I think
there's no
substitute for the tactile -- a
kid needs

47:40.257 --> 47:43.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this. A kid learns math by
crawling.

47:43.728 --> 47:51.569 align:left position:0%,start line:66.67% size:100%
The connection between the brain
and physical
activity is obvious and
well-studied and
well-researched.

47:51.602 --> 47:56.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the same thing with
books. The
connection between language --
the connection

47:56.474 --> 48:01.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between language and movement,
the connection
between language and all your
senses are vital.

48:01.245 --> 48:02.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And kids know that.

48:02.813 --> 48:06.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, the
book is "Thunder
Boy Jr. by Sherman Alexie Jr.?

48:06.584 --> 48:07.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHERMAN ALEXIE: Yes.

48:07.418 --> 48:08.252 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:08.285 --> 48:09.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, thanks
so much.

48:09.553 --> 48:11.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHERMAN ALEXIE: Thank you.

48:46.924 --> 48:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: She was famous for
her icy glare,
her toughness, and most of all
her will to

48:55.566 --> 48:57.334 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
win.

48:57.368 --> 49:02.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pat Summitt brought women's
basketball to
the national stage and took
Tennessee's Lady

49:02.072 --> 49:08.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Vols to eight national
championships. One
came in 1998, when Tennessee
went 39-and-0.

49:08.646 --> 49:12.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAT SUMMITT, University of
Tennessee Basketball
Coach: We were young, but we
were very athletic,

49:12.716 --> 49:18.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and very skilled, and I think
the one ingredient
that probably separated our team
night in

49:18.189 --> 49:20.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and night out was just our
competitiveness.

49:20.090 --> 49:26.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Pat Summitt was
always competitive,
a star player in college, and
head coach of

49:26.397 --> 49:30.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Lady Vols when she was just
22 years old.

49:30.467 --> 49:40.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over 38 years, Summitt racked up
1,098 wins,
the most by any Division I
college basketball

49:40.444 --> 49:47.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coach ever, male or female. She
never had
a losing season. She was still
at it in 2000,

49:47.852 --> 49:51.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when she was inducted into the
Naismith Basketball
Hall of Fame.

49:51.055 --> 49:58.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAT SUMMITT: I have always felt
a tremendous
responsibility as a coach and as
a teacher

49:58.929 --> 50:04.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to give to this game. I could
never give to
this game what this game has
given or meant

50:04.335 --> 50:06.170 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to me.

50:06.203 --> 50:11.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Then, in 2011,
Summitt announced
she had early-onset dementia.
Her son, Tyler,

50:11.542 --> 50:13.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
spoke to the "NewsHour."

50:13.477 --> 50:16.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TYLER SUMMITT, Son of Pat
Summitt: She wakes
up every day and thinks about
the relationships

50:16.513 --> 50:21.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that she has with those young
ladies, her
players. And she just loves
being around them

50:21.785 --> 50:27.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and making their lives better,
not only on
the court, but also off. And so
there's nothing

50:27.391 --> 50:29.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that could take that passion
away from her.

50:29.193 --> 50:33.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Summitt coached one
more season
and retired in 2012.

50:33.197 --> 50:36.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Pat Summitt is an
unparalleled figure
in collegiate sports.

50:36.934 --> 50:40.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That year, President
Obama awarded
her the Medal of Freedom.

50:40.905 --> 50:47.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, a makeshift memorial grew
at the University
of Tennessee in Knoxville, and
tributes rolled

50:47.544 --> 50:52.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in, starting with Summitt's
greatest rival,
University of Connecticut coach
Geno Auriemma.

50:52.650 --> 50:59.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GENO AURIEMMA, University of
Connecticut Basketball
Coach: When people talked about
women's basketball

50:59.089 --> 51:06.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in America, college women's
basketball in
America, it was Pat Summitt and
Tennessee.

51:06.130 --> 51:11.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In her 1998 book,
"Reach for the
Summit," she told of turning
down an opportunity

51:11.402 --> 51:18.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to coach the Tennessee men's
basketball team.
She asked, "Why is that a step
up?"

51:18.776 --> 51:22.212 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Summitt was 64 years old.

51:22.246 --> 51:31.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And updating our top
story tonight:
A senior Turkish official says
nearly 50 people

51:31.055 --> 51:36.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were killed in a suicide attack
on Istanbul's
main airport. The official says
up to four

51:36.694 --> 51:42.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
attackers took part. In
response, the Federal
Aviation Administration has
halted all flights

51:42.433 --> 51:45.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
between the U.S. and Istanbul.

51:45.169 --> 51:50.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tune in tune in later tonight on
"Frontline":
a provocative look inside the
Newark, New

51:50.207 --> 51:55.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jersey, Police Department, as it
tries to
implement reforms mandated by
the Justice

51:55.346 --> 52:02.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Department. In "Policing the
Police," Jelani
Cobb examines Newark's history
of police abuses,

52:02.052 --> 52:07.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its rocky relationship with the
community,
and efforts by its mayor to
bring about change.

On the "NewsHour" online right
now: Part-time
workers want the work full time,
right? Not

52:13.097 --> 52:19.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
always. On our Making Sense
page, one columnist
examines the trade-off for
parents who work.

52:19.303 --> 52:24.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm
Gwen Ifill.
