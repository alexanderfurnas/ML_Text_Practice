00:01.966 --> 00:04.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And from Georgia
to Washington's Pennsylvania
Avenue, the political stakes

00:04.766 --> 00:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are high this week, a
perfect time for Politics
Monday with Tamara Keith
of NPR and Amy Walter

00:11.466 --> 00:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of The Cook Political Report.

00:13.266 --> 00:14.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome to you both.

00:14.600 --> 00:16.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
A lot to talk about.

00:16.066 --> 00:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Amy, let's talk about that
6th District race in Georgia.

00:19.666 --> 00:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of people are saying
it is a referendum of a
sort on the president.

00:24.366 --> 00:26.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you see it?

00:26.433 --> 00:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Yes, we're going to
read a lot into one race and

00:28.766 --> 00:30.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
overinterpret one race.

00:30.866 --> 00:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, obviously, because of the
amount of money that's been
spent on it and the fact that

00:34.100 --> 00:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the national media has
descended on it, we don't
really have a choice.

00:37.033 --> 00:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there are going to
be a couple of narratives
that come out of this.

00:40.233 --> 00:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If Democrats are able to win
here on Tuesday, the message
being sent is not just one about

00:47.300 --> 00:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump, but it is saying that
in Republican districts, even
districts that went Republican

00:52.600 --> 00:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
slightly for Trump, are now
in danger for Republicans.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So this probably expands the
playing field for Democrats.

00:59.533 --> 01:04.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're going to now try to get
and try to involve themselves
in many more districts

01:04.166 --> 01:06.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that are traditionally
Republican.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If a Republican wins,
it says, you know what?

01:09.400 --> 01:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This anger among Democrats,
the enthusiasm among Democrats,
while it is playing a national

01:16.566 --> 01:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
role, it is not translating
into districts that still
have a slight Republican lean.

01:24.033 --> 01:25.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It means that Republican
voters haven't abandoned -
- not that they just didn't
abandon the president,

01:25.966 --> 01:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but they're not
abandoning congressional
Republicans at this point.

01:28.966 --> 01:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The only other person
that this is a referendum
on is Nancy Pelosi.

01:32.633 --> 01:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There have been more ads in
this district run against
Nancy Pelosi, Republican Karen

01:36.700 --> 01:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Handel, as well as other
groups, trying to make this
referendum from a liberal member

01:41.333 --> 01:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from San Francisco to paint
Jon Ossoff as out of touch
with the suburban district.

01:47.233 --> 01:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's running as a moderate.

01:48.466 --> 01:49.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: She pops
up, Nancy Pelosi...

01:49.933 --> 01:51.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: In a lot of ads.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In
a lot of races.

01:52.900 --> 01:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Tamara, what do you see
are the factors at play here?

01:55.400 --> 01:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Well, so the president
tweeted this morning in support

01:58.733 --> 02:00.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Karen Handel.

02:00.966 --> 02:04.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Then he did it again
this afternoon with a
series of tweets also
going after Jon Ossoff

02:04.066 --> 02:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for not living in the district,
which is a true thing.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jon Ossoff doesn't
live in the district.

02:09.633 --> 02:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Karen Handel is not running
away from President Trump.

02:13.433 --> 02:15.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He held a fund-raiser with her.

02:15.266 --> 02:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Her campaign tweeted out a
fund-raising e-mail today.

02:18.533 --> 02:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The headline on it was, did you
see what Trump just tweeted?

02:23.033 --> 02:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So she's not separating
herself from the president.

02:25.866 --> 02:29.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She is running with
President Trump.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so we will see what voters
in that district think of it.

02:33.600 --> 02:38.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a very narrow victory that
President Trump had in 2016
in that district, even though

02:39.800 --> 02:42.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it was designed to be
a safe Republican seat.

02:42.300 --> 02:45.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A lot
of interpreting going
to be going on tomorrow
night and into Wednesday

02:45.933 --> 02:47.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and maybe even later.

02:47.133 --> 02:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Oh, absolutely.

02:48.133 --> 02:49.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We love narratives.

02:49.133 --> 02:50.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Come on.

02:50.666 --> 02:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Political narratives, it's
what we live for, Judy.

02:51.633 --> 02:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have got to keep doing this.

02:52.833 --> 02:54.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

02:54.966 --> 02:57.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking
of narratives, what was your
take, Amy, on what Jay Sekulow

02:57.166 --> 03:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had to say, the president's
attorney we talked
to a few minutes ago?

03:00.533 --> 03:01.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

03:01.500 --> 03:03.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What we heard in his interview
with you that seemed to be a
little bit different from what

03:06.166 --> 03:10.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we heard over the weekend
was the acknowledgment
that, while Jay Sekulow
said over the weekend

03:12.633 --> 03:17.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the president's not
being investigated, what
he acknowledged with
you was, we don't know

03:17.100 --> 03:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for sure that he's not being --
to the best of our knowledge,
I think, was the term that

03:20.533 --> 03:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he used, the president is
not being investigated.

03:23.733 --> 03:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think, as an overall take
on where we're going on Russia,
I don't think we're moving

03:29.866 --> 03:31.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very far.

03:31.333 --> 03:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It feels like we're kind of just
running in place constantly.

03:34.066 --> 03:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know that the special counsel
is doing its investigation.

03:37.033 --> 03:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know that the Senate
is doing an investigation.

03:39.233 --> 03:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's unlikely that the Senate
is going to - - even the Senate
itself is going to be done

03:42.800 --> 03:47.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
by the end of the year,
nonetheless what Robert
Mueller, counsel, is
going to have by then.

03:47.300 --> 03:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you read
this based on your reporting at
the White House and elsewhere

03:51.033 --> 03:53.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this town?

03:53.133 --> 03:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, so, I have
been reporting on the legal
team that President Trump has

03:56.633 --> 04:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
assembled, which includes
Jay Sekulow, who he is really
the face and the voice of the

04:03.566 --> 04:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
legal team, but he is not
necessarily the person that will
be representing the president.

04:10.400 --> 04:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is the public face because
what he has actually specialized
in is religious freedom

04:15.866 --> 04:16.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cases.

04:16.800 --> 04:18.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's argued extensively...

04:18.000 --> 04:19.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Before
the Supreme Court.

04:19.166 --> 04:21.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: ... before
the Supreme Court.

04:21.166 --> 04:25.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Marc Kasowitz is another
attorney who is sort
of the lead attorney.

04:25.100 --> 04:29.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He doesn't have a
criminal law background.

04:29.166 --> 04:33.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He's basically Donald
Trump's attorney, and
had been for years.

04:33.833 --> 04:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he's someone that the
president listens to, and that
is why he's a key part of the

04:37.633 --> 04:40.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
team.

04:40.066 --> 04:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then they just
brought on another
lawyer who has Washington
experience and has some

04:44.800 --> 04:46.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
white-collar-type experience.

04:46.866 --> 04:50.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So the team is preparing
for the president to
be under investigation
by the special counsel

04:52.700 --> 04:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even if they aren't saying
that he is under investigation
by the special counsel, even

04:54.800 --> 04:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if they aren't saying that
he is under investigation
by the special counsel,

04:57.233 --> 04:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to turn
both of you - - there is so
much to talk about, but I want

04:59.733 --> 05:04.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to turn you now, Amy, to the --
what's going on in the Senate
and the Congress over health

05:04.366 --> 05:06.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
care reform.

05:06.366 --> 05:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know the House passed
a reform bill to basically
undo the Obamacare.

05:11.733 --> 05:13.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's been sitting in the
Senate week after week.

05:13.800 --> 05:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans are working behind
closed doors to try to come
up with a version that will

05:19.666 --> 05:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be more acceptable to them.

05:21.333 --> 05:25.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Democrats are now in
revolt, as much as they
can be in the minority.

05:26.566 --> 05:27.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where is that going?

05:27.500 --> 05:29.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

05:29.566 --> 05:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It sounds like what they want
to do is use a parliamentary
procedure to basically slow

05:32.300 --> 05:34.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
business in the
Senate to a crawl.

05:34.800 --> 05:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not that they can make much
change to the bill itself, but
they want to put a spotlight

05:38.533 --> 05:41.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the way that this bill is
being handled, just as you
pointed out, the fact that it's

05:41.966 --> 05:45.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being written behind doors, that
Democrats aren't part of the
process, that, quite frankly,

05:45.466 --> 05:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a whole bunch of Republican
senators have no idea
what's in the bill.

05:49.100 --> 05:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They also want to keep the
spotlight on the health care
bill because the House-passed

05:52.200 --> 05:54.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
one is so unpopular.

05:54.066 --> 05:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not even
particularly popular
among Republicans voters.

05:57.133 --> 06:01.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the more attention that
Democrats can put on that,
as well as the way that it's

06:01.800 --> 06:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being -- the bill itself,
as well as the way the
bill is being handled,
they think politically

06:07.400 --> 06:09.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is a winner.

06:09.500 --> 06:12.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, then, finally, they
are saying to their own
constituents, we are
trying to do something

06:12.466 --> 06:16.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about health care, but we're
not -- this is the only thing
that we can do, because we're

06:16.566 --> 06:18.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not in the majority.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The only thing we can
try to do is some of this
procedural maneuvering.

06:20.100 --> 06:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you
know about what's happening?

06:21.966 --> 06:24.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

06:24.000 --> 06:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: What I know about
what happening is that, in the
Senate, the votes that were

06:27.666 --> 06:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supposed to happen tonight
were actually pushed
off because of weather.

06:31.233 --> 06:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
However, Chuck Schumer went
to the floor of the Senate
and did a -- sort of began the

06:38.133 --> 06:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
process, tried to get unanimous
consent to demand that there
be a hearing on this bill.

06:43.433 --> 06:47.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the majority leader,
Mitch McConnell, said
he objected to that.

06:47.433 --> 06:50.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They went around and
around and around.

06:50.200 --> 06:53.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Democrats don't have a
lot that they can do.

06:53.033 --> 06:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is happening behind closed
doors, which means they can't
make an argument on substance

06:57.300 --> 07:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and policy, so they're making
an argument on procedure,
which is harder to make.

07:04.366 --> 07:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The majority
leader in the Senate, Mitch
McConnell, has said he wants

07:08.033 --> 07:10.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to get a vote on this
by the 1st of July.

07:10.033 --> 07:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's right.

07:12.100 --> 07:14.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They really, really want
to get this behind them,
move through this process.

07:14.066 --> 07:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Remember, they can't move ahead
on the things they also want
to move ahead on, like tax

07:17.833 --> 07:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reform, until this is done.

07:19.533 --> 07:22.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And this
has been held up for,
as we say, a long time.

07:22.833 --> 07:25.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: They wanted
to get it done in Easter
was the first deadline.

07:25.900 --> 07:27.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now, there's nothing
unusual about that.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It took Democrats a long time
to get Obamacare through.

07:29.566 --> 07:31.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They wanted to get
it through in 2009.

07:31.433 --> 07:34.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It took them until 2010
to finally pass it.

07:34.400 --> 07:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The bigger question is, what
does that bill look like and
then, if implemented, how do

07:40.566 --> 07:42.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Americans -- how does
it affect Americans?

07:42.100 --> 07:44.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Because this
is one-sixth of the economy.

07:44.766 --> 07:47.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is not small stuff.

07:47.233 --> 07:49.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There
will be a lot of reaction
as the Republican
Senate version emerges,

07:49.966 --> 07:50.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which it hasn't done yet.

07:50.966 --> 07:51.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Right.

07:51.966 --> 07:53.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

07:53.933 --> 07:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tamara
Keith, Amy Walter, Politics
Monday, thank you both.

07:54.866 --> 07:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

07:55.800 --> 07:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.
