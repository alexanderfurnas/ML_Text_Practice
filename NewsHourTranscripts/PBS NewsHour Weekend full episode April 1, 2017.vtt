POLICY MAKERS AND THE PUBLIC THE

19:25.564 --> 19:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

19:35.074 --> 19:36.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE COVER

19:36.142 --> 19:36.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE PIECE.

19:36.942 --> 19:38.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT RATTLES OFF SOME OF THESE

19:38.377 --> 19:39.178 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEVEN REASONS.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WORLD IS WARMING; NUMBER

19:40.713 --> 19:41.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TWO, IT'S BECAUSE OF US; AND

19:41.847 --> 19:42.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THREE, WE'RE SURE.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE ARE USUALLY THE TOPICS

19:44.216 --> 19:45.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT ARE THE MOST CHALLENGED BY

19:45.885 --> 19:48.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLIMATE-CHANGE SKEPTICS OR

19:48.621 --> 19:50.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DENIERS.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> PEOPLE ALMOST VIEW HOW THEY

19:51.524 --> 19:53.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIEW CLIMATE CHANGE AS PART OF

19:53.592 --> 19:54.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR IDENTITY.

19:54.727 --> 19:57.163 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WAY I THINK WE CAN PLAY A

19:57.163 --> 19:58.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROLE HERE IS HELP PEOPLE

19:58.397 --> 20:00.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDERSTAND BY PRESENTING STORIES

20:00.099 --> 20:02.101 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGH PICTURES, THROUGH

20:02.101 --> 20:03.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMAZING GRAPHICS, AND ALSO

20:03.903 --> 20:05.771 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISHING UP A HEALTHY DOSE OF THE

20:05.771 --> 20:07.106 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACTS, BUT DOING SO IN A WAY

20:07.106 --> 20:09.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WILL DRAW PEOPLE IN, RATHER

20:09.041 --> 20:09.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAN PUT THEM OFF.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE ICE IS MELTING FAST.

20:14.013 --> 20:15.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE HEARD SEVERAL DIFFERENT

20:15.181 --> 20:17.349 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STORIES JUST IN THE LAST FEW

20:17.349 --> 20:18.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MONTHS ABOUT ICE SHELVES

20:18.784 --> 20:20.219 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BREAKING OFF.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS?

20:21.921 --> 20:23.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, IT'S REALLY SIGNIFICANT

20:23.489 --> 20:24.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN TWO WAYS.

20:24.123 --> 20:25.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF YOU TOOK ALASKA AND

20:25.758 --> 20:28.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CALIFORNIA'S LAND MASS TOGETHER,

20:28.561 --> 20:30.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S HOW MUCH SEA ICE DIDN'T

20:30.429 --> 20:32.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORM THIS YEAR IN THE ARCTIC.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN WHAT-- AND SO THAT'S

20:34.066 --> 20:35.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE ASPECT OF THE STORY.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OTHER IS THE MELTING OF THE

20:36.836 --> 20:38.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ICE SHEETS AND THE GLACIERS IN

20:38.704 --> 20:41.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREENLAND AND IN THE ANTARCTIC

20:41.040 --> 20:42.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE MELTING OF THOSE IS WHAT

20:42.508 --> 20:44.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS CAUSING THE SEA LEVEL RISE

20:44.110 --> 20:44.877 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WE'RE ALREADY STARTING TO

20:44.877 --> 20:45.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

AROUND THE WORLD.

20:50.449 --> 20:51.250 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

20:51.250 --> 20:52.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS ABOUT HUGE

THAT ARE DEAD.

20:56.122 --> 20:57.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> EXACTLY.

20:57.289 --> 20:59.425 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE CORAL IS JUST ONE ASPECT

20:59.425 --> 21:00.559 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE

21:00.559 --> 21:02.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
