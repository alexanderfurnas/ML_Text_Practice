JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:07.641 --> 00:12.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl breaks his silence,

00:12.112 --> 00:17.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
telling the public radio podcast "Serial"
how he walked away from his Army post in Afghanistan.

00:17.751 --> 00:24.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead this Thursday: President
Obama signs an overhaul to No Child Left Behind

00:24.124 --> 00:29.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- how the landmark moment could change public
schools for the first time in more than a

00:29.563 --> 00:31.164 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
decade.

00:31.198 --> 00:36.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And how a Vermont ski resort
cashed in on a little known immigrant visa

00:36.069 --> 00:37.738 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
program.

00:37.771 --> 00:43.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Before the EB-5-funded renovation
and expansion began in 2008, this was a ski

00:43.310 --> 00:50.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
slope going downhill. It's now a year-round
resort attracting a million customers annually.

00:50.250 --> 00:53.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:53.654 --> 00:56.323 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:56.356 --> 01:10.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Geneva, Switzerland, went on
high alert today over new warnings of possible

01:10.504 --> 01:16.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
terrorist attacks. Officials said a search
was on for two to four suspects with possible

01:16.143 --> 01:21.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
links to the Islamic State group. It was unclear
if the alert was tied to last month's attacks

01:21.915 --> 01:23.717 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Paris.

01:23.750 --> 01:28.889 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Police stepped up screenings at border crossings,
and there was heavier security deployed outside

01:28.922 --> 01:32.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the U.N.'s European headquarters and other
sites.

01:32.225 --> 01:36.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The U.S. military is attempting
to explore expanding its ability to fight

01:36.697 --> 01:42.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Islamic State forces beyond Iraq and Syria.
The New York Times reports the Pentagon wants

01:42.202 --> 01:48.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to build up bases across East Africa, Southwest
Asia and the Middle East for special operations

01:48.575 --> 01:50.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and intelligence.

01:50.243 --> 01:54.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At the Pentagon today, Defense Secretary Ash
Carter said, that kind of network would help

01:54.815 --> 01:56.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cut down the militants' reach.

01:56.483 --> 02:01.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ASHTON CARTER, U.S. Defense Secretary: This
tumor is metastasizing or has metastasized.

02:01.121 --> 02:09.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the reality, the recognition of that,
behind the concept of linking together American

02:09.529 --> 02:14.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
counterterrorism and military nodes in the
region and around the world.

02:14.668 --> 02:18.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The plan is subject to presidential
approval.

02:18.338 --> 02:24.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Republican presidential candidate
Donald Trump has postponed a December visit

02:24.211 --> 02:30.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
had been singled out by many Israeli politicians

02:30.317 --> 02:35.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for inviting Trump, after the GOP front-runner
called for banning Muslims from entering the

02:35.989 --> 02:37.591 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
U.S.

02:37.624 --> 02:41.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, Trump tweeted that he's putting off
the trip because -- quote -- "I didn't want

02:41.561 --> 02:47.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to put Netanyahu under pressure." He said
he will reschedule after he becomes president.

02:47.734 --> 02:52.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Meanwhile, leaders of Arab states
in the Persian Gulf region condemned verbal

02:52.205 --> 02:58.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attacks on Muslims and Syrian refugees. Meeting
in Riyadh, the heads of state warned against

02:58.178 --> 03:04.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what they called hostile, racist and inhumane
rhetoric. None directly named name Donald

03:04.184 --> 03:05.819 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

03:05.852 --> 03:08.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in Washington, the Senate
has approved a short-term funding bill to

03:08.955 --> 03:13.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
keep the government operating through next
Wednesday. The House is expected to follow

03:13.894 --> 03:20.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
suit tomorrow. Negotiators still have to nail
down agreement on long-term tax and spending

03:20.200 --> 03:23.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
measures totaling more than a trillion dollars.

03:23.603 --> 03:28.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
House Speaker Paul Ryan said this morning
he remains optimistic about getting it done.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the House:
I think our members understand the situation

03:30.710 --> 03:35.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quite well. Look, we're not going to get everything
we want in negotiations. The Democrats aren't

03:35.515 --> 03:39.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to get everything they want in negotiations.
Not everybody gets what they want when you

03:39.453 --> 03:42.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
negotiate in divided government. But I think
we will complete this.

03:42.989 --> 03:48.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressional leaders aim to
complete the omnibus bills next week and adjourn

03:48.562 --> 03:50.163 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for the year.

03:50.197 --> 03:53.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Commercial truck and bus drivers
are going to have to start recording their

03:53.867 --> 03:59.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
driving hours electronically. A new federal
rule released today aims to keep tired drivers

03:59.906 --> 04:07.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
off the road. It requires devices that automatically
log engine hours and other data. Since 1938,

04:07.180 --> 04:11.985 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
operators have kept paper logs, but accident
investigators say those are easily doctored.

04:12.018 --> 04:17.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wall Street recouped some of
its recent losses today. The Dow Jones industrial

04:17.224 --> 04:25.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
average gained 82 points to close near 17575.
The Nasdaq rose 22 points, and the S&amp;P 500

04:25.999 --> 04:27.734 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
added four.

04:27.767 --> 04:33.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour": a first-hand
account from Bowe Bergdahl; a "Sophie's Choice"

04:33.507 --> 04:39.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for Yazidi refugees weighing the risk of a
journey to Europe; the end of No Child Left

04:39.646 --> 04:44.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Behind, and much more.

04:44.885 --> 04:57.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The controversy over the prisoner
exchange that freed Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl

04:57.831 --> 05:04.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from the Taliban last year reignited today,
as Afghanistan struggles to fight back against

05:04.171 --> 05:06.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the resurgent militant group.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We start with this report from chief foreign
affairs correspondent Margaret Warner.

05:09.709 --> 05:12.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BOWE BERGDAHL, U.S. Army Veteran: I had this
fantastic idea that I was going to prove to

05:12.312 --> 05:17.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the world that, you know, I was the real thing.

05:17.083 --> 05:21.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: It's the first time Bowe
Bergdahl's version of his experience has been

05:21.721 --> 05:27.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
heard publicly. The Army sergeant tells his
story in a new episode of the wildly popular

05:27.394 --> 05:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
podcast "Serial." He says he left his post
in Afghanistan without permission in June

05:33.466 --> 05:39.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
2009, hoping to raise concerns about leadership
his unit.

05:39.172 --> 05:49.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BOWE BERGDAHL: All I was seeing was basically
leadership failure, to the point that the

05:49.282 --> 05:51.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lives of the guys standing next to me were
literally, from what I could see, in danger.

05:51.751 --> 05:56.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But he was captured by Taliban
fighters and remained a prisoner until his

05:56.122 --> 05:57.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
release last May.

05:57.824 --> 06:01.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States:
This morning, I called Bob and Jani Bergdahl

06:01.261 --> 06:07.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and told them that, after nearly five years
in captivity, their son Bowe is coming home.

06:07.567 --> 06:12.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: In the Rose Garden, President
Obama announced he'd been freed, in exchange

06:12.305 --> 06:19.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for releasing five Taliban inmates at Guantanamo
Bay, who were sent to Qatar. The swap sparked

06:19.079 --> 06:25.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
criticism by Republican lawmakers, who blasted
its legality, some calling Bergdahl a deserter,

06:25.518 --> 06:30.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and by some of the soldiers who served with
Bergdahl, who also accused him of deserting.

06:30.357 --> 06:33.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SPC. CODY FULL (RET.), U.S. Army: Countless
people looked for him when he went missing,

06:33.660 --> 06:39.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
putting their own lives on the lives for his.
Combat is difficult. The only thing you can

06:39.099 --> 06:42.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
count on in combat is the commitment of your
fellow American. Knowing that someone you

06:42.836 --> 06:48.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
needed to trust deserted you in war and did
so on his own free will is the ultimate betrayal.

06:48.842 --> 06:53.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The president defended his
decision a few days after Bergdahl's release.

06:53.313 --> 07:01.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: We do not leave anybody wearing
the American uniform behind. We had a prisoner

07:01.488 --> 07:10.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of war whose health had deteriorated and we
were deeply concerned about, and we saw an

07:11.031 --> 07:14.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opportunity, and we seized it. And I make
no apologies for that.

07:14.167 --> 07:18.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: That wasn't the end of it.
Today, Republicans on the House Armed Services

07:18.071 --> 07:24.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Committee released a 98-page report, finding
the Taliban swap violated several laws, requiring

07:24.644 --> 07:29.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
30 days' notice to Congress, and that the
committee was misled about the extent and

07:29.983 --> 07:33.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
scope of efforts to arrange the transfer.

07:33.286 --> 07:37.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats called the report an unbalanced,
partisan, and needless attempt to justify

07:37.724 --> 07:43.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a predetermined position. Bergdahl was originally
charged with desertion and misbehavior before

07:43.563 --> 07:50.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the enemy, but the Army's investigating officer
recommended his case be treated as a misdemeanor.

07:50.503 --> 07:55.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bergdahl is now awaiting a decision on whether
he will be court-martialed.

07:55.275 --> 08:00.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As the case plays out, the Taliban are again
on the offensive. An attack on Kandahar Airport

08:00.680 --> 08:05.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this week killed 50 people. And, in September,
the militants seized the northern city of

08:05.719 --> 08:08.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Kunduz for three days.

08:08.154 --> 08:12.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Meanwhile, there's turmoil in Kabul, where
the head of Afghanistan's main intelligence

08:12.959 --> 08:18.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agency resigned today. He had opposed President
Ashraf Ghani's efforts to renew peace talks

08:18.398 --> 08:20.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with the Taliban.

08:20.066 --> 08:23.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now, for more on the continuing
debate surrounding Bowe Bergdahl, we get two

08:23.803 --> 08:27.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
views from members of the House Armed Services
Committee.

08:27.474 --> 08:31.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Representative Vicky Hartzler is a Republican
from Missouri. She's also the chairwomen of

08:31.478 --> 08:37.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations,
which co-authored the report we just reported

08:37.550 --> 08:42.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on. And Representative Loretta Sanchez is
a Democrat from California who also serves

08:42.288 --> 08:45.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on the Homeland Security Commission -- Committee.

08:45.425 --> 08:50.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Representative Hartzler, was Bowe Bergdahl
worth rescuing, in your opinion?

08:50.330 --> 08:54.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. VICKY HARTZLER (R), Missouri: Well, that's
not to be determined by our report.

08:54.734 --> 09:01.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What we were looking at is actually the circumstances
relating to his transfer, and if it endangered

09:01.207 --> 09:06.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Americans, and if the law was violated. And,
clearly, we determined that this administration

09:06.079 --> 09:10.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
violated the law which says they need to notify
Congress at least 30 days before any transfer

09:10.950 --> 09:12.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from Guantanamo Bay.

09:12.652 --> 09:18.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And in addition to that, we found much evidence
how this administration misled Congress at

09:18.158 --> 09:23.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
every step of the way. In fact, the Taliban
five notified they were going to be transferred

09:23.129 --> 09:27.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
two days before Congress was even notified.
And this is very, very concerning.

09:27.600 --> 09:33.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But it sounds like your conclusion
then is that the Taliban five were not a worthwhile

09:33.173 --> 09:35.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
exchange for this American soldier.

09:35.341 --> 09:39.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. VICKY HARTZLER: Well, what's more important
is whether this administration followed the

09:39.412 --> 09:41.047 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
law or not.

09:41.080 --> 09:45.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Certainly, as a representatives of the people,
we should know if the five most dangerous

09:45.251 --> 09:50.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Taliban leaders that we were holding should
be released and the circumstances of those

09:50.490 --> 09:54.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
released. And we're talking about the deputy
minister of defense, the deputy minister of

09:54.994 --> 09:58.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
intelligence, military commanders, friends
of Osama bin Laden.

09:58.832 --> 10:05.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These are five of the most dangerous individuals
that we had in Guantanamo Bay, and yet they

10:05.205 --> 10:11.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were released, going around Congress, without
us even being notified of the nature of their

10:11.511 --> 10:16.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
release, of if it posed a security threat
to our nation, and whether the country who

10:16.950 --> 10:22.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would be accepting them would be able to detain
them and keep them from reengaging in the

10:22.155 --> 10:23.723 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fight.

10:23.756 --> 10:27.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is a clear violation of the law.
And it's very concerning, because we know

10:27.494 --> 10:32.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
through media reports that at least three
of these individuals have tried to reengage

10:32.699 --> 10:39.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
again. And we have soldiers still in Afghanistan,
and we -- we fought hard to capture these

10:39.339 --> 10:45.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
individuals, to take them off the battlefield.
And now, potentially, they were being released

10:45.078 --> 10:47.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
without Congress being involved in that decision.

10:47.180 --> 10:50.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let me ask the same question then
of Representative Sanchez.

10:50.617 --> 10:54.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Given what we know the exchange -- nature
to have the exchange was, was Bowe Bergdahl

10:54.554 --> 10:56.256 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
worth rescuing?

10:56.289 --> 10:58.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. LORETTA SANCHEZ (D), California: Well,
I believe that there is one thing all Americans

10:58.791 --> 11:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can agree on, and that is we never leave a
man or a woman behind that is in uniform for

11:07.166 --> 11:08.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our armed forces.

11:08.835 --> 11:15.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think we can agree on that. So, the
president, in his role as commander in chief,

11:15.174 --> 11:23.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
did what many have done before, negotiated
to get our POW back. Now, we, as the Congress,

11:23.983 --> 11:31.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
passed a resolution a few months ago that
already said, hey, you didn't give us a 30-day

11:31.190 --> 11:32.825 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
notice.

11:32.859 --> 11:38.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I do not understand why we had to spend
precious resources that we have on our Armed

11:38.431 --> 11:46.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Services Committee to basically do what came
out, a political report, a politically-minded

11:46.406 --> 11:49.742 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
report, something with a predetermined end
to it.

11:49.776 --> 11:53.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But is it possible there is a
connection to be made between the circumstances

11:53.746 --> 11:58.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of that exchange and the unsettled state we
now find Afghanistan in?

11:58.051 --> 12:03.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. LORETTA SANCHEZ: Look, these -- actually,
these five that were released were not the

12:03.690 --> 12:08.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
worst of the worst. We -- and we didn't choose
these in.

12:08.328 --> 12:17.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And in the report, the Republicans indicated
that somehow we had chosen these because we

12:17.036 --> 12:24.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wanted to get them out of Gitmo. And the reality
is that we were negotiating for the life of

12:24.277 --> 12:26.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a fellow American. That's what the president
was doing.

12:26.913 --> 12:31.851 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, could he have talked to Congress in some
way? Well, the administration said, look,

12:31.884 --> 12:37.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this was so important to keep under wraps,
because his health was deteriorating, and

12:37.890 --> 12:41.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we were trying to get him out, and we didn't
know whether the deal was going to go, and

12:41.194 --> 12:42.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we were afraid that it was going to leak.

12:42.962 --> 12:50.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I believe that there could have been a way
for the president and his administration to

12:50.770 --> 12:55.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
talk to some of the ranking members of the
different committees of jurisdiction, those

12:56.009 --> 13:00.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that, you know, deal with this, but he chose
not to. And I think we have already passed

13:00.413 --> 13:02.281 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a resolution that said that.

13:02.315 --> 13:06.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let me ask Representative Hartzler
about the Guantanamo Bay connection that Representative

13:06.185 --> 13:13.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sanchez just raised, this idea that there
is a goal behind all of this, to be able to

13:13.159 --> 13:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
resettle Guantanamo Bay detainees elsewhere,
close the base down, close the detention facility

13:20.466 --> 13:21.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
down.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do you see a connection?

13:22.802 --> 13:25.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. VICKY HARTZLER: Well, I'm not sure about
that, but do I know that the president promised

13:25.338 --> 13:30.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in his campaign that he was going to release
people from Guantanamo Bay, that it was his

13:31.010 --> 13:34.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
goal to close it, and he has continued in
that path.

13:34.580 --> 13:41.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He -- his goal is to continue to close the
facility. And so here he -- he released five

13:41.521 --> 13:47.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
individuals, and we were not able to determine
if we in the negotiations ever authored one

13:47.293 --> 13:52.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for one or two for one. All of that information
was hidden from us, and it still is hidden

13:52.165 --> 13:55.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from us. They refuse to give us that information.

13:55.268 --> 13:59.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It took over a year-and-a-half to carry out
this investigation, primarily because the

13:59.972 --> 14:05.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
administration continued to stonewall in providing
us with e-mails and documentation. When we

14:05.044 --> 14:08.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
did get the documentations, they were redacted
out.

14:08.681 --> 14:13.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was very difficult to determine what we
have determined. But it is clear -- and I

14:13.186 --> 14:18.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think the American people once they read this
report will be as concerned as I am -- that

14:18.191 --> 14:24.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the president violated the law. Plus, he misled
Congress over and over again, even to the

14:24.230 --> 14:29.268 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
extent that Secretary Hagel came over to the
Armed Services Committee and denied that they

14:29.302 --> 14:32.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were negotiating with the Taliban, when, in
fact, we know that he was.

14:32.772 --> 14:35.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let me let Representative Sanchez
respond to that.

14:35.208 --> 14:39.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do we know and what don't we at this
stage, in your opinion, about this whole episode?

14:39.712 --> 14:44.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. LORETTA SANCHEZ: Well, what I do know
is that what a shame that we spent a year-and-a-half

14:44.250 --> 14:53.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of resources and time on a report that was
in essence pre-written, being, yes, the Democrats

14:53.359 --> 14:58.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the task force for this did sit in the
interviews, they did sit in the hearings,

14:59.031 --> 15:06.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but they received the first draft of the report,
and they had no input into it, right before

15:06.873 --> 15:08.508 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thanksgiving.

15:08.541 --> 15:14.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then they received it yesterday, the final
draft of the report, with -- yesterday at

15:14.747 --> 15:21.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
11:00 a.m. in the morning, and then it was
released today. So, we have what we call a

15:21.721 --> 15:28.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
minority report, the Democrats' side of what
we think is wrong with the report. And, again,

15:28.194 --> 15:33.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we believe that it was politically motivated,
that it's a pre-written report, if you will,

15:33.633 --> 15:40.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that it doesn't talk about the real issues
that we might raise, that it makes a lot of

15:40.573 --> 15:45.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
assumptions that are just not true, and that
it goes after the president unnecessarily.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.246 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

15:47.280 --> 15:49.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Representative Sanchez, why we
have you, I want to ask you about one other

15:49.949 --> 15:54.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
report that we see today, reported that you
said on "Larry King" in the context of the

15:54.954 --> 15:58.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whole conversation that we have been having
this week about Muslims in America and whether

15:58.624 --> 16:02.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they should be here or not, and what their
role is in terrorism, you're quoted as saying,

16:02.862 --> 16:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"It can be anywhere from 5 and 20 percent,
from the people that I speak to, that Islam

16:07.567 --> 16:11.504 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is their religion and also have a desire for
a caliphate, and to institute that in any

16:11.537 --> 16:13.206 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
way possible."

16:13.239 --> 16:16.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you linked that to terrorism. Where do
you get that number, 5 to 20 percent of Muslims

16:16.409 --> 16:18.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
interested in caliphate?

16:18.077 --> 16:22.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. LORETTA SANCHEZ: Well, actually, it's
in a book that I read published by the Harvard

16:22.748 --> 16:24.350 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Press.

16:24.383 --> 16:31.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But think about this. What I'm talking is
about Muslims around the world. And I think

16:31.290 --> 16:36.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that that is a high number. And if you see
the rest of the interview that I have, I say

16:36.362 --> 16:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that. I think that's a very big number, between
5 and 20 percent of Muslims who have this

16:41.167 --> 16:43.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
idea to build a caliphate.

16:43.369 --> 16:50.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, yes, a few Muslims are willing to use
violence. We see it, whether it's in Afghanistan,

16:50.877 --> 16:59.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whether it's ISIS, whether it's in Iraq, whether
it's in the Philippines, in other areas around

16:59.051 --> 17:04.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the world, with this whole idea of pushing
forward their idea -- their ideas.

17:04.724 --> 17:06.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: OK. We will...

17:06.359 --> 17:09.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. LORETTA SANCHEZ: So, I think we need
to take that into context and say, you know,

17:09.295 --> 17:14.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how is this that we will fight these terrorists,
these extremists?

17:14.867 --> 17:16.569 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: OK.

17:16.602 --> 17:20.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Representative Loretta Sanchez of California,
Representative Vicky Hartzler of Missouri,

17:20.907 --> 17:22.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you both very much.

17:22.875 --> 17:27.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REP. LORETTA SANCHEZ: Thank you.

17:27.914 --> 17:32.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REP. VICKY HARTZLER: Thank you.

17:32.919 --> 17:39.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The plight of the Yazidi religious
sect in Iraq was a major factor in pushing

17:39.458 --> 17:44.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the United States to war against the Islamic
State group last year.

17:44.196 --> 17:49.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Last month, their homeland in and around Sinjar,
Iraq, was liberated, but thousands have no

17:49.802 --> 17:51.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
intention of staying.

17:51.904 --> 17:57.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Special correspondent Jane Arraf brings us
the story of some trying to leave for Europe.

17:57.376 --> 18:03.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JANE ARRAF: Amira Khan and her family are
planning to leave any day to be smuggled across

18:03.249 --> 18:10.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the border to Turkey. Going by boat from Turkey
to Greece is the cheapest way to get to Europe.

18:10.756 --> 18:15.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's afraid her two sons, Madares (ph) and
Nunber (ph), could drown, as so many have

18:15.828 --> 18:23.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trying to reach Europe's shores. Tens of thousands
have risked that dangerous passage this year,

18:23.402 --> 18:31.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
arriving on islands like Lesbos. It's a perilous
journey, made even more so by winter coming.

18:31.110 --> 18:36.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But many Yazidis are even more afraid of going
to back to Sinjar, where ISIS captured or

18:36.082 --> 18:42.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
killed so many of them when they took over
their villages in the summer of 2014. ISIS

18:42.688 --> 18:47.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
considers Yazidis infidels and vowed to either
convert or kill them all.

18:47.660 --> 18:50.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Amira says she faints when she even thinks
of ISIS.

18:50.930 --> 18:56.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMIRA KHAN, Iraq (through translator): It's
dangerous, but what can I say? I have to take

18:56.502 --> 19:01.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
my family and my kids. That's the way to get
out. We're not going to return to Sinjar.

19:01.607 --> 19:06.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's dangerous either to stay or to leave.
We might not survive, but we have to try.

19:06.545 --> 19:12.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JANE ARRAF: A backlash in Europe against refugees
was already building as their numbers swelled.

19:12.651 --> 19:18.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, after the attacks in Paris, Europe's
open doors are suddenly closing.

19:18.491 --> 19:23.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tighter border controls have made it much
more difficult to get to Western Europe. But

19:23.329 --> 19:29.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thousands are still trying. For just over
$2,000 each, Amira's family will be smuggled

19:29.835 --> 19:33.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Europe for what they hope will be a new
start.

19:33.773 --> 19:38.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Her husband, Muhsin, will be one of his first
five brothers to go, but not the last.

19:38.577 --> 19:42.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MUHSIN, Iraq (through translator): My brothers
collected all the money they have and gave

19:42.782 --> 19:46.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it to me, so I can make the journey. All the
brothers have given me their money, and once

19:47.019 --> 19:48.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I get there, I can help them.

19:48.687 --> 19:52.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JANE ARRAF: Their village is still under ISIS
control. They say almost everything there

19:52.691 --> 19:58.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has been destroyed by the fighting. The Yazidis
lived peacefully with their Muslim Arab neighbors

19:58.397 --> 20:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in Iraq for years, but that's all over.

20:01.133 --> 20:05.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MUHSIN (through translator): A lot of people
have died and people have drowned at sea.

20:05.337 --> 20:09.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's still better than going back to living
among the Arabs. It's either leave or face

20:09.375 --> 20:10.976 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
death here.

20:11.010 --> 20:15.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JANE ARRAF: Many accuse their Arab neighbors
of joining ISIS and killing their people,

20:15.047 --> 20:20.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inflaming their women, and stealing their
homes. Some want to stay and avenge what was

20:20.719 --> 20:22.354 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
done to them.

20:22.388 --> 20:25.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN (through translator): As long as we can
breathe, as long as we have a drop of blood

20:25.524 --> 20:30.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
left in us, no matter how far away they run,
we will chase them. We're not going to abandon

20:30.563 --> 20:32.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our land or our mountain.

20:32.198 --> 20:37.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JANE ARRAF: Instead of a temporary refuge
while they wait to return home, for many,

20:37.803 --> 20:43.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this former construction site has become a
way station on the journey to Europe.

20:43.275 --> 20:48.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Almost everyone here is from Sinjar. They
have turned this empty field into essentially

20:48.214 --> 20:53.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a village. But even though U.S. airstrikes
and Kurdish forces have retaken their own

20:53.886 --> 20:59.825 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
towns and villages on Sinjar Mountain, almost
no one here plans to go home again.

20:59.859 --> 21:04.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A lot of the younger people are trying to
raise enough money to leave. They say, if

21:04.130 --> 21:10.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they had the money, almost everyone would
be gone by now. Hassan, as he wants us to

21:10.069 --> 21:15.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
call him, is one of the smugglers getting
people to Europe.

21:15.441 --> 21:20.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Over the past two years, he says he's delivered
more than 1,000 Yazidis and Kurds to Turkey,

21:21.013 --> 21:26.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where his connections get them to Greece or
Eastern Europe. There is no lack of business,

21:26.085 --> 21:29.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but it's gotten a little bit harder for smugglers.

21:29.688 --> 21:35.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HASSAN, Smuggler (through translator): The
prices right now in the last four or five

21:35.194 --> 21:39.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
months are the cheapest than any other time.
Previously, the price was $12,500 per person

21:40.032 --> 21:45.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and you had to walk part of the way. But now,
until we hand you over to a (INAUDIBLE) organization,

21:45.437 --> 21:49.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's $4,000. Until they seal off the borders
for everyone, people will just go.

21:49.742 --> 21:56.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JANE ARRAF: He says he never smuggles anyone
he doesn't know, and he doesn't smuggle Arabs.

21:56.382 --> 22:02.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At one of the biggest bus companies in Dohuk,
two buses a day take passengers straight to

22:02.621 --> 22:10.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Istanbul. Seventy dollars and a passport will
get you a seat. For many, it's a one-way trip.

22:10.963 --> 22:16.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rizgar is 18 and traveling with his brother.
His brother will stay in Turkey and pay the

22:16.202 --> 22:21.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
smugglers the $8,000 they agreed on once Rizgar
arrives in Austria.

22:21.640 --> 22:26.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Another brother, now an Austrian citizen,
is waiting for him there.

22:26.745 --> 22:31.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RIZGAR, Iraq (through translator): I want
to build a future for myself. I can see myself

22:31.951 --> 22:36.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
learning their language. It's a very beautiful
thing for people to learn different languages

22:36.121 --> 22:41.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and to go to school. I want to get an education,
because it wasn't good here. ISIS came, and

22:41.160 --> 22:42.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we couldn't cope.

22:42.761 --> 22:49.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JANE ARRAF: The bus pulled up to the start
of their 22-hour trip to Istanbul. Rizgar

22:49.401 --> 22:54.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has heard of the doors in Europe closing for
refugees, but he says he believes people will

22:54.306 --> 22:58.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
welcome them because they know of the tragedy
of what happened to Yazidis.

22:58.344 --> 23:03.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Misan (ph) is taking her two children and
four nieces and nephews to Istanbul to be

23:03.682 --> 23:09.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
smuggled to Germany. Her husband and other
relatives are already there.

23:09.054 --> 23:13.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Everybody else is going. We're going, too,"
she says.

23:13.525 --> 23:21.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't look back. There are no tearful
goodbyes here from the relatives seeing them

23:21.700 --> 23:26.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
off. Most of them are confident they will
see them again in Europe.

23:26.338 --> 23:38.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Jane Arraf in
Dohuk, Iraq.

23:38.584 --> 23:49.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: After years of criticism and
debate over the federal law known as No Child

23:49.962 --> 23:55.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Left Behind, the president and Congress have
finally agreed on a new education law, one

23:55.334 --> 23:59.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that aims to shift some of the federal government's
influence over 100,000 public schools.

23:59.238 --> 24:04.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States:
A Christmas miracle, a bipartisan bill signing

24:04.376 --> 24:04.877 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right here.

24:04.910 --> 24:05.244 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

24:05.277 --> 24:06.845 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

24:06.879 --> 24:10.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama praised the
new bill called the Every Student Succeeds

24:10.082 --> 24:14.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Act as he prepared to sign it into law at
the White House.

24:14.653 --> 24:20.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It still requires annual testing of students
between third and eighth grade, as well as

24:20.392 --> 24:26.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
once during high school. But, unlike the prior
law signed by President George W. Bush in

24:26.732 --> 24:34.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
2002, it doesn't give the federal government
power to impose penalties on underperforming

24:34.239 --> 24:35.941 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
schools.

24:35.974 --> 24:40.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Obama, who had waived those penalties,
but had backed many features of the law for

24:40.946 --> 24:44.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years, acknowledged the shortcomings of No
Child Left Behind.

24:44.316 --> 24:49.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: It didn't always consider the
specific needs of each community. It led to

24:49.121 --> 24:55.894 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
too much testing during classroom time. It
often forced schools and school districts

24:55.928 --> 25:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into cookie-cutter reforms that didn't always
produce the kinds of results that we wanted

25:02.034 --> 25:03.702 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to see.

25:03.736 --> 25:08.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The new law passed with unusually
large bipartisan margins in the Senate and

25:08.407 --> 25:14.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the House, a point made yesterday by one of
its sponsors, Republican Senator Lamar Alexander

25:14.413 --> 25:16.148 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Tennessee.

25:16.181 --> 25:19.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEN. LAMAR ALEXANDER (R), Tennessee: Not many
things this important pass the us Senate 85-12.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.286 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

25:21.320 --> 25:24.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEN. LAMAR ALEXANDER: And we're -- this is
a big Christmas present from the Senate and

25:24.623 --> 25:28.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the House, and it's going down to the president,
and I hope he wraps a big red ribbon around

25:28.827 --> 25:34.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it and sends it out to 100 million students
and 3.4 million teachers in 100,000 pubic

25:34.299 --> 25:35.934 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
schools.

25:35.968 --> 25:39.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: States and school districts
will now have more responsibility for judging

25:39.705 --> 25:47.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how schools are doing and how to utilize testing.
Teacher evaluations, long a subject of intense

25:47.079 --> 25:50.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
debate, will not necessarily be tied to tests.

25:50.749 --> 25:56.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there remain many questions about the
practical impact: Will states take action

25:56.655 --> 26:02.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when needed? And will some districts return
to a time of ignoring the needs of struggling

26:02.995 --> 26:05.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and minority students?

26:05.230 --> 26:09.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, let's take a closer look at what this
law changes and some of those questions and

26:10.002 --> 26:11.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
criticisms of it.

26:11.637 --> 26:16.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Alyson Klein is a reporter with Education
Week, an organization we collaborate with

26:16.275 --> 26:21.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on education stories. She was at the White
House today for the president's signing.

26:21.380 --> 26:23.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Alyson, thank you for being here.

26:23.348 --> 26:27.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, what are the main ways that this new bill
is different from the old one?

26:27.519 --> 26:35.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALYSON KLEIN, Education Week: So, as you mentioned
at the top, this new law would really broaden

26:35.127 --> 26:40.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the authority of states when it comes to turning
around low-performing schools, evaluating

26:40.899 --> 26:44.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
teachers, and deciding what exactly to hold
schools accountable for.

26:44.903 --> 26:50.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
States, as you said, will still have to test
students in grades three through eight and

26:50.876 --> 26:58.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
once in high school, but they will have more
say over how much those tests count in gauging

26:58.517 --> 27:00.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a school's performance.

27:00.285 --> 27:03.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, is that a significant change
in the testing requirement, the testing that's

27:03.856 --> 27:05.491 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going to go on?

27:05.524 --> 27:09.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALYSON KLEIN: Yes, the testing will continue,
but schools will also be asked to focus on

27:09.428 --> 27:15.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other factors, things like school climate,
teacher engagement, student engagement, access

27:15.734 --> 27:20.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to advance course work. So those things will
be looked at in gauging a school's rating

27:20.639 --> 27:22.841 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or performance alongside tests.

27:22.875 --> 27:27.779 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about teacher performance?
We mentioned that that will not now be necessarily

27:27.813 --> 27:34.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tied to how the tests go. But what does this
new law say about teachers?

27:34.086 --> 27:39.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALYSON KLEIN: So, this law gives states the
authority to decide exactly how to evaluate

27:39.658 --> 27:44.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their teachers, and states may decide to kick
that responsibility to school districts.

27:44.997 --> 27:50.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
States certainly could continue to hold teachers
accountable for student growth in test scores,

27:50.836 --> 27:52.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but it would be up to them and not the federal
government.

27:52.804 --> 27:56.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, is there a sense, Alyson
Klein, that there -- that it will feel different

27:56.475 --> 27:59.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in terms of a federal mandate for public schools?

27:59.111 --> 28:02.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALYSON KLEIN: Well, states will really be
able to take much more ownership, I think

28:02.281 --> 28:04.349 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the sponsors would say, of their systems.

28:04.383 --> 28:10.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, how much change we will see in schools
will end up being up to the state and district

28:10.289 --> 28:18.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
level. Certainly, teachers unions, governors,
state chiefs are expecting to see a more holistic

28:18.730 --> 28:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
approach to education going forward.

28:20.899 --> 28:25.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, we mentioned this passed
by a very big, unusual bipartisan -- large

28:25.137 --> 28:28.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bipartisan margin, but we do still hear some
criticism out there.

28:28.440 --> 28:32.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For example, a number of conservative members
of Congress didn't vote for it. And one of

28:32.744 --> 28:39.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their main arguments, they say it still has
too much a federal presence, despite the changes.

28:39.384 --> 28:41.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALYSON KLEIN: Sure.

28:41.119 --> 28:44.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, obviously, there are some folks running
for president, for instance, Senator Ted Cruz,

28:44.523 --> 28:45.757 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who opposed the bill in a statement...

28:45.791 --> 28:47.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

28:47.292 --> 28:49.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALYSON KLEIN: ... who would like to see there
be no Department of Education.

28:49.995 --> 28:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, obviously, even though this would constrain
the Department of Education, some say it would

28:54.366 --> 28:58.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
put a straitjacket around the secretary, it
doesn't get rid of the department altogether,

28:58.704 --> 29:00.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which is what some folks would like to see.

29:00.639 --> 29:05.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, there is still is -- there
clearly are still some federal mandates in

29:05.277 --> 29:06.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
here that are connected to the money.

29:06.712 --> 29:08.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALYSON KLEIN: Yes. Yes, absolutely.

29:08.347 --> 29:12.851 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The other criticism you hear,
that you see today, is that -- I guess you

29:12.884 --> 29:16.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could say it's from the left, but it's those
who are saying that there is not enough in

29:16.755 --> 29:21.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
here that requires schools to do something
for those students who are academically struggling,

29:21.994 --> 29:24.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those students who are in underperforming
schools.

29:24.830 --> 29:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do the proponents defend it from that
criticism?

29:28.233 --> 29:32.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALYSON KLEIN: So, Senator Patty Murray, who
is a lead sponsor of this bill, and Representative

29:32.871 --> 29:38.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bobby Scott -- both of them are Democrats
-- have noted that there are guardrails, is

29:38.710 --> 29:43.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the term they use, in this bill that would
call for states to look at their very lowest-performing

29:43.815 --> 29:49.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
schools, schools where less than a third of
kids graduate, and schools where certain groups

29:50.022 --> 29:56.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of students, like English-language learners,
students in special education, racial minorities,

29:56.094 --> 29:58.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are just not performing as well as their peers.

29:58.797 --> 30:03.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, they say that those guardrails are in
place and we're not going to see any sort

30:03.502 --> 30:05.337 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of a slide back.

30:05.370 --> 30:10.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But there still is more leeway
for states on what to do about these lowest-performing

30:10.676 --> 30:11.343 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
schools?

30:11.376 --> 30:12.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALYSON KLEIN: Yes, absolutely.

30:13.011 --> 30:16.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly, final last
question, Alyson Klein. Common Core, does

30:16.581 --> 30:18.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this affect that?

30:18.183 --> 30:22.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALYSON KLEIN: So, this would turn control
over standards completely over to states.

30:22.721 --> 30:29.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Obama administration, through its No Child
Left Behind waiver program, has required states

30:29.061 --> 30:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to either adopt Common Core or a set of standards
that their institutions of higher education

30:34.199 --> 30:39.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sign off on. It's kind of technical. But this
law essentially says, you know, you need to

30:39.037 --> 30:42.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have challenging academic standards that will
get students ready for higher education.

30:42.974 --> 30:46.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it takes the federal government out of
the picture. That means states could continue

30:47.012 --> 30:50.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to do Common Core if they want to, but there
is nothing saying that they have to.

30:50.315 --> 30:55.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Alyson Klein with Education
Week, thank you.

30:55.187 --> 31:02.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALYSON KLEIN: Thank you.

31:02.828 --> 31:11.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Earlier this week, we looked at
how a little known immigration program originally

31:11.670 --> 31:17.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
intended to benefit poor and rural communities
is being used, and some say abused, by wealthy

31:17.342 --> 31:22.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
urban developers. Congress must decide whether
to renew the 25-year-old program next week.

31:22.814 --> 31:27.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tonight, economics correspondent Paul Solman
has a report about how the program is helping

31:27.919 --> 31:31.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a poor rural area, but still stirring up controversy.

31:31.757 --> 31:38.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of our series Making Sense, which
airs every Thursday on the "NewsHour."

31:38.897 --> 31:44.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Just four miles from the Canadian border,
surf's up, however improbably, at the Jay

31:44.703 --> 31:50.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Peak Resort, part of the half-billion-dollar
development project to transform the economically

31:50.742 --> 31:57.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
depressed Northeast Kingdom, as this corner
of Vermont is called, with foreign investment.

31:57.082 --> 31:58.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The developer is Bill Stenger.

31:58.717 --> 32:01.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BILL STENGER, CEO, Jay Peak Resort: In the
last seven years, we have constructed three

32:01.586 --> 32:07.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
different hotels, a beautiful indoor water
park, ice arena, conference center, wedding

32:07.292 --> 32:11.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
facility. And we have had a tremendous impact
on our local economy regionally as well.

32:11.863 --> 32:16.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: A local economy that, for most
of Vermont's history, has been at the very

32:16.334 --> 32:19.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bottom, but now leads the state in job creation.

32:19.938 --> 32:26.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, the Northeast Kingdom wins, tourists win,
and so do the foreign investors, not only

32:26.044 --> 32:31.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with a promised return on their investment,
but -- and here's the novel incentive of the

32:31.082 --> 32:38.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so-called EB-5 program -- with green cards,
permanent resident visas for them and their

32:38.423 --> 32:46.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
families, in exchange for forking over $500,000
to private companies to create at least 10

32:46.064 --> 32:47.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
jobs in areas of deep unemployment.

32:47.732 --> 32:51.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BILL STENGER: Well, you don't have to live
in Vermont. There are a number of people from

32:51.403 --> 32:57.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
around the world who love Florida, Arizona,
California, warmer weather.

32:57.742 --> 33:00.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But besides the lure of sunny
climes, says Stenger:

33:01.012 --> 33:05.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BILL STENGER: Parents oftentimes will gift
their son or daughter an investment. They

33:05.951 --> 33:11.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can complete their studies here. And if they
can find a job in the United States, the green

33:11.456 --> 33:16.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
card will allow them to accept the job, and
within five years they will be able to apply

33:16.628 --> 33:19.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for citizenship, and it will be granted.

33:19.064 --> 33:23.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Of course, some might have a
problem with this citizenship for a cool half-million

33:23.235 --> 33:29.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in cash deal, even if it is creating a winter
wonderland in the jobs-starved Northwoods.

33:29.040 --> 33:34.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you think it is fair that rich people get
to come to the United States, when there are

33:34.112 --> 33:40.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so many truly desperate emigres from a place
like Syria, say, out there on the water as

33:40.352 --> 33:41.987 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we speak?

33:42.020 --> 33:48.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BILL STENGER: I'm seeking capital from a legal
source that's been in existence since 1990

33:48.460 --> 33:54.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that is promoted by our government, helps
us. And, yes, those people are successful

33:54.432 --> 33:57.669 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and they're contributing to our economy.

33:57.702 --> 34:02.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Well, they certainly seem to
be improving life in and around Jay Peak.

34:02.407 --> 34:08.813 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Before the EB-5-funded renovation and expansion
began in 2008, this was a ski slope going

34:08.847 --> 34:16.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
downhill. It's now a year-round resort attracting
a million customers annually to its rides,

34:16.288 --> 34:22.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rinks, restaurants. Dining revenues alone
now top $10 million, double what the entire

34:22.527 --> 34:23.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
resort took in pre-EB-5.

34:24.029 --> 34:29.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: To do something like this for this area
is immense. It's priceless.

34:29.501 --> 34:34.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: For chef Mike Eldred (ph) and
his assistant, Bob McCrary (ph), economic

34:34.239 --> 34:36.274 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
growth has meant career growth as well.

34:36.308 --> 34:41.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Somebody like myself who could be maybe
just cooking steaks, but because of this growth,

34:41.813 --> 34:46.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it gives me an opportunity where I can become
a supervisor. I can keep moving up.

34:46.051 --> 34:48.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Growth that has even benefited
the local quilting bee.

34:48.753 --> 34:53.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: We started this about six years ago
with 33 people at our group when we were still

34:53.558 --> 34:54.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the old hotel.

34:54.693 --> 34:56.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Kay Corsen (ph) was the event's
organizer.

34:56.828 --> 35:00.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: By Jay Peak opening this wonderful
conference center, we're able to expand what

35:00.932 --> 35:03.568 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we do. We have 115 people here this year.

35:03.601 --> 35:07.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Including Helen Short (ph), a
nurse from nearby Enosburg Falls.

35:07.572 --> 35:11.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: I voluntarily went up and spoke to
Bill Stenger because I wanted to thank him.

35:11.476 --> 35:15.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A lot of the farms were going out of business.
There wasn't much opportunity for the youth

35:15.313 --> 35:19.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in this area. And now you have come here,
and it's like this big enterprise and there

35:19.384 --> 35:23.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is building and construction going on, and
students are employed in high school

35:23.688 --> 35:30.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: As lifeguards, ski patrols, desk
clerks. No wonder that in neighboring Newport,

35:30.495 --> 35:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bill Stenger is treated like man of the year,
if not of the millennium.

35:35.633 --> 35:41.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Newport is where Stenger and his partner,
Ariel Quiros, have half-a-dozen new EB-5 projects

35:41.573 --> 35:48.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pending, most ambitiously a stem cell manufacturing
facility affiliated with a South Korean biotech

35:49.014 --> 35:50.715 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
firm.

35:50.749 --> 35:54.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARIEL QUIROS, Chairman: We also will co-develop
and manufacture various kinds of artificial

35:54.986 --> 35:58.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
organs, such as artificial kidney, heart and
liver.

35:58.757 --> 36:05.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: I understand why you would build
up a resort, but a biotech center in the Northeast

36:05.764 --> 36:07.432 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Kingdom?

36:07.465 --> 36:12.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BILL STENGER: It's a great idea. We are at
the right place at the right time with capital,

36:12.270 --> 36:14.839 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
patient capital, and a great business plan.

36:14.873 --> 36:19.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is going to be enormous opportunity
in the construction trades.

36:19.377 --> 36:24.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Now, remember, Stenger is a promoter.
And if all this sounds too good to be true,

36:24.482 --> 36:29.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
well, some say it is, most notably some of
the investors.

36:29.954 --> 36:36.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tony Sutton was among Jay Peak's first EB-5
investors in early 2008, but is now back home

36:36.361 --> 36:38.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in England running a large car dealership.

36:38.830 --> 36:43.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TONY SUTTON, Investor: The problems started
back in 2014, when we received the exit strategy

36:43.902 --> 36:49.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
letter from Jay Peak, which was completely
the opposite to what they had promised would

36:49.240 --> 36:50.809 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
happen.

36:50.842 --> 36:54.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Sutton was one of a group of
35 who put up half-a-million dollars each

36:54.512 --> 36:59.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to build the Tram Haus Lodge at Jay Peak.
Twenty of the investors have now complained

36:59.250 --> 37:04.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the state, which oversees EB-5 in Vermont,
that Stenger and Quiros had promised their

37:04.989 --> 37:07.725 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
money back in five years.

37:07.759 --> 37:09.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But they didn't do that?

37:09.427 --> 37:14.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TONY SUTTON: No, they gave us all IOUs. And
if you look at the company that the IOUs are

37:14.065 --> 37:19.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
drawn against, our research suggests that
that company, Jay Peak Management, Inc., has

37:19.037 --> 37:23.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
no assets, no income and no way of servicing
the IOUs for any of the investors.

37:23.942 --> 37:27.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, you don't think you will
ever get your capital back?

37:27.145 --> 37:29.347 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TONY SUTTON: No, not from Jay Peak.

37:29.380 --> 37:33.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BILL STENGER: There is no obligation to pay
the investment back.

37:33.518 --> 37:38.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But Stenger maintains the loan
is guaranteed by the entire resort, and besides:

37:38.756 --> 37:42.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BILL STENGER: We want to pay them back. We
want to exit them.

37:42.794 --> 37:48.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But what -- this gentleman would have liked
us to have given him a $500,000 check on year

37:48.066 --> 37:54.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
five in one day. Well, the markets did -- the
markets crashed. We needed a little more time.

37:54.906 --> 37:57.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: It sounded like a reasonable
defense.

37:57.609 --> 38:00.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And besides, I said to investor Sutton:

38:00.178 --> 38:05.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You got four green cards for yourself and
your family. So why should anybody sympathize

38:05.817 --> 38:10.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the fact that you didn't get your money
on time or might not ever even get it?

38:10.655 --> 38:15.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TONY SUTTON: It's not about sympathy and it's
not about the return on the investment. It's

38:15.093 --> 38:19.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about the program that we bought into and
the way the program was sold to the EB-5 investors.

38:19.797 --> 38:23.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And that's a real concern, says
journalist Anne Galloway.

38:23.668 --> 38:28.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANNE GALLOWAY, Vermont Journalism Trust: If
people in other countries are investing in

38:28.206 --> 38:36.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something that they have put faith in, and
that faith is lost, that has a ripple effect

38:36.481 --> 38:44.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
across all EB-5 projects. And I know that
our stories have had kind of a chilling effect.

38:44.155 --> 38:49.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Galloway founded the investigative
reporting Web site VermontDigger.org. And

38:49.761 --> 38:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dig, she has for the last two years on Bill
Stenger's various projects, among the largest

38:55.300 --> 38:57.101 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the country funded by EB-5.

38:57.135 --> 39:03.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANNE GALLOWAY: I know from the documents that
I have collected, hundreds of pages of e-mails

39:03.107 --> 39:09.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and contracts and agreements and so on, that
there are very big questions about how the

39:09.380 --> 39:10.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
money has been handled.

39:11.015 --> 39:14.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: There is the concern out there
that investor money is being siphoned off

39:14.085 --> 39:15.787 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by individuals.

39:15.820 --> 39:22.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANNE GALLOWAY: That is a question that's come
up, in particular around the AnC Bio project.

39:22.894 --> 39:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the state wanted to know more about what
about $60 million went to.

39:28.466 --> 39:33.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: For his part, developer Stenger
investor says he's stung by any suspicions

39:33.238 --> 39:36.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and is obviously committed to the community
in which he lives and works.

39:36.608 --> 39:41.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BILL STENGER: Hundreds of families are relying
on me and my team to implement what we do,

39:41.980 --> 39:43.581 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and do it right.

39:43.615 --> 39:47.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Look, we're in no position to
tell whether or not financial ledger domain

39:47.318 --> 39:53.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has been going on. We leave that to the state
and federal agencies now reviewing the matter.

39:53.891 --> 39:55.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But reporter Galloway's concern is broader.

39:55.793 --> 40:01.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANNE GALLOWAY: I think, if the United States
is going to promote a program that attracts

40:01.199 --> 40:04.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people from overseas, it ought to be well-regulated.

40:04.269 --> 40:10.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And, in the end, that's why investors
like Tony Sutton are raising a ruckus.

40:10.108 --> 40:14.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We had one last question for him about Bill
Stenger and his partners.

40:14.545 --> 40:19.951 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One interpretation here is, they're trying
to do something good for a depressed part

40:19.984 --> 40:21.686 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Vermont.

40:21.719 --> 40:25.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TONY SUTTON: On that basis, Paul, you can
rob a bank and build a hospital, and everything's

40:25.657 --> 40:27.325 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fine.

40:27.358 --> 40:30.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: This is economics correspondent
Paul Solman, reporting from Northeast Kingdom,

40:30.828 --> 40:32.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Vermont, for the "PBS NewsHour."

JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: a spectacular new wilderness
park in Chile and the man who helped create

40:49.647 --> 40:51.316 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

40:51.349 --> 40:55.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Earlier this week, Douglas Tompkins, the founder
of the outdoor equipment company The North

40:55.119 --> 41:01.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Face, died in a kayaking accident in Chile,
the country where he spent much of his time.

41:01.292 --> 41:06.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tompkins and his wife, Kris, have long been
dedicated to purchasing natural wilderness

41:06.264 --> 41:10.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
areas and then turning them over to the countries
in South America.

41:10.368 --> 41:15.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The latest, the Patagonia National Park in
Chile, is opening this month.

41:15.807 --> 41:20.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Special correspondent Mike Cerre has this
report. It features Tompkins' financial broadcast

41:20.912 --> 41:23.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
interview before he died.

41:23.281 --> 41:31.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: Imagine a national park with the
best of Yellowstone, Yosemite and Grand Teton

41:31.622 --> 41:37.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
national parks, without the traffic or wait
lists for campsites.

41:37.495 --> 41:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Chile's new Patagonia National Park will be
the size of Rhode Island when it's combined

41:41.799 --> 41:48.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with two adjacent national reserves, complete
with snowcapped mountains, wild rivers and

41:48.172 --> 41:54.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sweeping grasslands, as these ultra-marathon
runners discovered on their 100-mile fund-raising

41:54.979 --> 41:58.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
run the length of the park, sponsored by the
Patagonia Company.

41:58.816 --> 42:00.485 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Epic!

42:00.518 --> 42:03.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KRIS TOMPKINS, CEO, of Patagonia, Inc.: Since
we have moved to Chile, we have been really

42:03.054 --> 42:10.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fortunate enough to have acquired just about
2.4 million acres between Chile and Argentina,

42:10.428 --> 42:17.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all of which we hope will become part of a
national park system in either country.

42:17.368 --> 42:21.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's a reason that people come from all
over the world here, and they stay, because

42:21.205 --> 42:29.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there is something alluring about it. After
24 years of working on the company Patagonia,

42:29.814 --> 42:33.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I thought there must be something to this.
I'm going to go see it for myself. And I fell

42:33.418 --> 42:35.086 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in love.

42:35.119 --> 42:40.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: Kris Tompkins, the Patagonia outdoor
clothing company's first CEO, also fell in

42:40.625 --> 42:46.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
love with Doug Tompkins, the founder of North
Face and Esprit companies, who moved to Patagonia

42:46.731 --> 42:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
after exiting the business world in the mid-'90s.

42:48.866 --> 42:52.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DOUGLAS TOMPKINS, Conservationist: Boy, they're
a lot more satisfying than selling a lot of

42:52.570 --> 42:59.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
clothes that nobody needs, and being part
of the problem, rather than an attempt at

42:59.811 --> 43:05.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a solution to the immense eco-social crisis
that we're all immersed in.

43:05.750 --> 43:15.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: Doug Tompkins and Yvon Chouinard,
the founder of the Patagonia clothing company,

43:15.059 --> 43:20.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first discovered the Patagonia region while
making a movie of their infamous 1968 road

43:20.998 --> 43:25.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trip to the tip of South America in a van,
surfing and climbing mountains the length

43:25.903 --> 43:27.472 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Chile.

43:27.505 --> 43:32.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DOUGLAS TOMPKINS: I'm sort of half-Chilean
at this point anyway, half-Argentine. This

43:32.376 --> 43:37.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is where I have been living and working for
a long time now.

43:37.548 --> 43:43.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: The road less traveled to Patagonia
and their new park and home away from home

43:43.421 --> 43:48.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is still unpaved. It took us eight hours to
get there from where Doug picked me up at

43:48.459 --> 43:54.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the closest commercial airport in the Aysen
region on the Chilean side of Patagonia, nearly

43:54.332 --> 43:59.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
1,000 miles south of Santiago, and nearly
as many miles north of Tierra del Fuego at

43:59.370 --> 44:01.005 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the tip.

44:01.038 --> 44:05.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Valle Chacabuco, the original land for the
park, was one of South America's largest sheep

44:05.877 --> 44:10.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ranches until it went into serious decline
due to severe overgrazing.

44:10.081 --> 44:16.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KRIS TOMPKINS: It was really a diminished
landscape. In some places, the land had been

44:16.988 --> 44:22.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
eaten down so consistently and for so many
decades that there wasn't really an opportunity

44:22.193 --> 44:23.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for it to come back.

44:23.895 --> 44:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: The Tompkins, along with the help
of other conservationists, bought the nearly

44:29.166 --> 44:33.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
200,000-acre ranch in 2004 for $10 million.

44:33.137 --> 44:38.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Over the past 20 years, they have invested
another $55 million of their and other conservation

44:38.543 --> 44:44.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
foundations' money to restore the grasslands
and local fauna, including the nearly extinct

44:44.081 --> 44:49.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
huemul deer and pumas, which had become quite
scarce.

44:49.554 --> 44:53.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
With the help of local and foreign student
volunteers, they have removed over 500 miles

44:53.925 --> 45:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of fences and created hundreds of miles of
trails. They designed and built the park's

45:01.699 --> 45:05.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
infrastructure to make it more accessible
and accommodating to visitors from Chile and

45:05.937 --> 45:07.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
around the globe.

45:07.605 --> 45:16.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KRIS TOMPKINS: Before too long, we step out.
We are donating this park, these lands, the

45:16.414 --> 45:23.754 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
infrastructure, the whole story, to the Chilean
people, and through that, the Chileans will

45:23.788 --> 45:26.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
develop their sense of ownership.

45:26.324 --> 45:33.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DOUGLAS TOMPKINS: We choose the national park
idea because it's really the highest form

45:33.831 --> 45:41.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of protection for landscapes that exists under
current law, especially in Chile and Argentina.

45:41.572 --> 45:45.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: The idea of privately funding
parks and then turning them over to the government

45:45.676 --> 45:50.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for national parks might be new to Chile,
but not in the United States. Some of our

45:50.181 --> 45:56.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more famous parks began with private donations
and citizen stewards, from Teddy Roosevelt

45:56.520 --> 46:01.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
protecting a redwood forest in Muir Woods,
California, donated by a local couple, to

46:01.392 --> 46:06.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John D. Rockefeller Jr.'s donation of private
lands which became the Acadia National Park

46:06.564 --> 46:11.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Maine and part of an American park system
which some believe to be one of our greatest

46:11.669 --> 46:13.270 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ideas.

46:13.304 --> 46:17.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KRIS TOMPKINS: The national parks system is
a great combination of public and private

46:17.842 --> 46:21.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
effort, and certainly it's the case in everything
that we're working on.

46:21.879 --> 46:30.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can't separate out the necessity, the
urgency of the private sector, individuals.

46:30.121 --> 46:34.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I don't care if they have a lot of money,
they have a little money. That is not the

46:34.425 --> 46:36.127 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
point.

46:36.160 --> 46:40.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: Like the conservation vs. development
battles in the U.S. and elsewhere, not all

46:40.364 --> 46:44.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Chileans have shared the Tompkins' conservation
vision.

46:44.568 --> 46:48.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Over the years, they have been buffeted by
shifting political winds, many of them generated

46:48.606 --> 46:53.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by opposition rumors that they were trying
to divide the country in half, and the ones

46:53.477 --> 46:58.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about creating a doomsday refuge and an American
nuclear waste site.

46:58.949 --> 47:04.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was a pro-development plan to dam the local
rivers and run hydroelectric power lines through

47:04.622 --> 47:09.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their parks and the length of the country
that finally turned Chilean public opinion

47:09.727 --> 47:14.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the Tompkins' favor in order to protect
the future of Patagonia.

47:14.632 --> 47:19.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The controversy turned Doug Tompkins, the
mysterious American conservationist, into

47:19.503 --> 47:21.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a local and national hero.

47:21.205 --> 47:26.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DOUGLAS TOMPKINS: The byproduct of the main
thrust to protect the biodiversity of a given

47:26.977 --> 47:35.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
place is that you get especially young people
out to the parks, because it will be future

47:35.586 --> 47:43.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
generations that will have to value these
landscapes and these ecosystems and make sure

47:43.294 --> 47:45.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that nobody is changing the law.

47:45.196 --> 47:50.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAROLINA PAVON, Chile: This park is going
to be a good thing for Chile. I think that

47:50.167 --> 47:57.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the peoples that work here transmit all the
knowledge about this park about the nature

47:57.208 --> 48:04.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to other people. And this site it's going
to be Like a huge economic resource for the

48:04.749 --> 48:06.383 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

48:06.417 --> 48:11.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: If they build it, will the people
come? And will eco-tourism help the local

48:11.055 --> 48:16.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
economy as much or more than other types of
development? It's about to become much clearer

48:16.761 --> 48:22.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this summer season in Chile starting December,
when most of the park will finally be open

48:22.066 --> 48:23.734 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the public.

48:23.768 --> 48:29.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KRIS TOMPKINS: You are seeing what you might
have seen 150 years ago in here in the United

48:29.473 --> 48:35.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
States. People are starting to go and really
learn about the country they were born into

48:35.646 --> 48:37.281 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and enjoy it.

MIKE CERRE: For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Mike Cerre reporting from Patagonia, Chile.

GWEN IFILL: Now we return to Brief But Spectacular,
our occasional series where we ask interesting

49:00.171 --> 49:02.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people to discuss their passions.

49:02.807 --> 49:07.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Among this year's Kennedy Center Honors awardees
is an actress and singer who made her debut

49:07.912 --> 49:13.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on Broadway at age 13, and is perhaps best
known for playing Anita in the film adaptation

49:13.250 --> 49:16.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of "West Side Story."

49:16.187 --> 49:21.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rita Moreno originally struggled with being
typecast, but fought industry pressure, and

49:21.091 --> 49:26.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
went on to become the first Latino to win
an Oscar, a Tony, an Emmy and a Grammy.

49:26.831 --> 49:31.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This fall, she released her first all Spanish
album titled "Una Vez Mas."

49:31.902 --> 49:38.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RITA MORENO, Actress: Being the house ethnic
was destroying my life and my sense of myself,

49:38.843 --> 49:46.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because I had been consigned to play every
dusky maiden you have ever seen in your life

49:46.550 --> 49:48.152 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in movies.

49:48.185 --> 49:52.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, if I was playing Hawaiian girl, I talked
like this. If I was playing an Arabian, I

49:52.256 --> 49:57.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
still talked like this. I didn't know. But
I was trying. I was really trying to improve

49:57.328 --> 49:58.963 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
things.

49:58.996 --> 50:12.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nobody gave a damn. Moving to Los Angeles,
I was then about, yes, 16, because I remember

50:13.010 --> 50:19.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that I went there under contract to MGM studios,
the studio of my dreams, because that's where

50:19.183 --> 50:21.218 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
all the great musicals were made.

50:21.252 --> 50:26.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"LIFE" magazine decided to do a story about
a young actress in Hollywood in 1954. And

50:26.523 --> 50:31.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I made the cover. And I remember that the
fellow who was doing the story on me said,

50:31.495 --> 50:36.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Listen, kid, I just want you to know, if
Eisenhower gets a cold, you're off the cover."

50:36.200 --> 50:41.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I auditioned for "West Side Story" just like
everybody else, and I nearly had a heart attack,

50:41.739 --> 50:45.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because I hadn't danced in about -- oh, I
don't know, about 15 years.

50:45.242 --> 50:50.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I got a friend of mine who had played Anita
on the road in "West Side Story" to teach

50:50.814 --> 50:56.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
me some steps. But she warned me that they
don't always teach you the same steps. And

50:56.987 --> 51:01.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to my astonishment, the first part of the
audition, the dance director said, OK, let

51:01.959 --> 51:07.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
me teach you these steps from "America." And
I said, OK. And it was the steps that this

51:07.932 --> 51:09.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
girl taught me.

51:09.566 --> 51:13.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When I was nominated for the Oscar, I was
absolutely positive that Judy Garland would

51:13.470 --> 51:22.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
win for "Judgment at Nuremberg," and then
they call my name, and I was absolutely paralyzed.

51:22.212 --> 51:28.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I remember walking down to the stage and
saying to myself, don't run, it's not dignified.

51:28.953 --> 51:34.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I got up there and I said the following. Unbelievable.

51:34.124 --> 51:35.592 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

51:35.626 --> 51:39.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RITA MORENO: I can't believe it.

51:39.396 --> 51:40.431 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

51:40.464 --> 51:41.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RITA MORENO: Good lord. I'll leave you with
that.

51:41.699 --> 51:43.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

51:43.133 --> 51:45.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RITA MORENO: Oh, my God, the things I could
have said. It just kills me.

51:45.736 --> 51:51.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is something about sex that always brings
out the funny in me. I think it's because

51:51.275 --> 51:56.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we make such fools of ourselves over it. You
know, get laid, oh, my God, people will do

51:56.981 --> 51:58.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just about anything.

51:58.749 --> 52:04.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think people get won over, too, by a woman's
kind of sexuality. And that's what I was trying

52:04.722 --> 52:19.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to achieve when I sang "Fever" with Animal,
the drummer from the Muppets. Well, I think

52:19.103 --> 52:25.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's one of the funniest things I have ever
done. I really had a hard time not laughing.

52:25.342 --> 52:33.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have always wanted to sing and dance all
my life, but there is one song that absolutely

52:33.150 --> 52:35.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
captures the essence of who I am.

52:35.486 --> 52:45.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
(singing): As I approach the prime of my life,
I find I have the time of my life, learning

52:45.662 --> 52:55.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to explore at my leisure every single pleasure.
And so I happily concede this is all I ask.

52:55.706 --> 53:06.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to explore at my leisure every single pleasure.
And so I happily concede this is all I ask.

53:06.750 --> 53:16.060 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is all I need.

53:16.093 --> 53:20.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm Rita Moreno. And this is my Brief But
Spectacular take on me.
