16:42.233 --> 16:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER WEAVER IS ONE OF THE

16:43.433 --> 16:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPORTERS ON THAT STORY, AND HE

16:44.533 --> 16:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOINS ME NOW TO DISCUSS IT.

16:47.433 --> 16:48.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT'S

16:48.767 --> 16:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENING?

16:50.700 --> 16:51.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO THE HOSPITALS ARE DOING

16:51.467 --> 16:53.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE AND MORE, A PROCEDURE THAT

16:53.467 --> 16:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS LUCRATIVE FOR ALMOST ANY KIND

16:55.100 --> 16:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF HOSPITAL.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIP AND KNEE REPLACEMENTS FOR

16:57.833 --> 16:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN-PATIENTS.

16:58.633 --> 17:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PROBLEM IS THEY'RE NOT DOING

17:00.533 --> 17:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT ENOUGH MORE TO BE AS GOOD AS

17:02.000 --> 17:03.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT AS BIGGER HOSPITALS THAT HAVE

17:03.667 --> 17:05.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUCH LOWER RATES OF PEOPLE DYING

17:05.700 --> 17:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFTER THE SURGERIES.

17:06.933 --> 17:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO USUALLY YOU THINK THE MORE

17:08.033 --> 17:10.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU DO, THE BETTER YOU GET AT T

17:10.567 --> 17:11.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LOWER COMPLICATIONS, RIGHT?

17:11.967 --> 17:12.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SURE.

17:12.767 --> 17:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE AVERAGE IN 2013, THE

17:14.600 --> 17:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AVERAGE CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITAL

17:16.400 --> 17:18.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS DOING ABOUT 26 OF THESE

17:18.367 --> 17:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROCEDURES A YEAR.

17:19.033 --> 17:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS ABOUT 130 I THINK FOR

17:21.433 --> 17:23.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GENERAL HOSPITALS.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE EXPERTS SAY THE SAFEST

17:24.200 --> 17:25.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOSPITALS DO ABOUT A HUNDRED.

17:25.467 --> 17:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND EVEN AS THEY ARE GROWING,

17:26.600 --> 17:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU WOULD THINK THAT WOULD LEAD

17:27.800 --> 17:29.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BETTER OUTCOMES BUT SOME ARE

17:29.867 --> 17:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROWING FROM TWO, THREE, FIVE A

17:31.433 --> 17:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEAR TO LIKE 13 OR 12 AND

17:33.533 --> 17:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPERTS SAY IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH

17:35.233 --> 17:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO DO THEM WELL

17:36.833 --> 17:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: AND WHAT ARE

17:37.800 --> 17:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF

17:39.233 --> 17:39.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUTCOMES.

17:39.967 --> 17:41.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW MUCH MORE DANGEROUS IS IT?

17:41.167 --> 17:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WE ASKED SOME RESEARCHERS AT

17:43.200 --> 17:44.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARVARD TO HELP US FIGURE THAT

17:44.467 --> 17:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT.

17:45.133 --> 17:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU NEED TO ADJUST FOR THINGS

17:46.933 --> 17:48.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE MAYBE PATIENTS MIGHT BE

17:48.467 --> 17:50.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SICKER IN RURAL AREAS OR OLDER.

17:50.167 --> 17:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> AND WHAT THEY FOUND.

17:53.333 --> 17:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE FINDS ARE I THINK IT WAS

17:54.933 --> 17:56.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT A NINE IN A THOUSAND

17:56.467 --> 17:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE DIE WITHIN 30 DAYS OF

17:58.333 --> 17:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GETTING ONE OF THESE PROCEDURES

17:59.400 --> 18:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT A CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITAL.

18:01.500 --> 18:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS ALMOST 80% MORE THAN AT

18:04.233 --> 18:05.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A TYPICAL GENERAL HOSPITAL WHERE

18:05.700 --> 18:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RATES ARE ABOUT 5 PER 1,000

18:08.300 --> 18:09.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: SO WHY ARE

18:09.567 --> 18:11.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE HOSPITALS IN THESE

18:11.167 --> 18:12.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRITICAL ACCESS OR RURAL AREAS

18:12.367 --> 18:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOING THIS AND SPECIALIZING IN

18:13.533 --> 18:14.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS.

18:14.167 --> 18:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK OF A RURAL HOSPITAL AND

18:15.433 --> 18:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY MAYBE I'M JUST THE NUTS AND

18:17.600 --> 18:18.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOLTS MAKING SURE YOU ARE OKAY

18:18.700 --> 18:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM A HEART ATTACK AND A COLD,

18:20.700 --> 18:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT SPECIFICALLY A HIP OR KNEE

18:22.233 --> 18:22.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPLACEMENT.

18:22.867 --> 18:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SURE.

18:23.633 --> 18:25.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IN THE LATE '90S, CONGRESS

18:25.867 --> 18:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SET UP A DIFFERENT WAY TO PAY

18:27.533 --> 18:29.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITALS

18:29.300 --> 18:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPARED TO YOUR TYPICAL YOUR

18:31.533 --> 18:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOWN MEMORIAL, RIGHT.

18:32.533 --> 18:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CRIT CAM ACCESS HOSPITALS

18:33.933 --> 18:36.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GET PAID BASED ON THEIR COSTS,

18:36.367 --> 18:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
101% OF THEIR COSTS BY MEDICARE.

18:38.333 --> 18:40.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RESULT IS THAT THEY'RE DOING

18:40.367 --> 18:41.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LUCRATIVE PROCEDURES LIKE HIP

18:41.967 --> 18:43.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPLACEMENT RESULTS IN BIGGER

AMOUNT OF MONEY TO THEM THAN IT

18:45.033 --> 18:48.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIGHT TO A TYPICAL GENERAL

18:48.067 --> 18:49.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOSPITAL, THEY GET PAID A FLAT

18:49.167 --> 18:50.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RATE FOR DOING EACH CASE

18:50.300 --> 18:51.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT IS THE

18:51.300 --> 18:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RECOURSE HERE?

18:52.233 --> 18:55.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THERE A WAY TO UNDO THIS?

18:55.467 --> 18:57.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S TOUGH BECAUSE

18:57.167 --> 18:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE PLACES ARE OFTEN SORT OF

18:59.333 --> 19:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ONLY HOSPITAL IN THE A LOCAL

19:00.633 --> 19:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SERVICE AREA.

19:01.533 --> 19:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND MEDICARE NEEDS TO BALANCE

19:02.733 --> 19:03.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FACT THAT THEY WANT PEOPLE

19:03.900 --> 19:05.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO

19:05.767 --> 19:06.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMERGENCY TREATMENT FOR THINGS

19:06.867 --> 19:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE HEART ATTACKS, WITH THEIR

19:08.833 --> 19:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCERNS WHICH THEY SEEM TO

19:10.033 --> 19:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHARE, RIGHT, ABOUT THE KINDS OF

19:11.800 --> 19:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PATTERNS THAT WE'RE SEEING AND

19:13.700 --> 19:16.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUALITY AND THE KINDS THAT

19:16.467 --> 19:18.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOSPITALS ARE PERFORMING.

19:18.500 --> 19:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME EXPERTS SUGGEST THAT MAYBE

19:19.433 --> 19:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY SHOULD GET A SPECIAL

19:20.700 --> 19:22.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAYMENT ONLY FOR THOSE KINDS OF

19:22.567 --> 19:23.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMERGENCY PROCEDURES THAT THE

19:23.867 --> 19:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUBLIC WOULD WANT TO HAVE THERE,

19:25.033 --> 19:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT.

19:25.633 --> 19:27.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN NOT FOR PERHAPS

ELECTIVE PROCEDURES THAT

19:28.067 --> 19:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
