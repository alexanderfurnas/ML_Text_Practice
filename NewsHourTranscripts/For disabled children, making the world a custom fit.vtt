GWEN IFILL: Now to an inspiring
story about
one of last year's MacArthur
grant winners

00:04.705 --> 00:07.407 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and how design can change lives.

00:07.441 --> 00:12.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Jackie
Judd reports
for our Breakthroughs series on
innovation

00:13.013 --> 00:14.848 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and invention.

00:14.882 --> 00:22.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: In the hands of
Alex Truesdell,
a simple piece of cardboard
turns into a world

00:22.189 --> 00:27.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of possibilities. Her life's
mission began
by accident.

00:27.327 --> 00:31.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Truesdell was rooting around in
a closet at
a school where she was teaching
and found

00:32.032 --> 00:34.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a chair that had been made for a
disabled
adult.

00:34.868 --> 00:38.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALEX TRUESDELL, Founder,
Adaptive Design Association:
The armrest and the footrest on
it were actually

00:38.472 --> 00:43.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at different heights on the left
side than
the right side. And I asked
about it, and

00:43.076 --> 00:46.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they said, oh, that's made of
cardboard. And
I think my head exploded.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Why did your head
explode?

00:48.548 --> 00:52.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX TRUESDELL: The idea that
you could take
that material and turn it into
what you needed,

00:52.185 --> 00:54.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, if you needed something,
you could make
something.

00:54.721 --> 01:00.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Truesdell has been
making something
ever since with her triple-ply
cardboard,

01:00.827 --> 01:07.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
glue and simple tools. In New
York City, at
the Adaptive Design Association,
which she

01:07.601 --> 01:13.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
founded, cardboard furniture and
learning
tools are built for children
with disabilities.

01:13.373 --> 01:18.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX TRUESDELL: It makes the
child, one, believe
in their own capacity, and then
everyone who

01:18.812 --> 01:24.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
knows and loves the child
believe in what
they're able to do. I think it
upends the

01:24.151 --> 01:30.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prognosis, because, so often,
unfortunately,
the word disability signals
broken, can't,

01:30.190 --> 01:31.892 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
isn't.

01:31.925 --> 01:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Creating this very
individualized
furniture often involves a house
call. In

01:39.466 --> 01:46.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
suburban New Jersey,
21-month-old Austin Kellenberger
is getting his first fitting for
a chair and

01:46.606 --> 01:48.375 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a table.

01:48.408 --> 01:50.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KELLENBERGER, Father of
Austin: Austin
has significant motor
development issues.

01:50.677 --> 01:53.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has difficulty even moving
his arm.

01:53.313 --> 01:59.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Today, even as a
toddler, dad
John Kellenberger says, Austin
feels apart

01:59.386 --> 02:01.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from his twin brother and older
sister.

02:02.022 --> 02:05.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KELLENBERGER: Oftentimes,
my other son,
Dylan (ph), and my daughter,
Savannah (ph),

02:05.092 --> 02:11.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will be playing at the table
with toys. He's
not able to do that. So, you do
see he is

02:11.064 --> 02:15.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very frustrated. He wants to --
he's a very
social boy. He wants to be part
of the group.

02:15.168 --> 02:19.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: This furniture is
supposed to
make that possible, to make
Austin feel less

02:19.773 --> 02:22.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
different and to build his
physical strength.

02:22.542 --> 02:29.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX TRUESDELL: Right now, he
fatigues quickly,
but he hasn't had the right
chair in order

02:29.416 --> 02:37.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to build strength. So, the
angles of this
will actually give him a bit of
a challenge.

02:37.591 --> 02:44.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Cardboard is
relatively inexpensive,
readily available and really
sturdy, a trifecta

02:44.164 --> 02:50.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for growing kids and for
families, often burdened
by medical costs, who are asked
for contributions

02:50.937 --> 02:55.709 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of just $500.

02:55.742 --> 03:01.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Austin's chair is measured, and
measured again,
and cut to within an eighth of
an inch, so

03:01.348 --> 03:03.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it is just exactly right for the
little boy.

03:03.784 --> 03:08.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX TRUESDELL: We need a custom
fit in an
off-the-rack world. And if it
doesn't fit,

03:08.789 --> 03:13.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if the child struggles, and
they're already
struggling, it's going to use up
that energy

03:13.760 --> 03:19.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and be discouraging. And then
they or someone
else will give up, and get the
wrong idea

03:19.533 --> 03:26.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the child's potential, as
opposed to
being inspired enough to change
the thing,

03:26.173 --> 03:27.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
change the environment to make
it work.

03:27.941 --> 03:32.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Truesdell saw that
happen in
her own family, and it was a
life-changer.

03:32.712 --> 03:37.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her uncle turned conventional
household tools
into something her aunt, who had
lost the

03:37.984 --> 03:39.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
use of her hands, could
manipulate.

03:39.886 --> 03:45.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX TRUESDELL: My uncle was
able to repurpose
things, bend things that were
too straight,

03:45.792 --> 03:50.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cut things that were too long,
connect things.
And that thought, that you could
engineer

03:50.864 --> 03:55.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
change to suit her specific
needs, is really
the root of this.

03:55.635 --> 04:00.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: The workshop has
turned out pieces
this year for more than 200 New
York area

04:00.707 --> 04:04.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kids, but many more children can
use them.

04:04.144 --> 04:08.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Alex Truesdell and her team
spend as much
time teaching as they do
designing and building.

04:09.015 --> 04:14.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the last several years alone,
they have
led several hundred design
workshops and have

04:14.321 --> 04:18.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
answered inquiries from around
the globe.
As a result, these cardboard
creations are

04:19.025 --> 04:24.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being built in about six U.S.
locations and
in countries as diverse as
India, Romania

04:25.031 --> 04:26.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Peru.

04:26.800 --> 04:30.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX TRUESDELL: We try to use
methods here
that could be used anywhere in
the world.

04:30.036 --> 04:36.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, any technique, anything we
make, the materials
we use, we want other people to
see what we

04:36.376 --> 04:41.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do and copy it. We really are
trying to supply
the movement, so that we would
inspire imitation,

04:41.915 --> 04:45.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cooperation, and collaboration
throughout.

04:45.051 --> 04:51.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Truesdell sees some
children
only once and others throughout
their lives.

04:51.191 --> 04:56.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She met New York City teenager
Hannah Auchincloss
(ph) as a toddler, when Hannah's
mother, Tracy

04:56.396 --> 05:01.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ehrlich, was struggling to find
a chair in
which Hannah could feed sitting
up.

05:01.668 --> 05:04.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACY EHRLICH, Mother of Hannah:
She couldn't
do any of those things, and she
was much too

05:04.838 --> 05:06.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
small for conventional
wheelchairs.

05:06.673 --> 05:10.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: So there was
nothing you could
have ordered online, or gone
into a medical

05:10.777 --> 05:14.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supply store and say, that's
what I need,
that's what would help her?

05:14.748 --> 05:16.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRACY EHRLICH: No, absolutely
not, because
she was so young.

05:16.983 --> 05:21.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Ehrlich has lost
track of all
the pieces Truesdell has made
for Hannah,

05:21.988 --> 05:27.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and even some for her sisters,
so the family
feels bound together, instead of
separated

05:27.427 --> 05:34.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by Hannah's challenges. But some
pieces stand
out, like the bike, the scooter
and a beloved

05:34.167 --> 05:37.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rocking chair that Hannah can
get moving on
her own.

05:37.504 --> 05:44.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX TRUESDELL: The experience
of moving herself
at just -- one thing she can
really control

05:44.578 --> 05:46.513 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
every day.

05:46.546 --> 05:50.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACY EHRLICH: I think that all
of the different
pieces of equipment have opened
up the possibilities

05:50.684 --> 05:56.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for her, the opportunities for
her to interact
with her world, interact with
the people who

05:56.223 --> 05:58.124 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are around her.

05:58.158 --> 06:02.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: In New Jersey,
Austin Kellenberger
is just beginning to interact
with his world.

06:02.896 --> 06:08.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
His furniture has been
delivered. And what
most see as a simple chair, his
parents, John

06:08.702 --> 06:10.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Danielle (ph), see as
transformative.

06:10.770 --> 06:15.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KELLENBERGER: I want Austin
to reach
whatever the potential that he
has. I want

06:15.475 --> 06:19.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him to reach that. I don't know
what that
is. The doctors don't know what
that is at

06:19.246 --> 06:24.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this point. But whatever it is,
I want to
give him every chance to meet
that. And this

06:24.351 --> 06:27.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is one of the -- frankly, this
is one of the
things that's helping us do
that.

06:27.988 --> 06:32.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Alex Truesdell
started out as
a teacher for the blind. What
she has done

06:32.892 --> 06:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is let children, thousands of
them, see and
experience movement, growth and
confidence,

06:39.866 --> 06:44.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all through a simple piece of
cardboard and
a lot of ingenuity.

06:44.437 --> 06:47.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is Jackie Judd in New York
for the "NewsHour."
