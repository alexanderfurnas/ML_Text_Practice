SLUMPED OVER ON JACKIE AND SHE

20:32.233 --> 20:33.667

WAY TO MANAGE THAT GRIEF AND

20:56.767 --> 20:56.900
TRAUMA

21:06.467 --> 21:08.767
PHOTOGRAPHS FOR THE EXHIBIT.

21:08.767 --> 21:09.867

21:09.867 --> 21:11.767
STRUCK ME ABOUT THE PHOTOGRAPH

21:11.767 --> 21:14.667
WAS THAT UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL

21:14.667 --> 21:16.533

21:32.667 --> 21:33.400
PRESIDENT.

21:33.400 --> 21:35.900

IS THE POLAROID TAKEN BY MAR
