00:05.438 --> 00:07.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.273 --> 00:12.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: It's
Tax Day, and
that's sparking new calls for
President Donald

00:12.278 --> 00:15.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump to release his own tax
returns.

00:15.115 --> 00:18.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We dig into how transparent this
White House
is.

00:18.885 --> 00:25.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: British Prime Minister
Theresa May calls
for a snap election, as she
seeks more public

00:25.325 --> 00:29.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
support to take Britain out of
the European
Union.

00:29.429 --> 00:34.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a teacher in the Navajo
Nation schools
takes a very hands-on approach
to learning.

00:34.667 --> 00:37.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLYDE MCBRIDE, Teacher, Kayenta
Unified School
District: In a math class, you
get the problem

00:37.704 --> 00:40.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wrong, you miss that question.

00:40.907 --> 00:45.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In my program, if you get that
math problem
wrong, that animal can die.

00:45.745 --> 00:53.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more

from London.

01:07.901 --> 01:12.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
British Prime Minister Theresa

for an early election, in June,
instead of

01:12.505 --> 01:14.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
waiting until 2020.

01:14.574 --> 01:19.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Speaking outside her official
residence, May
said she is asking to move up
the vote to

01:19.446 --> 01:23.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
strengthen her hand in
negotiating Britain's
exit from the European Union.

01:23.883 --> 01:28.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THERESA MAY, British Prime
Minister: Division
in Westminster will risk our
ability to make

01:28.188 --> 01:35.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a success of Brexit, and it will
cause damaging
uncertainty and instability to
the country.

01:35.495 --> 01:41.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we need a general election,
and we need
one now, because we have at this
moment a

01:41.835 --> 01:43.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
one-off chance to get this done.

01:43.636 --> 01:48.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will take a
closer look

the program.

broken up an
imminent attack aimed at that
country's presidential

01:55.215 --> 01:56.883 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

01:56.916 --> 02:01.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They arrested two suspects today
in the port
city of Marseille, and recovered
guns and

02:01.187 --> 02:02.422 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
explosives.

02:02.455 --> 02:05.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

02:10.330 --> 02:16.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Turkey, the main opposition
party is formally
asking to annul Sunday's
referendum that expanded

02:16.803 --> 02:19.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the powers of President Recep
Tayyip Erdogan.

02:19.639 --> 02:25.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

02:26.513 --> 02:30.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say accepting ballots
without an official
stamp was illegal.

02:30.817 --> 02:36.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Separately, the White House
defended President
Trump's congratulatory call to
Erdogan, arguing

02:36.789 --> 02:40.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that he is an ally in the fight
against terrorism.

02:40.627 --> 02:45.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vice President Mike Pence moved
on from South
Korea to Japan today, and again
pressed the

02:45.832 --> 02:48.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. case against North Korea.

02:48.168 --> 02:53.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Tokyo, Mr. Pence said the
U.S. will not
relent until the Korean
Peninsula is free

02:53.606 --> 02:55.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of nuclear weapons.

02:55.341 --> 02:59.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he told Japanese Prime

Abe that American support is
unwavering.

02:59.646 --> 03:05.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE, Vice President of
the United States:
We appreciate the challenging
times in which

03:05.118 --> 03:11.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the people of Japan live, with
increasing
provocations from across the Sea
of Japan.

03:11.224 --> 03:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as the president himself
would if he
was here, let me be clear to
you, Mr. Prime

03:20.333 --> 03:22.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Minister and to all of people in
Japan, we
are with you 100 percent.

03:22.969 --> 03:26.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last week, the
White House
announced that a U.S. aircraft
carrier was

03:26.673 --> 03:30.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
steaming toward Korean waters as
a deterrent.

03:30.243 --> 03:32.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now it turns out that was
premature.

03:32.946 --> 03:38.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The New York Times reports that
the carrier
group was headed the opposite
way at the time,

03:38.151 --> 03:39.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
before changing course.

03:39.652 --> 03:43.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Pentagon blames a series of
miscommunications.

03:43.456 --> 03:48.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. military says it
intercepted two
Russian bombers in international
airspace

03:48.194 --> 03:50.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
off Alaska on Monday.

03:50.263 --> 03:54.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two U.S. fighter planes shadowed
them for
12 minutes.

03:54.267 --> 04:00.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to FOX News, the
Russians came within
100 miles of Alaska's Kodiak
Island.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is the first such incident in
nearly two
years.

04:03.943 --> 04:09.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The manhunt is over for the
suspect accused
of killing an elderly man in
Cleveland and

04:09.649 --> 04:12.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
posting video of the crime on
Facebook.

04:12.552 --> 04:16.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

found Steve Stephens
today in the city of Erie.

04:16.923 --> 04:22.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He shot and killed himself after
a chase,
closing the case for authorities
back in Cleveland.

04:22.528 --> 04:26.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CALVIN WILLIAMS, Cleveland,
Ohio, Police Chief:
We are grateful that this has
ended.

04:26.165 --> 04:31.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We would have preferred that it
had not ended
this way, because there are a
lot of questions,

04:31.104 --> 04:36.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm sure, not only for the
family, but the
city in general, would have had
for Steve

04:36.876 --> 04:38.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as to why this transpired.

04:38.645 --> 04:43.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Facebook CEO Mark
Zuckerberg
pledged today that the social
media giant

04:44.017 --> 04:49.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will do all it can to prevent
postings of
violent crimes in the future.

04:49.622 --> 04:54.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State officials in Arkansas are
vowing to
carry out a double execution
later this week,

04:54.260 --> 04:58.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that after the U.S. Supreme
Court halted the
state's plan to resume capital
punishment

04:58.831 --> 05:01.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the first time in nearly 12
years.

05:01.634 --> 05:06.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The high court issued its ruling
late Monday,
just minutes before a condemned
man was scheduled

05:06.706 --> 05:08.574 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to die.

05:08.608 --> 05:14.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of Homeland Security
John Kelly
is taking on critics in Congress
over immigration

05:14.314 --> 05:16.149 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
enforcement.

05:16.182 --> 05:20.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Washington today, Kelly said
that too many
public officials ridicule
immigration agents

05:21.020 --> 05:26.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and airport security officers,
and accept
unfounded allegations about them
as truth.

05:26.793 --> 05:30.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KELLY, U.S. Homeland
Security Secretary:
If lawmakers do not like the
laws that we

05:30.363 --> 05:35.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enforce, that we are charged to
enforce, that
we are sworn to enforce, then
they should

05:35.501 --> 05:40.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have the courage and the skill
to change the
laws.

05:40.506 --> 05:43.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Otherwise, they should shut up
and support
the men and women on the front
lines.

05:43.543 --> 05:48.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: More than 21,000
undocumented
immigrants in the U.S. have been
arrested

05:48.881 --> 05:51.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
since President Trump took
office.

05:51.184 --> 05:55.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is up from 16,000 at this
point a year
ago.

05:55.455 --> 06:00.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans faced another tough
race today
in what had been a solidly red
U.S. congressional

06:00.727 --> 06:02.462 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
district.

06:02.495 --> 06:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The election was in suburban
Atlanta, where
18 candidates from both parties
competed.

06:06.899 --> 06:12.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The seat was vacated by Tom
Price, who is
now the secretary of health and
human services.

06:12.071 --> 06:17.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
President Trump sharply
criticized the leading
Democrat in the race, Jon
Ossoff, who said

06:17.276 --> 06:20.813 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he thinks the president is --
quote -- "misinformed."

06:20.847 --> 06:25.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is word this evening that
President
George H.W. Bush is hospitalized
again in

06:25.518 --> 06:27.153 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Houston.

06:27.186 --> 06:30.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A spokesman said Mr. Bush is
doing fine and
already on the path to going
home.

06:30.957 --> 06:32.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He gave no other details.

06:32.425 --> 06:33.826 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mr. Bush is 92.

06:33.860 --> 06:38.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He was hospitalized for
pneumonia back in
January.

06:38.364 --> 06:43.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street, stocks lost
more ground
after Goldman Sachs and Johnson
&amp; Johnson

06:43.403 --> 06:44.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
posted disappointing earnings.

06:44.771 --> 06:49.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 113
points to close at 20523.

06:49.709 --> 06:56.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell seven, and the
S&amp;P 500 slid
nearly seven.

06:56.282 --> 07:01.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
growing concerns
over White House ethics; the
president's efforts

07:01.721 --> 07:08.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to revamp a widely used guest
workers program;
pushback against Mr. Trump's
upcoming state

07:09.028 --> 07:22.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
visit to Britain; and much more.

07:23.009 --> 07:28.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's Tax Day, I'm sure you know,
and President
Trump is facing renewed
questions over public

07:28.748 --> 07:32.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
disclosure issues that dogged
him on the campaign
trial.

07:32.652 --> 07:34.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Our John Yang begins our
coverage.

07:34.554 --> 07:41.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: For President Trump,
questions
about transparency start with
his taxes, and

07:41.060 --> 07:45.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why he's breaking with tradition
and not releasing
his returns.

07:45.164 --> 07:46.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
White House Press Secretary Sean
Spicer:

07:46.933 --> 07:49.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
We're under the same audit that
has existed,

07:49.635 --> 07:51.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and so nothing has changed.

07:51.537 --> 07:56.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In fact, presidents
and vice presidents
are automatically audited by the
IRS, which

07:56.976 --> 07:59.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hasn't stopped other chief
executives from
making them public.

07:59.912 --> 08:04.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This weekend, thousands of
people marched
in cities around the country to
demand that

08:04.250 --> 08:06.552 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump release his taxes.

08:06.586 --> 08:12.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He dismissed them with a tweet:
"Someone should
look into who paid for the small
organized

08:12.191 --> 08:13.159 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rallies.

08:13.192 --> 08:14.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The election is over."

08:14.994 --> 08:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump is the first president
in more than
40 years not to make his tax
returns public.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The president says only
reporters care about
the issue.

08:23.603 --> 08:29.375 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
But in a recent
Bloomberg/Morning Consult
poll, 53 percent of those
surveyed said the

08:29.408 --> 08:31.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
president should release them.

08:31.878 --> 08:36.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then there's the question of who
visits the
White House, which Mr. Trump
calls the people's

08:36.682 --> 08:38.484 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
house.

08:38.518 --> 08:42.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The administration says it's
ending the Obama
policy of making visitor logs
available, with

08:42.622 --> 08:46.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exceptions for national security
and privacy
reasons.

Press Secretary Spicer:

08:48.194 --> 08:52.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: Frankly, the faux
attempt that
the Obama administration put
out, where they

08:52.064 --> 08:56.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would scrub who they didn't want
put out,
didn't serve anyone well.

08:56.168 --> 09:00.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The administration is
also under
scrutiny for hiring former
lobbyists to craft

09:00.907 --> 09:03.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
policies for the industries they
came from.

09:03.843 --> 09:08.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The New York Times and
ProPublica found some
had been given secret waivers
exempting them

09:08.781 --> 09:10.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from ethics rules.

09:10.716 --> 09:15.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ethics questions also extend to
first daughter
and White House adviser Ivanka
Trump and her

09:15.087 --> 09:16.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
business interests.

09:17.023 --> 09:22.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Associated Press reported
that she received
provisional Chinese approval for
three trademarks

09:22.161 --> 09:27.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the day she dined with
president Xi Jinping
at Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago
resort.

09:27.600 --> 09:32.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her fashion line, which is
seeing record sales,
is held in a family-run trust,
and she has

09:32.972 --> 09:36.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pledged to recuse herself from
issues that
present conflicts.

09:36.842 --> 09:38.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

09:38.978 --> 09:43.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For more on some
of the questions
all of this raises about
government transparency

09:43.549 --> 09:46.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and conflicts of interest, we
are joined by
Richard Painter.

09:46.752 --> 09:51.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a University of Minnesota
law professor
who served as President George
W. Bush's top

09:51.991 --> 09:53.693 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ethics attorney.

09:53.726 --> 09:58.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Noah Bookbinder, he's
executive director
of the government watchdog group
Citizens

09:58.364 --> 10:01.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for Responsibility and Ethics in
Washington.

10:01.467 --> 10:03.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We welcome both of you to the
program.

10:03.302 --> 10:04.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NOAH BOOKBINDER, Executive
Director, Citizens
for Responsibility and Ethics in
Washington:

10:04.170 --> 10:05.137 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

10:05.171 --> 10:06.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

10:06.172 --> 10:07.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Noah Bookbinder, I'm going to
start with you.

10:07.173 --> 10:08.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's so much to cover here.

10:08.174 --> 10:09.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's just pick out a few of
these questions.

10:09.475 --> 10:11.377 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Taxes.

10:11.410 --> 10:16.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House continues to
insist that President
Trump's taxes are being audited,
and there's

10:16.849 --> 10:21.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just no way he can release them,
he doesn't
have that ability to release
them.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's the answer?

10:22.121 --> 10:24.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NOAH BOOKBINDER: That's just not
correct.

10:24.824 --> 10:30.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the report just indicated,
every president's
taxes are routinely audited, and
yet all of

10:30.363 --> 10:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the previous presidents have
seen fit to release
their tax returns.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Richard Nixon released his tax
returns when
he was under audit.

10:36.636 --> 10:41.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, surely, a level of
transparency that
was sufficient for Richard Nixon
ought to

10:41.707 --> 10:43.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
work for this president.

10:43.142 --> 10:46.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Richard Painter,
why isn't
that a legitimate reason?

10:46.779 --> 10:51.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition, the White House
says the public
doesn't really care about
President Trump's

10:51.517 --> 10:53.252 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
taxes.

10:53.285 --> 10:55.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RICHARD PAINTER, Former
Associate Counsel
to President George W. Bush:
Well, the public

10:55.187 --> 11:00.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
does care, and the fact that the
tax returns
are under audit is not an excuse
for not releasing

11:00.393 --> 11:02.128 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the tax returns.

11:02.161 --> 11:08.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, furthermore, the president
is going to
propose tax reform legislation,
which may

11:08.200 --> 11:14.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
very well just mean more
handouts for the
super rich, billionaire tax
cuts.

11:14.206 --> 11:20.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We ought to at least know what
particular
tax provisions are benefiting
him financially,

11:20.680 --> 11:25.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which loopholes he's using,
before he starts
tinkering around with the tax
code to create

11:25.985 --> 11:27.653 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
yet more.

11:27.687 --> 11:32.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, this is going to be
critically important
that he release the tax returns,
or we're

11:32.458 --> 11:35.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not going to have any tax reform
legislation
get through Congress.

11:35.761 --> 11:41.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can't imagine that Congress
would sign off
on a bill proposed by the
president if he's

11:41.033 --> 11:45.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not going to disclose how the
bill is going
to affect him financially.

11:45.171 --> 11:47.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the only way to do that is
release those
tax returns.

11:47.473 --> 11:51.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly
to Noah Bookbinder,
this has been Donald Trump's
argument throughout

11:51.610 --> 11:54.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the campaign from the very
beginning, the
first time anyone asked him
about releasing

11:54.747 --> 11:55.715 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his taxes.

11:55.748 --> 11:56.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said, it's none of your
business.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's my private business.

11:58.084 --> 12:00.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, besides, they're being
audited.

12:00.486 --> 12:07.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does he have a point that he is
in a special
place in this argument, unlike
anyone else?

12:07.526 --> 12:09.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NOAH BOOKBINDER: He really
doesn't.

12:09.361 --> 12:16.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is -- his taxes will reveal
information
that is going to tell us how
he's affected,

12:16.268 --> 12:22.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as Richard said, by tax reform,
but also by
all kinds of other policy
issues, from foreign

12:22.641 --> 12:29.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policy -- his tax returns will
reveal his
foreign interests -- to
regulatory policy.

12:29.749 --> 12:35.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it's crucial for the
American people
to know what his interests are,
to know what

12:35.321 --> 12:38.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
affects him and where conflicts
might be.

12:38.190 --> 12:42.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's even more true for him than
for other
presidents, because he maintains
these vast

12:42.161 --> 12:43.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
business interests worldwide.

12:43.963 --> 12:47.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to turn
both of you
to another question that's been
in the news,

12:47.900 --> 12:52.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that is releasing, making
public the list
of people who visit the White
House, the so-called

12:52.571 --> 12:54.340 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
visitor logs.

12:54.373 --> 12:57.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Richard Painter, this White
House, they're
saying, we're not going to do
it, and, by

12:57.877 --> 13:01.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
history, by tradition, most
presidents haven't
done it.

13:01.747 --> 13:05.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, President Obama did, but
President Trump
doesn't feel compelled to do so.

13:05.918 --> 13:08.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What difference does it make?

13:08.954 --> 13:10.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RICHARD PAINTER: It makes a lot
of difference.

13:10.723 --> 13:16.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The most ordinary Americans
never have an
opportunity to visit with anyone
inside the

13:16.195 --> 13:17.463 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
White House.

13:17.496 --> 13:21.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They can only look at the White
House from
outside the gate.

13:21.400 --> 13:28.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Very few people get in there,
lobbyists, billionaires,
friends of the president,
friends of his staff,

13:28.240 --> 13:29.809 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
politically connected people.

13:29.842 --> 13:31.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have the right to know who
those people
are.

13:31.677 --> 13:33.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're going in there.

13:33.512 --> 13:37.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're lobbying the White House
staff, trying
to get legislation through,
trying to get

13:37.049 --> 13:40.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regulatory loopholes, tax
loopholes and the
rest of it.

13:40.853 --> 13:45.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the rest of us who don't
have any opportunity
to go in the White House have
the right to

13:45.257 --> 13:47.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at least know who is going in
and out of there.

13:47.259 --> 13:51.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Noah Bookbinder,
your organization
actually sued the administration
of George

13:51.197 --> 13:54.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
W. Bush to try to get them to
release these
visitor logs.

13:54.800 --> 13:58.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You weren't successful with him,
but then,
again, as we mentioned,
President Obama did

13:58.304 --> 13:59.271 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
release his.

13:59.305 --> 14:00.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where does that stand?

14:00.439 --> 14:03.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this the kind of lawsuit that
could apply
again?

14:03.843 --> 14:05.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NOAH BOOKBINDER: Sure.

14:05.110 --> 14:08.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, our organization sued
originally under
George W. Bush.

14:08.948 --> 14:13.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That lawsuit carried through
into President
Obama's administration, and it
was in discussions

14:13.519 --> 14:19.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that came out of that lawsuit
that led to
the Obama administration's
policy of releasing

14:19.658 --> 14:21.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the visitor logs.

14:21.594 --> 14:29.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They did it with exceptions for
national security
policy and for privacy, so there
were no problems

14:29.068 --> 14:30.769 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with doing so.

14:30.803 --> 14:34.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Countless news stories came out
of who was
in there, who was getting
access, who was

14:34.540 --> 14:37.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
influencing policy from the
millions of names
that were released.

14:37.877 --> 14:42.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have filed a similar suit now
with this
administration, because they're
not following

14:42.314 --> 14:45.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the example of the Obama
administration and
releasing those names.

14:45.284 --> 14:48.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so we will
see how long
that takes to work its way
through.

14:48.587 --> 14:53.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I now want to turn both of you,
though, to
something else that has cropped
up again today,

14:53.559 --> 14:56.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and that is the family conflicts
of interest.

14:56.161 --> 14:59.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know, Richard Painter, that
both the president's
daughter Ivanka Trump, her
husband, Jared

14:59.999 --> 15:04.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kushner, all have had very
successful business
interests.

15:04.403 --> 15:11.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have separated themselves
by a measure
now that they're working in the
White House,

15:11.210 --> 15:14.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but they have not completely
separated themselves.

15:14.146 --> 15:20.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you see the decision they
have made
to create trusts or other legal
mechanisms

15:20.753 --> 15:27.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
without completely selling off
and separating
themselves from their business
interests?

15:27.626 --> 15:32.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD PAINTER: Well, the
trusts don't do
anything to change ownership of
the businesses.

15:32.865 --> 15:39.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They still have ownership of
these businesses,
which include clothing import
businesses,

15:39.471 --> 15:44.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bring in clothes from China,
and, of course,
Jared Kushner's real estate
businesses.

15:44.376 --> 15:49.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what this means is both of
them are going
to have to recuse from trade
negotiations

15:49.415 --> 15:54.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with China that affect the
clothing import
business that Ivanka has, and
both of them

15:54.253 --> 15:59.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are going to have to recuse from
tax reform
measures, because there are lots
of loopholes

15:59.291 --> 16:04.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the real estate business in
any tax reform
bill, certainly a lot of real
estate-related

16:04.897 --> 16:09.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issues on the table in tax
reform, and, furthermore,
banking reform.

16:09.301 --> 16:10.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have got to stay out of
that.

16:10.469 --> 16:11.804 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That affects real estate.

16:11.837 --> 16:13.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, they have got to stay out of
those things,
and we will be OK.

16:13.772 --> 16:18.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I was in --
Noah Bookbinder,
I was in touch today with Ivanka
Trump's attorney,

16:18.510 --> 16:24.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Jamie Gorelick, here in
Washington, asked
her about this story today about
Ivanka Trump

16:24.550 --> 16:30.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
winning trademarks in China just
on the same
day that she was meeting with
the Chinese

16:30.656 --> 16:32.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- with her father, with the
Chinese premier.

16:32.491 --> 16:36.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jamie Gorelick wrote back and
basically said
that Ivanka Trump removed
herself from her

16:36.662 --> 16:39.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
business before the start of her
father's
administration.

16:39.965 --> 16:44.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She said she has no role in
deciding now what
trademarks it seeks.

16:44.670 --> 16:47.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's going to follow all
applicable ethics
rules.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why isn't that good enough?

16:48.974 --> 16:55.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NOAH BOOKBINDER: Well, the --
she is still
the owner of that business, and
because she

16:55.814 --> 17:01.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the owner, she benefits from
trademarks
that are granted to the
business.

17:01.787 --> 17:07.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, if they apply for
trademarks, she
sees that they get them.

17:07.493 --> 17:12.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She knows the Chinese government
is doing
things that are beneficial to
her, and that's

17:12.664 --> 17:15.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to make her more disposed
to policies
that benefit China.

17:15.834 --> 17:18.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, we are
going to
have to leave it there, as we
said, so many

17:18.871 --> 17:20.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
questions in this.

17:20.105 --> 17:21.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know we're going to be
coming back to
it.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Noah Bookbinder, Richard
Painter, we thank
you both.

17:24.343 --> 17:25.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NOAH BOOKBINDER: Thank you so
much.

17:25.577 --> 17:31.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RICHARD PAINTER: Thank you,
Judy.

17:31.116 --> 17:40.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
today renewed
his call for U.S. agencies to --
quote -- "buy

17:40.225 --> 17:45.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American and hire American"
following a tour
of a tool-making plant in
Kenosha, Wisconsin

17:45.264 --> 17:46.231 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

17:46.265 --> 17:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our William Brangham has the
story.

17:48.033 --> 17:51.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: During his
Wisconsin visit,
the president signed an
executive order to

17:51.904 --> 17:56.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
encourage federal agencies to
use more American
workers and products.

17:56.375 --> 18:02.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It also targeted what are known
as H-1B guest
worker visas, which the
president said hurt

18:02.147 --> 18:04.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
those same workers.

18:04.049 --> 18:07.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Right now, H-1B visas are
awarded in a totally

18:08.020 --> 18:11.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
random lottery, and that's
wrong.

18:11.423 --> 18:16.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, they should be given to
the most
skilled and highest paid
applicants, and they

18:16.962 --> 18:20.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
should never, ever be used to
replace Americans.

18:20.232 --> 18:26.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No one can compete with American
workers when
they are given a fair and level
playing field,

18:26.371 --> 18:28.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which has not happened for
decades.

18:28.607 --> 18:33.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The H-1B visa
system is
meant to help U.S. employers
find foreign

18:33.078 --> 18:37.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
labor to fill highly technical
jobs they can't
fill with U.S. workers.

18:37.382 --> 18:41.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But critics, including the
president, say
the system is being abused.

18:41.186 --> 18:44.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We turn to two people who have
followed this
issue closely.

18:44.523 --> 18:48.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Daniel Costa is director of
immigration law
and policy research at the
Economic Policy

18:48.827 --> 18:52.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Institute, a nonpartisan think
tank here in
Washington, D.C.

18:52.831 --> 18:58.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Vivek Wadhwa is a
distinguished fellow
and adjunct professor at
Carnegie Mellon University's

18:58.203 --> 18:59.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
College of Engineering.

18:59.338 --> 19:02.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He teaches and writes on
technology and entrepreneurship.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

19:04.443 --> 19:05.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Daniel Costa, I would like to
start with you.

19:05.811 --> 19:09.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You heard the brief introduction
that I made
about these visas.

19:09.047 --> 19:11.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Explain, what is the intention
of the H-1B
visa?

19:11.483 --> 19:14.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL COSTA, Economic Policy
Institute: Well,
the program is usually sold by
the companies

19:14.987 --> 19:19.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that use it as a program to
bring in the best
and the brightest workers from
abroad and

19:19.658 --> 19:23.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
also to be used when no
qualified U.S. workers
can be found.

19:23.929 --> 19:27.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the reality is, though, that
that's not
what the law requires.

19:27.332 --> 19:32.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Employers are not required to
search for and
offer jobs to U.S. workers, and
they can also

19:33.005 --> 19:37.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pay much lower wages, based on
the way the
wage rules are set up in the
program.

19:37.209 --> 19:42.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that's sort of the main
-- the two
main things that are wrong with
the program,

19:42.548 --> 19:47.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and so the program doesn't have
a lot of credibility,
and some fixes are definitely
required.

19:47.152 --> 19:51.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Vivek Wadhwa,
the president
argues that there is a ready
supply of American

19:51.623 --> 19:55.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tech workers to fill these jobs
and that the
visa program is being abused.

19:55.761 --> 19:57.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is your reaction to that?

19:57.529 --> 20:00.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIVEK WADHWA, Carnegie Mellon
University:
There are people with some
skills, but the

20:00.866 --> 20:05.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
type of skills that Silicon
Valley is looking
for are always in short supply
because technology

20:05.370 --> 20:07.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is changing so fast.

20:07.272 --> 20:10.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And immigration is the lifeblood
of Silicon
Valley.

20:10.209 --> 20:14.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, yes, there is some is
abuse, but
it is badly needed by Silicon
Valley for what

20:14.379 --> 20:17.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it does, which is to build these
amazing,
new, innovative product.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Daniel Costa,
what do you
respond to that?

20:19.985 --> 20:23.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does this complement U.S.
workers or does
it replace the workers?

20:23.188 --> 20:26.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL COSTA: ®MD-BO / I think
that there's
no question that America needs
the best and

20:26.458 --> 20:27.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the brightest skilled immigrants
from abroad.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't think anybody is
debating that.

20:29.728 --> 20:33.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what is at issue here is
the terms
and conditions under which those
migrants

20:33.865 --> 20:35.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
come to work in the United
States.

20:35.734 --> 20:38.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're coming in a visa that
ties them to
their employers, so they're
quasi-indentured.

20:38.203 --> 20:41.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they're able to be paid much
lower wages.

20:41.073 --> 20:46.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what you have is, the
program is set
up in a way that has four wage
levels, and

20:46.912 --> 20:51.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the two lowest wage levels are
below the local
average wage for the job, and 80
percent of

20:51.717 --> 20:55.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the H-1B jobs that are coming in
are coming
in at a wage that is lower than
the local

20:55.254 --> 20:56.989 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
average wage.

20:57.022 --> 21:00.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what that means is that
either these
are the best and brightest
workers who are

21:00.092 --> 21:03.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coming in, and they're being
vastly underpaid,
or they're just entry-level
workers who are

21:03.862 --> 21:05.163 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coming in.

21:05.197 --> 21:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those lower level wages are
listed as the
entry-level wage.

21:08.066 --> 21:09.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, that's the reality.

21:09.901 --> 21:16.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that prioritizing
higher-wage visas
or higher-skilled workers coming
in under

21:16.208 --> 21:19.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those visas, it won't lower the
number that
are coming in, and certainly
some companies

21:19.311 --> 21:21.213 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
really need these workers.

21:21.246 --> 21:25.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But we should shift to a
higher-wage, higher-skill
work force that comes in on the
visas.

21:25.884 --> 21:28.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Vivek, what's
your reaction
to that?

21:28.887 --> 21:33.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're bringing workers in
from other lands,
and they are being paid less
than American

21:33.925 --> 21:38.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
workers, there is a fundamental
fairness issue,
that many American workers,
including the

21:38.230 --> 21:40.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president, would say, that's not
right, we
shouldn't be doing that.

21:40.832 --> 21:41.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
VIVEK WADHWA: Yes.

21:41.833 --> 21:42.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I agree with that, by the
way.

21:42.834 --> 21:44.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I agree with what Daniel says.

21:44.603 --> 21:48.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the problem is that this
visa ties the
worker to the employer, which is
where the

21:48.840 --> 21:50.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
indentured servitude comes from.

21:50.676 --> 21:54.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when you're waiting for a
green card,
for which for Indians could take
10, 15 years,

21:54.746 --> 21:58.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're basically locked into
that employer,
and the employer does pay
substandard wages

21:58.750 --> 22:00.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because the employer can get
away with it.

22:00.285 --> 22:01.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have people who are locked
in.

22:01.753 --> 22:04.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
A very simple solution.

22:04.256 --> 22:09.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's -- a very simple solution.

22:09.761 --> 22:11.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's decouple the employer from
the visa.

22:11.596 --> 22:17.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In other words, let the visa go
to the employee,
so that the employee can shift
jobs and go

22:17.135 --> 22:18.804 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the highest-paid employer.

22:18.837 --> 22:21.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why do we have to have them
linked up the
way they are?

22:21.106 --> 22:25.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we did that, suddenly, the
market forces
would prevail, and it would fix
the problem

22:25.644 --> 22:28.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in one fell swoop, except we
don't talk about
it.

22:28.914 --> 22:32.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of the attacks on the visa
are to stop
immigration altogether and to
cut off the

22:32.918 --> 22:34.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lifeline to Silicon Valley.

22:34.720 --> 22:38.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to have intelligent
conversations
and fix the real problem there
is, which is

22:38.423 --> 22:40.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tethering the employee to the
employer.

22:40.926 --> 22:43.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Would that be
a solution?

22:43.795 --> 22:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the worker came in, and the
visa belonged
to them, and then, if they
didn't like the

22:48.166 --> 22:52.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pay they were getting at company
A, couldn't
they then just go and work for
company B?

22:52.237 --> 22:56.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL COSTA: ®MD-BO / That just
wouldn't
be enough to fix the way the
program is set

22:56.742 --> 22:57.909 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

22:57.943 --> 22:59.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is a very easy, simple
solution that's
out there.

22:59.711 --> 23:04.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been proposed in bipartisan
legislation
by Senators Durbin and Grassley,
and all it

23:04.683 --> 23:09.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would simply do is require that
employers
recruit and hire U.S. workers
before hiring

23:09.121 --> 23:14.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an H-1B worker, and it would
require that
employers pay at least the local
average wage,

23:14.326 --> 23:16.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so eliminate the two lowest wage
levels.

23:16.661 --> 23:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then it would also create a
prioritization
scheme for the lottery that
allocates the

23:21.967 --> 23:23.869 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
visas.

23:23.902 --> 23:29.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, the tech industry and
the corporate
lobbies have been strongly
against these basically

23:29.408 --> 23:32.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
simple, commonsense solutions.

23:32.244 --> 23:36.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just being able to switch to
another employer
is not going to fix a lot of the
problems.

23:36.148 --> 23:39.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's something, and I think that
we should
move away from these
non-immigrant temporary

23:39.785 --> 23:43.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
visa statuses, because they're
terrible for
workers, because they are tied
to employers.

23:43.221 --> 23:46.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's the same issue with
low-skilled visas.

23:46.625 --> 23:48.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But workers need to be coming
in.

23:48.627 --> 23:52.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to be making sure that
there is an
actual labor shortage, an actual
need before

23:52.464 --> 23:54.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the worker comes in.

23:54.332 --> 23:58.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, once they come in, we
should be
putting them on a quick and easy
path to permanent

23:58.103 --> 23:59.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
residency and a green card and
citizenship.

23:59.771 --> 24:01.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Vivek, what do
you think
of that?

24:01.373 --> 24:03.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a lot of proposals
there, but the
idea that...

24:03.809 --> 24:05.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIVEK WADHWA: Too complex.

24:05.644 --> 24:11.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: ... if a job
for a computer
engineer of a certain category
is $150,000

24:11.216 --> 24:14.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a year, that's what the
immigrant laborer
should be paid as well?

24:14.085 --> 24:16.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIVEK WADHWA: I agree with that.

24:16.254 --> 24:20.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if the employee is allowed
to change jobs
-- keep it simple.

24:20.225 --> 24:24.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the employee can change jobs
like every
other American can right now,
the employer

24:24.095 --> 24:25.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
would have to pay market wages.

24:25.363 --> 24:27.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The employer will select the
best person.

24:27.132 --> 24:30.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Why do we have to become
nationalistic and
saying you have to have white
skin or you

24:30.202 --> 24:33.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have to be born in America to
get a job with
an American company?

24:33.538 --> 24:37.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The majority of the income that
-- a lot of
American companies will say this
from abroad.

24:38.009 --> 24:39.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They market their goods
globally.

24:39.778 --> 24:43.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we're now going to shut off
the rest of
the world, the rest of the world
will shut

24:43.315 --> 24:45.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
us off and it will impact our
economy.

24:45.517 --> 24:49.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The simplest thing over here is
to untether
the visa from the employer and
let the free

24:50.021 --> 24:51.156 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
market prevail.

24:51.189 --> 24:53.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is what makes America
great, is the free
market.

24:53.425 --> 24:55.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's go back to that.

24:55.327 --> 25:00.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's not have more regulation
or more loopholes
that can be subverted, which is
what we were

25:00.632 --> 25:01.867 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
talking about.

25:01.900 --> 25:03.001 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Simple.

25:03.034 --> 25:04.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Untether the two things, let the
free market
rule.

25:04.636 --> 25:06.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what I'm saying.

25:06.438 --> 25:09.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Daniel Costa,
Vivek Wadhwa, thank you both
very much for

25:09.107 --> 25:11.610 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
being here.

25:11.643 --> 25:17.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DANIEL COSTA: ®MD-BO / Thank you.

25:17.949 --> 25:24.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As we reported
earlier, British
Prime Minister Theresa May
announced today

25:24.422 --> 25:29.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she would ask for elections to
be held this
June, instead of in 2020.

25:29.828 --> 25:31.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has that.

25:31.630 --> 25:34.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: The prime
minister's request
for snap elections was made with
an eye towards

25:34.933 --> 25:39.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shoring up her negotiating
position, as the
United Kingdom heads into tough
talks over

25:39.804 --> 25:42.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the terms of its exit from the
European Union.

25:42.874 --> 25:46.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After repeatedly saying she
would not call
for clearly elections, it was a
move that

25:46.711 --> 25:48.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
took many by surprise.

25:48.647 --> 25:52.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From London, we're joined by
Stephanie Baker,
a senior writer at Bloomberg.

25:52.684 --> 25:57.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stephanie, first with that
surprise, how big
was it, or even shock for many
there, and

25:57.622 --> 25:59.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
how was it taken?

25:59.524 --> 26:03.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHANIE BAKER, Bloomberg: It
was a big shock,
and it was -- a lot of people
were surprised

26:03.828 --> 26:06.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it hadn't leaked out beforehand.

26:06.197 --> 26:12.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you noted in your report,
she, Theresa
May, the prime minister, has
ruled out an

26:12.170 --> 26:15.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
early election repeatedly over
the past few
months.

26:15.440 --> 26:17.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And people took her at her word.

26:17.509 --> 26:20.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So even members of her own party
were taken
aback by the decision.

26:20.879 --> 26:24.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, how fractured
is the political
debate there?

26:24.082 --> 26:29.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Was there a sense that she did
this because
she realized she needed a strong
mandate in

26:29.487 --> 26:33.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
order to shore up her support
over Brexit?

26:33.391 --> 26:36.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STEPHANIE BAKER: Yes.

26:36.528 --> 26:42.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her Conservative Party has a
slim 17-seat
majority in Parliament, and you
know, I think

26:42.300 --> 26:45.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she is taking a calculated bet
here.

26:45.270 --> 26:50.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's taken a look at the polls,
which give
her Conservative Party a
20-point lead, and

26:50.775 --> 26:57.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she thinks she could increase
her majority
in Parliament by picking up
disaffected voters

26:57.082 --> 27:03.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the opposition Labor Party,
particularly
those who supported Brexit in
the north, to

27:03.822 --> 27:09.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
increase her majority, so that
when she goes
to Brussels to negotiate the
U.K.'s exit from

27:09.094 --> 27:16.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the E.U., she can come back with
a deal, and
not be attacked for any kind of
compromises

27:16.034 --> 27:26.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or, you know, negotiating
conclusions by the
hard anti-European wing of her
own party.

27:26.444 --> 27:29.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And how big a
personal risk
is she taking?

27:29.614 --> 27:35.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I saw that opposition figures
were already
painting her as a kind of
opportunist trying

27:35.086 --> 27:37.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to take advantage of things
here.

27:37.322 --> 27:45.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHANIE BAKER: Well, yes, I
mean, I think
she runs a personal risk of
undermining her

27:45.096 --> 27:49.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
own credibility, since she did
say so many
times that she wouldn't hold an
early election,

27:49.934 --> 27:55.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the country didn't need
another election,
that it would undermine
stability.

27:55.707 --> 28:00.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She does look like another
politician who
has gone back on her word, and I
think that

28:00.178 --> 28:03.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
will play out during the
campaign over the
next seven weeks.

28:03.048 --> 28:08.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, one of the
big questions,
of course, is to what extent
this reopens

28:08.420 --> 28:10.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the whole question of Brexit.

28:10.455 --> 28:14.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much will it be the subject
of debate
in this election?

28:14.659 --> 28:20.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHANIE BAKER: I think that's
what a lot
of people are talking about now.

28:20.532 --> 28:25.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Traditionally, the U.K. has been
dominated
by the two main political
parties, the Conservatives

28:25.870 --> 28:28.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the left-leaning Labor
Party.

28:28.673 --> 28:31.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Labor Party is in a current
state of disarray.

28:31.209 --> 28:37.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's led by a weak leader,
Jeremy Corbyn,
who is regarded as very un-prime
ministerial.

28:37.649 --> 28:41.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a third party called
the Liberal
Democrats who were part of a
governing coalition

28:41.453 --> 28:43.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
between 2010 and 2015.

28:43.888 --> 28:48.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have positioned themselves
as the party
of the remain vote, that is, the
48 percent

28:48.793 --> 28:55.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of British voters who backed
staying in the
E.U., and they are trying to
turn this election

28:55.767 --> 28:59.504 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into a kind of quasi-rerun of
the referendum.

28:59.537 --> 29:03.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether or not they will be able
to do that,
how many seats they will be able
to pick by

29:03.108 --> 29:05.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
running that strategy is
unclear.

29:05.076 --> 29:10.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, certainly, in areas like
London and the
South of England, which voted
overwhelmingly

29:10.048 --> 29:13.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for remain, they're likely to
pick up quite
a number of seats.

29:13.084 --> 29:15.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So it's hard to see how the
balance will change.

29:15.186 --> 29:18.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And just briefly,
in 30 seconds
or so, Stephanie, Americans, of
course, are

29:18.890 --> 29:21.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
used to endless, years-long
elections.

29:21.326 --> 29:25.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is June 8, so it's very
quick.

29:25.296 --> 29:27.932 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STEPHANIE BAKER: It is.

29:27.966 --> 29:30.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's seven weeks of campaigning.

29:30.201 --> 29:33.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parties are going to have to be
writing their
election manifestos, getting
fund-raising

29:33.471 --> 29:34.439 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in place.

29:34.472 --> 29:36.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It will be incredibly quick.

29:36.074 --> 29:37.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is not unexpected.

29:37.876 --> 29:41.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were many people amongst
all of the
different parties who thought
that she would

29:41.279 --> 29:42.514 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
call it.

29:42.547 --> 29:44.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The timing, of course, caught
many people
by surprise.

29:44.949 --> 29:50.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Stephanie Baker
of Bloomberg
in London, thank you very much.

29:50.889 --> 30:04.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, from the
prime minister's
surprise news of today, to a
surprise Theresa

30:04.302 --> 30:10.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
May brought to the White House
in January,
and the debate it's sparked
across Great Britain.

30:10.542 --> 30:14.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
From London, special
correspondent Ryan Chilcote
has this look.

30:14.746 --> 30:21.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: It was supposed
to be a diplomatic
coup, the British prime minister
beating the

30:21.586 --> 30:23.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
world's leaders to the Oval
Office.

30:23.388 --> 30:29.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
I am honored to have Prime
Minister Theresa

30:29.761 --> 30:32.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
May here for our first official
visit.

30:32.730 --> 30:35.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: May didn't just
return the
favor.

30:35.600 --> 30:40.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She upped the ante, extending an
honor only
two U.S. presidents have
received since 1952.

30:40.738 --> 30:44.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THERESA MAY, British Prime
Minister: I have
today been able to convey Her
Majesty the

30:44.609 --> 30:49.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Queen's hope that President
Trump and the
first lady would pay a state
visit to the

30:49.080 --> 30:53.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United Kingdom later this year,
and I'm delighted
the president has accepted that
invitation.

30:53.918 --> 30:57.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: Then, things got
awkward.

30:57.755 --> 31:06.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Three days later, 20,000
protesters gathered
outside the prime minister's
office to denounce

31:06.297 --> 31:13.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the travel ban President Trump
imposed just
hours after May left, then,
another day of

31:13.037 --> 31:21.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
demonstrations, then another --
1.8 million
Brits signed a petition
demanding the prime

31:21.412 --> 31:23.348 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
minister cancel the state visit.

31:23.381 --> 31:28.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If 10 of the last 12 American
presidents who'd
come weren't given the honor,
why should President

31:28.653 --> 31:30.054 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump?

31:30.088 --> 31:31.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Parliament gathered for a
debate.

31:31.823 --> 31:34.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAULA SHERRIFF, Parliament
Member: Does he
agree that to use the expression
grab them

31:34.626 --> 31:39.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the (EXPLETIVE DELETED)
describes a sexual
assault, and therefore suggests
that he shouldn't

31:39.464 --> 31:41.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be afforded a visit to our
queen?

31:41.900 --> 31:47.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: At 82, Paul Flynn
is the senior
member of the House of Commons.

31:47.138 --> 31:50.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The debate in this country isn't
about whether
Donald Trump comes here.

31:50.308 --> 31:53.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been about whether he is
treated to a
state visit.

31:53.778 --> 31:55.513 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's the big deal?

31:55.546 --> 31:57.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL FLYNN, Parliament Member:
The big deal
is that only two American
presidents since

31:57.982 --> 32:02.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
1952 have been given this
special honor of
a state visit.

32:02.186 --> 32:07.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're giving this unique
privilege to
Donald Trump after being in
office for seven

32:07.091 --> 32:08.493 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
days.

32:08.526 --> 32:12.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was an act of desperation by
a prime minister
that's in deep trouble.

32:12.330 --> 32:17.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're losing our markets in
Europe because
of Brexit, and she's desperate
to ingratiate

32:17.669 --> 32:21.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
herself with America in order to
try to win
new markets.

32:21.873 --> 32:23.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't want to give him
privileged treatment.

32:23.708 --> 32:26.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We want to show him our contempt
and disdain.

32:26.611 --> 32:32.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: President Trump's
visit to
the U.K. has become politically
fraught.

32:32.150 --> 32:36.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every aspect of the trip, from
the timing
to the itinerary, is in flux.

32:36.521 --> 32:37.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Barack Obama.

32:37.855 --> 32:39.791 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

32:39.824 --> 32:44.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: Six years ago,
President Trump's
predecessor was granted the
highest of honors

32:44.562 --> 32:49.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the opportunity to address
Parliament during
his state visit.

32:49.400 --> 32:53.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was ruled out this time
around before
it could even be debated.

32:53.304 --> 32:55.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Bercow is the speaker of
the House of
Commons.

32:55.773 --> 33:01.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BERCOW, Speaker, House of
Commons: Before
the imposition of the migrant
ban, I would

33:01.913 --> 33:09.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
myself have been strongly
opposed to an address
by President Trump in
Westminster Hall.

33:09.320 --> 33:18.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After the imposition of the
migrant ban by
President Trump, I am even more
strongly opposed.

33:18.196 --> 33:24.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: The state banquet
is a staple
of state visits, so that's in.

33:24.802 --> 33:29.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Protests are also a regular
feature.

33:29.273 --> 33:35.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A foray into the countryside
kept London's
protesters away from President
Bush in 2003

33:35.346 --> 33:37.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
during his state visit.

33:37.115 --> 33:42.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This time, the planners are
looking at going
even further, to the north.

33:42.186 --> 33:43.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Scotland's an option.

33:43.988 --> 33:48.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rural and remote, it's not a
likely place
for tens of thousands of
protesters to gather,

33:49.027 --> 33:55.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and yet, even here, not
everyone's a fan.

33:55.433 --> 34:00.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump owns two golf
courses in Scotland,
including this one built on a
pristine patch

34:00.471 --> 34:05.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of 4,000-year-old sand dunes.

34:05.276 --> 34:10.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Milne's house overlooks
the course and
the sea, or at least it did,
until he refused

34:10.748 --> 34:13.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to sell his property to
President Trump.

34:13.151 --> 34:16.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you used have a completely
unimpeded view
here.

34:16.854 --> 34:19.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID MILNE, Scotland: Yes, we
had 40 miles
of uninterrupted coastline.

34:19.657 --> 34:22.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: And now you have
got the fence.

34:22.693 --> 34:25.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MILNE: Yes, and Trump
provided the trees,
which, as you can see, are dying
slowly.

34:25.797 --> 34:30.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: Milne has flown
two flags ever
since Trump visited Scotland
last year.

34:30.968 --> 34:33.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The one on top is Scotland's.

34:33.538 --> 34:35.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what possessed you to put up
a Mexican
flag?

34:35.606 --> 34:39.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MILNE: Donald Trump had
recently made
the announcement that he was
going to build

34:39.210 --> 34:41.813 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a border wall and send the bill
to Mexico.

34:41.846 --> 34:45.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, he did basically the same
thing here
with a small fence, and he sent
me the bill.

34:45.616 --> 34:47.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: Michael Forbes
wouldn't sell
either.

34:47.318 --> 34:52.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL FORBES, Scotland: The
first thing
he said is was, what's this land
worth?

34:52.256 --> 34:54.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Twenty-five dollars an acre.

34:54.492 --> 34:57.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
(EXPLETIVE DELETED) I said in
your (EXPLETIVE
DELETED) dreams.

34:57.795 --> 34:58.996 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

34:59.030 --> 35:01.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL FORBES: Yes, there will
be protesters,
all right.

35:01.432 --> 35:06.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: If there's one
place in all
of the United Kingdom that can
provide security

35:06.571 --> 35:15.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and privacy during President
Trump's visit,
it's here at the queen's holiday
home in Scotland.

35:15.379 --> 35:19.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump has reportedly
asked to play
golf on the queen's private
course at her

35:19.117 --> 35:23.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Scottish castle, Balmoral.

35:23.154 --> 35:24.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That would be a real honor.

35:24.856 --> 35:29.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The last president Queen
Elizabeth II met
at her private home was Dwight
Eisenhower

35:29.994 --> 35:31.429 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 1959.

35:31.462 --> 35:36.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: He went to Balmoral to
stay with
the royal family, remember?

35:36.567 --> 35:41.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: According to one
poll, close
to half of the British public
supports the

35:41.539 --> 35:43.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
idea of a state visit.

35:43.474 --> 35:48.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is also support for the
president, himself,
though in all of the
parliamentary debate,

35:48.279 --> 35:50.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this was the closest anyone got
to it.

35:50.081 --> 35:52.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NIGEL EVANS, Member of
Parliament: I would
like to respect the fact that he
stood on

35:52.750 --> 35:55.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a platform which is he is now
delivering.

35:55.520 --> 36:00.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's going to go down in history
as being
roundly condemned for being the
only politician

36:00.625 --> 36:02.393 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to deliver on his promises.

36:02.426 --> 36:07.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: Most who back the
visit, though,
do so despite the president's
policies.

36:07.265 --> 36:13.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a selfie that Hillary
took up in Derry,
New Hampshire, in January last
year.

36:13.070 --> 36:17.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: Sir Simon Burns
traveled to
the U.S. to campaign on behalf
of Hillary

36:17.808 --> 36:19.277 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton.

36:19.310 --> 36:22.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is a conservative member of
Parliament
who supports the state visit.

36:22.380 --> 36:24.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SIR SIMON BURNS, Member of
Parliament: We
stand by America.

36:24.348 --> 36:25.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
America stands by us.

36:25.449 --> 36:27.118 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's in our national interest.

36:27.151 --> 36:31.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And regardless of who's
president, we have
got to get on with the United
States.

36:31.822 --> 36:36.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: Fellow member of
Parliament
Bob Neill says the visit should
be looked

36:36.060 --> 36:37.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at in perspective.

36:37.895 --> 36:40.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB NEILL, Member of Parliament:
We have had
out-and-out dictators like
Nicolae Ceausescu

36:40.998 --> 36:43.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Robert Mugabe come over in
the past.

36:43.634 --> 36:48.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, whatever my personal
distaste for Mr.
Trump's style and policies in
some areas,

36:49.006 --> 36:50.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's a democratically elected
politician.

36:50.908 --> 36:56.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN CHILCOTE: President Trump
and Prime Minister
May have agreed to postpone the
visit until

36:56.447 --> 37:00.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
October to give British
protesters a chance
to cool off.

37:00.418 --> 37:10.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Reporting for the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm Ryan
Chilcote in London.

37:10.394 --> 37:21.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fallout from
Sunday's referendum
vote in Turkey continued today,
with critics

37:21.439 --> 37:26.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan calling
for the results to be annulled.

37:26.377 --> 37:31.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is just one of a series of
important
issues being dealt with by the
Senate Foreign

37:31.048 --> 37:32.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Relations Committee.

37:33.017 --> 37:38.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke just a short while ago
with its ranking
member, Democratic Senator Ben
Cardin of Maryland.

37:38.356 --> 37:44.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I began by asking him if he was
concerned
by President Trump's call last
night to President

37:44.061 --> 37:46.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Erdogan to congratulate him on
his apparent
victory.

37:46.764 --> 37:48.532 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

37:48.566 --> 37:52.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN CARDIN (D), Maryland: Well,
Turkey is
a very vibrant democracy, and
it's, of course,

37:52.103 --> 37:53.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
one of our NATO allies.

37:53.904 --> 37:55.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They had a referendum.

37:55.139 --> 37:58.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The referendum, according to
local officials,
did pass.

37:58.643 --> 38:03.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are certainly concerned about
some of the
powers that are being
consolidated by Mr.

38:03.147 --> 38:07.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Erdogan, and about the checks
and balances
in their own system.

38:07.385 --> 38:12.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's also been questions
raised as to the
legitimacy of some of the votes
that were

38:12.757 --> 38:14.191 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cast.

38:14.225 --> 38:16.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there are still issues that
I think need
to be addressed by Turkey.

38:16.294 --> 38:21.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As far as President Trump
calling President
Erdogan, that's a personal
decision he made.

38:22.033 --> 38:25.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's important to
recognize this is
an important ally.

38:25.036 --> 38:30.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so you are
watching the
way ballots were cast?

38:30.074 --> 38:35.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I ask because European observers
are saying
that some 2.5 million ballots
may have been

38:35.579 --> 38:36.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cast fraudulently.

38:36.580 --> 38:37.648 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

38:37.682 --> 38:39.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN CARDIN: Yes, I'm very
concerned about
that.

38:39.850 --> 38:43.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's been some legitimate
concerns raised
about some of the techniques
that were used

38:43.721 --> 38:47.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the way the election was
conducted.

38:47.458 --> 38:48.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So we are concerned.

38:48.459 --> 38:49.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was a close election.

38:49.694 --> 38:52.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was not a -- it was a pretty
close call
between the two.

38:52.363 --> 38:57.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The amount of resources that
were made available
were certainly not equal on both
sides.

38:57.902 --> 39:02.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are some questions on some
of the processes
that -- procedures that were
used.

39:02.540 --> 39:04.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, yes, we are concerned.

39:04.375 --> 39:08.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we hope that the Erdogan
government will
have a complete independent
investigation

39:08.646 --> 39:10.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on how the elections itself were
conducted.

39:10.648 --> 39:12.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me turn you
to North Korea.

39:12.416 --> 39:17.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you know, tensions have been
raised significantly
just in the last few days.

39:17.588 --> 39:21.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The rhetoric, both from the
United States,
from the Trump administration,
and from the

39:21.692 --> 39:24.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
North Koreans, has gotten
hotter.

39:25.029 --> 39:31.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This administration is saying
what they call
the era of strategic patience is
over.

39:31.202 --> 39:34.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night on this program, I
interviewed
the former Defense Secretary
William Perry,

39:34.805 --> 39:39.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who said he's alarmed by the
state of relations
between our two countries.

39:39.610 --> 39:40.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where do you stand?

39:40.611 --> 39:41.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How concerned are you?

39:41.812 --> 39:42.780 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

39:42.813 --> 39:44.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BEN CARDIN: Well, I'm very, very
concerned.

39:44.382 --> 39:48.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clearly, the young leader of
North Korea is
a very dangerous person.

39:48.352 --> 39:50.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're not sure how he makes
decisions.

39:50.254 --> 39:55.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen what he does to
people who oppose
him, including members of his
own family.

39:55.659 --> 39:57.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's not a stable leader.

39:57.661 --> 40:02.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now is the time for the United
States to exercise
some very mature international
leadership

40:03.000 --> 40:08.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to try to calm things down on
the Korean Peninsula,
and to change the calculation
for North Korea,

40:08.773 --> 40:15.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so that it's -- they recognize
it's in their
interests to negotiate the end
of the nuclear

40:15.146 --> 40:16.981 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
weapon program.

40:17.014 --> 40:23.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That requires China to be much
more aggressive
in isolating North Korea with
the sanctions

40:23.387 --> 40:27.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that have been imposed, so that
we can really
make it clear to North Korea
that their only

40:27.792 --> 40:31.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
path forward is to negotiate
with the international
community.

40:31.829 --> 40:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That requires strong, mature
U.S. leadership.

40:35.299 --> 40:39.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need a game plan that can
accomplish those
types of objectives on the
Korean Peninsula.

40:39.370 --> 40:42.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are you seeing
that game plan
from this administration?

40:42.873 --> 40:44.408 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

40:44.442 --> 40:47.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN CARDIN: No, I'm not -- I'm
not clear what
the administration's policy is.

40:47.511 --> 40:49.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They haven't really shared that
with Congress.

40:49.146 --> 40:53.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I'm not sure they have a
comprehensive policy
for the Korean Peninsula.

40:53.384 --> 40:58.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want to make sure that North
Korea doesn't
possess the ability to use
nuclear weapons,

40:58.856 --> 41:02.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
particularly to be able to
deliver those nuclear
weapons through the missiles
that they are

41:02.526 --> 41:06.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
testing, and that we want to
make sure also
that North Korea is more in
harmony with the

41:06.597 --> 41:09.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
international community in the
way they treat
its own people.

41:09.967 --> 41:13.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, and, obviously, we're
concerned about
the security of South Korea.

41:13.771 --> 41:17.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there's a lot of interest
that the United
States has on the Korean
Peninsula.

41:17.241 --> 41:21.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And we haven't seen an
articulated, coordinated
policy from this administration.

41:21.846 --> 41:23.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're moving
around the world.

41:23.647 --> 41:28.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's so much to ask you
about, Senator,
but I also want to speak to you
about Russia.

41:28.552 --> 41:33.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Besides Russian meddling in U.S.
elections,
there's now growing concern
about Russian

41:33.457 --> 41:37.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
involvement in upcoming
elections in France
and in Germany.

41:37.127 --> 41:45.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You are the sponsor, along with
others, a
bipartisan bill in the Senate to
impose sanctions

41:45.102 --> 41:49.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on Russia for cyber-activity.

41:49.373 --> 41:51.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was -- that legislation was
introduced
months ago.

41:51.809 --> 41:53.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Russians are still doing
this.

41:54.011 --> 42:01.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do they -- what's your sense of
how seriously
they take any sort of
retaliation or action

42:01.151 --> 42:02.119 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by the U.S.?

42:02.152 --> 42:04.054 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

42:04.088 --> 42:07.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN CARDIN: Well, we do know
that the sanctions
that were led by the United
States, and which

42:07.658 --> 42:12.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Europe has joined us, has had a
major impact
on the Russian economy.

42:12.162 --> 42:17.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we believe sanctions can be
very effective
in changing the equation for
Russia and what

42:17.501 --> 42:22.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're doing, not just in
meddling in our
elections or meddling in
European elections,

42:22.573 --> 42:27.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but what they're doing in
Ukraine and the
annexation of Crimea -- there's
still engagement

42:28.012 --> 42:32.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the eastern part of Ukraine
-- and the
manner in which they are
supporting the Assad

42:32.116 --> 42:34.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
regime in Syria committing war
crimes.

42:34.952 --> 42:40.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All those behaviors by Russia,
we believe,
need to change, and we believe
sanctions can

42:40.357 --> 42:42.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be a major part of that.

42:42.059 --> 42:46.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, yes, we want to enhance
those sanctions
to make them stronger.

42:46.096 --> 42:52.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a strong bipartisan
group, 10 Democrats,
10 Republicans, that have joined
in this legislation.

42:52.503 --> 42:54.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We do know that Russia meddled
in our election.

42:55.005 --> 42:56.140 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We know that.

42:56.173 --> 42:58.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know that they meddled in the
Montenegro
election.

42:58.342 --> 43:00.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We know that and caused
violence.

43:00.144 --> 43:06.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that they're very active
today in
France and in Germany trying to
impact that

43:06.317 --> 43:11.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election, not only impact the
integrity of
the election, but also the
results, to get

43:11.322 --> 43:15.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a more pro-Russian leader --
leaders in Europe.

43:15.593 --> 43:20.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is totally unacceptable,
and we need
to be united with our European
allies to prevent

43:20.164 --> 43:21.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that from happening.

43:21.699 --> 43:23.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And is the Trump
administration
supporting that legislation?

43:23.567 --> 43:25.336 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

43:25.369 --> 43:29.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN CARDIN: Well, I really have
not had much
communication with the Trump
administration

43:29.440 --> 43:31.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in regards to Russian policy.

43:31.809 --> 43:37.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are major players yet to
be named that
-- from the administration that
will require

43:37.181 --> 43:38.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Senate confirmation.

43:38.415 --> 43:42.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we're still awaiting their
full team to
be in place.

43:42.386 --> 43:45.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In my conversations with Mr.
Tillerson, I
have made it very clear.

43:45.589 --> 43:48.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think he's made it clear in
recent weeks.

43:48.926 --> 43:54.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we're trying to give the
administration
more tools it can use for an
effective policy

43:54.398 --> 43:56.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against Russia's aggressive
actions.

43:56.500 --> 44:01.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Ben
Cardin, the ranking
Democrat on the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee,

44:01.505 --> 44:02.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thank you very much.

44:02.506 --> 44:03.540 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

44:03.574 --> 44:08.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEN CARDIN: Thank you, Judy.

44:08.579 --> 44:21.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: a classroom
innovation
called career and technical
education, a hands-on

44:21.058 --> 44:23.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
learning method for high school
students.

44:23.394 --> 44:27.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is seen as a practical
approach for both
those headed to college and for
those who

44:27.765 --> 44:29.099 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are not.

44:29.133 --> 44:32.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in the Navajo Nation in
Arizona, it's
making a difference.

44:32.836 --> 44:38.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PBS special correspondent Lisa
Stark of our
partner Education Week brings us
this story

44:38.409 --> 44:41.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as part of our weekly segment
Making the Grade.

44:41.745 --> 44:46.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: This is a
one-of-a-kind classroom,
with a one-of-a-kind educator,
Clyde McBride.

44:46.150 --> 44:49.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLYDE MCBRIDE, Teacher, Kayenta
Unified School
District: My philosophy is a kid
don't learn

44:49.687 --> 44:51.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
unless they get a little dirty.

44:51.388 --> 44:57.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: So, in Clyde
McBride's classes
in Navajo Nation in Northeastern
Arizona,

44:57.828 --> 44:58.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
students jump right in.

44:58.829 --> 45:00.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLYDE MCBRIDE: You never hold
with your hands.

45:00.664 --> 45:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You hold with your forearm.

45:02.599 --> 45:04.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: The McBrides tell us,
you know, go
in there.

45:04.968 --> 45:08.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're not going to learn
anything if you
just kind of stand back and just
watch anything.

45:08.272 --> 45:14.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: This is hands-on
instruction in
veterinary science, part
classroom, part veterinary

45:14.111 --> 45:15.879 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
clinic.

45:15.913 --> 45:21.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Students work and observe in two
operating
rooms, one for small animals,
the other for

45:21.185 --> 45:23.253 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
large.

45:23.287 --> 45:31.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:66.67% size:87.5%
They conduct exams and
vaccinations in a
state-of-the-art
$2.4 million facility, part of
Monument Valley

45:31.562 --> 45:39.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
High School in Kayenta, Arizona,
and its career
and technical education program;
180 students,

45:39.136 --> 45:43.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than a quarter of the high
school, have
signed up for this program,
where abstract

45:43.774 --> 45:46.009 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
concepts meet the real world.

45:46.043 --> 45:51.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLYDE MCBRIDE: Before they go to
surgery,
ketamine puts them to sleep.

45:51.949 --> 45:54.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is an anesthesia.

45:54.551 --> 46:00.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's calculated by the
millimeter per
pound.

46:00.824 --> 46:06.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a math class, you get the
problem wrong,
you miss that question.

46:06.730 --> 46:11.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In my program, if you get that
math problem
wrong, that animal can die.

46:11.368 --> 46:15.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: McBride grew up
around animals
on a ranch in Arizona.

46:15.706 --> 46:21.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He lost his father at age 16 and
figured he'd
forgo college to stay home and
take care of

46:21.612 --> 46:22.746 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the cattle.

46:22.780 --> 46:24.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
His mother had other ideas.

46:24.648 --> 46:28.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLYDE MCBRIDE: I will never
forget going home
one day and she says: "We're
going to sign

46:28.752 --> 46:29.720 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
papers.

46:29.753 --> 46:31.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I just sold the ranch.

46:31.088 --> 46:32.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have got to go to college."

46:32.856 --> 46:37.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: He became a teacher
and, longing
for a rural district, jumped at
the job in

46:37.728 --> 46:39.496 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Kayenta.

46:39.530 --> 46:43.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLYDE MCBRIDE: When I came up
here, some of
my peer teachers were like, why
go to the

46:43.600 --> 46:44.802 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
reservation?

46:44.835 --> 46:47.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's going to be the worst
place that you
ever go to.

46:47.171 --> 46:51.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our school is 98 percent on the
free and reduced
lunch program.

46:51.375 --> 46:55.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A lot of our communities are
very, very poor.

46:55.112 --> 47:01.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: But that hasn't
slowed McBride,
or stopped him from dreaming
big.

47:01.685 --> 47:06.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELISSA MCBRIDE, Teacher: When
Mr. McBride
and I first started dating, we
would go out

47:06.657 --> 47:14.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to eat dinner and he would draw
on napkins
his vision of the agro-science
center.

47:14.464 --> 47:18.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would tell him all the
time, you're
crazy.

47:18.101 --> 47:22.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People don't invest money like
this in education,
especially in Native American
children.

47:22.172 --> 47:24.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLYDE MCBRIDE: I wouldn't accept
no as an
answer.

47:24.608 --> 47:28.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: It took decades to
turn his dream
into a reality.

47:28.846 --> 47:35.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A new superintendent found the
funding, and
students helped with the design.

47:35.085 --> 47:38.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Ag Center opened its doors
opened in 2011.

47:38.722 --> 47:43.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This program prepares students
for careers
and college and much more.

DR.

47:45.229 --> 47:48.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUZANNE SMITH, Veterinarian:
It's to get the
community and the kids and the
students and

47:48.665 --> 47:54.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their parents involved in a
better lifestyle
and better health for
themselves, for their

47:54.671 --> 47:58.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
animals, and making better
career choices
and making better life choices.

47:58.976 --> 48:00.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: And it's working.

48:00.978 --> 48:04.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Students in the veterinary
science program
do better than the state average
on math and

48:04.781 --> 48:10.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
English tests; 100 percent of
them graduate
high school, and three-quarters
of them go

48:10.554 --> 48:12.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on to college or training
programs.

48:13.023 --> 48:19.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The rest go on to a job, numbers
that would
be impressive anywhere, but
especially for

48:19.062 --> 48:25.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Native American students, who
post the lowest
graduation rates of any racial
or ethnic group.

48:25.068 --> 48:26.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLYDE MCBRIDE: We ignite the
fire.

48:26.904 --> 48:27.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We give them that passion.

48:28.005 --> 48:30.807 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We give them that leadership.

48:30.841 --> 48:35.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then whatever route they
want to choose,
then we support that route.

48:35.445 --> 48:38.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRESHES PARRISH-BEGAY, Student:
They made
sure I didn't fall off track.

48:38.515 --> 48:47.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They made sure I didn't -- I
didn't do anything
to ruin my chances of going
somewhere.

48:47.090 --> 48:50.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHELIA YENCHICK, Student: I
didn't really
have that much motivation from
my parents,

48:50.827 --> 48:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but here, the kids, they really
have a lot
of that from the teachers and
the community.

48:56.366 --> 49:00.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They really help them a lot, and
then they
reach their goals.

49:00.237 --> 49:05.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: The program has
enriched the students
and their community.

49:05.108 --> 49:10.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With the nearest vet hours away,
this is the
go-to clinic for the animals and
livestock

49:10.681 --> 49:13.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
families here depend on.

49:13.350 --> 49:16.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Animals are considered a sacred
part of the
Navajo culture.

49:16.420 --> 49:22.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MYRON HUDSON, Student: In my
culture, it's
like, if you take care of the
animals, they

49:22.592 --> 49:24.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
take care of you.

49:24.261 --> 49:28.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: McBride's goal is to
launch his
students on to college or good
jobs.

49:28.765 --> 49:31.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Many hope to come back to serve
their community.

49:31.368 --> 49:35.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLYDE MCBRIDE: The Navajo
belief, and really
the way I was raised, is you
want to leave

49:35.939 --> 49:39.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this world better than you found
it.

49:39.376 --> 49:42.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I can tell you that that's
what I took
into this program.

49:42.746 --> 49:48.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when I leave Kayenta some
day, it's going
to be better off than when I
came.

49:49.019 --> 49:57.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: I'm Lisa Stark of
Education Week
for the "PBS NewsHour."

49:57.227 --> 50:09.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, in our
"NewsHour" Shares
moment of the day: that sure
sign of spring,

50:09.840 --> 50:10.807 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tulips.

50:10.841 --> 50:12.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And no one knows them better
than the Dutch.

50:12.743 --> 50:19.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This year, the Royal Netherlands
Embassy in
Washington displayed some 10,000
at the ambassador's

50:19.116 --> 50:20.217 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
residence.

50:20.250 --> 50:23.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We took a tour with Caroline
Feitel from the
embassy.

50:23.053 --> 50:26.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CAROLINE FEITEL, Royal
Netherlands Embassy:
Our ambassador decided that,
this year, he

50:26.256 --> 50:31.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would like to do a spring event
where we show
off one of our biggest export
products.

50:31.728 --> 50:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we decided to do a tulip
event to celebrate
spring.

50:36.733 --> 50:41.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have over 10,000 tulips here,
and I would
say about 100 different
varieties.

50:41.405 --> 50:47.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Netherlands, we're the
second largest
exporter of agricultural
products in the world.

50:47.411 --> 50:53.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We export about two billion cut
tulips every
year.

50:53.150 --> 50:58.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we export to the United
States over a
billion bulbs, which half are
tulip bulbs.

50:58.655 --> 51:04.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, we're also very much
known for
Keukenhof, which has hundreds of
millions

51:04.227 --> 51:06.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of tulips during spring.

51:06.329 --> 51:07.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's endless.

51:07.798 --> 51:11.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's like a carpet of tulips
that you see,
and it is very impressive.

51:11.701 --> 51:15.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a lot of Dutch people, but
also a lot
of tourists come to the
Netherlands and want

51:15.105 --> 51:16.606 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to see that.

51:16.640 --> 51:20.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's a unique moment in the
Netherlands
every year in about mid-April.

51:20.677 --> 51:28.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the 16th century, there was a
lot of tulip
bulb speculation, and one bulb
could be the

51:28.318 --> 51:31.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
value of a house in Amsterdam.

51:31.221 --> 51:37.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's seen as the first
bubble speculation,
you know, commercial bubble in
the world.

51:37.661 --> 51:44.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every tulip you see comes from
one bulb that
was created by the grower, and
then had to

51:44.701 --> 51:45.802 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be multiplied.

51:45.836 --> 51:49.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the one bulb became four, and
the four
becomes 12.

51:49.039 --> 51:53.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that's why, when you have
a new variety
of tulip, it takes quite a while
before you

51:54.010 --> 51:58.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have the huge quantity to be
able to sell
it commercially.

51:58.782 --> 52:01.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They come in a huge variety of
colors.

52:01.885 --> 52:04.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have parrot ones that have
the multiple
colors.

52:04.921 --> 52:05.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have doubles.

52:05.989 --> 52:08.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, it's almost like three
tulips in
one.

52:08.925 --> 52:11.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Black doesn't exist.

52:11.361 --> 52:13.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then blue doesn't exist
either.

52:13.763 --> 52:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The closest you can get is a
deep purple.

52:16.366 --> 52:18.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, we played a little trick.

52:18.401 --> 52:22.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we have a blue tulip here
today that was
colored.

52:22.172 --> 52:25.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's originally a white tulip.

52:25.075 --> 52:29.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the way it's colored, it's
put in blue
water, and then it becomes a
beautiful blue.

52:29.379 --> 52:34.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tulips, they are definitely the
springtime
flower that you see around.

52:34.417 --> 52:38.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think it brings people
happiness.

52:38.822 --> 52:53.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tonight, on most
PBS stations,
"Frontline" presents "The Last
Days of Solitary,"

52:53.069 --> 52:58.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
following five inmates over
three years in
the Maine state prison system.

52:58.208 --> 53:03.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In this clip, a confined inmate
talks about
his violent tendencies.

53:03.380 --> 53:08.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Never hurt anybody that I
felt that didn't
deserve it.

53:08.885 --> 53:13.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Staff members, any staff member
I ever put
my hands on, I didn't stab any
of them.

53:13.690 --> 53:15.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Had multiple opportunities to.

53:15.559 --> 53:17.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have not done that.

53:17.494 --> 53:23.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When I was done, I walked up to
the desk.

53:23.800 --> 53:26.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The female that was on had her
back to me.

53:26.102 --> 53:31.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I threw the two shanks on the
desk, and I
told her, I said, I'm not here
to hurt you.

53:31.274 --> 53:32.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I held my hands up like this.

53:32.542 --> 53:36.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I go, I'm going to turn around,
put my hands
behind my back.

53:37.013 --> 53:37.981 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Cuff me.

53:38.014 --> 53:39.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I turned around, put my hands
behind my back.

53:39.683 --> 53:41.451 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
She froze up.

53:41.484 --> 53:44.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think she was kind of a little
in shock,
just didn't know what the hell
was going on.

53:44.554 --> 53:45.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She was like, is that your
blood?

53:45.589 --> 53:46.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that somebody's blood?

53:46.590 --> 53:47.624 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is that yours?

53:47.657 --> 53:49.392 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I said, hello.

53:49.426 --> 53:51.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Don't ask no questions.

53:51.761 --> 53:54.064 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Just cuff me up.

53:54.097 --> 53:55.799 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Call your code.

53:55.832 --> 53:58.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Am I a violent inmate?

53:58.134 --> 54:00.203 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I can be, yes.

54:00.237 --> 54:03.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You put me in certain
situations, I am going
to be like that.

54:03.306 --> 54:05.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's not no secret, though.

54:05.675 --> 54:07.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Anybody knows that.

54:07.510 --> 54:12.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online right
now: For Tax Day, this writer
says the current

54:12.649 --> 54:17.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. tax code should be scrapped
and completely
rewritten.

54:17.520 --> 54:18.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Last week, we profiled T.R.

54:18.989 --> 54:21.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Reid and his new book, "A Fine
Mess."

54:21.925 --> 54:28.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can now read an excerpt from
that book
on our Web site,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

54:29.032 --> 54:30.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

54:30.867 --> 54:37.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Wednesday: a preview of
Saturday's worldwide
march in support of scientific
research.

54:37.207 --> 54:38.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:38.408 --> 54:40.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening.

54:40.710 --> 54:50.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and we will see you soon.

54:50.754 --> 55:04.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
