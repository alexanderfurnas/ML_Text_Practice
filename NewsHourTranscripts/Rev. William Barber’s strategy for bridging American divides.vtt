How a Moral Movement Is
Overcoming the Politics

00:48.766 --> 00:50.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

this thing, if you will, called
the white Southern strategy.

00:50.466 --> 00:55.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the goal of it was
undermine black and
white fusion coalitions.

What we're going to do is,
we're going to figure out a way
to talk that makes poor whites

01:03.400 --> 01:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think that they're losing
because black people and
brown people are gaining.

01:06.600 --> 01:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what you do in that is, you
make poor whites, who should
be allies with poor blacks,

01:14.666 --> 01:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think that their problem,
their poverty is being caused
because black and brown people

01:19.633 --> 01:23.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are acquiring something or
taking something from them.

01:23.600 --> 01:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

said, the only transformative

01:34.166 --> 01:39.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
force that could really, fully

poor whites and blacks and brown

Barber.

01:49.600 --> 01:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Before that, he had been a young
conservative who had worked
both for the Moral Majority,

01:52.733 --> 01:57.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a political group associated
with the Christian right and the
Republican Party, and also for

conservative South Carolina

Church in a sundown town.

02:12.733 --> 02:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Until 1983, there was a sign
at the edge of our town that
told black people they weren't

JONATHAN WILSON-HARTGROVE: Sure.

02:22.266 --> 02:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I didn't know I was a racist,
but Reverend Barber helped me
see that I was racist, and,

02:25.533 --> 02:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more importantly, that my
racism was getting in the way
of loving Jesus, which is what

02:30.433 --> 02:32.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I really wanted to do.

CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT:
Wilson-Hartgrove first
heard Reverend Barber
some 20 years ago at

02:35.466 --> 02:38.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a meeting called by the
North Carolina governor.

02:38.566 --> 02:43.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reverend Barber delivered
a motivational speech to a
gathering of young people.

02:43.400 --> 02:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wilson-Hartgrove was moved
by what Barber said and began
to understand how racism had

02:49.300 --> 02:51.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been used as a tool to divide.

02:51.733 --> 02:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Growing up poor,
Wilson-Hartgrove had
never before realized
what he had in common with

02:56.266 --> 02:58.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
poor black people.

02:58.333 --> 03:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONATHAN WILSON-HARTGROVE: We
were taught to believe that
there were people who were

03:01.500 --> 03:04.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
poor because they
chose to be poor.

03:04.233 --> 03:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that narrative kept us
from seeing the way that our
religion was being used to pit

03:10.100 --> 03:12.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
us against other people.

03:43.100 --> 03:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I said, listen, this
legislature just cut,
denied Medicaid expansion.

03:50.133 --> 03:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are 1,000 people in this

care, and they can't be black,

03:55.766 --> 03:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because there are no
black people are up here.

03:57.033 --> 03:58.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They cut funding for
public education.

03:58.300 --> 04:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You are losing teachers here.

04:02.066 --> 04:04.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they have to be white.

04:04.166 --> 04:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

people because of what they
told you they stood on prayer

talk to them about the things

04:19.233 --> 04:20.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that they had in common.

04:20.833 --> 04:22.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

up like Jonathan?

investment, first,
some people laughed.

06:02.033 --> 06:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They said we were a nuisance.

06:03.733 --> 06:07.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But then they started
seeing more people come,
and they looked diverse.

06:07.733 --> 06:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said, that's my
teacher getting arrested,
that's my doctor, that's
a black man and white

06:12.466 --> 06:13.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

JONATHAN WILSON-HARTGROVE:
What can be learned
from our experience is
that white people need

06:33.900 --> 06:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to talk about race honestly.

06:36.733 --> 06:40.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We need to say, of
course we're racist.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a country that's

You know, it's not like
it's a personal failing.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I inherited this.

06:46.966 --> 06:51.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Racism is about structures
that pass on what
we inherited, right?

06:53.600 --> 06:56.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Inequalities that we
inherited are written
into these structures.

06:56.433 --> 07:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when we help white people
think about that, I think
we're making it possible to

07:02.833 --> 07:04.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
form alliances that we
haven't been able to form.

07:07.066 --> 07:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have to look back in history.

07:09.133 --> 07:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When black and white people
came together right after the
Civil War, we fundamentally

07:12.100 --> 07:14.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
changed this country.

came together in the civil

was transformative.

This is a country that was
built on the original sin of
race-based chattel slavery.

It is how the, you know,
concentrated capital
in this country from
the very beginning has

07:47.533 --> 07:50.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
maintained power.

07:50.033 --> 07:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I don't think that the
future of America is possible
without dealing with it.

WILLIAM BARBER II: I'm hopeful.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Optimism is a different thing.

07:58.766 --> 08:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I believe we have to be the
kind of what I call moral
dissenters, moral defibrillators

08:02.533 --> 08:04.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who shock the nation.

08:04.166 --> 08:06.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But we also are seeing
something in the wind.

You have white people marching
with Black Lives Matter.

I had a friend of mine who's a
Sikh, and she put it like this.

08:12.400 --> 08:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Quickly, she said, a tomb
is dark and a womb is dark,
but there's a difference.

08:18.900 --> 08:20.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A tomb is death, a
womb is possibility.

08:20.633 --> 08:22.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's dark now.

But if we push and push together
and come together, I think
this is a birthing moment.
