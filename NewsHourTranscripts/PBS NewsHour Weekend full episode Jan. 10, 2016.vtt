04:18.200 --> 04:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY VERY PROUD OF BECAUSE

04:19.700 --> 04:21.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT SENDS, OR IT IS BASICALLY

04:21.467 --> 04:22.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPORTING THEIR MEDICAL

04:22.867 --> 04:24.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROFESSIONALS ABROAD TO HELP IN

04:24.200 --> 04:25.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACES THAT REALLY NEED IT.

04:25.867 --> 04:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ALSO EARN MONEY FROM DOING

04:27.333 --> 04:28.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT.

04:28.167 --> 04:29.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THEY CERTAINLY, THE CUBAN

04:29.967 --> 04:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNMENT CERTAINLY SAW IT AS A

04:31.400 --> 04:33.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRETTY BIG SLAP IN THE FACE.

04:33.267 --> 04:34.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: I REMEMBER

04:34.267 --> 04:35.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEARING ABOUT HOW MANY CUBAN

04:35.667 --> 04:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOCTORS WERE THERE IN AFRICA TO

04:37.633 --> 04:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TREAT EBOLA.

04:38.933 --> 04:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALMOST EVERY NATURAL DISASTER

04:39.900 --> 04:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HAPPENS AROUND THE WORLD,

04:41.333 --> 04:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU ALWAYS HEAR OF A LARGE

04:42.333 --> 04:44.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NUMBER OF CUBAN DOCTORS THAT ARE

04:44.267 --> 04:45.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE.

04:45.167 --> 04:45.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

04:45.967 --> 04:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CUBAN DOCTORS ARE KNOWN FOR

04:49.633 --> 04:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRINGING BEING SKILLFUL MEDICAL

04:52.433 --> 04:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROFESSIONALS AND SOMETHING THE

04:53.400 --> 04:54.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CUBANS ARE PROUD OF.

04:54.567 --> 04:56.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO SORT OF POACHING THEM AWAY

04:56.267 --> 04:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO THE UNITED STATES WAS ONE

04:57.433 --> 04:59.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE MANY THORNS IN THE SIDE,

04:59.467 --> 05:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THAT RELATIONSHIP BOTH FOR

05:02.200 --> 05:04.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CUBAN-- CUBA AND AMONG MANY THAT

05:04.300 --> 05:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE THORNS IN THE SIDE OF THE

05:05.500 --> 05:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNITED STATES AS WELL.

05:07.033 --> 05:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SOME OF THE DOCK TORS THAT

05:08.100 --> 05:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE DEFECTING ALSO COMPLAINED

05:09.833 --> 05:11.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY WEREN'T

05:11.267 --> 05:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GETTING PAID WHAT THESE FOREIGN

05:12.800 --> 05:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRIES WAS PAYING CUBAN.

05:14.633 --> 05:16.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> RIGHT, I MEAN IT WAS A

05:16.267 --> 05:17.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MONEYMAKER FOR CUBA.

05:17.467 --> 05:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE OF THE EXAMPLES IS THEY

05:19.800 --> 05:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEND-- CUBA SENDS A LOT OF

05:21.100 --> 05:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS TO

05:23.733 --> 05:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VENEZUELA IN EXCHANGE FOR OIL.

05:25.633 --> 05:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE CUBAN DOCTORS

05:27.433 --> 05:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEMSELVES, THOUGH THEY WERE

05:28.533 --> 05:30.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBABLY MAKING A MORE

05:30.167 --> 05:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPETITIVE SALARY THAN THEY

05:30.833 --> 05:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE BACK AT HOME, THEY WERE

05:32.633 --> 05:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT TAKING IN ALL THE REVENUE

05:34.833 --> 05:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT WAS

05:36.633 --> 05:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKING FROM SENDING THOSE PEOPLE

05:38.100 --> 05:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABROAD.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THAT WAS INDEED ONE OF THEIR

05:40.867 --> 05:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPLAINTS AND ONE OF THE

05:41.533 --> 05:42.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REASONS THAT THEY TOOK UP THIS

05:42.867 --> 05:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPORTUNITY FROM THE UNITED

05:44.133 --> 05:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES.

05:44.633 --> 05:46.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: AS WE START

05:46.200 --> 05:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NORMALIZING RELATIONS, HAS THAT

05:47.533 --> 05:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO SAY YOU

05:48.833 --> 05:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW WHAT, LET'S GO AHEAD AND

05:50.633 --> 05:52.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUT IN OUR APPLICATIONS NOW,

05:52.800 --> 05:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAUSE ALMOST A SURGE IN THE LAST

YEAR.

05:55.867 --> 05:57.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR WHAT IS THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT

05:57.067 --> 05:58.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOING ABOUT THIS?

05:58.167 --> 05:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY

05:59.700 --> 06:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS CLAMPED DOWN ON THE NUMBER

06:01.200 --> 06:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF DOCTORS THAT THEY ALLOW TO

06:02.900 --> 06:05.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEAVE CUBA AND TO PARTICIPATE IN

06:05.000 --> 06:06.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE PROGRAM AS BROAD.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING

06:07.300 --> 06:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT LEAD THE UNITED STATES,

06:09.500 --> 06:10.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH AS I REPORTED, HAS PUT

06:10.967 --> 06:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS PROGRAM UNDER REVIEW.

06:12.733 --> 06:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS BEING, INCLUDED IN PART

06:16.200 --> 06:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THAT HE ARE VIEW RIGHT NOW.

06:17.633 --> 06:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE CUBANS HAVE TAKEN SOME

06:19.933 --> 06:21.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTION TO REDUCE THOSE NUMBERS

06:21.467 --> 06:22.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE OF THE POACHING AND

06:22.367 --> 06:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SPENDING ON HOUSING, TOO MANY

20:40.467 --> 20:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE BORROWED TOO MUCH MONEY

20:41.633 --> 20:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN THAT BUBBLE BURST.

20:43.533 --> 20:45.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT WAS REALLY BAD.

20:45.267 --> 20:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT SET OFF A TERRIBLE GLOBAL

20:46.800 --> 20:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RECESSION.

20:47.633 --> 20:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THEN IT MOVED OVER TO EUROPE

20:49.333 --> 20:51.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE THE PROBLEM REALLY WAS

20:51.000 --> 20:51.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE SOVEREIGN DEBT, WHERE

20:51.967 --> 20:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRIES HAD BORROWED TOO MUCH,

20:54.600 --> 20:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE GREECE.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO YOU HAD A BIG DISRUPTION OVER

20:57.700 --> 20:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE THAT HURT THE EUROPEAN

20:59.233 --> 21:00.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ECONOMY AND NOW YOU'RE

21:00.367 --> 21:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOVING OVER TO CHINA WHERE THE

21:02.133 --> 21:03.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNMENT SPENT WAY TOO MUCH

21:03.233 --> 21:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MONEY ON WHAT PEOPLE CALLED

21:05.833 --> 21:07.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GHOST CITIES, MAYBE THEY BUILT

21:07.367 --> 21:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAY TOO MUCH INFRASTRUCTURE

21:10.100 --> 21:10.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND APARTMENT BUILDINGS AND NOW

21:10.967 --> 21:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT BUBBLE IS BURGS.

21:12.300 --> 21:14.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THIS PART THREE OF THE SAME

21:14.267 --> 21:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIG GIANT CRISIS THAT HAS BEEN

21:15.933 --> 21:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING ON FOR YEARS AND IT STILL

21:17.300 --> 21:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS GOING TO PULL IT DOWN WITH

21:19.100 --> 21:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT?

21:19.400 --> 21:21.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR IS THIS REALLY A COMPLETELY

21:21.167 --> 21:23.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEPARATE ISSUE AND REALLY THE

21:23.067 --> 21:24.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNITED STATES HAS ALREADY GONE

21:24.000 --> 21:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGH ITS CORRECTION AND WE'RE

21:25.533 --> 21:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN MUCH BETTER SHAPE NOW.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND CHINA WILL JUST HAVE TO SORT

21:29.367 --> 21:30.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT OUT ON ITS OWN.

21:30.700 --> 21:33.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I HATE TO SAY THAT, YOU KNOW,

21:33.000 --> 21:34.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE JUST DON'T KNOW BUT WE JUST

21:34.667 --> 21:35.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON'T KNOW.

21:35.967 --> 21:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE TO SEE HOW THIS PLAYS

21:37.133 --> 21:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THERE IS AN ARGUMENT THAT IT

21:39.333 --> 21:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD BE VERY BAD FOR THE WHOLE

21:41.633 --> 21:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GLOBAL ECONOMY.

21:42.733 --> 21:44.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THERE'S ALSO AN ARGUMENT

21:44.167 --> 21:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT CHINA'S STOCK MARKET IS

21:48.100 --> 21:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY SMALL AND PRIMITIVE.

21:49.433 --> 21:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

21:56.800 --> 21:57.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY INFLUENCE EACH OTHER.
