04:26.299 --> 04:28.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEY DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS THEY WANT

04:28.134 --> 04:30.136 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE TARGETED IN THESE RAIDS BY

04:30.136 --> 04:31.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I.C.E. AGENTS.

04:31.537 --> 04:33.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ONE THAT WAS THE MOST

04:33.339 --> 04:35.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRIKING DEPARTURE FROM POLICY

04:35.208 --> 04:36.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WE SAW UNDER THE PREVIOUS

04:36.309 --> 04:38.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION IS THE TARGETING

04:38.244 --> 04:40.213 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF 16- AND 17-YEAR-OLDS WHO ARE

04:40.213 --> 04:42.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSPECTED OF GANG ACTIVITY.

04:42.682 --> 04:44.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. IMMIGRATIONS TOLD ME THAT

04:44.651 --> 04:46.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY CAN MEET TWO OR MORE

04:46.352 --> 04:47.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRITERIA.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE CRITERIA COULD BE THINGS

04:48.855 --> 04:50.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE A GANG TATTOO, WEARING GANG

04:50.690 --> 04:52.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APPAREL, OR JUST HANGING OUT IN

04:52.892 --> 04:54.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AN AREA THAT'S FREQUENTED BY

04:54.093 --> 04:55.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GANGS.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO OF COURSE THERE ARE A NUMBER

04:56.829 --> 04:58.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF IMMIGRATION LAWYERS AND CIVIL

04:58.564 --> 04:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES

04:59.866 --> 05:01.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAWYERS WHO ARE SAYING THAT IS

05:01.134 --> 05:04.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT ENOUGH TO FIND SOMEONE -- TO

05:04.837 --> 05:06.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAKE SOMEONE A TARGET FOR

05:06.472 --> 05:08.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEPORTATION, ESPECIALLY A MINOR.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: HOW DIFFERENT IS

05:10.076 --> 05:11.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS FROM THE OBAMA

05:11.344 --> 05:13.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION'S INTERESTS?

05:13.179 --> 05:14.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WAS THE THRESHOLD THERE

05:14.580 --> 05:16.816 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERSUS WHAT THIS IS?

05:16.816 --> 05:17.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO IT'S INTERESTING, AS I

05:17.717 --> 05:18.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WENT BACK AND I READ THE

05:18.318 --> 05:20.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOVEMBER 2014 PRIORITIES FOR

05:20.987 --> 05:23.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEPORTATION THAT OBAMA SET OUT.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT DID MENTION 16- AND

05:25.491 --> 05:26.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
17-YEAR-OLDS, BUT THEY WERE

05:26.859 --> 05:28.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN CONVICTED OF

05:28.995 --> 05:30.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A GANG-RELATED CRIME.

05:30.596 --> 05:31.864 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WAS HIS WAY OF SAYING THAT

05:31.864 --> 05:34.334 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALTHOUGH THESE PEOPLE ARE

05:34.334 --> 05:36.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MINORS, THEY'VE ENTERED ANOTHER

05:36.369 --> 05:38.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CATEGORY BY COMMITTING A CRIME,

05:38.171 --> 05:40.106 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE WHEN WE SEE A JUVENILE GETS

05:40.106 --> 05:41.374 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AN ADULT KIND OF SENTENCE IN

05:41.374 --> 05:42.709 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COURT.

05:42.709 --> 05:43.843 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS CHANGES THAT, OF COURSE,

05:43.843 --> 05:44.811 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THESE ARE PEOPLE JUST

05:44.811 --> 05:46.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSPECTED OF GANG ACTIVITY.

05:46.379 --> 05:47.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: IF YOU ARE IN

05:47.814 --> 05:49.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NEIGHBORHOODS, BECAUSE YOU

05:49.182 --> 05:50.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIVE THERE, THAT ALREADY KIND OF

05:50.950 --> 05:52.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHECKS OFF ONE OF THE BOXES,

05:52.452 --> 05:53.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT?

05:53.319 --> 05:54.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO BASICALLY YOU CAN'T ESCAPE

05:54.721 --> 05:56.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND MOVE

05:56.155 --> 05:57.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMEWHERE ELSE TOMORROW TO GET

05:57.724 --> 05:59.425 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AWAY FROM THESE RAIDS.

05:59.425 --> 06:00.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I KNOW, I THINK THAT WAS

06:00.159 --> 06:02.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBABLY THE MOST STRIKING THING

06:02.195 --> 06:03.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT I SAW ON THAT LIST, WAS

06:03.696 --> 06:05.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HANGING OUT IN THESE PLACES

06:05.698 --> 06:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOTORIOUS FOR GANG ACTIVITY.

06:07.533 --> 06:08.701 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, THAT COULD BE A

06:08.701 --> 06:09.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCHOOLYARD, THAT COULD BE RIGHT

06:09.268 --> 06:10.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUTSIDE OF YOUR PUBLIC SCHOOL.

06:10.803 --> 06:12.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT COULD BE A PARKING LOT OF A

06:12.405 --> 06:14.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROCERY STORE WHERE YOUR FAMILY

06:14.273 --> 06:15.074 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD FREQUENT.

06:15.074 --> 06:16.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE'S

06:16.342 --> 06:17.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY NO WAY TO GET AROUND

06:17.443 --> 06:18.811 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT.

06:18.811 --> 06:20.446 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND AS I WAS TOLD, THERE ARE A

06:20.446 --> 06:21.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOT OF PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY

06:21.914 --> 06:23.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE WHO HAVE FLED VIOLENCE, IN

06:23.182 --> 06:24.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACES LIKE EL SALVADOR WITH THE

06:24.951 --> 06:27.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOTORIOUS MS-13 GANG, THAT HAS

06:27.120 --> 06:28.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRONG ROOTS IN THE UNITED

06:28.087 --> 06:29.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES, A LOT OF TIMES THOSE

06:29.522 --> 06:31.190 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE COME HERE, LIVE IN

06:31.190 --> 06:32.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMUNITIES OF OTHER EL

06:32.592 --> 06:34.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SALVADORANS, WITH PEOPLE WITH

06:34.060 --> 06:35.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRONG TIES TO THAT GANG.

06:35.695 --> 06:37.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO

06:37.096 --> 06:38.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GET A TATTOO, OR THEIR LIVES

06:38.498 --> 06:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD BE THREATENED.

06:40.566 --> 06:41.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: APPAREL, I MEAN,

06:41.267 --> 06:42.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT GOES

06:42.335 --> 06:43.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BACK TO, BACK WHEN THIS

06:43.569 --> 06:44.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONVERSATION WAS BETWEEN THE

06:44.871 --> 06:46.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRIPS AND THE BLOODS IN L.A., IN

06:46.606 --> 06:48.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE '80s AND '90s.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OH, WHAT ARE THE COLORS, WHAT'S

06:49.375 --> 06:50.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE UNIFORM.

06:50.710 --> 06:51.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> RIGHT.

06:51.944 --> 06:53.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I DO ACTUALLY REMEMBER BEING IN

06:53.112 --> 06:54.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHERE THERE

06:54.247 --> 06:56.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS A RULE IN MY PUBLIC SCHOOL,

06:56.015 --> 06:57.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK, AGAINST WEARING ALL

06:57.083 --> 06:58.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BLUE OR ALL RED, BECAUSE THOSE

06:58.317 --> 07:00.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE DAYS WHERE THAT WAS SEEN AS

07:00.086 --> 07:01.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A GANG AFFILIATION.

07:01.587 --> 07:02.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME OF THIS ALSO COULD HAVE

07:02.622 --> 07:03.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGED.

07:03.523 --> 07:04.457 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF GANGS THAT

07:04.457 --> 07:05.925 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AREN'T AS OVERT.

07:05.925 --> 07:06.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THESE AREN'T

07:06.926 --> 07:08.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEGAL DEFINITIONS OF WHAT MAKES

07:08.428 --> 07:09.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMEONE A GANG MEMBER, AND IT'S

07:09.829 --> 07:11.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT EVEN ILLEGAL TO BE A GANG

07:11.063 --> 07:12.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEMBER.

07:12.231 --> 07:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT AT THIS POINT, I.C.E.-- U.S.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.301 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS

07:17.203 --> 07:18.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVER WHOEVER THEY WANT TO TARGET

07:18.938 --> 07:20.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY A CRIME TO

07:20.973 --> 07:22.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE IN THE UNITED STATES

07:22.308 --> 07:24.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ILLEGALLY, AND SO THEREFORE THEY

07:24.110 --> 07:25.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN COME UP WITH DIFFERENT

07:25.511 --> 07:26.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CATEGORIES OF WHO THEY WANT TO

07:26.846 --> 07:28.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ON U.S. CRIMINAL CODE IN ANY

07:48.601 --> 07:50.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIMPLE: SOMEONE WHO POSTS CASH

07:50.770 --> 07:52.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO GET OUT OF JAIL BEFORE TRIAL

07:52.472 --> 07:54.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS MORE LIKELY TO RETURN TO

COURT THAN TO FORFEIT THE MONEY.

07:56.042 --> 07:57.477 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
