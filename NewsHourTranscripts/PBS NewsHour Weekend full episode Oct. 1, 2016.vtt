WHY IS THIS DIFFERENT?

05:27.194 --> 05:28.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF TWO

05:28.461 --> 05:29.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIG FACTORS.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NUMBER ONE IS THE SORT OF

05:31.698 --> 05:33.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGING NATURE OF THE

05:34.734 --> 05:39.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT IS NOW BUILT ON A COALITION

05:39.739 --> 05:41.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT INCLUDES LESS WORKING CLASS

WHITE VOTERS AND MORE WHAT'S

05:43.310 --> 05:45.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN CALLED A COALITION OF THE

05:53.186 --> 05:54.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFFLUENT NOW.

05:54.454 --> 05:56.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

BELT STATE.

05:57.057 --> 05:58.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:59.359 --> 06:00.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF OPPONENT

06:00.227 --> 06:02.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

YOU'RE GOING TO COMPETE IN

OHIO-- SHE'S NOT GOING TO PULL

OUT OF THERE.

06:11.238 --> 06:12.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN FACT, SHE'S GOING BACK NEXT

WEEK.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT'S NOT ESSENTIAL.

06:14.107 --> 06:17.277 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

06:21.748 --> 06:23.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS SHE DOESN'T NEED IT TO GET

06:23.116 --> 06:25.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

07:47.067 --> 07:49.202 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THAT CAUSES AIDS.

18:21.300 --> 18:22.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SO, PROFESSOR, WHAT DO THESE

18:38.451 --> 18:40.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHILDREN HAVE THAT'S SPECIAL?

18:40.052 --> 18:41.887 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW IS IT THAT THEY DON'T GO

18:41.887 --> 18:44.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM H.I.V. TO AIDS?

18:44.357 --> 18:46.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THE INTERESTING THING

18:46.792 --> 18:48.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THESE CHILDREN IS THAT, AS

18:48.861 --> 18:50.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU SAY, THEY DON'T PROGRESS TO

18:50.162 --> 18:51.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DISEASE THROUGH CHILDHOOD.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

H.I.V., SOMETHING LIKE 60%

18:56.135 --> 18:59.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITHOUT TREATMENT WOULD DIE IN

18:59.038 --> 19:00.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FIRST TWO AND A HALF YEARS.

19:00.639 --> 19:03.042 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THIS IS QUITE AN UNEXPECTED

19:03.042 --> 19:03.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FINDING.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WE INITIALLY LOOKED TO SEE

19:06.746 --> 19:08.848 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHETHER THIS WAS TO DO WITH THE

19:08.848 --> 19:10.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMMUNE RESPONSES AGAINST THE

19:10.082 --> 19:10.816 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIRUS.

19:10.816 --> 19:11.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN FACT, ALTHOUGH THEY DO

19:11.817 --> 19:12.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAKE QUITE STRONG IMMUNE

19:12.985 --> 19:14.286 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESPONSES AGAINST THE VIRUS,

19:14.286 --> 19:15.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS WASN'T THE REASON THEY

19:15.554 --> 19:16.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIDN'T PROGRESS.

19:16.956 --> 19:20.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE REASON WAS THAT THEY, IN

19:20.259 --> 19:21.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPITE OF HAVING A LOT OF VIRUS

19:21.494 --> 19:23.529 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON BOARD, THEIR IMMUNE

19:23.529 --> 19:25.264 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTIVATION LEVELS ARE RELATIVELY

19:25.264 --> 19:25.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOW.

19:25.531 --> 19:28.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, IN SOME SENSES, THEY TEND TO

19:28.034 --> 19:30.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IGNORE THE VIRUS, AND, AS A

19:30.236 --> 19:31.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESULT, THEY DON'T GET ANY

19:31.937 --> 19:32.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISEASE FROM IT.

19:32.571 --> 19:33.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: THAT'S THE

19:33.305 --> 19:34.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPOSITE OF WHAT AN ADULT BODY

19:34.774 --> 19:35.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD DO, RIGHT?

19:35.674 --> 19:38.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, IT WOULD-- OUR BODY

19:38.077 --> 19:41.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD ATTACK AS MUCH AS

19:41.147 --> 19:43.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POSSIBLE, AND YOU'RE SAYING THE

19:43.082 --> 19:44.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEACE VERSUS THE WAR MIGHT BE

19:44.784 --> 19:44.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETTER IN THESE CASES?

19:44.116 --> 19:45.351 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> EXACTLY SO.

19:45.351 --> 19:46.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE IMMUNE SYSTEM HAS A VERY

19:46.986 --> 19:48.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFICULT JOB ON ITS HANDS,

19:48.654 --> 19:51.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE IF YOU MAKE TOO WEAK A

19:51.123 --> 19:52.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESPONSE, YOU RUN THE RISK OF

19:52.258 --> 19:54.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEING KILLED BY A FOREIGN

19:54.060 --> 19:55.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INVADER; AND IF YOU MAKE TOO

19:55.094 --> 19:56.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRONG A RESPONSE, THEN THE

19:56.862 --> 19:58.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMMUNE RESPONSE CAUSES A DISEASE

19:58.030 --> 19:59.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON ITS OWN ACCOUNT.

19:59.965 --> 20:03.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, FINDING THAT PERFECT MIDDLE

20:03.769 --> 20:05.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LINE IS A VERY DIFFICULT THING

20:05.371 --> 20:06.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THE IMMUNE RESPONSE.

20:06.238 --> 20:08.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, OBVIOUSLY, THE IMMUNE

20:08.474 --> 20:09.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYSTEM HAS TO DEAL WITH ALL

20:09.708 --> 20:11.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SORTS OF DIFFERENT PATHOGENS AND

20:11.610 --> 20:12.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HANDLE THOSE.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND H.I.V. IS JUST ONE

20:14.580 --> 20:16.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTICULAR VIRUS THAT IT HAS TO

20:16.115 --> 20:17.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEAL WITH.

20:17.183 --> 20:17.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

INTO ADOLESCENCE AND ADULTHOOD,

20:27.693 --> 20:29.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

20:41.240 --> 20:42.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMMUNE SYSTEM GETS MORE AND MORE

20:42.741 --> 20:44.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

PROGRESS MORE RAPIDLY.

THAT TRIES TO MIMIC WHAT THESE

21:07.066 --> 21:09.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHILDREN ARE DOING NATURALLY?

21:09.502 --> 21:10.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK SO.

21:10.436 --> 21:11.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK WE CAN ACTUALLY LEARN A

LOT FROM WHAT CHILDREN CAN TEACH

21:14.473 --> 21:16.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
US IN THE DIFFERENT WAY THAT

21:16.442 --> 21:18.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY APPROACH DEALING WITH

21:18.444 --> 21:21.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOREIGN PATHOGENS LIKE H.I.V.

21:21.313 --> 21:24.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN THIS INSTANCE, OBVIOUSLY,

21:24.483 --> 21:25.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANTI-RETROVIRAL THERAPY IS

21:25.718 --> 21:27.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MAINSTAY OF TREATMENT FOR

21:27.119 --> 21:28.687 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE WITH H.I.V.

21:28.687 --> 21:31.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE PROGNOSIS FOR PEOPLE

21:31.123 --> 21:32.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH H.I.V. HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED

21:32.458 --> 21:34.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BY ANTI-RETROVIRAL THERAPY.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT BEING SAID, THE IMMUNE

21:35.427 --> 21:37.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESPONSE OF PEOPLE WITH H.I.V.

21:37.463 --> 21:38.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOESN'T RETURN BACK TO NORMAL,

21:38.631 --> 21:40.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN WITH SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THERE'S STILL A NEED FOR NEW

21:43.702 --> 21:46.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APPROACHES TO TRY AND BRING THE

21:47.806 --> 21:49.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE WITH H.I.V., EVEN ON
