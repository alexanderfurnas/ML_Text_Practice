JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to our series
of conversations focusing on the
road ahead for the Democratic

00:04.433 --> 00:06.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Party.

00:06.466 --> 00:10.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Today, Senate and House
Democratic leaders
left Washington for a
stop in Berryville in

00:10.333 --> 00:15.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Northwest Virginia, estimated
population around 4,300.

00:15.166 --> 00:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was to roll out a new,
more populist message
focusing on economic issues.

00:19.733 --> 00:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They said it's what the party
needs to win back voters.

00:22.800 --> 00:24.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: When you lose elections,
as we did in 2014 and

00:26.666 --> 00:30.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
2016, you don't flinch.

00:30.033 --> 00:32.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You don't blink.

00:32.100 --> 00:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You look in the mirror and
ask, what did we do wrong?

00:35.366 --> 00:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The number one thing we did
wrong is not present a strong,
bold economic agenda to working

00:43.833 --> 00:47.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Americans, so that their
hope for the future
might return again.

00:47.566 --> 00:49.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

00:49.666 --> 00:52.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), House
Minority Leader: That is why,
today, Democrats are unveiling

00:52.066 --> 00:57.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an aggressive and ambitious
economic agenda, and a bold new
promise to America's working

00:58.200 --> 01:00.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
families.

01:00.266 --> 01:05.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From the heartland -- these
members are from the heartland,
but to the suburbs, to the

01:07.033 --> 01:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cities, Democrats are offering
a better deal, better jobs,
better wages, a better future.

01:11.766 --> 01:13.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:13.766 --> 01:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN RAY LUJAN (D), New
Mexico: Voters, constituents
want us to focus on them.

01:16.333 --> 01:18.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They want us to
understand where they are.

01:18.600 --> 01:22.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they want us to understand
that their wages are not
keeping up with their cost of

01:22.066 --> 01:24.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
living.

01:24.066 --> 01:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the more people that are
able to have that conversation
with the American people,

01:26.133 --> 01:29.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we will be in a
stronger place in 2018.

01:29.033 --> 01:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Joining me now
to discuss the new agenda, and
the way forward for the party,

01:33.666 --> 01:37.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
is the chairman of the
Democratic National
Committee, Tom Perez.

01:37.233 --> 01:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to the "NewsHour."

01:39.333 --> 01:43.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, how did the Democratic Party
get to the point where you have
to be reintroducing yourselves

01:45.033 --> 01:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the American people, telling
them what you stand for?

01:47.133 --> 01:48.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
THOMAS PEREZ, Chairman,
Democratic National
Committee: Well, we have
heard across America

01:48.633 --> 01:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from people that they don't
know what we stand for.

01:51.900 --> 01:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I have been traveling
to countries listening.

01:54.366 --> 01:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so what Leader Pelosi,
Senator Schumer and others
today have been doing is telling

01:58.933 --> 02:01.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
people not only what
we're fighting for, but
who we're fighting for.

02:01.700 --> 02:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're fighting for a
better future for everyone.

02:04.200 --> 02:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're fighting to address
the most important
issue of our time, which
is income inequality.

02:08.766 --> 02:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're fighting and showing
people that we believe that
everyone has an opportunity,

02:13.466 --> 02:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or should have an opportunity,
to punch their ticket to the
middle class, that health care

02:16.866 --> 02:19.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is a right for all, not
a privilege for a few.

02:19.633 --> 02:23.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, again, we're not
only talking about what
we're fighting for,
but who we're fighting

02:23.733 --> 02:24.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for.

02:24.933 --> 02:26.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're fighting for
the many, not the few.

02:26.366 --> 02:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're fighting for an economy
that works for everyone.

02:28.366 --> 02:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is this
different, Tom Perez, from the
Democrats' message before now?

02:32.633 --> 02:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ: Well, I think
-- I worked for Ted Kennedy.

02:34.633 --> 02:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Ted Kennedy always fought
for he called the common
man and the common woman.

02:38.400 --> 02:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the Democratic
Party, we have always been
fighting for ordinary Americans,

02:43.100 --> 02:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether it was fighting for
the Social Security Act in the
1930s, fighting for Medicare and

02:49.666 --> 02:51.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Medicaid.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will be celebrating
the anniversary of Medicaid
and Medicare in a few days.

02:53.966 --> 02:55.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Fighting for the
Affordable Care Act.

02:55.466 --> 02:57.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Fighting for good jobs.

02:57.466 --> 03:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what we need to do is
underscore what we have been
doing and tell people how we're

03:01.333 --> 03:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to continue that fight,
because Donald Trump attempted
to hijack that message.

03:07.700 --> 03:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we need to tell people
exactly who's fighting for them.

03:09.833 --> 03:12.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, is part
of the reason you need to do
this that the party has been

03:12.500 --> 03:17.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spending -- and Democrats
-- have been spending so
much time talking about
Donald Trump, criticizing

03:17.866 --> 03:19.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump?

03:19.900 --> 03:22.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just today, I got another press
release from the Democratic
National Committee about Jared

03:22.166 --> 03:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kushner's meeting with Senate
investigators on Russia.

03:26.233 --> 03:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Have you have been -- by you, I
mean Democrats - - been spending
too much time criticizing

03:30.400 --> 03:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump, in other words,
talking about what you're
against, rather than what you're

03:34.366 --> 03:36.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for?

03:36.466 --> 03:38.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ: Well, when we
have a vote on the Affordable
Care Act repeal tomorrow, it's

03:38.466 --> 03:43.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
important for us to talk about
the fact that that's not a
health care bill, it's a massive

03:44.666 --> 03:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tax cut for wealthy people.

03:46.700 --> 03:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But your point is absolutely
well taken, which is we can't
simply be against Donald Trump.

03:51.333 --> 03:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to be for the values
that Senator Schumer, Leader
Pelosi and all of us have

03:56.200 --> 03:57.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
been talking about.

03:57.500 --> 03:59.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's what I do
day in and day out.

03:59.533 --> 04:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats believe that no
one who works a full-time job
should have to live in poverty.

04:03.633 --> 04:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats believe that, again,
health care is a right for
all and not a privilege for

04:07.433 --> 04:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a few, that the secretary
of education ought to
believe in public education.

04:11.666 --> 04:16.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when I was labor secretary,
I was fighting for higher
wages, overtime pay for people.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was fighting for retirement
security for folks.

04:19.600 --> 04:23.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We were fighting to make
sure that people had
the skills to compete.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the Republicans were
always fighting against that.

04:25.133 --> 04:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They didn't want to raise
the overtime threshold.

04:27.633 --> 04:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They fought our efforts at
making sure that anyone who had
a 401(k) or an IRA could get

04:34.200 --> 04:36.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the advice they need.

04:36.166 --> 04:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what we have to do a better
job of as Democrats is tell
folks exactly what we have

04:41.633 --> 04:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been fighting for and what they
have been fighting against.

04:43.733 --> 04:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How does this
fit into the debate that I
have been hearing out there?

04:47.133 --> 04:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the one hand, you hear
I guess you would call them
centrist Democrats saying, well,

04:50.933 --> 04:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the party didn't pay enough
attention to the Middle America,
working-class Americans, it

04:57.400 --> 04:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spent too much time on what
they call identity politics.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, on the other hand, you
have got the more progressive
wing of the party saying,

05:02.566 --> 05:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no, no, the party forgot about
its base, it about minorities,
about black voters, about

05:08.166 --> 05:09.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hispanic voters.

05:09.933 --> 05:12.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And you're hearing two
different critiques.

05:12.466 --> 05:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How does what you're saying
the party is arguing now, how
does it fit into that argument?

05:17.333 --> 05:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ: Well, I think it's
a false choice to suggest that
you either do one or the other.

05:21.833 --> 05:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And as Dr. King said, the best
civil right is a good job.

05:26.433 --> 05:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What good is a seat at
the counter if you can't
afford to buy a hamburger?

05:30.366 --> 05:34.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And economic opportunity
for everyone is what we
have been talking about.

05:34.833 --> 05:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what we have to do a
better job of as Democrats is
talk about that in every zip

05:39.333 --> 05:41.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
code.

05:41.366 --> 05:45.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A big part of what we're doing
with the Democratic Party is
we're building a 12-month-a-year

05:46.500 --> 05:48.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
organizing presence
in every zip code.

05:48.600 --> 05:52.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to talk to folks in
rural America, urban America,
suburban America, because the

05:54.233 --> 05:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opioid epidemic is touching
all of those communities.

05:56.333 --> 06:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we need to tell them that
we are the party that's trying
to make sure that we retain

06:00.366 --> 06:02.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
access to health care.

06:02.433 --> 06:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're the party that's making
sure that you have the skills
to compete, not only for today's

06:06.833 --> 06:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
jobs, but for the dynamic
economy and the jobs that
will be coming tomorrow.

06:11.133 --> 06:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what Democrats have
been fighting for, and I think
that message resonates in every

06:15.066 --> 06:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
zip code across the country.

06:16.833 --> 06:18.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Everyone wants good
public education.

06:18.333 --> 06:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Doesn't matter where you live.

06:19.533 --> 06:21.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's what
we're fighting for.

06:21.566 --> 06:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Former President
Obama himself said that he was
partly to blame for the fact

06:23.933 --> 06:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the party didn't so as much
as it should have done, could
have been doing at the state

06:28.200 --> 06:30.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
level, at the local level.

06:30.700 --> 06:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is the party now going
to be working actively to
recruit and be more present
in local communities,

06:36.933 --> 06:37.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in cities?

06:37.933 --> 06:39.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ: Absolutely.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Absolutely.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have changed our
mission statement.

06:42.300 --> 06:44.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our mission is no longer
simply to elect the president
of the United States.

06:44.866 --> 06:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our mission is to elect
Democrats up and down the
ticket, from the school
board to the Senate.

06:50.100 --> 06:52.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And our mission is to be
there in every zip code.

06:52.066 --> 06:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why we helped two
candidates who were running in
Oklahoma a couple weeks ago who

06:55.633 --> 06:59.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
won special elections
in districts that
Donald Trump had won.

06:59.500 --> 07:03.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have a
57-state-and-territory strategy.

07:03.166 --> 07:05.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we have to
organize everywhere.

07:05.233 --> 07:08.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we to have to be a
12-month-a-year party.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You can't just show up
every fourth October and
call that organizing.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have to organize everywhere.

07:13.866 --> 07:15.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's everywhere
every year.

07:15.900 --> 07:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to
come back to the question we
were discussing a minute ago.

07:19.666 --> 07:24.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that is, how much of
what people are hearing
from Democrats now
is anti-Donald Trump?

07:27.133 --> 07:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you both do this,
the positive things
you're talking about, and
remain this relentless

07:31.766 --> 07:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anti-Trump machine that many
people think the Democrats are?

07:35.400 --> 07:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ: Well,
we can't match Trump
tweet for tweet, because
distracting Donald frequently

07:40.100 --> 07:42.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out there.

07:42.100 --> 07:46.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm sure, at the G20,
everyone was talking about
John Podesta's tweets.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so when you -- and then
you have this misnamed voter
integrity commission, which

07:52.033 --> 07:54.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is a voter suppression
commission.

07:54.666 --> 07:58.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we can't allow all of
the relentless conflict
and chaos that emanates
from this administration

08:02.933 --> 08:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to take our eye off the ball.

08:04.933 --> 08:08.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That's what today was
about with Leader Pelosi
and Senator Schumer.

08:08.166 --> 08:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was about telling the
American people we are the party
that's fighting for a better

08:12.333 --> 08:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
future for folks, for everyone.

08:14.433 --> 08:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're the party that's going
to make sure that you get that
good job that pays a decent

08:18.866 --> 08:21.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wage that allows
you to have dignity.

08:21.933 --> 08:23.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we have to do that.

08:23.966 --> 08:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's exactly what I do
everywhere I go, Judy, because
it is so important to tell

08:27.666 --> 08:31.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people what we stand for
and who we stand with.

08:31.333 --> 08:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tom Perez, the
chairman of the Democratic
Party, thank you very much.

08:35.266 --> 08:35.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
THOMAS PEREZ: Pleasure
to be with you.
