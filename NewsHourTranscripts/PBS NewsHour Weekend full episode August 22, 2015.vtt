FINANCIAL CRISIS AND PAY OFF ITS

00:29.062 --> 00:30.264
RECORD DEBT?

00:30.264 --> 00:31.832
DO YOU THINK PUERTO RICO WILL BE

00:31.832 --> 00:33.100
SEEN AS GREECE?

00:33.100 --> 00:34.835
>> IT'S HAPPENING ALREADY,

00:34.835 --> 17:00:18.724
AND I HATE IT.

17:00:18.724 --> 00:37.104
PUERTO RICO'S NOT GREECE.

00:37.104 --> 00:38.272
PUERTO RICO'S NOT A FOREIGN

00:38.272 --> 00:39.106
COUNTRY.

00:48.181 --> 00:48.982
>> Larson: GOOD EVENING.

00:48.982 --> 00:49.850
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:49.850 --> 00:51.318
I'M JOHN LARSON IN FOR HARI

00:51.318 --> 00:52.486
SREENIVASAN.

00:52.486 --> 00:54.454
THE PRESIDENTS OF FRANCE AND

00:54.454 --> 00:55.856
THE UNITED STATES ARE PRAISING

00:55.856 --> 00:57.391
THREE AMERICANS WHO SUBDUED A

00:57.391 --> 00:58.825
GUNMAN WHO ATTEMPTED TO CARRY

00:58.825 --> 01:00.494
OUT A MASS SHOOTING ON A

01:00.494 --> 01:01.895
PASSENGER TRAIN HEADING TOWARDS

01:01.895 --> 01:03.297
PARIS.

01:03.297 --> 01:04.798
THE HIGH SPEED THALYS TRAIN,

01:04.798 --> 01:06.466
GOING FROM AMSTERDAM TO PARIS

01:06.466 --> 01:08.902
LAST NIGHT, HAD 554 PASSENGERS

01:08.902 --> 01:09.937
ON BOARD.

01:09.937 --> 01:12.005
AMONG THEM WERE THREE AMERICAN

01:12.005 --> 01:13.874
FRIENDS IN THEIR EARLY 20s:

01:13.874 --> 01:15.776
SPENCER STONE, ANTHONY SADLER,

01:15.776 --> 01:18.178
AND ALEK SKARLATOS, TWO OF THEM

01:18.178 --> 01:19.613
ACTIVE MEMBERS OF THE U.S.

01:19.613 --> 01:20.847
MILITARY.

01:20.847 --> 01:22.482
THE GUNMAN BOARDED THE TRAIN IN

01:22.482 --> 01:24.084
BRUSSELS.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.519
HE ENTERED A PASSENGER CAR

01:25.519 --> 01:28.722
CARRYING AN AK-47 ASSAULT RIFLE,

01:28.722 --> 01:30.457
AN AUTOMATIC HANDGUN, AND A BOX

01:30.457 --> 01:31.425
CUTTER.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.060
STONE, WHO IS IN THE AIR FORCE,

01:33.060 --> 01:34.995
RAN DOWN THE AISLE AND TACKLED

01:34.995 --> 01:36.396
THE GUNMAN.

01:36.396 --> 01:37.197
>> I THINK SPENCER IS THE REAL

01:37.197 --> 01:38.031
HERO.

01:38.031 --> 01:39.700
HE WAS THE FIRST ONE TO JUMP ON

01:39.700 --> 01:40.701
HIM.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.602
HE IS THE ONE WHO GOT CUT UP.

01:42.602 --> 01:43.704
LIKE, NONE OF US ARE INJURED BUT

01:43.704 --> 01:44.438
SPENCER.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.806
SPENCER TOOK A FEW INJURIES, AND

01:45.806 --> 01:46.907
HE JUST HAD NO FEAR.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.976
AND HE'S OUR FRIEND, SO ONCE WE

01:48.976 --> 01:49.977
SAW HIM GO, WE HAD TO GO JOIN

01:49.977 --> 01:51.078
HIM, LIKE WE COULDN'T HAVE JUST

01:51.078 --> 01:53.547
LET EVERYBODY DIE LIKE THAT.

01:53.547 --> 01:55.115
IT WAS CRAZY SITUATION.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.116
>> Larson: SKARLATOS, WHO SERVES

01:56.116 --> 01:57.784
IN THE NATIONAL GUARD AND WAS

01:57.784 --> 01:58.719
RECENTLY DEPLOYED IN

01:58.719 --> 02:00.654
AFGHANISTAN, WRESTLED THE GUN

02:00.654 --> 02:01.822
AWAY.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.890
>> HE HAD ABOUT 7 OR 8 MAGAZINES

02:03.890 --> 02:06.026
IN HIS BACKPACK WITH HIM.

02:06.026 --> 02:07.294
AND TWO FIREARMS.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.029
SO, HE WAS THERE TO DO BUSINESS,

02:09.029 --> 02:09.997
THAT'S FOR SURE.

02:11.898 --> 02:12.899
WE ARE REALLY LUCKY THAT HIS AK

02:12.899 --> 02:14.735
JAMMED, OR ELSE I DON'T KNOW HOW

02:14.735 --> 02:16.837
IT WOULD HAVE TURNED OUT.

02:16.837 --> 02:17.838
>> Larson: STONE, STABBED IN THE

02:17.838 --> 02:19.006
NECK AND THE HAND DURING THE

02:19.006 --> 02:20.674
STRUGGLE, HAS BEEN TREATED AND

02:20.674 --> 02:23.110
RELEASED FROM A FRENCH HOSPITAL.

02:23.110 --> 02:24.611
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS TELEPHONED

02:24.611 --> 02:25.912
THE THREE AMERICAN MEN TO

02:25.912 --> 02:27.914
EXPRESS HIS GRATITUDE, AND

02:27.914 --> 02:29.516
FRENCH OFFICIALS HAVE AWARDED

02:29.516 --> 02:31.284
THEM MEDALS, ALONG WITH A

02:31.284 --> 02:32.919
BRITISH BUSINESSMAN WHO HELPED

02:32.919 --> 02:34.755
TIE UP THE GUNMAN.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.490
THE GUNMAN'S IDENTITY HAS NOT

02:36.490 --> 02:38.191
YET BEEN CONFIRMED, BUT FRENCH

02:38.191 --> 02:40.060
OFFICIALS HAVE DESCRIBED HIM AS

02:40.060 --> 02:42.229
A 26-YEAR-OLD MOROCCAN.

02:42.229 --> 02:43.997
HE REMAINS IN POLICE CUSTODY IN

02:43.997 --> 02:45.465
PARIS.

02:45.465 --> 02:46.767
FRANCE AND BELGIUM HAVE

02:46.767 --> 02:48.735
INCREASED POLICE PATROLS IN RAIL

02:48.735 --> 02:50.337
STATIONS AND ON THE HIGH SPEED

02:50.337 --> 02:52.672
TRAIN LINE, WHICH CONNECTS 17

02:52.672 --> 02:54.441
EUROPEAN CITIES.

02:54.441 --> 02:55.642
THE TRAINS HAVE NO METAL

02:55.642 --> 02:58.278
DETECTORS OR SECURITY CHECKS.

02:58.278 --> 02:59.646
OFFICIALS FROM NORTH AND SOUTH

02:59.646 --> 03:01.581
KOREA MET TODAY IN AN EFFORT TO

03:01.581 --> 03:03.617
EASE TENSIONS, FOLLOWING AN

03:03.617 --> 03:05.152
EXCHANGE OF ARTILLERY FIRE

03:05.152 --> 03:06.653
EARLIER THIS WEEK.

03:06.653 --> 03:08.155
TODAY'S TALKS WERE HELD IN THE

03:08.155 --> 03:09.723
DEMILITARIZED ZONE BETWEEN THE

03:09.723 --> 03:11.792
TWO COUNTRIES, IN THE SAME TOWN

03:11.792 --> 03:13.393
WHERE BOTH SIDES SIGNED THEIR

03:13.393 --> 03:15.962
ARMISTICE IN 1953.

03:15.962 --> 03:17.697
ON THURSDAY, NORTH KOREA FIRED

03:17.697 --> 03:19.366
ROCKETS AT SOUTH KOREAN

03:19.366 --> 03:21.468
LOUDSPEAKERS BROADCASTING ANTI-

03:21.468 --> 03:23.437
NORTH KOREAN PROPAGANDA, AND

03:23.437 --> 03:25.005
THREATENED FURTHER MILITARY

03:25.005 --> 03:26.006
ACTION.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.741
SOUTH KOREA RESPONDED BY FIRING

03:27.741 --> 03:29.609
DOZENS OF ARTILLERY ROUNDS INTO

03:29.609 --> 03:30.744
NORTH KOREA.

03:30.744 --> 03:32.612
NO CASUALTIES WERE REPORTED ON

03:32.612 --> 03:33.914
EITHER SIDE.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.615
THE SOUTH KOREAN BROADCASTS

03:35.615 --> 03:37.617
BEGAN AFTER TWO OF ITS SOLDIERS

03:37.617 --> 03:39.019
WERE INJURED BY A LANDMINE

03:39.019 --> 03:40.821
EXPLOSION IN THE D.M.Z. ON

03:40.821 --> 03:42.089
AUGUST 4.

03:42.089 --> 03:43.657
JOINING ME NOW VIA SKYPE FROM

03:43.657 --> 03:45.625
SEOUL SOUTH KOREA IS JEAN LEE,

03:45.625 --> 03:47.360
SHE IS A FELLOW AT THE WILSON

03:47.360 --> 03:48.562
CENTER, WHICH CONDUCTS

03:48.562 --> 03:50.063
INDEPENDENT RESEARCH ON GLOBAL

03:50.063 --> 03:51.098
ISSUES.

03:51.098 --> 03:52.466
LEE IS THE FORMER ASSOCIATED

03:52.466 --> 03:53.900
PRESS BUREAU CHIEF IN THE NORTH

03:53.900 --> 03:55.502
KOREAN CAPITAL OF PYONGYANG.

03:55.502 --> 03:56.870
JANE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

03:56.870 --> 03:57.938
JOINING US.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.172
YOU'VE JUST RETURNED FROM THE

03:59.172 --> 04:01.475
BORDER AREA, CORRECT?

04:01.475 --> 04:02.409
>> I HAVE.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.311
I WAS UP THERE EARLIER TODAY.

04:04.311 --> 04:06.346
I MADE A LITTLE DAY TRIP UP TO

04:06.346 --> 04:08.615
PAJU, RIGHT ON THE BORDER ON

04:08.615 --> 04:10.283
THE SOUTH KOREAN SIDE.

04:10.283 --> 04:11.451
>> Larson: WE HEARD TENSIONS

04:11.451 --> 04:12.919
HAVE BEEN VERY HIGH THIS WEEK.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.354
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT

04:14.354 --> 04:15.889
TODAY?

04:15.889 --> 04:17.424
>> I HAVE A FEELING THAT IT

04:17.424 --> 04:18.692
LOOKS LOT MORE TENSE FROM

04:18.692 --> 04:20.093
WHERE YOU'RE SITTING THAN IT DID

04:20.093 --> 04:21.728
FOR ME IN PAJU.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.964
I CAN TELL YOU ANY TIME I ASKED

04:23.964 --> 04:25.532
PEOPLE IN PAJU IF THEY WERE

04:25.532 --> 04:26.800
WORRIED THEY JUST LAUGHED AT THE

04:26.800 --> 04:27.567
QUESTION.

04:27.567 --> 04:30.070
SOUTH KOREANS ARE USED TO THIS

04:30.070 --> 04:30.904
KIND OF TENSION.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.038
THEY'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS

04:32.038 --> 04:33.840
FOR DECADES AND TO A CERTAIN

04:33.840 --> 04:35.709
DEGREE LIFE GOES ON AS USUAL.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.677
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE OF

04:37.677 --> 04:40.347
PANIC IN THE TOWN OF PAJU.

04:40.347 --> 04:41.615
>> Larson: TO WHAT EXTENT DO

04:41.615 --> 04:44.584
YOU THINK THIS IS SABER RATTLING

04:44.584 --> 04:46.019
BY THE DIFFERENT LEADERS OF THE

04:46.019 --> 04:47.020
TWO COUNTRIES?

04:47.020 --> 04:48.121
OBVIOUSLY, THE NORTH KOREAN

04:48.121 --> 04:49.623
LEADER NOT MUCH IS KNOWN ABOUT

04:49.623 --> 04:51.391
THE PERSON'S ABILITY TO CONTROL

04:51.391 --> 04:52.959
THE MILITARY IN THE SOUTH.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.060
HE'S BEEN CRITICIZED FOR BEING

04:54.060 --> 04:55.095
TOO SOFT.

04:55.095 --> 04:56.396
IS THIS SORT OF AN OPPORTUNITY

04:56.396 --> 04:58.698
FOR BOTH OF THEM TO LOOK TOUGH?

04:58.698 --> 05:00.066
>> CERTAINLY.

05:00.066 --> 05:01.568
I THINK YOU'VE GOT THAT RIGHT.

05:01.568 --> 05:03.370
WITH THE NORTH KOREANS,

05:03.370 --> 05:05.805
THESE KINDS PROVOCATIONS ARE A

05:05.805 --> 05:07.774
WAY AIR, GOOD CHANCE TO REMIND

05:07.774 --> 05:09.176
THE SOUTH KOREANS AND REMIND THE

05:09.176 --> 05:11.444
WORLD THAT THE KOREAN WAR

05:11.444 --> 05:12.779
REMAINS UNRESOLVED.

05:12.779 --> 05:15.849
THE TWO SIDES AGREED TO A

05:15.849 --> 05:18.251
CEASE-FIRE IN 1953 BUT THEY DID

05:18.251 --> 05:20.487
NOT SIGN A PEACE TREATY SO THE

05:20.487 --> 05:21.788
KOREAN PENINSULA REMAINS IN A

05:21.788 --> 05:23.256
TECHNICAL STATE OF WAR AND IT'S

05:23.256 --> 05:25.225
THE REASON THE U.S. MILITARY HAS

05:25.225 --> 05:27.661
MORE THAN 28,000 TROOPS ON SOUTH

05:27.661 --> 05:28.762
KOREAN SOILS.

05:28.762 --> 05:31.731
NOW, NORTH KOREA MAY LOOK AT

05:31.731 --> 05:33.967
THIS AS A REASON TO PROVOKE BUT

05:33.967 --> 05:36.369
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE THREAT

05:36.369 --> 05:38.505
OF AN OUTSIDE FORCE TO BRING OUT

05:38.505 --> 05:40.607
PATRIOTISM, AND PERHAPS WHAT HE

05:40.607 --> 05:41.908
WANTS TO SHOW HIS PEOPLE IS THAT

05:41.908 --> 05:43.710
HE CAN DEFEND THEM FROM THIS

05:43.710 --> 05:45.445
THREAT FROM SOUTH KOREA AND THE

05:45.445 --> 05:46.413
UNITED STATES.

05:46.413 --> 05:48.114
ON THE OTHER HAND, HE MAY WANT

05:48.114 --> 05:50.217
TO SHOW HIS PEOPLE AS WELL THAT

05:50.217 --> 05:51.718
HE'S A STATESMAN, THAT HE CAN

05:51.718 --> 05:53.587
SUNDAY HIS AIDS INTO THE D.M.Z.

05:53.587 --> 05:54.888
AND COME BACK WITH SOME SORT OF

05:54.888 --> 05:57.224
SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENT WITH THE

05:57.224 --> 05:58.158
SOUTH KOREANS.

05:58.158 --> 05:59.859
SO I THINK THAT IT WILL BE

05:59.859 --> 06:00.927
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW IT PANS

06:00.927 --> 06:01.828
OUT.

06:01.828 --> 06:02.862
I'M NOT SO SURE THAT THE

06:02.862 --> 06:04.164
TENSIONS ARE QUITE OVER YET.

06:04.164 --> 06:04.965
>> Larson: JEAN, FOR THE PAST

06:04.965 --> 06:06.099
FOUR OR FIVE YEARS, CERTAINLY,

06:06.099 --> 06:07.968
THIS SHOVING MATCH SEEMS TO TAKE

06:07.968 --> 06:09.502
PLACE AROUND THIS TYPE OF YEAR

06:09.502 --> 06:10.303
EVERY YEAR.

06:10.303 --> 06:10.904
WHY IS THAT?

06:10.904 --> 06:13.907
>> THE SOUTH KOREANS HOLD

06:13.907 --> 06:16.676
MILITARY EXERCISES THIS TIME

06:16.676 --> 06:19.112
OF YEAR AND THIS THEY CALL

06:19.112 --> 06:20.647
DEFENSIVE EXERCISES BUT NORTH

06:20.647 --> 06:22.182
KOREA CREATE IS AS A REHEARSAL

06:22.182 --> 06:23.350
FOR INVASION.

06:23.350 --> 06:25.318
SO IT DOES TEND TO RILE THEM UP.

06:25.318 --> 06:27.487
IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT THIS

06:27.487 --> 06:28.855
KIND OF TENSION IS HAPPENING

06:28.855 --> 06:29.923
THIS TIME OF YEAR.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.191
THERE'S ONE OTHER THING THAT IS

06:31.191 --> 06:32.025
GOING ON.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.193
NORTH KOREA IS GEARING UP FOR A

06:33.193 --> 06:35.195
MAJOR ANNIVERSARY, THE 70th

06:35.195 --> 06:36.930
ANNIVERSARY OF THE WORKERS PARTY

06:36.930 --> 06:37.731
OF KOREA.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.966
THAT HAPPENS IN OCTOBER, AND SO

06:39.966 --> 06:41.568
THAT IS ALSO AN OCCASION TO TRY

06:41.568 --> 06:42.702
TO BRING THE PEOPLE TOGETHER.

06:42.702 --> 06:43.737
SO THEY MAY BE LOOKING FOR

06:43.737 --> 06:45.705
REASONS TO KIND OF DRAW THE

06:45.705 --> 06:47.607
PEOPLE TOGETHER.

06:47.607 --> 06:48.908
JEAN LEE FROM THE WILSON

06:48.908 --> 06:49.576
CENTER.

06:49.576 --> 06:50.477
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

06:50.477 --> 06:51.344
US.

06:51.344 --> 06:52.879
>> THANK YOU.

07:02.389 --> 07:03.456
>> Larson: IN OUR SIGNATURE

07:03.456 --> 07:04.724
SEGMENT, WE FOCUS ON PUERTO

07:04.724 --> 07:05.892
RICO, IN THE MIDST OF AN

07:05.892 --> 07:08.161
HISTORIC ECONOMIC CRISIS.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.797
A U.S. TERRITORY SINCE 1898,

07:10.797 --> 07:12.632
PUERTO RICO HAS ACCUMULATED

07:12.632 --> 07:14.834
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN BOND DEBT

07:14.834 --> 07:16.770
THAT IT IS INCREASINGLY UNABLE

07:16.770 --> 07:18.171
TO PAY BACK.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.572
THIS FOLLOWS A DECADE IN WHICH

07:19.572 --> 07:21.241
HUNDREDS OF BUSINESSES AND

07:21.241 --> 07:24.110
FACTORIES CLOSED, AND 300,000

07:24.110 --> 07:26.079
RESIDENTS LEFT THE ISLAND.

07:26.079 --> 07:27.714
AND TODAY, THE POVERTY RATE IN

07:27.714 --> 07:29.215
PUERTO RICO IS HIGHER THAN THAT

07:29.215 --> 07:30.984
OF ANY U.S. STATE.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.798
JUAN'S BIGGEST HOSPITAL, CENTRO

07:44.798 --> 07:46.700
MEDICO, WHERE PATIENTS LINE THE

07:46.700 --> 07:48.268

07:48.268 --> 07:50.136
ENOUGH NURSES TO TREAT THEM OR

07:55.642 --> 07:56.910
>> THERE IS NO BEDS AVAILABLE IN

07:56.910 --> 07:58.211
THE HOSPITAL, SO THEY HAVE TO

07:58.211 --> 07:59.346
WAIT HERE FOR A BED.

07:59.346 --> 08:00.046

08:03.616 --> 08:04.551

08:04.551 --> 08:06.486
TO MAYBE A WEEK, YES.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.520

08:07.520 --> 08:09.489

BIGGER TROUBLES: A THIRD OF THE

08:13.026 --> 08:15.195

08:15.195 --> 08:16.363

RELY ON THAT MONEY TO PROVIDE

08:24.037 --> 08:25.138
SERVICES.

08:25.138 --> 08:26.606
BUT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT

08:26.606 --> 08:28.908
REIMBURSES PUERTO RICO AT A MUCH

08:28.908 --> 08:30.944
LOWER RATE THAN STATES GET.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.645
AND NOW, A DRAMATIC HIKE IN

08:32.645 --> 08:34.848
SALES TAXES-- A NEW AUSTERITY

08:34.848 --> 08:36.883
MEASURE TO HELP PUERTO RICO PAY

08:36.883 --> 08:38.485
BACK ITS DEBT-- IS SQUEEZING

AT ASHFORD PRESBYTERIAN

08:43.123 --> 08:45.325
COMMUNITY HOSPITAL IN SAN JUAN,

08:45.325 --> 08:47.527
THE NEW, HIGHER TAXES ARE

08:47.527 --> 08:49.362
COSTING THE HOSPITAL EVEN MORE

08:49.362 --> 08:51.064
FOR EVERYTHING IT HAS TO BUY,

08:51.064 --> 08:53.366
INCLUDING ALL ITS SUPPLIES,

$700,000.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.512

09:06.513 --> 09:07.247

09:16.055 --> 09:17.924
ANOTHER NEW TAX ON SERVICES--

09:17.924 --> 09:19.793
ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE JUST

09:19.793 --> 09:21.694
OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW

09:21.694 --> 09:22.562
REVENUE.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.531
NOT NEARLY ENOUGH TO PUT A

09:24.531 --> 09:26.433
SIGNIFICANT DENT IN PUERTO

09:26.433 --> 09:30.170
RICO'S $72 BILLION DEBT.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.105

09:32.105 --> 09:33.306
DIFIÍCIL.

09:33.306 --> 09:34.340

09:34.340 --> 09:35.842
RICO'S GOVERNOR, ALEJANDRO

09:35.842 --> 09:38.044
GARCIA PADILLA, MADE A STUNNING

09:38.044 --> 09:39.712
ANNOUNCEMENT, APPEARING ON

09:39.712 --> 09:41.815
TELEVISION TO SAY, "THE PUBLIC

09:41.815 --> 09:44.417
DEBT IS UNPAYABLE."

09:44.417 --> 09:45.518
AND PLEDGED TO COME UP WITH A

09:45.518 --> 09:47.387
PLAN BY THE END OF AUGUST.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.355
PUERTO RICO IS IN A BIND.

09:49.355 --> 09:50.924
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS FLATLY

09:50.924 --> 09:52.792
REJECTED ANY KIND OF FEDERAL

09:52.792 --> 09:53.660
BAILOUT.

09:53.660 --> 09:55.361
AND THE TERRITORY DOES NOT HAVE

09:55.361 --> 09:57.030
ACCESS TO THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY

09:57.030 --> 09:58.031
COURTS.

09:58.031 --> 09:59.866
SO PUERTO RICO HAS BEGUN TO

09:59.866 --> 10:01.568
DEFAULT ON SOME OF ITS MASSIVE

10:01.568 --> 10:03.770
DEBT, THE FIRST SUCH FAILURE TO

10:03.770 --> 10:05.605
PAY BY AN AMERICAN STATE OR

10:05.605 --> 10:07.006
TERRITORY SINCE THE GREAT

10:07.006 --> 10:08.508
DEPRESSION.

10:08.508 --> 10:09.676
DO YOU THINK THIS WILL GIVE

10:09.676 --> 10:11.277
PUERTO RICO A BLACK EYE, THAT IT

10:11.277 --> 10:12.912
WILL BE SEEN AS GREECE?

10:12.912 --> 10:14.347
>> IT'S HAPPENING ALREADY.

10:14.347 --> 10:15.748
AND I HATE IT.

10:15.748 --> 10:17.550
PUERTO RICO'S NOT GREECE.

10:17.550 --> 10:18.718
PUERTO RICO'S NOT A FOREIGN

10:18.718 --> 10:19.586
COUNTRY.

10:19.586 --> 10:21.287

10:22.655 --> 10:24.657
REPRESENTATIVE TO CONGRESS.

10:24.657 --> 10:26.392
WHY IS PUERTO RICO DEFAULTING ON

10:26.392 --> 10:27.694
ITS DEBT?

10:27.694 --> 10:28.761
>> WELL, FIRST, IT SHOULDN'T BE

10:28.761 --> 10:30.330
DEFAULTING.

10:30.330 --> 10:33.700
BUT THE TRUTH IS WE PILED UP

10:33.700 --> 10:36.402
QUITE A BIT OF DEBT, AND I'M

10:36.402 --> 10:38.471
TALKING ABOUT 18 GOVERNMENT

10:38.471 --> 10:40.907
ENTITIES WHICH ISSUED BONDS FOR

10:40.907 --> 10:41.875
DECADES.

10:41.875 --> 10:42.909
>> Reporter: SOME OF THOSE BONDS

10:42.909 --> 10:44.644
ARE GUARANTEED BY THE PUERTO

10:44.644 --> 10:46.045
RICAN CONSTITUTION.

10:46.045 --> 10:47.347
BUT OTHERS, SUCH AS THOSE ISSUED

10:47.347 --> 10:48.848
BY THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED ELECTRIC

10:48.848 --> 10:50.850
POWER AUTHORITY, ARE NOT.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.585
CONGRESSMAN PIERLUISI HAS

10:52.585 --> 10:54.420
INTRODUCED A BILL TO ALLOW THOSE

10:54.420 --> 10:56.623
AGENCIES TO APPLY FOR CHAPTER 9

10:56.623 --> 10:58.458
BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION, JUST LIKE

10:58.458 --> 11:00.159
THEY CAN IN THE STATES.

11:00.159 --> 11:01.928
IT WOULD LET PUERTO RICAN OWNED

11:01.928 --> 11:03.763
ENTITIES AND CITIES DO WHAT

11:03.763 --> 11:05.999
DETROIT DID: RESTRUCTURE DEBTS

11:05.999 --> 11:07.400
WITH ALL THEIR CREDITORS AT THE

11:07.400 --> 11:10.436
SAME TIME; WIPE THE SLATE CLEAN.

11:10.436 --> 11:11.771
>> WE NEED CHAPTER 9, BECAUSE

11:11.771 --> 11:14.407
WHEN YOU NEED TO REORGANIZE AN

11:14.407 --> 11:17.043
ENTITY, ADJUST ITS DEBTS, THE

11:17.043 --> 11:19.679
ONLY WAY TO DO IT IN THE U.S. IN

11:19.679 --> 11:22.749
AN ORDERLY, LEGAL FASHION IS

11:22.749 --> 11:24.384
UNDER THE PROTECTION OF A

11:24.384 --> 11:26.886
FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY COURT.

11:26.886 --> 11:28.221
WE CANNOT.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.989
IT'S UNFAIR.

11:29.989 --> 11:30.990
>> Reporter: THE BONDS WERE

11:30.990 --> 11:32.258
POPULAR WITH INVESTORS, BECAUSE

11:32.258 --> 11:34.227
THEY ARE TAX-FREE, PAY A HIGH

11:34.227 --> 11:35.862
YIELD, AND SOME HAVE THAT

11:35.862 --> 11:37.830
GUARANTEE IN PUERTO RICO'S

11:37.830 --> 11:39.098
CONSTITUTION.

11:39.098 --> 11:40.967
IT'S ESTIMATED THAT PUERTO RICO

11:40.967 --> 11:42.535
RESIDENTS OWN ABOUT A THIRD OF

11:42.535 --> 11:43.536
THE BONDS.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.738
AMERICAN INVESTORS, INDIVIDUALLY

11:45.738 --> 11:47.340
AND THROUGH MUTUAL FUNDS, OWN

11:47.340 --> 11:48.741
BILLIONS AS WELL.

11:48.741 --> 11:50.510
AND HEDGE FUNDS HAVE ALSO

11:50.510 --> 11:52.478
SCOOPED UP A BIG CHUNK, OFTEN AT

12:01.554 --> 12:03.356

12:03.356 --> 12:06.492
CORRECTLY PERCEIVED AS REWRITING

12:06.492 --> 12:09.896
THE RULES RETROACTIVELY AND I

12:09.896 --> 12:11.598
THINK IT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE

MARKET.

12:14.067 --> 12:14.901

12:14.901 --> 12:16.402
BANKRUPTCY BECAUSE HE SAYS THAT

12:16.402 --> 12:17.670
WOULD MAKE IT HARDER IN THE

12:17.670 --> 12:19.772
FUTURE FOR PUERTO RICO TO BORROW

12:19.772 --> 12:21.608
MONEY IN THE BOND MARKETS.

12:21.608 --> 12:22.942

12:22.942 --> 12:24.911
IT'S NOT IN PUERTO RICO'S BANKS,

12:24.911 --> 12:26.646
IT'S NOT IN THE POCKETS OF THE

12:26.646 --> 12:28.147
PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO.

12:28.147 --> 12:30.650
THEY HAVE TO COME OUT ELEGANTLY

12:30.650 --> 12:33.252
FROM THIS CRISIS IN ORDER TO

12:33.252 --> 12:35.922
RESUME NORMAL FINANCING.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.590

12:37.590 --> 12:38.558
AN ORDERLY PROCESS TO

12:38.558 --> 12:39.626
RESTRUCTURE ITS UNSUSTAINABLE

12:39.626 --> 12:41.160

PRIVATIZING PUBLIC WORKS, AND

15:09.242 --> 15:11.344
EXEMPTING PUERTO RICO FROM A

1920 LAW THAT REQUIRES ALL GOODS

15:13.746 --> 15:16.048

15:25.925 --> 15:28.027
BELIEVE PUERTO RICO IS EVEN MORE
