WEBVTT

00:06.139 --> 00:09.643
GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill. Judy Woodruff is
away.

00:09.643 --> 00:15.449
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Hungary declares a state of
crisis, as refugees flood its
border,

00:15.449 --> 00:22.256
while at least 22 migrants die
after a boat capsizes off the
coast of Turkey.

00:22.256 --> 00:27.527
Also ahead this Tuesday: In
Seattle, a tentative deal is
reached to end a teachers
strike.

00:27.527 --> 00:31.498
Plus, with two women running for
president, we look at Republican
efforts to court female

00:31.498 --> 00:34.868
voters ahead of
tomorrow's debate.

00:34.868 --> 00:40.073
LISA DESJARDINS: Of the 15
presidential candidates, of
course, Fiorina will be the only
woman

00:40.073 --> 00:45.012
debating tomorrow night, and
that's an issue for Republicans.
How do they get more women

00:45.012 --> 00:47.881
to run for president? Well, some
say they need to encourage more
women to run for other

00:47.881 --> 00:49.449
offices.

00:49.449 --> 00:56.123
GWEN IFILL: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:56.123 --> 01:00.560
(BREAK)

01:00.560 --> 01:10.704
GWEN IFILL: The many thousands
on a desperate journey into
Europe's heartland hit the wall

01:10.704 --> 01:15.709
today, literally. A barrier
fence sealed off the length of
Hungary's southern frontier,

01:15.709 --> 01:18.912
the main land route
for the migrants.

01:18.912 --> 01:22.649
James Mates of Independent
Television News reports from the
scene.

01:22.649 --> 01:29.122
JAMES MATES: "Open, open," they
cry, 2,000 or more refugees
pressing against Hungary's

01:29.122 --> 01:33.894
newly fortified border with its
southern neighbor, Serbia.

01:33.894 --> 01:39.266
There has been a human river
flowing northward for weeks.
This is what happens when you
try

01:39.266 --> 01:44.404
to top stop that flow. The crowd
have been growing since early
morning as the first arrivals

01:44.404 --> 01:50.477
confronted the new three-meter
high razor wire fence, one
obstacle too many in their

01:50.477 --> 01:54.348
bid to get to Germany. Instead,
they must walk along it to an
official transit center

01:54.348 --> 01:57.150
built from shipping containers.

01:57.150 --> 02:03.323
The thousands walking this trail
can enter Hungary through this
door and this door alone,

02:03.323 --> 02:09.229
and the wait will be
interminable. They have traveled
hundreds of miles to get here.
They

02:09.229 --> 02:15.802
find this quite literally the
door into the E.U. And it's
shut. So, they waited, in a

02:15.802 --> 02:21.008
field, in the blazing
sun all day.

02:21.008 --> 02:23.577
A former prime minister
of Hungary came to look.

02:23.577 --> 02:26.713
MAN: It's terrible, what we are
seeing here. It's terrible.

02:26.713 --> 02:35.489
JAMES MATES: He was disgusted by
what his successor was doing.
Mohammed al-Mahaney (ph)

02:35.489 --> 02:40.193
from Damascus, spotting a senior
Hungarian, asked for her to find
his wife, who crossed

02:40.193 --> 02:44.131
the border without him. Mohammed
now admits, if he had known what
was waiting for him,

02:44.131 --> 02:46.266
he might never have left Syria.

02:46.266 --> 02:49.536
MAN: Hopefully. Look at this.

02:49.536 --> 02:53.573
JAMES MATES: Is this
what you expected?

02:53.573 --> 02:58.011
MAN: Of course not. This is
because I tried to be legal.
This is only because I tried

02:58.011 --> 03:07.587
to be legal. They want us to be
illegal? This fence will not
help them.

03:07.587 --> 03:13.794
JAMES MATES: Patience quickly
ran out. Demanding the right to
go to Germany, they sat in the

03:13.794 --> 03:16.663
middle of a main motorway
between Hungary and Serbia. If
they weren't going to cross

03:16.663 --> 03:21.868
the border, nor was anyone else.

03:21.868 --> 03:27.574
Women brought tiny babies up to
the austere metal fence,
pleading to be let through.
Instead,

03:27.574 --> 03:31.645
the bolts were tightened.
Nervous policemen gripped their
cans of tear gas in case there

03:31.645 --> 03:35.849
was to be an assault.

03:35.849 --> 03:40.854
It is a standoff. The Serbians
want this border open to relieve
the pressure they're under.

03:40.854 --> 03:46.259
Many others in Europe believe
this is not how refugees should
be treated. But Hungary

03:46.259 --> 03:51.698
has made this central to their
policy and seem unlikely to back
down.

03:51.698 --> 03:58.605
GWEN IFILL: Hungary also began
enforcing new laws, arresting
174 people for trying to cross

03:58.605 --> 04:04.077
illegally. In response, Serbia
started bussing migrants toward
Croatia, which also has a

04:04.077 --> 04:07.981
border with Hungary. But the
Hungarians defended their
actions.

04:07.981 --> 04:10.717
ZOLTAN KOVACS, Hungarian
Government Spokesman: The
freedom of movement, the freedom
of settlement,

04:10.717 --> 04:15.155
the freedom of the flow of goods
is being endangered by the very
fact that illegal migrants

04:15.155 --> 04:19.292
will come, will try to come at
will through the green borders.
And that is not going to

04:19.292 --> 04:22.729
stop if Hungary is
not stopping them.

04:22.729 --> 04:26.666
GWEN IFILL: In Washington,
President Obama met with the
king of Spain and expressed new

04:26.666 --> 04:29.870
concern about the
crisis in Europe.

04:29.870 --> 04:35.809
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: We agreed that
this is going to require
cooperation

04:35.809 --> 04:41.114
with all the European countries
and the United States and the
international community in

04:41.114 --> 04:52.392
order to ensure that people are
safe, that they are treated with
shared humanity, and

04:52.392 --> 04:56.897
that we ultimately have to deal
with the source of the problem,
which is the ongoing crisis

04:56.897 --> 04:59.199
in Syria.

04:59.199 --> 05:03.904
GWEN IFILL: There were new
casualties today among the
thousands of Syrians trying to
make

05:03.904 --> 05:09.843
the journey. We will have a
report on that front in the
crisis after the news summary.

05:09.843 --> 05:14.648
Losses mounted today from the
firestorm that swept part of
Northern California over the

05:14.648 --> 05:20.053
weekend. Officials gained access
to more burned-out areas about
100 miles north of San
Francisco,

05:20.053 --> 05:23.490
not far from Napa Valley.

05:23.490 --> 05:30.096
Overnight, the count of homes
consumed by the Valley Fire
surged to 585, a number that

05:30.096 --> 05:36.536
could rise even higher as the
big blaze keeps burning. At
least 9,000 more homes are in

05:36.536 --> 05:44.611
its path. The massive fire has
engulfed 104 square miles across
three counties. In hard-hit

05:44.611 --> 05:49.749
Middletown, the newly homeless
are trying to absorb the
enormity of their losses.

05:49.749 --> 05:55.188
MAN: My house burnt up in
probably about 30 minutes. I
lived on Hoberg South, which is

05:55.188 --> 05:59.859
basically where the fire
originated from. And we were at
a soccer game, got home a little

05:59.859 --> 06:05.365
after 2:00 p.m. Our house was
gone by 3:00 and we really don't
have anything left.

06:05.365 --> 06:10.837
GWEN IFILL: For those families,
donated clothing and food are on
hand at an evacuation center

06:10.837 --> 06:15.542
at the Napa County Fairgrounds.
Many of the evacuees still don't
know if their homes and

06:15.542 --> 06:18.311
belongings even survived.

06:18.311 --> 06:22.549
MAN: I know everybody wants to
know, what -- what happens? When
do we get to go home?

06:22.549 --> 06:25.552
It's not an easy question. You
get to go home when it's safe.

06:25.552 --> 06:30.490
GWEN IFILL: Others are just
trying to maintain hope, in the
face of the devastation.

06:30.490 --> 06:36.096
MAN: I'm not going to be defined
by things like this, you know?
It's -- you have a choice

06:36.096 --> 06:38.798
of how you handle things in
life, and I think this is the
way I want to handle it,
positive.

06:38.798 --> 06:41.968
We will move forward. We
will get through this.

06:41.968 --> 06:46.840
GWEN IFILL: Nearly 2,400
firefighters are battling the
Valley Fire. By this morning,

06:46.840 --> 06:51.244
it was only 15
percent contained.

06:51.244 --> 06:54.547
One person died in the Valley
Fire: an elderly woman whose
body was found in the gutted
remains

06:54.547 --> 06:57.717
of her home.

06:57.717 --> 07:02.055
Another major wildfire has
burned nearly 200 homes and
outbuildings southeast of
Sacramento.

07:02.055 --> 07:05.759
It's now about
one-third contained.

07:05.759 --> 07:11.364
A small town in Utah is in
mourning tonight after flash
floods killed 12 people Monday

07:11.364 --> 07:16.970
evening. One other was missing.
Authorities said a wall of water
smashed into Hildale,

07:16.970 --> 07:22.676
just above the border with
Arizona. An SUV and a van
carrying women and children were

07:22.676 --> 07:29.316
washed miles downstream by the
torrent triggered by a heavy
rainfall in a canyon above the

07:29.316 --> 07:34.654
town. Flood warnings remained in
force today, with more storms in
the forecast.

07:34.654 --> 07:39.993
In North Korea, state media
announced the communist nation's
nuclear fuel plants have

07:39.993 --> 07:46.633
been upgraded and restarted.
That includes the main plutonium
enrichment site at Yongbyon.

07:46.633 --> 07:52.605
Upgrades there could let the
North build new, more
sophisticated nuclear warheads.

07:52.605 --> 07:57.777
Russian President Vladimir Putin
today strongly defended Moscow's
military aid to the government

07:57.777 --> 08:03.683
of Syria. He said such
intervention is needed to defeat
the Islamic State group. Putin
spoke

08:03.683 --> 08:08.421
in Tajikistan at a meeting of
ex-Soviet nations, and he urged
other countries to follow
Russia's

08:08.421 --> 08:10.423
example.

08:10.423 --> 08:14.627
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through translator):
I would like to say that we are

08:14.627 --> 08:19.199
supporting the government of
Syria in the fight against
terrorist aggression, and will

08:19.199 --> 08:24.137
continue to offer military
technical assistance. It's clear
that without an active
participation

08:24.137 --> 08:27.040
of the Syrian authorities and
the military, it would be
impossible to expel the
terrorists

08:27.040 --> 08:30.076
from that country and
the region as a whole.

08:30.076 --> 08:35.815
GWEN IFILL: Putin rejected
allegations that Russian support
has sparked the flow of refugees

08:35.815 --> 08:41.788
out of Syria. He said the
situation would be even worse if
Moscow had not stepped in.

08:41.788 --> 08:46.159
Desperate officials in Malaysia
turned to cloud-seeding today to
battle a smoky haze

08:46.159 --> 08:51.865
that's blanketed swathes of
Southeast Asia. Planes will spew
chemicals into the air to

08:51.865 --> 08:57.003
promote rainfall and clear the
air. The haze is coming from
illegal fires set in neighboring

08:57.003 --> 09:01.708
Indonesia to clear land. It's so
bad, and dangerous to breathe,
that schools across

09:01.708 --> 09:06.279
three states in Malaysia
had to close today.

09:06.279 --> 09:11.885
Back in this country,
Hewlett-Packard announced up to
30,000 jobs will be cut when it
spins

09:11.885 --> 09:18.024
off its software, consulting,
and data analysis business. H.P.
already shed thousands of
workers

09:18.024 --> 09:23.997
in recent years amid falling
demand for its personal
computers and printers.

09:23.997 --> 09:28.935
And Wall Street shot higher, as
weaker economic data raised
hopes that the Federal Reserve

09:28.935 --> 09:35.642
might delay raising interest
rates. The Dow Jones industrial
average gained nearly 230

09:35.642 --> 09:43.817
points to close at 16600. The
Nasdaq rose 54 points and the
S&P 500 added 25.

09:43.817 --> 09:48.555
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a state of crisis, as Europe
grapples with refugees;

09:48.555 --> 10:04.170
how Republicans are trying to
court women voters; and much
more.

10:04.170 --> 10:07.874
Now to another tragedy at sea.

10:07.874 --> 10:12.178
Earlier today, a boat filled
past its capacity with migrants
and refugees capsized off the

10:12.178 --> 10:16.249
Turkish coast, drowning
more than 20 people.

10:16.249 --> 10:21.488
"PBS NewsHour"'s Malcolm
Brabant, who was on shore as
survivors returned to the
Turkish

10:21.488 --> 10:27.260
city of Bodrum, reports tonight
on why so many are still willing
to take the risk.

10:27.260 --> 10:32.298
MALCOLM BRABANT: The boat
capsized and sank less than two
miles after setting off from

10:32.298 --> 10:37.804
Bodrum. More than 240 people
were packed into the
65-foot-long vessel, which was
normally

10:37.804 --> 10:42.008
used for tourist trips. It was
heading for the nearby Greek
island of Kos, which has

10:42.008 --> 10:45.745
become one of the main
entry points to Europe.

10:45.745 --> 10:52.685
Turkish Coast Guards managed to
rescue 220 people, but 22
drowned, four of them children,

10:52.685 --> 10:58.191
one a 16-day-old baby. The
survivors were brought back to
the coast guard station in

10:58.191 --> 11:04.030
Bodrum, where medical teams were
on hand to deal with the trauma
of their experience.

11:04.030 --> 11:12.472
A group of small children were
among the first to be placed on
special buses by police. The

11:12.472 --> 11:17.243
whole drama was played out in
front of European tourists like
Harlene Bown, who had been to

11:17.243 --> 11:20.513
Turkey for a day shopping and
were boarding boats back to
their resorts in Kos the legal

11:20.513 --> 11:22.248
way.

11:22.248 --> 11:25.518
HARLENE BOWN, Tourist: I have
got very mixed feelings over it,
obviously, sympathy for

11:25.518 --> 11:28.922
some of them, and obviously
concern over the others.

11:28.922 --> 11:32.692
MALCOLM BRABANT: What do you
think about the journeys they
have to make?

11:32.692 --> 11:37.163
HARLENE BOWN: Oh, that's
terrible. We sit from our
balcony and watch the lanyards
go

11:37.163 --> 11:42.502
in and out with them on. And
they're being pushed from pillar
to post. They must doubt

11:42.502 --> 11:47.440
where their future lies
in the end of all this.

11:47.440 --> 11:52.211
MALCOLM BRABANT: The regional
authorities drafted in extra
police to hunt down the
trafficking

11:52.211 --> 11:58.318
gang responsible for this latest
Mediterranean tragedy. And three
men were taken away.

11:58.318 --> 12:04.090
The going rate for the short
voyage to Europe is $1,000 a
head. So this one boatload could

12:04.090 --> 12:08.094
have earned the people smugglers
a quarter-of-a-million dollars.
Officials at the coast guard
headquarters

12:08.094 --> 12:11.864
suggested these men were
the prime suspects.

12:11.864 --> 12:17.236
Excuse me, sir. Are you the
smuggler? Are you the smuggler
responsible for these people's

12:17.236 --> 12:24.177
deaths? What's your
involvement in this?

12:24.177 --> 12:28.448
The Turkish authorities have
kept us quite some distance away
from the survivors, but

12:28.448 --> 12:33.019
we have been close enough to one
of the buses to hear the most
uncontrollable weeping coming

12:33.019 --> 12:37.323
from a couple of people who have
lost relatives during the
sinking.

12:37.323 --> 12:41.494
Now, these people haven't just
endured the most profound
personal tragedy. They have

12:41.494 --> 12:46.499
also probably lost money to the
traffickers who were promising
them a new life in Europe.

12:46.499 --> 12:51.037
And what's more, once the
Turkish authorities are finished
processing them, they're going

12:51.037 --> 12:56.109
to take them away from the
Mediterranean, hundreds of miles
away, to the southeastern

12:56.109 --> 13:01.514
part of Turkey, near to the
Syrian border to an overcrowded
refugee camp.

13:01.514 --> 13:05.151
And perhaps then they will try
to escape and come and go
through this whole experience

13:05.151 --> 13:11.658
one more time. Such tragedies
don't deter Abed al-Mughabel
(ph), a 21-year-old Syrian

13:11.658 --> 13:16.929
student who spent the past three
years in Lebanon. He's already
had one failed crossing

13:16.929 --> 13:21.367
after his boat was intercepted
by the Turkish coast guard, as
are many.

13:21.367 --> 13:25.438
But he's ready to try again,
with the intention of getting to
Sweden.

13:25.438 --> 13:32.178
MAN: I look at it as a
redemption, as a redemption, to
start a new life in these
countries, these

13:32.178 --> 13:36.616
free countries, these free
countries where they respect the
human rights, all the human

13:36.616 --> 13:39.018
rights. Yes.

13:39.018 --> 13:43.222
MALCOLM BRABANT: How many -- it
is worth the risk going on the
boat? I mean, how scared

13:43.222 --> 13:45.224
are you?

13:45.224 --> 13:50.463
MAN: I mean, I have already been
in the boat for the first time.
I failed. I'm now going

13:50.463 --> 13:57.370
back. It's not that hard,
because starve for the family is
hard, OK? When -- it's better

13:57.370 --> 14:05.311
than to stay in Lebanon and die
slowly in there, without study
and nothing to do in

14:05.311 --> 14:07.613
Lebanon. It's -- it's worth it
to go there. It's worth it.

14:07.613 --> 14:08.848
MALCOLM BRABANT: Have you got
something to give to Europe?

14:08.848 --> 14:10.450
(CROSSTALK)

14:10.450 --> 14:16.322
MAN: Yes, yes. If I study there,
I am willing to give the Europe
back what they gave me,

14:16.322 --> 14:20.093
to give them back what they gave
me. If they gave me shelter, I
give them back my whole

14:20.093 --> 14:23.730
energy to -- to build
their country.

14:23.730 --> 14:29.102
MALCOLM BRABANT: This is Basmane
in the city of Izmir, which is
the gateway the Europe.

14:29.102 --> 14:33.573
It's a magnet for Syrians and
scores of other nationalities.
We were taken to a smugglers

14:33.573 --> 14:38.978
cafe by the head of the regional
refugee support group, Cem
Terzi, a consultant surgeon.

14:38.978 --> 14:43.282
CEM TERZI, Surgeon: It's a
meeting point for smugglers and
the refugees all day, during

14:43.282 --> 14:50.890
the day or during the night.
They are all coming together
here and talking and reaching

14:50.890 --> 14:52.391
about a price.

14:52.391 --> 14:57.597
MALCOLM BRABANT: The regional
government estimates that there
are 70,000 asylum-seekers in the

14:57.597 --> 15:03.636
Izmir region, but professor
Terzi believes that the number
is really 400,000, half of

15:03.636 --> 15:09.041
whom want to come to Europe. The
figures dwarf those that Europe
is concentrating resettling.

15:09.041 --> 15:20.353
CEM TERZI: We are seeing, I
think, one of the most tragic
situations in history. At

15:20.353 --> 15:29.362
the moment, three million people
are in Turkey, and at least half
of them are trying to go

15:29.362 --> 15:36.969
to Europe and to survive, to
have better conditions, to get
refugee situation.

15:36.969 --> 15:41.941
MALCOLM BRABANT: The professor
and other medical volunteers
offer a rudimentary health care

15:41.941 --> 15:48.981
service for the thousands living
rough, where infection is rife
among the dirt and dust.

15:48.981 --> 15:53.753
Turkey doesn't grant these
people full refugee status, and
so, unless they have money, they

15:53.753 --> 15:59.125
are in serious trouble. As the
professor treated children with
bronchitis, we caught up with

15:59.125 --> 16:03.129
Abed. He had found a smuggler,
who told him to go to a secret
rendezvous for a boat to

16:03.129 --> 16:06.432
the Greek island of Samos.

16:06.432 --> 16:11.604
How does this feel in terms of
your life? How much of an
important day is today?

16:11.604 --> 16:16.809
MAN: It's -- it might be my best
day or might be my salvation
day.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.478
MALCOLM BRABANT: And
what do you think?

16:19.478 --> 16:22.281
MAN: What do I think of what?

16:22.281 --> 16:24.016
MALCOLM BRABANT: What
is it going to be?

16:24.016 --> 16:26.018
MAN: It's going to be,
hopefully, my salvation day.

16:26.018 --> 16:30.089
MALCOLM BRABANT: And what
does salvation mean to you?

16:30.089 --> 16:32.992
MAN: Salvation means start a new
life, find a new hope, not to
stay stuck here in Izmir

16:32.992 --> 16:38.331
in Turkey and going back to
Lebanon and live a miserable
life.

16:38.331 --> 16:44.003
MALCOLM BRABANT: In this corner
of Turkey, we have not been able
to discover where Abed

16:44.003 --> 16:48.975
made it. This is the prosperous
and exotic Mediterranean,
tantalizingly close to Europe,

16:48.975 --> 16:54.080
but, to refugees, it's an
illusion, for this is a deadly
sea.

16:54.080 --> 16:58.317
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant in Bodrum,
Turkey.

16:58.317 --> 17:03.489
GWEN IFILL: German Chancellor
Angela Merkel today called for
an emergency summit next

17:03.489 --> 17:09.495
Tuesday to deal with the refugee
and migrant crisis. The push
comes one day after European

17:09.495 --> 17:14.901
ministers failed to reach a deal
on resettlement quotas. Some of
Germany's leaders have said

17:14.901 --> 17:19.138
the nation could receive one
million people by the end of
this year.

17:19.138 --> 17:22.708
For more on how the country and
continent are dealing with the
surge, I'm joined by

17:22.708 --> 17:25.878
Germany's ambassador to the
United States Peter Wittig.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.880
Thank you for joining us.

17:27.880 --> 17:28.814
PETER WITTIG, German Ambassador
to the United States: It's a
pleasure to be here.

17:28.814 --> 17:33.753
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk about
this refugee summit that
Chancellor Merkel is calling
for.

17:33.753 --> 17:40.226
Given the resistance which any
idea, any common solution had
met in Brussels, is there a
possibility

17:40.226 --> 17:44.096
that there's some one
way to address this?

17:44.096 --> 17:49.502
PETER WITTIG: Well, we have to
understand this is a crisis of
historic proportions.

17:49.502 --> 17:58.044
Never, since the World War II,
have we seen that flow of
refugees pouring into Europe,

17:58.044 --> 18:05.584
so small wonder that Europe was
ill-prepared for this momentous
crisis. But I think all

18:05.584 --> 18:10.222
the countries have realized we
can only solve this together.
And it's a litmus test of
European

18:10.222 --> 18:13.359
solidarity.

18:13.359 --> 18:20.232
And that's why the chancellor
has called for an urgent summit,
to do basically two things,

18:20.232 --> 18:28.441
provide more help for the
front-line states, those states
where the refugees transit
through

18:28.441 --> 18:35.047
or enter the European Union,
help them manage the border,
help them to receive the
refugees

18:35.047 --> 18:41.854
in a dignified manner, and help
to fight human trafficking.

18:41.854 --> 18:48.461
And the second thing is, the
second challenge is to find a
fair and a fairer distribution

18:48.461 --> 18:54.500
of those refugees among us. In a
way, this is a litmus test for
European solidarity.

18:54.500 --> 18:59.605
GWEN IFILL: Well, let me pick up
on that, because, last week, we
had a European Union

18:59.605 --> 19:04.176
ambassador here sitting here
where you are. And his solution,
their solution was that

19:04.176 --> 19:08.647
there be mandatory quotas
imposed, that certain countries,
every country in the E.U. would

19:08.647 --> 19:10.583
have to take a certain
number of migrants.

19:10.583 --> 19:13.786
And that has not been -- that
has not gone over well. So, is
that dead?

19:13.786 --> 19:18.224
PETER WITTIG: It's not dead.
It's still on the table.

19:18.224 --> 19:23.729
And the homeland security
ministers, they discussed this,
and they reached an agreement

19:23.729 --> 19:30.603
that they would work together in
that direction. But some
countries have not embraced that

19:30.603 --> 19:35.574
idea because of their domestic
politics, because they think
they can't receive that many
refugees.

19:35.574 --> 19:39.812
It's not off the table,
but it's not all of it.

19:39.812 --> 19:47.720
I think it's a package. We have
got to support those countries
that are receiving the refugees.

19:47.720 --> 19:54.593
The first point of entry, like
Greece, like Italy, like
Hungary, we have got to enable

19:54.593 --> 20:03.569
them to receive and process, is
the word, the refugees in a more
dignified way. And

20:03.569 --> 20:11.911
then we have got to reform our
own asylum, Europe asylum
system, make it more coherent,

20:11.911 --> 20:17.850
and then again, yes, a fairer
distribution of the refugees
among the European member

20:17.850 --> 20:19.552
states.

20:19.552 --> 20:23.889
It cannot be that just two or
three are bearing the brunt of
the burden.

20:23.889 --> 20:28.327
GWEN IFILL: Well, among those
two or three was Germany.
Chancellor Merkel had her arms

20:28.327 --> 20:33.299
wide open, and now, however, is
talking about border controls.

20:33.299 --> 20:36.902
Is that a result of the domestic
resistance to this notion of
just throwing the doors

20:36.902 --> 20:38.804
open?

20:38.804 --> 20:48.047
PETER WITTIG: Well, the German
reaction to the refugee flow was
generally very welcoming.

20:48.047 --> 20:53.786
We saw an outpour, an
overwhelming outpour of
solidarity by thousands and
thousands of

20:53.786 --> 21:01.794
volunteers in Germany. And so
the reaction is still very
positive. But the sheer number

21:01.794 --> 21:09.401
and the speed of the refugees,
they are -- now start to stretch
the capabilities of our country,

21:09.401 --> 21:11.470
of the cities, of
the municipalities.

21:11.470 --> 21:15.007
GWEN IFILL: Is it also the kinds
of refugees we're talking about?
You served in Lebanon,

21:15.007 --> 21:15.941
if I'm not mistaken.

21:15.941 --> 21:18.244
PETER WITTIG: I did.

21:18.244 --> 21:22.214
GWEN IFILL: So you understand
that the people we're talking
about coming across these
borders

21:22.214 --> 21:25.918
are not homogeneous, the way
they are in so many other
countries.

21:25.918 --> 21:32.625
PETER WITTIG: Well, the first
concern is now to have a more
orderly process. And we have

21:32.625 --> 21:38.931
got to house the refugees
decently, give them food, school
them.

21:38.931 --> 21:48.073
And we have got to distinguish
between those who are really in
need of help, like the
asylum-seeker

21:48.073 --> 21:54.380
who are politically persecuted,
or the refugees from Syria. For
instance, they need our help.

21:54.380 --> 21:57.349
GWEN IFILL: How do you do that?
How do you make that
distinction, and then the extra

21:57.349 --> 22:00.886
distinction between those who
are innocent and those who are
dangerous?

22:00.886 --> 22:06.959
PETER WITTIG: Well, they have to
go through a process of
registration, and eventually

22:06.959 --> 22:11.564
seeking asylum, getting asylum,
or getting the status of a
refugee.

22:11.564 --> 22:18.470
And then we can help them and
welcome them for a longer time.
And there are others who

22:18.470 --> 22:25.311
come for different reasons that
we might not be able to take in
for good. So, there are

22:25.311 --> 22:31.417
security concerns also. We have
to know who is coming into our
countries.

22:31.417 --> 22:38.724
So now we are at a point -- and
that's the backdrop of that
reintroduction of border

22:38.724 --> 22:46.665
controls. We're not closing the
border, nor are we putting into
question the system of

22:46.665 --> 22:52.638
free movement within Europe. But
that's an emergency measure, in
order to have a more

22:52.638 --> 22:57.843
orderly process of entry
into our country.

22:57.843 --> 23:02.147
GWEN IFILL: Is it different for
Germany, a country which is
perhaps more welcoming to

23:02.147 --> 23:06.452
immigrants because you have an
aging population and you could
actually stand to have some

23:06.452 --> 23:09.021
-- a greater influx
of new citizens?

23:09.021 --> 23:12.057
PETER WITTIG: I think
it's a couple of reasons.

23:12.057 --> 23:21.433
First of all, we have an
historic legacy. We know the
tremendous value of asylum,
countries

23:21.433 --> 23:26.472
granting exile. We have our own
-- we had in our history the
Nazi dictatorship that

23:26.472 --> 23:32.044
produced refugees, so we have
a very liberal asylum law.

23:32.044 --> 23:40.452
I think we saw this compassion
in the German population which
was really heartwarming for

23:40.452 --> 23:45.924
the victims of the civil war in
Syria. That's something -- I
served there, and, you know,

23:45.924 --> 23:51.897
people are fleeing hell, fleeing
the barrel bombs of Assad and
the murderous swathes of

23:51.897 --> 23:54.266
ISIL.

23:54.266 --> 23:58.537
So I think that is what people
felt. They need to -- they
wanted to comply with
humanitarian

23:58.537 --> 24:00.706
norms.

24:00.706 --> 24:06.679
GWEN IFILL: You talked about the
war in Syria and what's driving
people out. How much
responsibility

24:06.679 --> 24:10.449
does the European Union,
Germany, the United States have
to address or do something about

24:10.449 --> 24:13.152
the root causes of what's
causing these people to flee?

24:13.152 --> 24:17.056
PETER WITTIG: The root causes,
we have got to tackle.

24:17.056 --> 24:27.333
And I think this refugee crisis
now should be a catalyst, if you
will, a new incentive

24:27.333 --> 24:35.541
to once again try politically to
cope with this cruel, horrendous
civil war in Syria.

24:35.541 --> 24:42.614
And I think a good occasion
would be the next meeting of the
U.N. General Assembly in two

24:42.614 --> 24:47.619
weeks' time, where hopefully
leaders will sit together and
address that political challenge

24:47.619 --> 24:56.395
to come to a political solution
in Syria that includes not only
the main segments of the

24:56.395 --> 24:59.732
Syrian population, but also the
main powers of the region,
including Saudi Arabia and

24:59.732 --> 25:02.067
Iran and others.

25:02.067 --> 25:04.269
GWEN IFILL: Well, that certainly
will be at the top of someone's
agenda. We will see how

25:04.269 --> 25:07.373
it plays out in New York.

25:07.373 --> 25:14.980
Peter Wittig, U.S. -- German
ambassador to the United States,
thank you very much.

25:14.980 --> 25:22.154
PETER WITTIG: Thank you, Gwen.

25:22.154 --> 25:27.426
GWEN IFILL: Tomorrow night, the
Republican candidates for
president will gather once

25:27.426 --> 25:33.799
again on a debate stage, this
time in California at the Ronald
Reagan Library.

25:33.799 --> 25:38.704
The prime-time gathering will
feature at least one new face,
Carly Fiorina, whose very
presence

25:38.704 --> 25:44.410
will highlight one key challenge
for Republicans: the need to
appeal to women voters.

25:44.410 --> 25:49.014
Political director Lisa
Desjardins has a preview tonight
from Simi Valley.

25:49.014 --> 25:53.152
LISA DESJARDINS: This townhouse
in Texas holds both the
challenge and the hope for
Republican

25:53.152 --> 25:56.054
women.

25:56.054 --> 26:02.261
Missy Shorey is setting up her
new home office in Dallas. From
this desk, she directs a
national

26:02.261 --> 26:07.566
organization called Maggie's
List, named after Maine
Republican Margaret Chase Smith,
the

26:07.566 --> 26:13.205
first woman to serve in both the
U.S. House and Senate. The prime
goal of Maggie's List?

26:13.205 --> 26:18.877
Find, recruit and elect more
Republican women to office. A
secondary goal is to ramp up

26:18.877 --> 26:21.880
Republican appeal to
women in general.

26:21.880 --> 26:26.552
MISSY SHOREY, Maggie's List:
Women are not just a factor in
elections. They are the factor

26:26.552 --> 26:31.290
in this election. And it's time
that people have finally done
the math and seen that,

26:31.290 --> 26:37.362
indeed, we represent 53 percent
of the vote. And the sad reality
is, is that, as Republicans

26:37.362 --> 26:41.600
and conservatives, we haven't
always done the best job at
reaching out.

26:41.600 --> 26:46.138
LISA DESJARDINS: The last time a
majority of American women voted
for a Republican presidential

26:46.138 --> 26:51.643
candidate was 1988. George H.W.
Bush edged out Michael Dukakis
with women in exit polls

26:51.643 --> 26:53.879
that year.

26:53.879 --> 26:57.883
But, since then, women have gone
the other way, choosing
Democrats. It is an advantage

26:57.883 --> 27:00.319
Hillary Clinton and her
supporters are pressing.

27:00.319 --> 27:04.323
WOMAN: We are all here to
kick off Women for Hillary.

27:04.323 --> 27:09.928
LISA DESJARDINS: But a new poll
shows Hillary doesn't have a
lock on women's votes. Just

27:09.928 --> 27:14.533
42 percent of Democratic-leaning
women say they support her, a
sharp drop from 71 percent

27:14.533 --> 27:16.435
in July.

27:16.435 --> 27:18.637
CARLY FIORINA (R), Presidential
Candidate: Thank you so very
much.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.906
LISA DESJARDINS:
Enter Carly Fiorina.

27:20.906 --> 27:24.076
CARLY FIORINA: If you're ready
for a woman president, how about
one who is honest and

27:24.076 --> 27:28.080
competent and can do the job?

27:28.080 --> 27:32.784
LISA DESJARDINS: Fiorina has
pushed back at Clinton, and
pushed out a conservative
definition

27:32.784 --> 27:37.456
of feminism about
jobs and security.

27:37.456 --> 27:41.226
And that brings us here, to
tomorrow's presidential debate,
where, of course, Fiorina will
be

27:41.226 --> 27:46.131
the only woman on the debate
stage. That is a concern for
some Republicans. But how do

27:46.131 --> 27:49.868
they get more women to run for
president? Some say they need to
encourage more women

27:49.868 --> 27:56.508
to run for other offices, local,
state, and Congress. But that is
also a problem for Republicans.

27:56.508 --> 28:00.679
You could see it in Congress
last week. House Republicans
leaving their weekly meeting
were

28:00.679 --> 28:07.619
a line of men. Of 247
Republicans, just 23 are women.

28:07.619 --> 28:10.789
Members like Utah's Jason
Chaffetz openly acknowledge it.

28:10.789 --> 28:13.392
REP. JASON CHAFFETZ (R), Utah:
Well, we need as many female
candidates on the ballot as

28:13.392 --> 28:16.061
we possibly can.

28:16.061 --> 28:19.331
LISA DESJARDINS: We asked
Tennessee Congresswoman Diane
Black, who co-founded a women's
policy

28:19.331 --> 28:20.465
group.

28:20.465 --> 28:23.168
How do Republicans get
more women in Congress?

28:23.168 --> 28:26.171
REP. DIANE BLACK (R), Tennessee:
Well, we, of course, have been
working on that for the

28:26.171 --> 28:30.275
last several years. The
difficulty right now is the
there aren't a whole lot of
opportunities

28:30.275 --> 28:35.814
out there for us, because we
have got a lot of seats that are
already -- 247 seats, so

28:35.814 --> 28:37.015
it's -- it's difficult.

28:37.015 --> 28:39.651
LISA DESJARDINS: And already
filled by men, yes.

28:39.651 --> 28:44.189
REP. DIANE BLACK: Well, if men
then decide to retire -- we, of
course, aren't going to

28:44.189 --> 28:47.225
primary our own guys. But if men
do decide to retire, we are
recruiting women for those

28:47.225 --> 28:49.094
positions.

28:49.094 --> 28:51.496
JENNIFER LAWLESS, Women &
Politics Institute, American
University: Democrats are way
ahead.

28:51.496 --> 28:54.666
About between 60 and 70 percent
of the women who serve at the
state legislative and
congressional

28:54.666 --> 28:57.369
levels are Democrats.

28:57.369 --> 29:02.741
LISA DESJARDINS: Jennifer
Lawless runs the Women &
Politics Institute At American
University.

29:02.741 --> 29:07.045
She also is a Democrat who
advises women in her party on
how to run for office.

29:07.045 --> 29:09.781
JENNIFER LAWLESS: Hi. This is
Jennifer Lawless returning your
call.

29:09.781 --> 29:14.386
LISA DESJARDINS: It may surprise
some, but she says reproductive
issues, Planned Parenthood

29:14.386 --> 29:20.258
and abortion, divide women
almost evenly and do not
advantage either party
nationally.

29:20.258 --> 29:24.029
What does matter? She says
economic fairness and diversity.

29:24.029 --> 29:28.066
JENNIFER LAWLESS: We're talking
about the economy and national
security and a general

29:28.066 --> 29:32.270
sense of what's the best
direction to move the country
forward. And women are generally

29:32.270 --> 29:37.442
more likely to believe the
Democratic Party and the
Democratic Party's candidates
are

29:37.442 --> 29:43.048
diverse and understand a diverse
group of people's preferences
and backgrounds and
circumstances.

29:43.048 --> 29:49.988
LISA DESJARDINS: In Dallas,
Missy Shorey is pushing back
against Democrats, arguing that

29:49.988 --> 29:55.160
jobs, the economy and taxes are
where conservatives can win with
women.

29:55.160 --> 30:00.065
MISSY SHOREY: These are women's
issues. They're called
pocketbook issues. The reality
is that,

30:00.065 --> 30:05.103
right now, 40 percent of all
households in the United States,
the primary breadwinner

30:05.103 --> 30:09.307
is a woman. And no one is
talking about this and no one is
respecting the fact that
government

30:09.307 --> 30:12.077
keeps on grabbing
for our purses.

30:12.077 --> 30:17.182
LISA DESJARDINS: Groups like
hers are starting to change the
face of the Republican Party.

30:17.182 --> 30:22.087
Maggie's List helped launch
Nebraska Senator Deb Fischer and
a few dozen others. The group

30:22.087 --> 30:27.693
has 7,000 members. But that's a
fraction of the Democratic
equivalent, EMILY'S List, and

30:27.693 --> 30:32.164
its two million members.
Shorey is undaunted.

30:32.164 --> 30:37.335
MISSY SHOREY: We are positive,
because when we're taking a
stand and raising the issues,

30:37.335 --> 30:41.239
we're getting tremendous
support. There's a de facto myth
out there that, somehow, because

30:41.239 --> 30:44.209
you're a woman, that you're
automatically a liberal.

30:44.209 --> 30:47.579
LISA DESJARDINS: As the
candidates battle for the
nomination tomorrow night, their
party

30:47.579 --> 30:52.050
hopes the debate helps win
the fight for female voters.

30:52.050 --> 30:59.958
For the "PBS NewsHour," Lisa
Desjardins, Simi Valley,
California.

30:59.958 --> 31:08.033
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

31:08.033 --> 31:11.903
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Egypt responds to the killing of
tourists; and teaching girls

31:11.903 --> 31:15.373
how to make video games.

31:15.373 --> 31:21.346
But, first, a five-day teachers
strike that delayed the start of
the school year in Seattle

31:21.346 --> 31:25.751
is nearing an end. The strike
itself was a surprise, and left
nearly -- and left parents

31:25.751 --> 31:31.456
of nearly 50,000 students
figuring out just what to do for
days.

31:31.456 --> 31:36.995
Special correspondent Cat Wise
was in Seattle when the
agreement was announced earlier
today.

31:36.995 --> 31:42.634
CAT WISE: Seattle teachers
Kristin and Joe Bailey Fogarty
were getting ready for a fifth

31:42.634 --> 31:45.804
day on the picket line and
another day out of school for
them and their daughters when

31:45.804 --> 31:48.173
they got the news.

31:48.173 --> 31:50.142
JOE BAILEY FOGARTY, Teacher: SEA
reached a tentative contract
agreement with the Seattle

31:50.142 --> 31:51.176
School Board.

31:51.176 --> 31:53.311
KRISTIN BAILEY-FOGARTY,
Teacher: No way.

31:53.311 --> 31:57.649
CAT WISE: The news of a deal was
a surprise to Kristin and many
of her colleagues in the

31:57.649 --> 32:01.987
union, but a welcome one that
came after an all-night
negotiating session.

32:01.987 --> 32:08.393
KRISTIN BAILEY-FOGARTY: We hated
it. We hated being on strike. We
hate it. It's been 30

32:08.393 --> 32:10.729
years since Seattle struck,
because it is so awful.

32:10.729 --> 32:15.300
MAN: Thank you for your
support. Thank you.

32:15.300 --> 32:20.138
CAT WISE: Teachers across the
city began celebrating the
likely end to Seattle's first
teachers

32:20.138 --> 32:23.942
strike in more than 30 years,
even though details of the
agreement were still under

32:23.942 --> 32:28.380
wraps this afternoon. District
officials praised the outcome.

32:28.380 --> 32:32.217
GEOFF MILLER, Chief Negotiator:
In the end, we found common
ground, wanting to make sure

32:32.217 --> 32:37.322
that our children get the best
education that they can. We
intend moving forward to work

32:37.322 --> 32:41.660
as closely as we can with the
union to realize the goals that
we have for making the Seattle

32:41.660 --> 32:45.463
schools the best place for
kids to go to school.

32:45.463 --> 32:50.802
CAT WISE: The Seattle Education
Association -- that's the union
representing the district's

32:50.802 --> 32:55.874
5,000 teachers and school staff
-- had been in negotiations with
the school district over

32:55.874 --> 33:01.279
a new contract since May. But
just as the school year was set
to begin last Tuesday,

33:01.279 --> 33:05.116
talks over pay raises
and more broke down.

33:05.116 --> 33:09.588
Issues including testing, longer
instructional time, discipline
policies and even the length

33:09.588 --> 33:14.893
of recess were on the table. But
in a city where the cost of
living is soaring, for many

33:14.893 --> 33:18.830
teachers like Bailey-Fogarty,
pay was a top concern.

33:18.830 --> 33:22.033
KRISTIN BAILEY-FOGARTY: The
teacher in the newspaper who had
the nanny and is married

33:22.033 --> 33:26.471
to somebody in the tech
industry, that's the exception.
A lot of teachers are single
parents.

33:26.471 --> 33:30.475
A lot of teachers are coming out
of school with huge student
loans, because you need

33:30.475 --> 33:33.912
a lot of education
to be a teacher.

33:33.912 --> 33:38.984
CAT WISE: Before a deal was
announced, teachers union
president Jonathan Knapp told us
that

33:38.984 --> 33:43.755
wages were a key sticking point,
but he said teachers fought for
bigger issues important

33:43.755 --> 33:47.926
to parents across Seattle and
the country, like a program to
reduce suspensions of minority

33:47.926 --> 33:49.494
students.

33:49.494 --> 33:52.063
JONATHAN KNAPP, President,
Seattle Education Association:
The disproportionate discipline

33:52.063 --> 33:57.435
of certain groups of students
really matter to the parents.
You know, the testing issue

33:57.435 --> 34:01.840
has become very important to
parents these days. So, I think
all of those resonate with

34:01.840 --> 34:04.943
parents, and I think they would
resonate all over the country.

34:04.943 --> 34:09.381
CAT WISE: The weeklong strike
sent parents scrambling to find
child care when schools

34:09.381 --> 34:12.918
didn't open. The school
organized some temporary day
camps at community centers
across the

34:12.918 --> 34:15.620
city.

34:15.620 --> 34:20.792
This afternoon, representatives
from each school were expected
to vote to end the strike.

34:20.792 --> 34:24.930
And classes are likely to resume
on Thursday. Over the weekend,
the entire union will vote

34:24.930 --> 34:27.432
on whether to accept the deal.

34:27.432 --> 34:34.506
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Cat Wise in Seattle.

34:34.506 --> 34:46.217
GWEN IFILL: The U.S. sends
hundreds of billions of dollars
worth of military aid to allies

34:46.217 --> 34:51.957
around the world. On Sunday, the
army of one of those allies,
Egypt, killed 12 tourists.

34:51.957 --> 34:55.093
Most of the dead were
Mexican citizens.

34:55.093 --> 35:00.465
They were in Egypt's Western
Desert. It's an area famous for
its rock formations and

35:00.465 --> 35:05.804
oases. It's also increasingly a
base for insurgents launching
attacks against the army.

35:05.804 --> 35:08.306
Jeffrey Brown has more.

35:08.306 --> 35:12.043
JEFFREY BROWN: The Egyptian
government says that an Apache
helicopter crew mistook the

35:12.043 --> 35:17.215
tourists for a group of Islamic
militants. An investigation is
ongoing.

35:17.215 --> 35:21.619
Egypt is one of the largest
recipients of U.S. military aid
in the world, receiving

35:21.619 --> 35:26.825
$1.3 billion annually. And even
before Sunday's incident,
there's been friction between
Washington

35:26.825 --> 35:31.830
and Cairo over how the Egyptian
military uses American hardware.

35:31.830 --> 35:35.266
I'm joined now by Michele Dunne,
senior associate at the Carnegie
Endowment for International

35:35.266 --> 35:36.167
Peace.

35:36.167 --> 35:38.203
Welcome back to you.

35:38.203 --> 35:37.202
MICHELE DUNNE, Director,
Atlantic Council's Rafik Hariri
Center for the Middle East:
Thank

35:37.202 --> 35:38.570
you.

35:38.570 --> 35:41.773
JEFFREY BROWN: First, what more
do we know about this incident
on Sunday?

35:41.773 --> 35:46.311
MICHELE DUNNE: Well, what we
know is, there was a group of
tourists -- they had an Egyptian

35:46.311 --> 35:52.250
police escort and apparently had
the proper permits -- that were
touring this -- near

35:52.250 --> 35:57.789
an oasis in the Western Desert,
and that the convoy was
attacked, obviously by mistake,

35:57.789 --> 36:00.992
by an Egyptian
military helicopter.

36:00.992 --> 36:05.697
Twelve people were killed. Seven
of those seemed to have been
Mexican tourists. There

36:05.697 --> 36:11.236
were others who were injured,
including one person who is a
dual Mexican-U.S. citizen.

36:11.236 --> 36:16.474
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, the
helicopter and these other
weapons are part of military aid
from

36:16.474 --> 36:21.446
the U.S. to Egypt, right? This
aid had been put on hold for a
while during all the turmoil

36:21.446 --> 36:24.482
in Egypt. Is it back
up to where it was?

36:24.482 --> 36:30.188
MICHELE DUNNE: Yes. The United
States resumed all military aid
to Egypt earlier this year,

36:30.188 --> 36:35.293
after having suspended after
the military coup in 2013.

36:35.293 --> 36:42.033
Now, Egypt is fighting a serious
insurgency. So the, United
States didn't want to abandon

36:42.033 --> 36:47.138
a longtime ally. The United
States has a very deep
investment in Egypt and
particularly

36:47.138 --> 36:52.110
the military, to which it has
given more than $35 billion of
assistance.

36:52.110 --> 36:55.780
JEFFREY BROWN: The larger
context here is this attempt by
President Al-Sisi to crush

36:55.780 --> 36:58.450
this insurgency. How is
-- where does that stand?

36:58.450 --> 37:02.053
MICHELE DUNNE: Well,
it's not going well.

37:02.053 --> 37:06.224
There was a military coup in
Egypt a couple of years ago that
suspended an attempt at

37:06.224 --> 37:11.896
a democratic transition. And
since then, terrorists, who
already existed in Egypt, have
really

37:11.896 --> 37:17.268
escalated an insurgency. It
started out in the Sinai, and
that's still the main base

37:17.268 --> 37:21.806
of it, but it has been spreading
to other parts of the country,
notably the Western

37:21.806 --> 37:27.745
Desert, the areas near Libya,
which is where this incident
that just took place happened.

37:27.745 --> 37:33.384
And it happened in the context
of an Egyptian army fight with
some militants in that area.

37:33.384 --> 37:36.121
JEFFREY BROWN: This incident got
a lot of attention, but it's
just one of many, I gather.

37:36.121 --> 37:38.289
There's a lot going on in the
Sinai, for example, right?

37:38.289 --> 37:40.091
MICHELE DUNNE: Absolutely.

37:40.091 --> 37:46.197
There have been very significant
insurgent operations against the
Egyptian military in

37:46.197 --> 37:52.971
the Sinai. And, frankly, the
Egyptian military's operations
just -- just aren't working.
They

37:52.971 --> 37:58.676
don't have a holistic strategy
against the insurgency. They
just seem to have sort of

37:58.676 --> 38:03.982
ad hoc operations, and there are
reports of very large human
rights violations, collective

38:03.982 --> 38:07.118
punishment and so
forth, going on.

38:07.118 --> 38:11.823
So, at the same time that the
Egyptian military is fighting
the insurgency, in a way, it's

38:11.823 --> 38:16.661
also fueling it by carrying out
these abuses that seem to be
channeling more and more people

38:16.661 --> 38:19.931
toward the militant groups.

38:19.931 --> 38:23.535
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, and then to
circle back where we started,
the tension here is because,

38:23.535 --> 38:28.673
in this country, and part is
because of the use of American
hardware. Now, does the U.S.

38:28.673 --> 38:32.810
have it -- sell these with
strings attached? Or does it
have any sway or influence in
how

38:32.810 --> 38:36.381
these -- how all this
military hardware is used?

38:36.381 --> 38:40.919
MICHELE DUNNE: The U.S.
administration is trying to
exert a bit more influence, both

38:40.919 --> 38:46.357
about over what Egypt buys with
its military aid from the U.S.
government and also how

38:46.357 --> 38:49.394
it is used.

38:49.394 --> 38:54.832
But the Egyptian military in
general has not wanted a lot of
advice or training. In general,

38:54.832 --> 39:01.039
it wants a lot of hardware and
very minimal training. But the
United States recently -- for

39:01.039 --> 39:06.110
example, Secretary of State
Kerry was just in Egypt in early
August for a strategic dialogue.

39:06.110 --> 39:11.950
And he was pressing the issue,
including in his public remarks,
about the possible connections

39:11.950 --> 39:18.456
between human rights abuses and
radicalization in the country
and the need for more effective

39:18.456 --> 39:23.094
counterterrorism methods, as
well as a better political and
economic atmosphere and rights

39:23.094 --> 39:24.996
atmosphere in the country.

39:24.996 --> 39:26.731
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, I
think we will leave it there.

39:26.731 --> 39:29.734
And one correction before we go.
I think we said seven Mexican
citizens -- tourists were

39:29.734 --> 39:31.970
killed. I think the number
is up to eight now.

39:31.970 --> 39:34.138
So, Michele Dunne,
thank you so much.

39:34.138 --> 39:41.746
MICHELE DUNNE: Thank you, Jeff.

39:41.746 --> 39:48.820
GWEN IFILL: Now: giving girls
access to a more level playing
field in an area formerly

39:48.820 --> 39:52.824
dominated by boys,
making video games.

39:52.824 --> 39:56.394
Special correspondent Sandra
Hughes has the story.

39:56.394 --> 40:02.634
SANDRA HUGHES: It's no secret
that video gaming is aimed at a
male audience. From creation

40:02.634 --> 40:06.638
to design to playing the games,
the mostly violent first-person
shooter games target

40:06.638 --> 40:10.408
boys, not girls.

40:10.408 --> 40:16.981
No wonder. In 2013, women
accounted for just 11 percent of
computer game designers and

40:16.981 --> 40:21.619
only 3 percent of programmers.
Ten-year old Scarlett Thompson
isn't too young to understand

40:21.619 --> 40:23.187
there's a gender gap.

40:23.187 --> 40:24.422
SCARLETT THOMPSON, Participant,
Alexa Cafe: I love video games.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.124
SANDRA HUGHES: Do you really?

40:26.124 --> 40:27.225
SCARLETT THOMPSON: Yes. So,
I mean, there's really...

40:27.225 --> 40:28.893
(CROSSTALK)

40:28.893 --> 40:31.429
SANDRA HUGHES: So, what's it
like -- what's it like for a
girl who likes video games?

40:31.429 --> 40:34.432
Is it a tough world to be in?

40:34.432 --> 40:39.871
SCARLETT THOMPSON: Kind of,
because then, like, you have to
compete with people, and

40:39.871 --> 40:46.477
it's just -- sometimes it's
really hard, like, online. It's
not as fair and, like, I --
like,

40:46.477 --> 40:51.115
oh, no I have a girl on my
team. What am I going to do?

40:51.115 --> 40:58.356
SANDRA HUGHES: These girls want
to be more than just on the
team. They want to create

40:58.356 --> 41:01.959
the game. They spent their
summer break, along with
thousands of others, at
girls-only computer

41:01.959 --> 41:07.298
coding camps like the Alexa
Cafe and Code Like a Girl.

41:07.298 --> 41:11.369
These camps aim to balance the
gender gap in the next
generation of coders by
supporting

41:11.369 --> 41:15.039
an early interest in
technology from girls.

41:15.039 --> 41:17.742
CLAUDIA ORTIZ, Instructor, Code
Like a Girl: We're trying to
create that environment, say,

41:17.742 --> 41:20.845
hey, you could be the world's
best coder. It doesn't have to
be your brother or it doesn't

41:20.845 --> 41:22.547
have to be, like, a
male. It can be you.

41:22.547 --> 41:26.017
TE STEVENS, Participant, Code
Like a Girl: It's called Code
Like a Girl because we want

41:26.017 --> 41:31.723
to be treated equal, but that
doesn't mean that I totally say,
oh, boys stink, because

41:31.723 --> 41:34.759
that would be kind of not really
-- that would kind of
hypocritical, I guess.

41:34.759 --> 41:39.063
OLIVIA FISHMAN, Participant,
Code Like a Girl: It's awesome
because we all are here to learn

41:39.063 --> 41:44.369
more. We all have great
intellectual minds. And we're
all very curious. And we all
have

41:44.369 --> 41:47.872
great ideas. And we all -- we
feed off of each other with our
great ideas.

41:47.872 --> 41:52.243
SANDRA HUGHES: These young
coders say that learning in an
all-girl environment has allowed

41:52.243 --> 41:56.581
them to focus more on
cooperation and less on the
competition they feel in school
when

41:56.581 --> 41:58.750
working with boys.

41:58.750 --> 42:01.652
KENDALL MCDERMOTT, Participant,
Code Like a Girl: At school,
there's always been a little

42:01.652 --> 42:05.590
bit of an issue when we do
robotics unit. They think they
are the only ones capable

42:05.590 --> 42:10.528
of coding and doing the work.
So, often, it becomes a lot
harder to do any of the work,

42:10.528 --> 42:14.499
or when you bounce an idea off
someone, they're more like, no,
my idea is right.

42:14.499 --> 42:19.003
But, here, it's a lot of, you to
ask someone for an idea and they
are very, oh, here, let

42:19.003 --> 42:22.840
me help you. And it's a lot less
of, no, you are wrong. And so
it's just really nice to

42:22.840 --> 42:25.076
be in a really
collaborative environment.

42:25.076 --> 42:30.415
SANDRA HUGHES: Eleven-year old
Kendall McDermott hasn't found
boys collaborative or even
friendly

42:30.415 --> 42:37.588
when she plays online video
games. To avoid harassment, she
plays online as a he.

42:37.588 --> 42:41.125
KENDALL MCDERMOTT: So, usually,
I avoid mentioning gender, which
makes it a lot more enjoyable.

42:41.125 --> 42:45.430
But it's kind of sad to think
that if you, say -- if you check
the -- because when they

42:45.430 --> 42:49.233
say, are you male or female, if
you check female, sometimes, you
get a lot of hackers

42:49.233 --> 42:52.770
and spammers and people saying
rude things, even though they
know nothing about you and

42:52.770 --> 42:55.072
don't have a photo
of you or anything.

42:55.072 --> 42:59.610
SANDRA HUGHES: The camp
instructors see differences in
how girls and boys create their
games.

42:59.610 --> 43:02.847
TE STEVENS: She's Supergirl,
right, so she has to save
somebody.

43:02.847 --> 43:08.119
SANDRA HUGHES: Girls games focus
more on a narrative than
competition.

43:08.119 --> 43:11.522
Is there a difference between
sort of the boys and the girls
do online and in camps?

43:11.522 --> 43:15.726
SCARLETT THOMPSON: I don't think
there's a difference. But I
think that girls will make

43:15.726 --> 43:21.098
it more friendly and more, like,
visual and happy, instead of,
like, just gun games and

43:21.098 --> 43:24.602
dark and gloomy and scary.

43:24.602 --> 43:29.941
SANDRA HUGHES: At Alexa Cafe,
the girls design games aimed at
having a positive social impact,

43:29.941 --> 43:33.177
like Scarlett's plan
to save sea turtles.

43:33.177 --> 43:38.149
SCARLETT THOMPSON: I made a
game, and it was, you clean up
all the trash before the turtles

43:38.149 --> 43:42.987
get them, and you have like
three seconds to do it. It's
actually pretty hard.

43:42.987 --> 43:48.659
SANDRA HUGHES: Why do you think,
Scarlett, it's important for
girls to get to understand

43:48.659 --> 43:53.297
technology and get involved with
coding and gaming and all of
this? Why do girls need

43:53.297 --> 43:55.199
to get involved more?

43:55.199 --> 44:00.638
SCARLETT THOMPSON: When girls
start to run, like, these video
games, then it will just

44:00.638 --> 44:04.976
help a lot, because then girls
will allow girls to come on that
video game.

44:04.976 --> 44:05.676
SANDRA HUGHES: And get more
and more girls, right?

44:05.676 --> 44:06.611
SCARLETT THOMPSON: Yes.

44:06.611 --> 44:07.378
SANDRA HUGHES: And then it'll
be fair and it'll be even.

44:07.378 --> 44:08.446
SCARLETT THOMPSON: Yes.

44:08.446 --> 44:09.747
SANDRA HUGHES: Right now,
it's not so fair and even?

44:09.747 --> 44:11.215
SCARLETT THOMPSON: Mm-mmm.

44:11.215 --> 44:15.286
KENDALL MCDERMOTT: If you only
have one type of person thinking
about something, and they

44:15.286 --> 44:18.890
can't find a solution to a
problem, that might be because
the way they are coming -- they

44:18.890 --> 44:24.462
are coming to it. I think,
sometimes, girls might have a
different interpretation of the

44:24.462 --> 44:27.265
problem, and that way, it means
they might come up with a
different solution.

44:27.265 --> 44:31.802
SANDRA HUGHES: A solution that
includes both boys and girls
coding together and creating

44:31.802 --> 44:34.672
games they both will enjoy.

44:34.672 --> 44:41.045
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Sandra Hughes in Los Angeles.

44:41.045 --> 44:55.326
GWEN IFILL: Infant mortality,
life expectancy, heart disease,
obesity, in almost every area

44:55.326 --> 44:59.163
of health outcomes, black
people are more vulnerable.

44:59.163 --> 45:02.833
In the latest addition to the
"NewsHour" Bookshelf, one
African-American doctor talks
about what

45:02.833 --> 45:04.936
that looks like from the inside.

45:04.936 --> 45:06.771
Jeff is back with that.

45:06.771 --> 45:10.908
JEFFREY BROWN: Being black
can be bad for your health.

45:10.908 --> 45:15.913
It's a lesson Damon Tweedy
writes in his new book, "Black
Man in a White Coat: A Doctor's

45:15.913 --> 45:20.284
Reflections on Race and
Medicine," that he learned time
and again in his own life and

45:20.284 --> 45:23.821
in his many years as a doctor.
Tweedy is a psychiatrist at Duke
University, where he

45:23.821 --> 45:25.756
also attended medical school.

45:25.756 --> 45:27.291
And welcome to you.

45:27.291 --> 45:26.924
DR. DAMON TWEEDY, Author, "Black
Man in a White Coat: A Doctor's
Reflections on Race

45:26.924 --> 45:28.326
and Medicine" Thank you.

45:28.326 --> 45:31.195
JEFFREY BROWN: So, you start
with this big subject. Is that
what started it for you,

45:31.195 --> 45:32.029
that you wanted to write about?

45:32.029 --> 45:34.599
DR. DAMON TWEEDY: Yes.

45:34.599 --> 45:38.736
So, race is this really highly
charged political subject that
we have in our society,
obviously,

45:38.736 --> 45:40.338
but, for me, this is a very
personal story. This is really
kind of about my experience

45:40.338 --> 45:42.873
and my journey.

45:42.873 --> 45:47.111
All too often in medical school,
you learn about health problems
in the black community,

45:47.111 --> 45:51.215
you learn -- you hear this
disease is more common than
this. It's always more common

45:51.215 --> 45:53.317
in black people, but you didn't
really hear why. And so it
wasn't -- and the question

45:53.317 --> 45:55.486
of why is a huge issue for me.

45:55.486 --> 45:59.357
And there was also a big
question about how my experience
as a young black man was
different

45:59.357 --> 46:02.093
than the experiences of
other people in my class.

46:02.093 --> 46:07.298
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, that comes
through, because you're also
saying that, as a young doctor

46:07.298 --> 46:12.403
in training, you're saying
constantly hearing about the
medical frailties of black
people

46:12.403 --> 46:15.773
picked at the scab of your
insecurity. You didn't set out
thinking about medicine and

46:15.773 --> 46:16.874
race.

46:16.874 --> 46:19.410
DR. DAMON TWEEDY: No, I was
actually attracted to medicine.

46:19.410 --> 46:25.149
It was sort of like this -- it
was almost like a post-racial
kind of mind-set I had.

46:25.149 --> 46:29.353
Medicine to me held it appeal to
being objective, formulas,
equations. And it was really --
and

46:29.353 --> 46:32.657
that was appealing. So much of
society is messy, and life is
messy as a black person.

46:32.657 --> 46:35.226
So this -- it was this appeal
that it could be objective.

46:35.226 --> 46:38.195
And then, when I got to medical
school, I kind of got a rude
awakening that it wasn't.

46:38.195 --> 46:41.565
JEFFREY BROWN: When you refer to
your insecurities, what do you
mean?

46:41.565 --> 46:46.537
DR. DAMON TWEEDY: I come from
Prince George's County,
Maryland. And it was an
all-black

46:46.537 --> 46:49.907
neighborhood that I grew up in,
just outside of Washington, D.C.

46:49.907 --> 46:55.346
And I went to a state college.
Then I got to Duke. Duke is a
fancy private school. A

46:55.346 --> 46:56.981
lot of my classmates had parents
who were doctors. And so I was
really insecure about

46:56.981 --> 46:58.683
that.

46:58.683 --> 47:02.353
And as a black person, there is
always a sort of thing about, is
affirmative action part

47:02.353 --> 47:04.889
of why you're here, and do you
really belong? And so I
grappling with all those things
when

47:04.889 --> 47:07.358
I first got to medical school.

47:07.358 --> 47:10.895
JEFFREY BROWN: You write about a
number of incidents that you
witnessed in which you

47:10.895 --> 47:16.167
saw white doctors unaware of the
different ways that they were
treating black patients.

47:16.167 --> 47:19.503
How much in the end did you
conclude that race does a play
factor in the doctor's room,

47:19.503 --> 47:21.505
in the hospital room?

47:21.505 --> 47:23.774
DR. DAMON TWEEDY: I think it
plays a big factor, and often in
ways that the doctor and the

47:23.774 --> 47:27.478
patient may not
even be aware of.

47:27.478 --> 47:30.381
And there are several examples I
talk about in the book. And
there is one example in
particular,

47:30.381 --> 47:34.585
so it comes to mind off the top
of my head. This was a time when
I was going to the clinic

47:34.585 --> 47:39.924
myself as a patient. So, I'm
coming from home. And I had
injured my knee a few days
earlier.

47:39.924 --> 47:44.061
And I'm dressed very casually in
sweatpants and a sweatshirt. And
I come into the exam

47:44.061 --> 47:47.198
room with the doctor. And he
comes in. And he never looks at
me. He just looks at my

47:47.198 --> 47:49.834
knee and sort of has me stand up
and down and then says, you're
OK, and kind of was

47:49.834 --> 47:52.369
going to shuttle me away.

47:52.369 --> 47:55.573
And being a doctor, I knew that
there was more that could be
done or should have been

47:55.573 --> 47:59.410
done. And so I mentioned to him
that I'm a doctor. And then,
suddenly, he looks at me,

47:59.410 --> 48:04.014
and his eyes kind of light up.
And he looks at my knee. He
starts to talk to me. And so

48:04.014 --> 48:06.117
he really engages in the sort of
doctor-patient exchange, the way
that it should have been

48:06.117 --> 48:08.152
from the beginning.

48:08.152 --> 48:12.323
And it was a really vivid
illustration of how differently
I can -- perceived. On one

48:12.323 --> 48:16.227
hand, I could just be a young
black man who is off the street
somewhere. And who knows

48:16.227 --> 48:19.563
what negative presumptions he
may have had, because he didn't
engage with me at all. And

48:19.563 --> 48:22.466
then once he realizes I'm a
doctor, it was like a totally
different experience.

48:22.466 --> 48:24.835
And so I think that really
illustrates how differently
things can play out in the exam

48:24.835 --> 48:25.703
room.

48:25.703 --> 48:26.337
JEFFREY BROWN: You
became a psychiatrist.

48:26.337 --> 48:27.204
DR. DAMON TWEEDY: Yes.

48:27.204 --> 48:28.239
JEFFREY BROWN: Why?

48:28.239 --> 48:30.274
DR. DAMON TWEEDY:
Great question.

48:30.274 --> 48:32.176
I never thought, when I went to
medical school, I would become
-- come to psychiatry.

48:32.176 --> 48:33.944
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

48:33.944 --> 48:37.248
DR. DAMON TWEEDY: But as I got
towards the end of medical
school, I took this one rotation

48:37.248 --> 48:41.485
just on a flyer, and I really
enjoyed it. And the patients
told my supervisors that

48:41.485 --> 48:44.121
I had a way with -- of relaxing
people and getting them to talk
to me and I had a way

48:44.121 --> 48:46.423
of connecting with people.

48:46.423 --> 48:50.995
And so that really made me think
about psychiatry. There is also
this huge issue as an
African-American.

48:50.995 --> 48:55.366
And the mental health in the
black community is really a big
deal, because, often, black

48:55.366 --> 48:58.936
people will be resistant to
mental health care or feel like
it's something that's not

48:58.936 --> 49:02.439
for them. And there is this huge
sort of stigma that we often
deal with.

49:02.439 --> 49:05.676
And so, as a psychiatrist, I
have often been one of the only
few black psychiatrist. And

49:05.676 --> 49:08.312
so it's a huge deal
there as well.

49:08.312 --> 49:10.181
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, this is
something important that you
have written a lot about, the
dearth

49:10.181 --> 49:11.949
of the black doctors generally.

49:11.949 --> 49:13.551
DR. DAMON TWEEDY: Yes. Yes.

49:13.551 --> 49:16.353
JEFFREY BROWN: And you're
pointing to that as one of the
important factors of why blacks

49:16.353 --> 49:19.890
fair so poorly in
the medical system.

49:19.890 --> 49:22.359
Why? Why is it important to
have more black doctors?

49:22.359 --> 49:24.762
DR. DAMON TWEEDY: Yes.

49:24.762 --> 49:28.365
So, African-Americans make up
about 13 percent of the
population, but about 4 percent
of

49:28.365 --> 49:30.134
physicians. And it's like --
mental health and psychiatry, it
is about the same, really

49:30.134 --> 49:32.369
low numbers.

49:32.369 --> 49:36.974
And what you often see is that
there is this issue of the
patients don't trust the health

49:36.974 --> 49:40.377
care system because there has
been a bad history of things
that have happened in the past.

49:40.377 --> 49:45.649
And so often, as a black doctor,
I'm there to help sort of be a
translator in a way.

49:45.649 --> 49:48.652
JEFFREY BROWN: So that's why
we need more black doctors.

49:48.652 --> 49:53.657
At the same time, I saw recently
the Association of American
Medical Colleges, a new report

49:53.657 --> 49:55.893
that applications from
African-American men have
declined...

49:55.893 --> 49:56.760
DR. DAMON TWEEDY: Yes, exactly.

49:56.760 --> 49:57.628
JEFFREY BROWN: ...
from 1978 to recently.

49:57.628 --> 49:58.062
DR. DAMON TWEEDY:
Right. Exactly.

49:58.062 --> 49:58.429
JEFFREY BROWN: Why?

49:58.429 --> 50:00.097
DR. DAMON TWEEDY: Yes.

50:00.097 --> 50:02.433
So, the numbers for black women
have actually increased during
that time.

50:02.433 --> 50:06.604
But I think there's this bigger
issue about the way society from
the very top down kind

50:06.604 --> 50:11.041
of limits the horizons and the
expectations of what
African-American men can be. And
I

50:11.041 --> 50:12.243
think that really filters down.
It starts from the top and it
filters down into the

50:12.243 --> 50:14.211
communities.

50:14.211 --> 50:18.182
I come from that kind of
community, where the idea of
being a doctor was sort of an

50:18.182 --> 50:22.987
alien concept. And it was only
the -- I had the good fortune of
having an older brother

50:22.987 --> 50:25.189
who had gone to college and then
being in a program -- I tested
into a program that

50:25.189 --> 50:28.192
really set -- a magnet program
that really set me on that path.

50:28.192 --> 50:31.061
But there all too many young
black men who don't have those
opportunities. And there

50:31.061 --> 50:32.863
is talent being squandered. And
so I think that is the big
factor.

50:32.863 --> 50:36.066
JEFFREY BROWN: I know this is a
sort of personal memoir for you.

50:36.066 --> 50:37.668
DR. DAMON TWEEDY: Sure.

50:37.668 --> 50:41.171
JEFFREY BROWN: Have you thought
about larger questions of
policy-type questions of what

50:41.171 --> 50:45.142
should be done, either in the
medical profession or the wider
society?

50:45.142 --> 50:47.044
DR. DAMON TWEEDY: Sure.

50:47.044 --> 50:50.381
And in the book, I talk about
some of those. I talk about the
Affordable Care Act and its

50:50.381 --> 50:52.816
-- the way it's helped and the
way it's been undercut by sort
of the politics of all of

50:52.816 --> 50:54.585
it.

50:54.585 --> 50:59.290
I also talk about ways in which
doctors and patients can be --
can sort of be educated

50:59.290 --> 51:02.526
to have a better relationship,
because I think that's -- a huge
issue in my book is about

51:02.526 --> 51:07.064
the doctor and patient
relationship. And when that's
frayed, that really makes a huge
impact

51:07.064 --> 51:10.200
on patients. And, ultimately,
the way our society is set up,
often, black people are

51:10.200 --> 51:11.568
the ones who are facing the
biggest consequence for that.

51:11.568 --> 51:12.836
JEFFREY BROWN: All right.

51:12.836 --> 51:14.772
The new book is "Black
Man in a White Coat."

51:14.772 --> 51:19.143
Dr. Damon Tweedy,
thank you so much.

51:19.143 --> 51:24.248
DR. DAMON TWEEDY:
Thank you, sir.

51:24.248 --> 51:29.520
GWEN IFILL: Before we go
tonight, an update on the flash
floods in Utah.

51:29.520 --> 51:34.558
Officials at Zion National Park
say three are dead and four
others are missing after

51:34.558 --> 51:37.828
the floods washed through that
park. Twelve people were killed
last night in the flooding

51:37.828 --> 51:41.465
near the Arizona border.

51:41.465 --> 51:46.637
And, finally, our "NewsHour"
Shares of the day, something
that caught our eye which might

51:46.637 --> 51:51.375
be of interest to you, too.
Today marks the halfway point in
a year-long mission on the

51:51.375 --> 51:55.612
International Space Station. The
goal? To figure out the
long-term effects on the human

51:55.612 --> 51:59.149
body from being out
of this world.

51:59.149 --> 52:03.988
They are comparing NASA
astronaut Scott Kelly, up in the
station, with his identical twin

52:03.988 --> 52:07.191
brother, retired astronaut Mark
Kelly, back here on Earth.

52:07.191 --> 52:10.494
Yesterday, NASA offered
a progress report.

52:10.494 --> 52:15.899
SCOTT KELLY, NASA Astronaut: As
far as physically, you know, I
feel good. You know, we have
some

52:15.899 --> 52:20.804
pretty good exercise equipment
up here, but there are a lot of
effects of this environment

52:20.804 --> 52:26.977
that we can't see or feel, like
bone loss, effects on our
vision, effects on our genetics,

52:26.977 --> 52:31.582
our DNA, RNA and proteins,
things like that.

52:31.582 --> 52:37.421
So they can look at that data
and look at the data they
collect with him over this year

52:37.421 --> 52:44.728
and see what kind of deviations
we have on a genetic level,
which, you know, could be

52:44.728 --> 52:49.466
a result of this environment,
the weightlessness of the
environment, the radiation that
we

52:49.466 --> 52:55.205
see, and, you know, from that
figure out other areas we need
to investigate, so we can, you

52:55.205 --> 52:58.809
know, eventually complete our
journey to Mars and elsewhere.

52:58.809 --> 53:02.212
QUESTION: What is your role in
the twin study here on the
ground, and how much time does

53:02.212 --> 53:04.181
it take?

53:04.181 --> 53:08.919
MARK KELLY, Former NASA
Astronaut: So far, my role has
been to provide samples, blood,

53:08.919 --> 53:12.356
saliva, other things I'm
not going to go into...

53:12.356 --> 53:14.525
(LAUGHTER)

53:14.525 --> 53:20.564
MARK KELLY: ... and be there for
MRIs and ultrasounds and even
some experiments. Sometimes,

53:20.564 --> 53:23.834
I will be laying in some kind of
contraption. I don't even know
what they're trying to figure

53:23.834 --> 53:26.870
out. I'm just like, do
whatever you need to do.

53:26.870 --> 53:32.376
So, we have data on a lot of
people out to six months being
in space. So, we have a pretty

53:32.376 --> 53:37.915
good idea of what happens in
that six-month period. We have
no data beyond six months.

53:37.915 --> 53:42.286
So, maybe there becomes a bend
in the curve. And what I mean by
that is, we know people's

53:42.286 --> 53:45.756
vision gets worse over the
six-month period, but maybe at
nine months or 10 months, maybe

53:45.756 --> 53:49.493
it gets really, really bad.

53:49.493 --> 53:54.531
And imagine you're trying to
send a crew to go work and live
on Mars for an extended period

53:54.531 --> 53:58.802
of time, but that, by the time
they get there, we find out
they're going to be nearly blind

53:58.802 --> 54:02.372
from the environment.
That's a big problem.

54:02.372 --> 54:06.777
So that's part of the idea of
doing this research over a
one-year period.

54:06.777 --> 54:12.116
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
online: For a city whose slogan
is Keep Austin Weird,

54:12.116 --> 54:16.553
these artists are model
citizens, combining puppetry and
cycling. The collective known

54:16.553 --> 54:21.191
as Austin Bike Zoo builds giant
animal puppets on wheels. Watch
the video on our home page,

54:21.191 --> 54:22.226
PBS.org/NewsHour.

54:22.226 --> 54:27.498
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm Gwen Ifill.

54:27.498 --> 54:30.767
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening. For all of us
here at the "PBS NewsHour,"

54:30.767 --> 54:31.068
thank you, and good night.
