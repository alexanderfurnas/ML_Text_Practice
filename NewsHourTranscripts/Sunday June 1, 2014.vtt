18:33.467 --> 18:35.867
>>> PLANT AND ANIMAL EXTINCTIONS

18:35.867 --> 18:40.133
ARE HAPPENING AT A RATE 1,00

18:40.133 --> 18:41.600
TIMES QUICKER.

18:41.600 --> 18:45.233
THE PLANET HAS BEEN THROUGH FIVE

18:45.233 --> 18:46.900
MAJOR EXTINCTIONS BEFORE

18:46.900 --> 18:48.867
SCIENTISTS THINK WE ARE ON THE

18:48.867 --> 18:50.933
CUSP OF A SIXTH.

18:50.933 --> 18:55.200
I SPOKE WITH STEWART PIM

18:55.200 --> 18:58.933
>> AN ENORMOUS ASTEROID PLOWED

18:58.933 --> 19:02.267
INTO THE YUCATAN PENINSULA I

19:02.267 --> 19:02.467
MEXICO

19:02.467 --> 19:04.400
IT STERILIZED MUCH OF NORT

19:04.400 --> 19:07.400
AMERICA AND ELIMINATED THE

19:07.400 --> 19:08.633
DINOSAURS.

19:08.633 --> 19:10.800
THAT KIND OF CATASTROPHE WILL BE

19:10.800 --> 19:13.267
WHAT WILL HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT

19:13.267 --> 19:15.400
100 YEARS IF WE DON'T DO

19:15.400 --> 19:18.333
SOMETHING ABOUT THE SPECIE

19:18.333 --> 19:18.967
EXTINCTION CRISIS.

19:18.967 --> 19:20.467
WE WILL LEAVE TO OUR CHILDRE

19:20.467 --> 19:22.500
AND GRANDCHILDREN A MUCH

19:22.500 --> 19:23.767
DEPLETED PLANET.

19:23.767 --> 19:25.933
>> HOW DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE RATE

19:25.933 --> 19:27.633
OF EXTINCTION SINCE HUMANS HAV

19:27.633 --> 19:29.267
ONLY BEEN ON THE PLANET FOR

19:29.267 --> 19:30.300
CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME

19:30.300 --> 19:31.867
>> THERE ARE TWO PARTS OF IT

19:31.867 --> 19:34.200
ONE IS WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW O

19:34.200 --> 19:36.233
AT LEAST OVER THE LAST 50 TO 100

19:36.233 --> 19:36.600
YEARS.

19:36.600 --> 19:39.033
WE CAN FOLLOW SPECIES FROM WHE

19:39.033 --> 19:41.267
WE FIRST LEARNED ABOUT THEM TO

19:41.267 --> 19:42.500
THE PRESENT AND SEE WHAT

19:42.500 --> 19:44.100
FRACTION OF THEM ARE DYING OFF

19:44.100 --> 19:47.333
AND THEY ARE DYING OFF A PRETT

19:47.333 --> 19:48.100
HEFTY RATE

19:48.100 --> 19:50.633
WORKING OUT WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE

19:50.633 --> 19:51.867
HUMANS CAME ALONG IS A LITTL

19:51.867 --> 19:52.933
MORE DIFFICULT

19:52.933 --> 19:54.900
THE FOSSIL RECORD CAN TELL US

19:54.900 --> 19:56.067
LOT ABOUT THAT

19:56.067 --> 19:59.767
WE ALSO LEARN A LOT FROM THEIR

19:59.767 --> 20:01.800
DNA, FROM THE MOLECULAR EVIDENCE

20:01.800 --> 20:04.367
OF HOW FAST SPECIES ARE BORN AND

20:04.367 --> 20:05.967
HOW FAST THEY DIE OFF.

20:05.967 --> 20:08.067
AND IT'S COMPARING THOSE TWO

20:08.067 --> 20:10.233
THINGS, WHAT IS HAPPENING TO

20:10.233 --> 20:12.167
SPECIES NOW WITH WHAT HAPPENED

20:12.167 --> 20:14.367
IN THE GEOLOGICAL PAST THAT HA

20:14.367 --> 20:16.167
ALLOWED US TO COME UP WITH THE

20:16.167 --> 20:18.067
STATEMENT OF HOW FAST SPECIE

20:18.067 --> 20:19.467
ARE GOING EXTINCT.

20:19.467 --> 20:21.833
>> HELP US PUT THIS STARTLIN

20:21.833 --> 20:22.933
EXTINCTION NUMBER IN PERSPECTIVE

20:22.933 --> 20:23.900
A BIT.

20:23.900 --> 20:25.933
>> EXTINCTION IS A DEATH RATE.

20:25.933 --> 20:29.900
WE USED TO THINK OF HUMAN BEINGS

20:29.900 --> 20:36.367
DYING OFF THE RATE PER YEAR.

20:36.367 --> 20:39.067
SPECIES OFTEN DIE OFF BUT TH

20:39.067 --> 20:42.233
RATE OF 1 SPECIES IN TEN MILLION

20:42.233 --> 20:43.433
A YEAR

20:43.433 --> 20:44.833
SPECIES ARE GOING EXTINCT TH

20:44.833 --> 20:49.533
RATE OF 100 TO 1,000 SPECIES

20:49.533 --> 20:52.833
EXTINCTIONS PER MILLION SPECIES.

20:52.833 --> 20:54.400
AND THAT IS A RATE THAT IS VERY,

20:54.400 --> 20:55.833
VERY MUCH HIGHER THAN WE THOUGHT

20:55.833 --> 20:56.833
IT WAS

20:56.833 --> 20:59.700
>> AND WHAT IS CAUSING THESE

20:59.700 --> 20:59.800
EXTINCTIONS?

20:59.800 --> 21:00.967
IS IT HUMANS

21:00.967 --> 21:01.867
IS IT CLIMATE?

21:01.867 --> 21:05.667
>> WE ARE THE ULTIMATE PROBLEM

21:05.667 --> 21:07.233
THERE ARE 7 BILLION PEOPLE O

21:07.233 --> 21:08.767
THE PLANET

21:08.767 --> 21:11.467
WE TEND TO DESTROY CRITICA

21:11.467 --> 21:13.367
HABITATS WHERE SPECIES LIVE.

21:13.367 --> 21:15.400
WE TEND TO BE WARMING TH

21:15.400 --> 21:15.700
PLANET

21:15.700 --> 21:17.267
WE TEND TO BE CARELESS ABOUT

21:17.267 --> 21:19.033
MOVING SPECIES AROUND THE PLANET

21:19.033 --> 21:20.900
TO PLACES WHERE THEY DON'T

21:20.900 --> 21:24.933
BELONG AND WHERE THEY CAN.

21:24.933 --> 21:28.367
>> PEOPLE ARE ASSISTING IN

21:28.367 --> 21:29.667
CONSERVATION EFFORTS WIT

21:29.667 --> 21:30.667
TECHNOLOGY IN THEIR HANDS TODAY.

21:30.667 --> 21:31.733
>> ABSOLUTELY.

21:31.733 --> 21:33.567
THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

21:33.567 --> 21:36.733
AROUND THE WORLD WHO ARE

21:36.733 --> 21:38.833
PASSIONATE ABOUT ORCHIDS AND

21:38.833 --> 21:42.067
FROGS AND BIRDS AND DRAGON

21:42.067 --> 21:42.300
FLIES.

21:42.300 --> 21:44.467
AND THAT CROWD SOURCING IS

21:44.467 --> 21:48.367
GIVING US AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT O

21:48.367 --> 21:49.467
DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE

21:49.467 --> 21:50.333
SPECIES ARE.

21:50.333 --> 21:54.133
AND WE CAN USE THAT DETAILED

21:54.133 --> 21:55.700
INFORMATION TO SEND VERY

21:55.700 --> 21:58.333
PRECISE, VERY CRISP CONSERVATION

21:58.333 --> 21:58.533
PRIORITIES

21:58.533 --> 22:00.367
IT HELPS US KNOW WHERE WE NEED

22:00.367 --> 22:03.500
TO ACT, WHERE WE NEED TO INVES

22:03.500 --> 22:06.533
OUR SCARCE CONSERVATION DOLLARS.

22:06.533 --> 22:08.000
>> THANKS SO MUCH.

22:08.000 --> 22:08.067
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVIN

22:08.067 --> 22:17.000
ME ON THE PROGRAM.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.267
>>> THAT'S IT FOR THIS EDITION

22:19.267 --> 22:23.933
OF "PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND".
