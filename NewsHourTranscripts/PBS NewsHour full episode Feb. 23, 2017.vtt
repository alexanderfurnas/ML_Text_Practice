Trump era agenda
with a Republican-controlled
Congress.

00:15.949 --> 00:20.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Thursday:
As top U.S. officials meet with
their Mexican

00:20.787 --> 00:25.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
counterparts, we talk with an
influential
congressional leader to discuss
new immigration

00:25.993 --> 00:27.861 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
plans.

00:27.895 --> 00:31.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Jeffrey Brown
sits down
with the makers of the
Oscar-nominated documentary

00:31.198 --> 00:34.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"White Helmets" about the heroes
of the Syrian
conflict.

00:34.568 --> 00:38.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ORLANDO VON EINSIEDEL, Director,
"The White
Helmets": This group of everyday
Syrian civilians

00:38.805 --> 00:45.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who had decided not to pick up a
gun, decided
not to leave Syria, and instead
had decided

00:45.078 --> 00:46.413 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to stay.

00:46.446 --> 00:48.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:48.382 --> 00:52.786 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:52.819 --> 01:05.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump's
top advisers
took the stage today at the
annual Conservative

01:05.933 --> 01:07.801 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Political Action Conference.

01:07.834 --> 01:12.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're among the thousands
who've gathered
just across the river from
Washington to discuss

01:13.006 --> 01:17.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the future of the conservative
movement, now
that a Republican is back in
power.

01:17.978 --> 01:19.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang has our report.

01:19.813 --> 01:25.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: This year's
Conservative Political
Action Conference, or CPAC,
clearly reflects

01:25.385 --> 01:27.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the new resident of the White
House.

01:27.220 --> 01:30.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY, Trump Senior
Adviser: Well,
I think, by tomorrow, this will
be TPAC this

01:30.891 --> 01:32.693 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

01:32.726 --> 01:36.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Eight top
administration officials,
including President Trump
himself, are on

01:36.930 --> 01:38.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the three-day agenda.

01:39.032 --> 01:42.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today's lead-off speaker, White
House counselor
Kellyanne Conway.

01:42.536 --> 01:46.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Every great
movement ends
up being a little bit sclerotic
and dusty

01:46.974 --> 01:50.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after a time, and I think they
need an infusion
of energy.

01:50.911 --> 01:57.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the case of candidate
Trump and president-elect
and nominee Trump, he went right
to the grassroots

01:57.484 --> 01:58.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and brought you along.

01:58.986 --> 02:02.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That new energy is
evident among
many conference attendees.

02:02.990 --> 02:08.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: There's so many people and
there's so
many ideas and all of the
speakers and everything.

02:08.929 --> 02:09.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's really exciting.

02:09.930 --> 02:11.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: We know that we have a
voice.

02:11.465 --> 02:14.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president talks straight to
us now, and
this is our chance to talk back.

02:14.701 --> 02:18.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Last year, at the
height of the
Republican presidential
primaries, candidate

02:18.905 --> 02:21.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Trump skipped CPAC altogether.

02:21.408 --> 02:25.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while the Trump team has
taken over this
year's schedule, the question is
whether they

02:25.912 --> 02:28.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are also taking over the
conservative movement.

02:29.016 --> 02:33.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, White House chief of
staff Reince Priebus,
the former party chairman, and
senior Trump

02:33.954 --> 02:40.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
adviser Steve Bannon, the
insurgent-turned-insider,
sought to present a united
front.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They dismissed reports of White
House infighting.

02:42.529 --> 02:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REINCE PRIEBUS, White House
Chief Of Staff:
In regard to us two I think the
biggest misconception

02:46.566 --> 02:48.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is everything that you're
reading.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE BANNON, White House Chief
Strategist:
Reince is indefatigable.

02:50.237 --> 02:54.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it's low-key, but it's
determination,
the thing I respect most.

02:54.141 --> 02:58.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the only way this thing
works is, Reince
is always kind of steady.

02:58.078 --> 03:02.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Bannon said the
president's attitude
is full steam ahead.

03:02.416 --> 03:06.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE BANNON: He's going to
continue to press
his agenda.

03:06.453 --> 03:10.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as economic conditions get
better, as
more jobs get better, they're
going to continue

03:10.791 --> 03:12.592 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to fight.

03:12.626 --> 03:16.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you think they're going to
give you your
country back without a fight,
you're sadly

03:16.096 --> 03:17.064 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mistaken.

03:17.097 --> 03:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Every day, every day, it's going
to be a fight.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Earlier, the
executive director
of the American Conservative
Union, which

03:24.304 --> 03:31.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
organizes CPAC, slammed the
alt-right movement,
a mix of white nationalism,
neo-Nazi beliefs

03:31.078 --> 03:32.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and hard-edged populism.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAN SCHNEIDER, Executive
Director, American
Conservative Union: We know who
these people

03:34.481 --> 03:36.316 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are.

03:36.349 --> 03:40.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They met just a couple months
ago in Washington,
D.C., to spew their hatred and
make their

03:41.021 --> 03:44.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
"Heil Hitler" salutes.

03:44.691 --> 03:45.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are anti-Semites.

03:45.725 --> 03:47.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are racists.

03:47.494 --> 03:49.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are sexists.

03:49.296 --> 03:54.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Richard Spencer, the
man credited
with coining the phrase
alt-right, attended

03:54.267 --> 03:57.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today's conference, but said he
was asked
to leave.

03:57.804 --> 03:59.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

03:59.840 --> 04:04.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will take a
closer look
at President Trump's inner
circle, and the

04:04.211 --> 04:08.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
role his senior adviser Steve
Bannon is playing,
later in the program.

04:08.748 --> 04:12.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the day's other news:
President Trump says
that he wants to build up the
U.S. nuclear

04:13.019 --> 04:16.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
arsenal to make sure that it's
-- quote -- "at
the top of the pack."

04:17.023 --> 04:21.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In an interview with Reuters,
Mr. Trump also
denounced Russia's launch of a
ground-based

04:21.895 --> 04:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cruise missile as a violation of
a 1987 arms
control treaty.

04:27.434 --> 04:31.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he said he supports some
form of a border
tax, but offered no specifics.

04:31.838 --> 04:35.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: President
Trump's education
secretary defended the rollback
of public

04:35.942 --> 04:39.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
school bathroom rules for
transgender students.

04:39.179 --> 04:43.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Education and Justice
Departments last
night withdrew guidance on the
issue from

04:43.783 --> 04:45.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Obama administration.

04:45.619 --> 04:50.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It had said public schools must
let transgender
students use the bathroom of
their choice.

04:50.557 --> 04:55.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At today's CPAC conference,
Betsy DeVos insisted
students, parents and teachers
need more flexibility.

04:55.128 --> 05:02.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETSY DEVOS, U.S. Education
Secretary: This
issue was a very huge example of
the Obama

05:02.536 --> 05:08.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration's overreach, to
suggest a one-size-fits-all,
federal government approach,
top-down approach

05:08.375 --> 05:13.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to issues that are best dealt
with and solved
at a personal level and a local
level.

05:13.747 --> 05:17.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The White
House yesterday
denied reports that DeVos
opposed changes

05:17.617 --> 05:20.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to the guidance, but was
overruled by the
Justice Department.

05:20.654 --> 05:26.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A number of
Republican lawmakers
home on break this week are
facing angry constituents

05:26.593 --> 05:28.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at town hall meetings.

05:28.562 --> 05:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some attendees have expressed
concerns about
President Trump and his
approaches to environmental

05:33.166 --> 05:36.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
protection and the Affordable
Care Act.

05:36.069 --> 05:41.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Arkansas last night, Senator
Tom Cotton
was confronted by shouting
demonstrators who

05:41.308 --> 05:43.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
asked about the health care
issue.

05:43.677 --> 05:50.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Will you commit to
replacements in
the same way that you have
committed to the

05:50.150 --> 05:51.117 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
repeal?

05:51.151 --> 05:52.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

05:52.185 --> 05:53.653 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

Everyone in this
room has been hurt or helped...

05:59.125 --> 06:02.329 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I have only been helped.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Obamacare saved my life,
Senator.

06:04.998 --> 06:10.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, amid
more jeers
in Louisiana, Republican Senator
Bill Cassidy

06:10.270 --> 06:15.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was asked if he would author
legislation to
get rid of big contributions in
elections.

06:15.242 --> 06:16.943 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

06:16.977 --> 06:17.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL CASSIDY (R), Louisiana: To
get money
out of politics means that you
would need

06:17.544 --> 06:18.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to have public funding.

06:18.478 --> 06:20.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

06:20.247 --> 06:21.214 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(SHOUTING)

06:21.248 --> 06:22.215 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

06:22.249 --> 06:29.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BILL CASSIDY: I fundamentally
disagree.

06:29.556 --> 06:41.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The protest bears
similarity
to events in the summer of 2009,
when Tea

06:41.234 --> 06:46.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Party groups voiced discontent
about President
Obama's health care overhaul.

06:46.039 --> 06:49.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Attorney
General Jeff Sessions
will let the federal government
continue to

06:49.909 --> 06:51.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
use private prisons.

06:51.444 --> 06:53.213 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He issued a new memo today.

06:53.246 --> 06:57.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It replaces an Obama
administration memo that
intended to phase them out,
citing subpar

06:57.684 --> 06:59.486 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
management.

06:59.519 --> 07:02.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And also from the Trump
administration today,
there's a sign that states with
recreational

07:02.956 --> 07:07.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
marijuana use laws have stricter
federal enforcement
in store.

07:07.927 --> 07:11.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House Press Secretary Sean
Spicer said
the Department of Justice will
be looking

07:11.298 --> 07:13.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
into it.

07:13.199 --> 07:16.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Newly released e-mails show a
cozy relationship
between the now head of the
Environmental

07:16.636 --> 07:18.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Protection Agency and energy
companies.

07:18.772 --> 07:23.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scott Pruitt, Oklahoma's former
attorney general,
was sworn in as EPA chief last
week.

07:23.810 --> 07:29.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 7,500 pages of e-mails
from his
attorney general's office were
released under

07:29.382 --> 07:31.151 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
court order.

07:31.184 --> 07:35.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They show Pruitt and his staff
coordinated
with oil and gas executives to
fight Obama

07:35.322 --> 07:37.424 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
era environmental regulations.

07:37.457 --> 07:42.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Iraq,
U.S.-backed Iraqi
forces fought their way into a
military base

07:42.696 --> 07:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
outside Mosul, and onto the
grounds of the
city's airport.

07:46.499 --> 07:51.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of a major assault to
drive Islamic
State fighters out of Iraq's
second biggest

07:51.938 --> 07:53.740 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
city.

07:53.773 --> 07:58.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraqi police units and army
forces engaged
in heavy clashes with ISIS
militants, before

07:58.311 --> 08:00.280 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
seizing the airport's runway.

08:00.313 --> 08:04.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Back in this
country, officials
are investigating, after an
off-duty Los Angeles

08:04.651 --> 08:08.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
policeman fired his gun during a
dispute with
teenagers on his lawn.

08:08.955 --> 08:13.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cell phone video showed the
officer struggling
with a 13-year-old yesterday.

08:13.259 --> 08:17.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After other kids approached, the
man pulled
a gun from his waistband and
fired a shot.

08:17.864 --> 08:21.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No one was hurt, but two teens
were arrested.

08:21.334 --> 08:24.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Protests erupted overnight, with
hundreds
marching through the streets.

08:24.471 --> 08:27.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some blocked traffic, and 24
people were arrested.

08:27.741 --> 08:30.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The officer was placed on
administrative leave.

08:30.243 --> 08:33.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stocks were
mostly higher on
Wall Street today.

08:33.513 --> 08:39.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained more
than 34 points to close at
20810.

08:39.686 --> 08:44.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 25, and the S&amp;P
500 added
nearly a point.

08:44.124 --> 08:48.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Still to come
on the "NewsHour":
the chairman of the House
Homeland Security

08:48.061 --> 08:53.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Committee on plans to tighten
immigration
policies; the changing face of
the GOP under

08:53.500 --> 08:58.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump and his inner
circle; why
more white Americans are dying
in middle age;

08:58.905 --> 09:03.042 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and much more.

09:03.076 --> 09:14.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We turn now to
the Trump administration's
push to increase security along
the southern

09:14.988 --> 09:18.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
border and at U.S. points of
entry.

09:18.124 --> 09:23.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The chairman of the House
Homeland Security
Committee, Representative
Michael McCaul,

09:23.196 --> 09:26.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
joined me a short time ago from
his home state
of Texas.

09:26.332 --> 09:31.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He toured the U.S.-Mexico border
yesterday
as part of a congressional
delegation.

09:31.070 --> 09:37.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I asked if he believed it's
necessary to build
a physical wall along the entire
border, as

09:37.310 --> 09:38.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the president has suggested.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.480 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

09:40.513 --> 09:43.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MCCAUL (R), Texas: No, I
don't think
we need a 2,000-mile wall down
there.

09:43.917 --> 09:51.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need a physical barrier,
multilayered approach,
using both physical
infrastructure, but also

09:51.458 --> 09:52.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
technology and personnel.

09:52.959 --> 09:58.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those are the three main things
that Border
Patrol tells us they need.

09:58.231 --> 10:02.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we need some creativity to
make a smart
border to get operational
control.

10:02.936 --> 10:08.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what we saw yesterday,
Judy, I thought
was very interesting was how, in
McAllen and

10:08.708 --> 10:14.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hidalgo county, they created a
levee to protect
them from floods that was in
essence a concrete

10:14.380 --> 10:20.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
levee that could operate and
looked sort of
like a wall, but, at the same
time, was embraced

10:20.653 --> 10:26.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the local community residents
as being
a solution to the problem, that
the county

10:26.059 --> 10:31.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
judge in Hidalgo County told us
they wanted
us to go that direction, rather
than erecting

10:31.731 --> 10:33.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a 20-foot concrete wall.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's interesting
you say that,
because I was going to ask you
about a number

10:36.970 --> 10:41.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of other Republican members of
Congress, your
colleagues, who are saying a
wall may be part

10:41.574 --> 10:43.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the solution, but it's not
the only solution.

10:43.776 --> 10:49.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I saw Congressman Will Hurd, who
represents
a border district, said the wall
is the most

10:49.349 --> 10:53.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
expensive and, in his words,
least effective
way to secure the border.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.121 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

10:55.154 --> 11:01.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MCCAUL: Well, I think
it's necessary
in some places to basically slow
down illegals

11:01.394 --> 11:03.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or potential terrorists or
funnel them.

11:03.696 --> 11:08.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we essentially, Judy,
because of the Secure
Fence Act, have fencing between
San Diego

11:08.434 --> 11:09.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
almost all the way the El Paso.

11:09.536 --> 11:10.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.405 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

11:12.438 --> 11:13.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MCCAUL: I think the Rio
Grande Valley
sector, where I was with the
speaker yesterday

11:13.873 --> 11:18.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in my state of Texas, presents a
challenge,
because you have a river.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not just land.

11:20.780 --> 11:23.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have a river there and you
have land owners
that have -- want to have access
to that river.

11:23.683 --> 11:28.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think these creative
solutions like
this concrete levee system I
think provide

11:28.588 --> 11:30.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a creative way to do it.

11:30.456 --> 11:34.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Chairman, you
announced
today the launch of a
congressional task force.

11:34.694 --> 11:39.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're calling it denying
terrorists entry
into the United States, looking
for all the

11:39.299 --> 11:44.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
potential pathways by which
extremists, in
your word, might enter this
country.

11:44.170 --> 11:47.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
How is this going to be
different from what
the federal government has been
doing and

11:47.307 --> 11:50.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spending billions of dollars
doing since 9/11?

11:50.777 --> 11:52.712 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

11:52.745 --> 11:56.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MCCAUL: Well, we had a
foreign fighter
task force last Congress that
provided legislative

11:56.950 --> 12:03.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
solutions, some of which were
signed into
law by then President Obama,
dealing with

12:03.089 --> 12:08.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
foreign fighter threat from the
caliphate,
Iraq and Syria, into Europe and
into the United

12:08.294 --> 12:10.063 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

12:10.096 --> 12:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to be examining, how
can we more
properly screen and vet people
coming into

12:14.334 --> 12:15.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the United States?

12:15.335 --> 12:16.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will also be looking at the
border.

12:16.803 --> 12:20.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will also be taking a look
at, how can
you vet refugees as well?

12:20.406 --> 12:29.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, I think you can
enhance this process
and certainly deploy ICE
officials at consular

12:29.182 --> 12:34.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
offices where they apply for the
visas and
have a higher vetting process on
the front

12:34.787 --> 12:36.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
end, when they're applying for
the visas.

12:36.556 --> 12:39.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, one of the
things you
focus on in this document that I
was looking

12:39.559 --> 12:43.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are American citizens crossing
back into this
country.

12:43.062 --> 12:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that the people behind
some of the
most recent terror attacks in
this country

12:47.266 --> 12:51.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in San Bernardino, Orlando were
American citizens.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But what more can you do?

12:53.339 --> 12:58.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you screen American
citizens without
profiling them or without
violating their

12:58.945 --> 12:59.912 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
civil liberties?

12:59.946 --> 13:01.748 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MCCAUL: Well, I think
you always have
to be a little more careful,
like we saw in

13:03.850 --> 13:08.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the executive order, denying
lawful permanent
residents access in the United
States.

13:08.488 --> 13:13.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that was the glitch in
that executive
order that I think will be
remedied in short

13:13.359 --> 13:15.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
order, I am told.

13:15.161 --> 13:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think you can look at --
the case Rahami,
the New York bomber, is a prime
example of

13:20.299 --> 13:22.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how we could have maybe done a
better job.

13:22.702 --> 13:24.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is where the FBI had opened
a case.

13:24.937 --> 13:27.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
His father said he's a
terrorist.

13:27.140 --> 13:32.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, after the fact, we find out
his travels
to Afghanistan and Pakistan led
him to more

13:32.545 --> 13:34.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
radicalized mosques.

13:34.480 --> 13:39.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet we didn't have that
intelligence ready
to vet him when he was going
through secondary

13:39.252 --> 13:41.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
screening trying to come back
into the United
States.

13:41.821 --> 13:42.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

13:42.822 --> 13:43.790 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL MCCAUL: And what was the
result?

13:45.058 --> 13:48.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two bombs going off, one in New
Jersey and
one in New York.

13:48.528 --> 13:52.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's the kind of example
of a case,
better intelligence-sharing,
connecting the

13:52.265 --> 13:54.434 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dots, looking at social media.

13:54.467 --> 13:57.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Any employer is going to look at
your social
media before they hire you.

13:57.537 --> 14:01.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why aren't we doing that when we
screen people
coming into the United States?

14:01.474 --> 14:04.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Another thing I
want to ask
you about is something President
Trump said

14:04.577 --> 14:07.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
today about enforcing
immigration.

14:07.413 --> 14:14.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He talked about the effort to
round up immigrants
as a military operation and he
talked about

14:14.253 --> 14:18.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ridding the U.S. of, in his
words, really
bad dudes.

14:18.324 --> 14:19.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that how you see this?

14:19.358 --> 14:20.727 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

14:20.760 --> 14:23.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MCCAUL: We have to
comply with federal
law in doing this.

14:23.463 --> 14:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can't just put the military
in the streets
of the United States rounding up
illegal aliens.

14:27.633 --> 14:29.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think that would be a
violation of federal
law.

14:29.669 --> 14:35.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think Secretary Kelly,
General Kelly,
came out not too long after that
to correct

14:35.141 --> 14:42.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that statement that he has no
intent to dispatch,
you know, military officers into
the streets.

14:42.982 --> 14:47.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a civilian police force
in the United
States for a reason, and that's
our police

14:47.653 --> 14:50.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
officers, our ICE agents, not
the military.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that would be a big
mistake.

14:51.457 --> 14:52.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

14:52.992 --> 14:54.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just a couple of other quick
things I want
to ask you about, Mr. Chairman.

14:54.861 --> 14:58.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president also said today
that if countries
are going to have nuclear
weapons, then he

14:58.798 --> 15:03.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said the United States needs to
be at the
top of the back, in his words,
meaning increasing

15:03.469 --> 15:04.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the U.S. nuclear arsenal.

15:04.904 --> 15:05.838 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Do you see that?

15:05.872 --> 15:07.740 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

15:07.774 --> 15:11.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MCCAUL: Well, I know
that in my dealings
with the president and looking
at the SALT

15:11.811 --> 15:20.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
treaty with Russia in terms of
how they built
more capability than we have, I
think all

15:20.186 --> 15:25.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
along his theme has been, we
want to build
a greater military, one that is
respected

15:26.025 --> 15:27.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
around the world.

15:27.894 --> 15:32.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I believe the previous
administration shrunk
from some of our
responsibilities as a superpower

15:32.865 --> 15:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and made the world a more
dangerous place.

15:34.634 --> 15:39.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think he's trying to project
strength, so
we can have peace through
strength in the

15:39.472 --> 15:41.007 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
end.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me ask
you, finally,
about meeting your constituents.

15:42.909 --> 15:45.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In your case, it's Texas' 10th
District.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It stretches from Austin to the
Houston suburbs.

15:48.481 --> 15:53.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I'm sure you know that
thousands, maybe tens
of thousands of Americans have
been gathering

15:53.953 --> 15:59.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at town halls sponsored by your
Republican
colleagues in Congress the last
couple of

15:59.625 --> 16:05.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weeks, many of them angry, many
of them upset
about policies of President
Trump.

16:05.298 --> 16:08.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are you going to be meeting with
your constituents
in the near future?

16:08.568 --> 16:09.535 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

16:09.569 --> 16:10.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MCCAUL: I always do.

16:10.570 --> 16:13.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, look, this is what
democracy is all about.

16:13.639 --> 16:19.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People have every right to
protest whoever's
in the White House, without fear
of persecution.

16:19.779 --> 16:24.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If this happened in Iran, people
would be
shot on the streets.

16:24.717 --> 16:28.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the United States of
America, and
we have a First Amendment that
protects this

16:28.487 --> 16:29.622 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
kind of speech.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it's just part of
the democratic
process.

16:31.991 --> 16:36.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm planning to hold what's
called a telephone
town hall, where we have greater
bandwidth,

16:36.729 --> 16:41.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I will be able to reach
probably 40,000
to 50,000 of my constituents
throughout my

16:41.100 --> 16:44.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
district in effective sort of
media technology.

16:44.670 --> 16:45.638 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, we...

16:45.671 --> 16:46.639 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

16:46.672 --> 16:47.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in person,
too?

16:47.673 --> 16:48.641 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

16:48.674 --> 16:49.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL MCCAUL: We do meet with
them.

16:49.876 --> 16:54.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Unfortunately, we had protesters
at my office
in Austin.

16:54.313 --> 16:59.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we meet with them and talk
to them and
make sure that their voices are
heard, too,

16:59.252 --> 17:02.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because, you know, we represent
all Americans,
just not one side of the aisle.

17:02.855 --> 17:07.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you agree with
the president's
words, finally, Mr. Chairman,
that these are,

17:07.493 --> 17:12.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in his words, so-called angry
crowds that
are actually planned out, in his
words, by

17:12.398 --> 17:13.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
liberal activists?

17:13.666 --> 17:14.634 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL MCCAUL: Well, they are
activists.

17:16.068 --> 17:19.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we had the Tea Party that
were activists.

17:19.138 --> 17:25.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now we're seeing this sort
of liberal
phenomenon of activists that are
speaking

17:25.111 --> 17:26.078 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out.

17:26.112 --> 17:27.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they have every right to do
so.

17:27.113 --> 17:29.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think we need to respect that
in this country.

17:29.315 --> 17:32.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's just part of the democratic
process.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.887 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I don't condemn them.

17:34.921 --> 17:39.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I try to educate them as best I
can.

17:39.058 --> 17:44.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, above all, I think what's
missing right
now in this country is really a
tone of civility

17:44.897 --> 17:46.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the fact that we are all
Americans.

17:46.832 --> 17:50.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's a message
that, unfortunately,
I'm not hearing a lot from our
leaders today.

17:50.670 --> 17:54.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I think a lot of
people would
agree with you about that.

17:54.707 --> 17:58.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chairman Michael McCaul, the
chairman of the
House Homeland Security
Committee, thank you

17:58.110 --> 17:59.946 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very much.

17:59.979 --> 18:01.480 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

18:01.514 --> 18:08.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MCCAUL: Thank you, Judy.

18:09.021 --> 18:15.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
secretaries of state
and homeland security were in
Mexico City

18:15.227 --> 18:20.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today on what was originally
seen as a fence-mending
mission after months of
turbulence.

18:20.633 --> 18:25.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But with new immigration
policies roiling
the relationship, it shaped up
to be what

18:25.204 --> 18:27.039 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump called a tough trip.

18:27.073 --> 18:32.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KELLY, U.S. Homeland
Security Secretary:
Let me be very, very clear:
There will be

18:32.311 --> 18:34.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
no, repeat, no mass
deportations.

18:34.947 --> 18:39.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That's
Homeland Security
Secretary John Kelly on a joint
mission with

18:39.719 --> 18:44.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson
days after
Kelly's department signaled a
crackdown on

18:44.724 --> 18:46.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
illegal immigration.

18:46.525 --> 18:51.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KELLY: Everything we do in
DHS will be
done legally and according to
human rights

18:51.897 --> 18:54.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the legal justice system of
the United
States.

18:54.967 --> 19:00.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This morning,
Mr. Trump
said the U.S. needed a more
muscular deportation

19:00.106 --> 19:01.907 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
force:

19:01.941 --> 19:03.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
We're getting really bad dudes
out of this

19:03.642 --> 19:07.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country, and at a rate that
nobody's seen
before.

19:07.713 --> 19:10.549 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they're the bad ones.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's a military operation.

19:12.184 --> 19:16.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In Mexico
City, Kelly seemed
to walk back his boss' words.

19:16.055 --> 19:22.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KELLY: No, repeat, no use
of military
force in immigration operations,
none.

19:22.194 --> 19:26.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The White
House press secretary
later sought to clarify the
president's comments.

19:26.699 --> 19:29.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
The president was using that as
an adjective.

19:29.035 --> 19:30.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's happening with precision.

19:30.970 --> 19:35.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The visit,
billed as reassurance
to concerned Mexican
counterparts, comes amid

19:35.341 --> 19:37.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
heightened tensions between the
neighbors.

19:37.643 --> 19:42.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier this week, a memo from
the Department
of Homeland Security vastly
expanded the government's

19:42.715 --> 19:47.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mandate to quickly deport
immigrants not convicted
of serious crimes.

19:47.753 --> 19:52.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The memo also said anyone caught
illegally
crossing the southern border
would be sent

19:52.358 --> 19:56.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back to Mexico, regardless of
their home country.

19:56.429 --> 20:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump has ordered a
review of all
aid to Mexico, raising
speculation that the

20:00.800 --> 20:06.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration may cut those
funds to pay
for Mr. Trump's long-promised
border wall.

20:06.806 --> 20:11.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Concerned Mexicans have urged
President Enrique
Pena Nieto's government to stand
up to the

20:11.177 --> 20:12.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump administration.

20:12.978 --> 20:17.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With Tillerson at his side,
Mexico's foreign
minister called for dialogue,
but said his

20:17.316 --> 20:21.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country was -- quote -- "worried
and irritated"
by the policy shifts.

20:21.287 --> 20:24.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUIS VIDEGARAY, Mexican Foreign
Minister (through
translator): In order to
overcome the insults,

20:24.990 --> 20:29.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to overcome the negative
feelings that, without
a doubt today prevail, what will
matter are

20:29.762 --> 20:31.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the actions, more than the
words.

20:31.597 --> 20:36.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tillerson said
it was natural
for two strong countries to
disagree, but

20:36.268 --> 20:38.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that progress had been made.

20:38.104 --> 20:41.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary of
State: There's
no mistaking that the rule of
law matters

20:41.140 --> 20:43.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
along both sides of our border.

20:43.142 --> 20:47.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We discussed the importance of
fair treatment
of all those in this transit.

20:47.780 --> 20:51.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Later,
Tillerson and Kelly
met the Mexican president, who
has sparred

20:51.717 --> 20:57.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Mr. Trump both during
campaign and since
the inauguration, over the wall,
immigration

20:57.323 --> 20:59.158 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and trade.

20:59.191 --> 21:02.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining me now to discuss the
trip to Mexico
and how Secretary Tillerson's
State Department

21:02.995 --> 21:05.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is taking shape are Gardiner
Harris of The
New York Times.

21:06.031 --> 21:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's in Mexico City right now.

21:07.533 --> 21:10.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Yeganeh Torbati, she covers
the State
Department for Reuters.

21:10.669 --> 21:12.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Gardiner, let me start with you.

21:12.505 --> 21:16.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The word choice by the president
to say military
operation today, and Secretary
Kelly going

21:16.876 --> 21:20.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of his way to make sure that
everyone
knew that it wasn't the
military, it almost

21:20.346 --> 21:23.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made it seem like there were two
messengers,
two messages, two teams.

21:23.616 --> 21:26.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GARDINER HARRIS, The New York
Times: Right.

21:26.118 --> 21:30.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, that's been the problem
all along during
the Trump administration,
particularly for

21:30.656 --> 21:32.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the State Department.

21:32.424 --> 21:37.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And leaders around the world are
having trouble
figuring out who they should
listen to.

21:37.563 --> 21:42.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Should they listen to the State
Department
and Rex Tillerson, who is very
straight?

21:42.568 --> 21:45.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's sort of a traditional
Republican.

21:45.437 --> 21:53.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's trying to keep alliances
and ties across
the world to our various allies,
particularly

21:53.612 --> 21:54.980 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Mexico.

21:55.014 --> 22:00.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or should they listen to the
more bombastic
statements from Trump?

22:00.386 --> 22:04.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tillerson was in Europe last
week trying to
calm everything down.

22:04.223 --> 22:09.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So was Mike Pence, saying that
we value NATO,
we value E.U.

22:09.428 --> 22:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But those are not messages that
President
Trump has said.

22:13.599 --> 22:15.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's insulted the E.U.

22:15.801 --> 22:16.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's insulted NATO.

22:16.936 --> 22:19.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the same thing is going on
in Mexico right
now.

22:19.371 --> 22:27.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, just today, as you
played, the president
had talked to a bunch of CEOs in
a roundtable,

22:27.513 --> 22:32.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and he mentioned Mexico five or
six different
times, suggesting that Mexico
has really been

22:32.785 --> 22:38.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stealing jobs from the United
States, has
this $70 billion trade surplus,
and that that

22:38.424 --> 22:40.159 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has to stop.

22:40.192 --> 22:44.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he sort of said, look, I
want to have
good relations with Mexico, but,
if we don't,

22:44.530 --> 22:46.465 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we don't.

22:46.498 --> 22:53.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that gives, obviously,
some very difficult
times for the diplomats here,
who are trying

22:53.505 --> 23:00.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to certainly change some things
about immigration
and enforcement with the
Mexicans, but keeping

23:00.179 --> 23:05.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what has been a vital alliance
with the Mexicans,
because the Mexicans, of course,
there is

23:05.985 --> 23:10.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not now any immigration of
Mexicans in the
United States.

23:10.489 --> 23:13.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Most of the immigration is from
Central America.

23:13.659 --> 23:18.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Mexicans are crucial
allies in slowing
that immigration.

23:18.297 --> 23:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yeganeh
Torbati, we were
just saying you have been
covering the State

23:21.200 --> 23:22.735 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Department.

23:22.768 --> 23:25.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there haven't been any daily
press briefings
since Mr. Tillerson took office.

23:25.871 --> 23:31.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is also, in some ways, the
opposite of
the personality of John Kerry,
who put himself

23:31.110 --> 23:33.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the middle of everything, was
taking questions
all the time.

23:33.946 --> 23:35.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEGANEH TORBATI, Reuters: Right.

23:35.414 --> 23:38.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, Secretary Tillerson
comes from a very
different background.

23:38.150 --> 23:42.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He comes from a private sector
background
and then, in particular, from
ExxonMobil,

23:42.988 --> 23:46.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where they really weren't
well-known for their
public engagement or their
engagement with

23:46.892 --> 23:48.694 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the press.

23:48.727 --> 23:51.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, just as you said, there
hasn't been a
State Department press briefing
since January

23:51.597 --> 23:55.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
19, the last full day of
President Obama's
presidency.

23:55.701 --> 24:01.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that has taken away a
megaphone that the
State Department traditionally
has to speak

24:01.307 --> 24:05.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on issues of international
importance, not
only to put their own views out
there, but

24:05.844 --> 24:08.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
also to respond to other
countries.

24:08.213 --> 24:11.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that briefing is not just
useful for reporters
like myself.

24:11.850 --> 24:17.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's also looked to very closely
by countries
around the world, both allies
and adversaries,

24:17.690 --> 24:23.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for clues on, what is the U.S.
policy towards
Israeli settlements, towards the
arrests of

24:23.896 --> 24:28.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
journalists by Turkey, for
example, and other
things that may happen around
the world?

24:29.001 --> 24:32.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's also looked to within
the State Department.

24:32.371 --> 24:37.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Preparing the different bureaus
for that press
briefing, sending up talking
points, is part

24:37.209 --> 24:40.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of sometimes the policy process
itself.

24:40.045 --> 24:44.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And without that daily kind of
organizing
structure, there is a little bit
of a sense

24:44.316 --> 24:48.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of loss right now at the State
Department
within those kind of lower ranks
and within

24:48.053 --> 24:49.855 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the bureaus.

24:49.888 --> 24:52.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Gardiner
Harris, today,
we heard the Mexican leaders
say, we're willing

24:52.291 --> 24:56.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to talk about immigration, but
we also want
to talk about trade and
security.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why did they want to lump those
in?

24:57.996 --> 25:00.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GARDINER HARRIS: Well, exactly.

25:00.265 --> 25:04.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, for the Mexicans, of
course, there's
a lot of issues that happen at
the border,

25:04.470 --> 25:08.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not just issues that are of
concern to the
United States, but are issues
that are of

25:08.340 --> 25:10.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
concern to Mexico.

25:10.175 --> 25:13.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For instance, there is a huge
amount of guns
that come from the United States
into Mexico.

25:13.345 --> 25:18.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a lot of bulk cash that
comes from
the United States into Mexico
that feeds the

25:18.717 --> 25:21.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
narco-trafficking gangs in
Mexico.

25:21.687 --> 25:28.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Mexico, of course, wants to
expand the
list of things to talk about
because this

25:28.427 --> 25:30.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is a two-way relationship.

25:30.195 --> 25:35.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for the Mexicans, they want
to help the
United States in the issues that
the United

25:35.434 --> 25:39.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States is worried about, but
only if they
have a little bit of help, too.

25:39.838 --> 25:44.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, Mexico, at this
point, has
largely been quiet.

25:44.076 --> 25:48.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have taken a lot of bombast
from the
United States.

25:48.380 --> 25:53.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president here, President
Pena Nieto,
has not been popular because he
has not really

25:53.786 --> 25:55.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
spat back at Trump.

25:55.487 --> 25:57.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the Mexicans have a lot of
levers here.

25:57.723 --> 26:01.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are the largest buyers, for
instance,
of corn in the United States.

26:01.627 --> 26:06.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are the largest buyers of a
huge number
of other agricultural products
from the United

26:07.032 --> 26:08.801 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

26:08.834 --> 26:13.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if things go south in this
relationship
-- it has gone south
tremendously over the

26:13.672 --> 26:14.640 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last month.

26:14.673 --> 26:16.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

26:16.542 --> 26:19.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARDINER HARRIS: If it gets
really worse,
the Mexicans can make things
hurt in the United

26:19.478 --> 26:23.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States in places where the
United States really
doesn't want to have it go bad.

26:23.649 --> 26:27.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yeganeh
Torbati, there has
been this narrative, fair or
unfair, that

26:27.486 --> 26:31.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the State Department has been
somewhat sidelined
in the major decision processes
that have

26:31.623 --> 26:35.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
already faced the Trump
administration and
perhaps, in certain times, they
have not even

26:35.360 --> 26:38.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been consulted before executive
orders and
so forth are rolled out.

26:38.831 --> 26:42.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YEGANEH TORBATI: I think that we
want to be
cautious.

26:42.100 --> 26:45.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rex Tillerson has been on the
job for about
three weeks now.

26:45.337 --> 26:47.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Things are -- he's still sort of
getting his
bearings.

26:48.006 --> 26:52.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's true that we have a
number of data
points that suggest that there
isn't lot of

26:53.011 --> 26:54.546 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
consultation.

26:54.580 --> 26:57.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, the State Department,
Rex Tillerson's
aides would push back on that.

26:57.649 --> 27:00.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say he's in touch with
President Trump
several times a day.

27:00.385 --> 27:04.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we know, from our reporting
and from others'
reporting, that he wasn't
consulted on any

27:04.957 --> 27:10.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of change to the White
House language
regarding U.S. support for the
two-state solution,

27:10.395 --> 27:11.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which happened last week.

27:11.697 --> 27:13.499 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That was a surprise to him.

27:13.532 --> 27:18.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we don't know if that is
deliberate, or
was it just sort of a result of
the chaos

27:18.370 --> 27:21.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that seems to be evident at the
White House
right now?

27:21.273 --> 27:24.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Yeganeh Torbati
from Reuters, Gardiner Harris
from The New

27:24.042 --> 27:26.879 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
York Times, thank you both.

27:26.912 --> 27:35.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEGANEH TORBATI: Thank you.

27:35.387 --> 27:43.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As we saw
earlier, President
Trump's top advisers presented a
picture of

27:43.562 --> 27:49.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unity at the annual Conservative
Political
Action Conference, or CPAC, in
Maryland today.

27:49.701 --> 27:54.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump's chief strategist,
Steve Bannon,
and his chief of staff, Reince
Priebus, dismissed

27:55.007 --> 28:00.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the notion of any clashing
ideologies within
the president's inner circle.

28:00.112 --> 28:05.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To discuss, we are joined by
former NPR CEO
Ken Stern.

28:05.083 --> 28:08.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He profiled Steve Bannon for
"Vanity Fair."

28:08.720 --> 28:13.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Phil Rucker, he's White
House bureau chief
for The Washington Post.

28:13.191 --> 28:14.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the "NewsHour."

28:14.960 --> 28:17.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm going to start with you, Ken
Stern.

28:17.129 --> 28:20.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fill out -- since you have
written about him,
fill out the picture of who
Steve Bannon is

28:21.033 --> 28:22.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and especially what does he
believe?

28:22.901 --> 28:27.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEN STERN, Former CEO, NPR: So,
Steve -- just
little bit of background about
Steve Bannon.

28:27.205 --> 28:33.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was a Goldman Sachs banker,
got wealthy
doing media deals.

28:33.612 --> 28:39.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Got into conservative media
doing documentaries
and met Andrew Breitbart, became
sort of friend

28:39.151 --> 28:40.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and counsel to him.

28:40.285 --> 28:43.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then, when Andrew died, he
took over Breitbart.

28:43.789 --> 28:45.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he transformed Breitbart.

28:45.591 --> 28:50.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When Andrew Breitbart ran it, it
was a site
that made a lot of noise,
attacked a lot of

28:50.729 --> 28:56.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people in what he -- what Andrew
Breitbart
called the complex, the
Democratic Hollywood

28:56.068 --> 28:57.035 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
activists.

28:57.069 --> 28:58.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

28:58.870 --> 29:04.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEN STERN: And then -- but Steve
Bannon turned
it into a -- really a political
movement,

29:04.743 --> 29:09.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a populist, nationalist
political movement
that I think Donald Trump
eventually rode

29:09.548 --> 29:11.216 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to power.

29:11.249 --> 29:13.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Phil Rucker,
as somebody
who is covering the White House,
now, how

29:13.385 --> 29:18.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much of that nationalist,
populist movement
has Steve Bannon brought to the
White House?

29:18.156 --> 29:20.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PHILIP RUCKER, The Washington
Post: All of
it.

29:20.826 --> 29:26.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can point to many of the
acts that President
Trump has taken in his first
month in office,

29:26.632 --> 29:29.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and it's that agenda, it's that
ideology.

29:29.368 --> 29:31.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's not so much that Bannon
is a puppeteer
here.

29:32.004 --> 29:36.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's more that Bannon
and Trump are
soul mates ideologically.

29:36.341 --> 29:40.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They both have the same views,
the same beliefs
about this sort of populism and
nationalism

29:40.979 --> 29:46.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and upending the kind of world
institutions
and structures that we have
become accustomed

29:46.551 --> 29:49.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to in the post-World War II era.

29:49.254 --> 29:54.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you see it on domestic
policy, on trade,
on economic moves, and also
certainly in the

29:54.559 --> 29:55.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
foreign policy world.

29:55.927 --> 29:58.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ken Stern, so
spell it out
for us.

29:58.930 --> 30:02.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, we heard Steve Bannon use
the term
economic nationalism.

30:02.367 --> 30:06.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He talked at one point about the
deconstruction
of the administrative state.

30:06.738 --> 30:08.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is he saying he wants to
do?

30:08.507 --> 30:14.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEN STERN: I think he wants to
change the
neo-liberal world order away
from free trade,

30:14.646 --> 30:17.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
away from open borders.

30:17.182 --> 30:19.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's America first.

30:19.084 --> 30:25.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is a philosophy built on the
notion that
virtue lies with the people, and
the establishment

30:25.290 --> 30:28.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has stabbed the people in the
back.

30:28.460 --> 30:30.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he wants to change that
world.

30:30.395 --> 30:32.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're saying,
yes, Phil Rucker.

30:32.631 --> 30:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PHILIP RUCKER: That's exactly
right.

30:34.733 --> 30:36.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it's interesting the
language that Bannon
used.

30:36.802 --> 30:40.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are not terms that we
often hear in
the political mainstream.

30:40.739 --> 30:46.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, some of the words
like globalist,
corporatist are terms you hear
on the political

30:46.111 --> 30:48.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
left, like the Bernie Sanders
campaign.

30:48.847 --> 30:52.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this is a really different
kind of movement
here.

30:52.250 --> 30:55.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's not traditional
Republicanism.

30:55.120 --> 31:00.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's nationalism, it's populism,
it's changing
the structures and the way
things work politically

31:00.425 --> 31:03.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and economically in the world
and here at
home.

31:03.662 --> 31:07.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Phil Rucker,
staying with you,
they did, as we were reporting
earlier, try

31:07.999 --> 31:09.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to paint a portrait of unity
today.

31:09.835 --> 31:11.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PHILIP RUCKER: That's right.

31:11.636 --> 31:14.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You would think
that Reince
Priebus and Steve Bannon were
the dearest

31:14.072 --> 31:16.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
friends from way back.

31:16.108 --> 31:19.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What has it really been like
inside the White
House with them?

31:19.244 --> 31:21.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PHILIP RUCKER: Well, it's
changed a little
bit.

31:21.780 --> 31:25.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think early on in the White
House, there
were these competing power
structures that

31:25.751 --> 31:31.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump set up on
purpose, Bannon
as chief strategist, Reince
Priebus as chief

31:31.556 --> 31:33.358 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of staff.

31:33.391 --> 31:37.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we were getting reports of
some tension,
not only between them, but among
their allies

31:37.529 --> 31:39.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
within the administration.

31:39.231 --> 31:41.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that seems to have cooled
off a bit.

31:41.066 --> 31:44.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a point a couple of
weeks in where
President Trump told all of his
aides in the

31:44.770 --> 31:49.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Oval Office, look, Reince
Priebus is in charge,
he is the chief of staff, the
process runs

31:49.341 --> 31:50.375 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
through him.

31:50.408 --> 31:52.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think Bannon has adapted
to that.

31:52.310 --> 31:57.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Bannon is more the ideas
guy, the strategist,
the person kind of coming up
with the grand

31:57.382 --> 32:02.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plan, whereas Reince Priebus is
the one implementing
it and orchestrating the process
and dealing

32:02.254 --> 32:05.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with kind of the hour-to-hour,
day-by-day
activities of the White House.

32:05.891 --> 32:10.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ken Stern, so
based on what
you know about Steve Bannon, how
do you see

32:10.829 --> 32:13.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him operating in this White
House?

32:13.198 --> 32:18.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because, as we heard Phil Rucker
say, he and
the president see eye to eye on
a lot.

32:18.537 --> 32:20.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, how does he make his
influence felt?

32:20.205 --> 32:22.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEN STERN: Well, I tend to think
-- so, I
agree with Phil.

32:22.574 --> 32:29.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I tend to think of Bannon as the
chief ideologist
of the White House, the ideas
guy, the guy

32:29.214 --> 32:30.982 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who is a political philosopher.

32:31.016 --> 32:34.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You even heard it today, the way
they talked.

32:34.486 --> 32:37.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Bannon talked about
deconstructing the
administrative
state.

32:37.689 --> 32:41.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Priebus talked about two-for-one
exchanges
of regulations.

32:41.626 --> 32:44.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Bannon is the big idea guy.

32:44.696 --> 32:46.464 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Priebus is the tactician.

32:46.498 --> 32:49.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But does that
mean that Reince
Priebus is going to be prepared
to go along

32:49.501 --> 32:53.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with all this agenda that Steve
Bannon espouses?

32:53.271 --> 32:56.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KEN STERN: I think this is very
strange bedfellows.

32:56.908 --> 32:58.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know what they say about
politics.

32:58.777 --> 33:03.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But if you went back to
Breitbart, and during
the early part of the election,
before Bannon

33:03.682 --> 33:08.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
joined the campaign, public
enemy number one
for Breitbart is the Republican
establishment.

33:08.286 --> 33:14.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They ran Paul -- they supported
Paul Nehlen
against Speaker Ryan.

33:14.292 --> 33:18.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't like people -- the
things that
Reince Priebus stands for.

33:18.730 --> 33:20.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it's a very odd collection.

33:20.832 --> 33:23.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they may -- they seem
genuinely to get
along.

33:23.568 --> 33:25.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They may be just good actors.

33:25.503 --> 33:28.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But there has got to be
long-term tension
between the establishment and
the anti-establishment.

33:28.807 --> 33:32.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is your
sense of that,
Phil Rucker?

33:32.677 --> 33:38.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You are saying that they seem to
be working
together better in the last few
weeks, but

33:38.750 --> 33:44.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what is the -- is there a fear,
is there a
concern about Bannon having too
much influence

33:44.489 --> 33:46.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over the president?

33:46.157 --> 33:48.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How does the rest of the White
House staff
read him?

33:48.460 --> 33:52.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHILIP RUCKER: You know, there
is some concern
about that, but people have to
remember, it's

33:52.597 --> 33:53.565 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not just Bannon.

33:53.598 --> 33:56.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, Bannon is espousing
Trump's views.

33:56.635 --> 34:00.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So if you're going to war with
Bannon, you're
going to war with the president,
too.

34:00.372 --> 34:04.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the more traditional
Republicans
in the White House, even if they
have been

34:04.075 --> 34:08.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
schooled to think differently
about these
issues ideologically, and even
if they personally

34:08.914 --> 34:12.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
might feel something different,
this is Trump's
belief.

34:12.250 --> 34:13.218 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's his agenda.

34:13.251 --> 34:14.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's his world view.

34:14.586 --> 34:17.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the things that he is
trying to implement
as president.

34:17.956 --> 34:21.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Bannon is guiding him and
leading him
in that direction.

34:21.192 --> 34:25.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the other staffers have to
kind of go
along, or get lost, if you will.

34:25.263 --> 34:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that sounds
like the makings
of a tense situation, Ken Stern.

34:28.366 --> 34:29.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KEN STERN: It does.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.269 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It really does.

34:31.303 --> 34:35.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's
certainly something
that has all our attention right
now.

34:35.807 --> 34:39.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ken Stern, Phil Rucker, we thank
you both.

34:39.444 --> 34:43.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PHILIP RUCKER: Thank you.

34:43.915 --> 34:49.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEN STERN: Thank you, Judy.

34:49.487 --> 34:52.424 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

34:52.457 --> 34:56.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": an
Oscar-nominated
documentary on the Syrians who
risk their

34:56.995 --> 35:02.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
own lives to save others in the
country's
civil war; and a daughter's
appreciation of

35:02.867 --> 35:06.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
her mother's life work years
after her death.

35:06.104 --> 35:12.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: the second of a
two-part look at
the declining life expectancy
for some middle-aged

35:12.410 --> 35:14.245 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
white Americans.

35:14.279 --> 35:18.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Last week, economics
correspondent Paul Solman
examined the role prescription
painkillers

35:18.049 --> 35:20.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and alcohol may play in the
trend.

35:20.919 --> 35:24.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, he explores how the
economy and the
job market may be involved.

35:24.422 --> 35:28.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Its part of our weekly series
Making Sense,
which airs Thursdays.

35:28.927 --> 35:36.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The Hardee's in
Maysville, Kentucky,
a popular hangout for the senior
set.

35:36.267 --> 35:40.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Martin Sauer used to work for
the sheriff's
department, where he says he saw
his share

35:40.472 --> 35:45.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Saturday night drunks, but
nothing like
the current opioid drug
epidemic.

35:45.510 --> 35:48.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SAUER, Kentucky: People
get hooked
on it and can't get off of it,
or don't want

35:48.346 --> 35:52.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to, causing a lot of younger
generation to
lose their lives.

35:52.584 --> 35:57.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And by younger
generation, Sauer
means his middle-aged neighbors,
who, as we

35:57.288 --> 36:03.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
reported last week, are
experiencing a stunning
rise in premature deaths due to
alcoholism,

36:03.361 --> 36:05.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
suicide and drug abuse.

36:05.530 --> 36:07.332 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
But why?

36:07.365 --> 36:12.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGUS DEATON, Economist: The
health crisis
here is particularly among white
working-class

36:12.337 --> 36:15.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or white people with a high
school and no
more.

36:15.240 --> 36:20.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For those people, the economy's
been very
hard for a very long time.

36:20.278 --> 36:24.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Predictably, Angus
Deaton and
Anne Case, economists who have
documented

36:24.382 --> 36:29.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the dramatic decrease in life
expectancy,
say an obvious place to look for
a cause is

36:29.687 --> 36:31.322 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the economy.

36:31.356 --> 36:33.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE CASE, Economist: It used to
be, with
a high school degree, you could
get a job,

36:33.458 --> 36:36.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that actually could provide for
your family.

36:36.428 --> 36:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the disappearance of those
may lead people
to feel a lot more stressed.

36:41.666 --> 36:49.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Indeed, in the
period covered
by their study, 1999-2014,
inflation-adjusted

36:49.140 --> 36:55.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
income for households headed by
a high school
graduate fell by 19 percent.

36:55.847 --> 37:02.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well away from the Ivory Tower,
on the ground
in Maysville, Wayne Pendleton
has lived the

37:02.454 --> 37:04.189 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
change.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WAYNE PENDLETON, Kentucky:
Maysville, when
we moved here, was a pretty well
flourishing

37:05.256 --> 37:06.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
little town right here.

37:07.025 --> 37:09.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we have lived here, what, 17
years?

37:09.461 --> 37:12.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you can just name the stuff
that's left
here.

37:12.330 --> 37:16.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can't take a job away from a
guy 55 years
old and expect him to start all
over again.

37:16.768 --> 37:20.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERMAN SAUNDERS, Kentucky: Even
at my age,
it's depressing if you're not
trying to do

37:20.839 --> 37:22.373 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
something.

37:22.407 --> 37:25.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Despite four heart
attacks, Sherman
Saunders still wants to work.

37:25.810 --> 37:28.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERMAN SAUNDERS: That's not
someone else's
responsibility to take care of
the family.

37:28.713 --> 37:30.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's supposed to be yours.

37:30.548 --> 37:34.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have to go to work to do
that yourself.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCY CONNER, Nurse: Most of the
men aren't
working.

37:36.087 --> 37:39.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Marcy Conner, a
nurse specializing
in substance abuse, has a
close-up view of

37:39.224 --> 37:40.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the downward spiral.

37:40.358 --> 37:42.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCY CONNER: All of a sudden,
you lose your
job.

37:42.727 --> 37:45.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, here is a male with no
identity.

37:45.697 --> 37:46.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's not working.

37:46.698 --> 37:48.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's supposed to be a provider
for his family.

37:48.133 --> 37:50.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He can't even do that.

37:50.368 --> 37:57.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So that low self-worth, along
with that hopelessness
feeling, we start seeing
tremendous depression.

37:57.408 --> 38:00.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, how do you relieve
depression?

38:00.145 --> 38:03.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can relieve it with drug
use, alcohol
use, or suicide.

38:03.915 --> 38:06.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Conner's own
husband died of
alcohol poisoning.

38:06.718 --> 38:11.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCY CONNER: Poured alcohol
down his feeding
tube until he died.

38:11.089 --> 38:14.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The husband of best
friend Becky
Manning also killed himself.

38:14.692 --> 38:17.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BECKY MANNING, Widow: He blew
his head off.

38:17.295 --> 38:21.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Joseph Manning had
been a truck
driver for 30 years.

38:21.332 --> 38:27.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BECKY MANNING: And then he
retired at 55,
which then gave him nothing to
do.

38:27.839 --> 38:30.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Then he started getting
depressed.

38:30.875 --> 38:38.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then we would go to
different doctors,
and then they would just try
different drugs.

38:38.783 --> 38:42.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those never worked, because
they caused
side effects, which made him
feel worse about

38:43.021 --> 38:43.988 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
himself.

38:44.022 --> 38:45.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Right, weight gain?

38:45.089 --> 38:47.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BECKY MANNING: Yes, he gained
weight.

38:47.125 --> 38:48.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Libido?

38:48.126 --> 38:51.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BECKY MANNING: Absolutely, where
I'm worthless.

38:51.095 --> 38:53.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I can't be here for my wife, you
know?

38:53.665 --> 38:59.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So when you hear
about the end
of work, the jobs, like truck
driving jobs...

38:59.737 --> 39:00.705 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BECKY MANNING: Right.

39:00.738 --> 39:01.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: ... which will be
replaced by...

39:01.739 --> 39:02.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECKY MANNING: Absolutely.

39:02.740 --> 39:04.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: ... self driving
cars, you think?

39:04.075 --> 39:06.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BECKY MANNING: What are these
men going to
do?

39:06.311 --> 39:08.179 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

39:08.213 --> 39:12.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCY CONNER: In this next
generation, I think
you're going to see the death
rate continue

39:12.417 --> 39:14.319 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to climb.

39:14.352 --> 39:19.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Local doctor Craig
Denham buys
into the economic hypothesis.

39:19.290 --> 39:20.758 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

39:20.792 --> 39:23.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM CRAIG DENHAM, Family
Physician: Economics
is a major component.

39:23.094 --> 39:24.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Job availability is a major
component.

39:24.862 --> 39:27.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, case closed.

39:27.699 --> 39:33.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Economics explains the epidemic
of suicide
and overdose deaths ravaging
America's white

39:33.137 --> 39:34.105 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
working-class.

39:34.138 --> 39:36.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Not so fast, say Case and
Deaton.

39:36.741 --> 39:43.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE CASE: Because Europeans
have suffered
too in this -- the jobs leaving
the country,

39:43.181 --> 39:45.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but we don't see them killing
themselves.

39:45.250 --> 39:47.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANGUS DEATON: Yes, you know,
Spain suffered.

39:47.185 --> 39:51.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The unemployment rate went from
5 percent
to like 25 percent.

39:52.023 --> 39:53.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And the health improved.

39:53.291 --> 39:55.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And what about
working-class
black Americans?

39:55.460 --> 40:00.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE CASE: African-Americans'
rates of death
from suicide, drug overdose and
alcohol have

40:00.498 --> 40:01.499 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been flat.

40:01.532 --> 40:03.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They have not risen.

40:03.368 --> 40:06.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARRICK HAMILTON, Economist:
It's not as if
stress is something new to the
black American

40:06.404 --> 40:07.572 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
population.

40:07.605 --> 40:08.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have been dealing with stress
for quite
a long time.

40:08.906 --> 40:10.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Economist Darrick
Hamilton.

40:10.675 --> 40:13.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARRICK HAMILTON: The impact of
stress is
not new, so that's why you're
probably not

40:13.811 --> 40:17.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seeing an uptick the way it is
for whites.

40:17.048 --> 40:19.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're used to struggle,
unfortunately.

40:19.717 --> 40:25.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGUS DEATON: And also there's
this argument
on the other side that whites
have been ahead

40:25.323 --> 40:30.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for so long that, when they see
their world
coming apart, even though
they're still doing

40:30.662 --> 40:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much better than blacks, then
they see equalization
as oppression.

40:34.899 --> 40:40.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT FRANK, Economist: The
group that they
studied is one that has, by
almost every concrete

40:40.972 --> 40:43.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
measure, been falling behind in
recent decades.

40:43.775 --> 40:48.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Economist Bob Frank
has devoted
much of his career to the study
of inequality.

40:48.880 --> 40:52.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROBERT FRANK: Life is graded on
the curve.

40:52.150 --> 40:54.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not how well you do in
absolute terms.

40:54.352 --> 40:57.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's how well you do relative to
your competitors.

40:57.322 --> 40:59.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Or relative to your
own past.

40:59.357 --> 41:05.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT FRANK: And if you're in a
chronic loser
position, I think that's a
position that just

41:05.229 --> 41:07.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wears people down eventually.

41:07.131 --> 41:13.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Psychologically and
physiologically,
as low status is linked to
decreased serotonin

41:13.504 --> 41:19.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the brain, which can cause
dysphoria, a
state of intense unease and
distress.

41:19.711 --> 41:25.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT FRANK: If you're exposed
to having
low status in a chronic way and
experiencing

41:25.483 --> 41:31.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
protracted feelings of
dysphoria, it's not
surprising that many people
would turn to

41:31.489 --> 41:35.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drink and drugs as a way to
alleviate such
feelings.

41:35.426 --> 41:37.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In fact, according
to a recent
study by

41:37.862 --> 41:42.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
economist Alan Krueger,
middle-aged men who
have dropped out of the labor
force report

41:43.000 --> 41:49.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
notably low levels of emotional
well-being,
and more than half take pain
medication every

41:49.741 --> 41:51.476 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
day.

41:51.509 --> 41:55.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGUS DEATON: And so, if you
suffer enough,
and your kids are not doing very
well, and

41:55.279 --> 42:02.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the world's going to hell in a
handbasket,
then suicide, either directly or
through painkillers

42:02.553 --> 42:07.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or alcohol, might seem like a
not completely
crazy thing to do.

42:07.925 --> 42:12.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: There is, we should
acknowledge,
another take on the rise in
so-called deaths

42:12.697 --> 42:14.532 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of despair.

42:14.565 --> 42:18.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTHONY FLANNERY, Kentucky: I
don't buy into
the everything fell apart, so
now I just -- I

42:18.202 --> 42:19.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can't do nothing.

42:19.203 --> 42:21.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I still believe in the American
dream.

42:21.105 --> 42:24.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Anthony Flannery,
who works long
hours in health care, and on
funding his dream

42:24.809 --> 42:28.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of making music full-time,
doesn't dispute
the data.

42:28.813 --> 42:32.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He just doesn't think they
provide an excuse
or even much of an explanation.

42:32.817 --> 42:37.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTHONY FLANNERY: So people that
lay around
and give up, I don't relate to
it.

42:37.054 --> 42:41.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's like, OK, I can understand
getting knocked
down, and now you, oh, I don't
know what to

42:41.526 --> 42:42.460 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do.

42:42.493 --> 42:43.461 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm overwhelmed.

42:43.494 --> 42:44.462 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I get that.

42:44.495 --> 42:46.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have been there countless
times.

42:46.297 --> 42:50.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you have to get focused,
pick yourself
up, find a direction, and make
it happen in

42:50.134 --> 42:51.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
your life and for your family.

42:51.903 --> 42:57.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But if the problem
is a decline
in moral fiber, what would
explain that?

42:57.208 --> 43:02.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Too easy access to remedies that
seem to cure
all problems, until they become
the problem

43:02.647 --> 43:10.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
themselves, or, longer term, the
deteriorating
economics of white working-age
America, relative

43:10.121 --> 43:13.024 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to any and all expectations?

43:13.057 --> 43:23.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"

Paul Solman, reporting from

JUDY WOODRUFF: Next month, the
Syrian civil
war will enter its sixth year.

43:35.713 --> 43:41.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The United Nations estimates
that more than
400,000 Syrians have been
killed, and more

43:42.019 --> 43:46.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than 10 million people have
either fled the
country or been displaced within
it since

43:46.757 --> 43:48.593 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the war began.

43:48.626 --> 43:54.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A documentary that's up for an
Oscar on Sunday
attempts to put a human face on
that conflict.

43:54.165 --> 43:58.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story for
our series
Beyond the Red Carpet.

43:58.769 --> 44:06.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: They are images
at once shocking
and strangely familiar, the
daily destruction

44:06.043 --> 44:10.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Syria's civil war.

44:10.348 --> 44:15.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the Oscar-nominated
documentary short
"The White Helmets" aims to get
beyond the

44:15.052 --> 44:18.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
numbness of this conflict now
dragging into
its sixth year.

44:18.623 --> 44:21.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ORLANDO VON EINSIEDEL, Director,
"The White
Helmets": The Syria conflict has
been going

44:21.225 --> 44:23.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
on for so long, it's so
upsetting, and people
feel so powerless.

44:23.961 --> 44:27.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the story of the White
Helmets is a story
of hope.

44:27.465 --> 44:32.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Director Orlando
Von Einsiedel
and producer Joanna Natasegara
are best known

44:32.937 --> 44:39.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for "Virunga," their
Oscar-nominated 2014
documentary about a team of
Congolese National

44:39.377 --> 44:42.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Park guards who protect gorillas
from poachers.

44:42.980 --> 44:48.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In "The White Helmets," they
profile a volunteer
group of first-responders
working to rescue

44:48.185 --> 44:55.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
victims of the ongoing assault
on cities like
Aleppo, a group that's been
featured on this

44:55.159 --> 44:56.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
news program and others.

44:57.028 --> 45:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, since 2013, the White
Helmets, whose official
name is the Syrian Civil
Defense, has, by

45:02.934 --> 45:09.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some estimates, saved 70,000
people.

45:09.173 --> 45:18.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ORLANDO VON EINSIEDEL: What we
found most
extraordinary was who the rescue
workers were,

45:18.182 --> 45:24.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this group of everyday Syrian
civilians who
had decided not to pick up a
gun, had decided

45:24.922 --> 45:30.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not to leave Syria, and instead
had decided
to stay and every day risk their
lives to

45:30.461 --> 45:32.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
save their fellow citizens.

45:32.630 --> 45:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're builders, tailors,
bakers, just
normal people.

45:36.534 --> 45:37.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're truly real-life heroes.

45:38.002 --> 45:39.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What was it like
to meet them?

45:39.804 --> 45:42.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOANNA NATASEGARA, Producer,
"The White Helmets":
It was really nerve-racking at
first.

45:42.073 --> 45:47.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We didn't know if they would
live up to this
incredible story we that we
thought we had

45:47.111 --> 45:48.913 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
found.

45:48.946 --> 45:52.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, actually, what we found was
people that
were even more heroic and
inspiring than we

45:52.183 --> 45:53.918 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
had thought.

45:53.951 --> 45:58.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There is this
moment in which
a baby is rescued from the
rubble, which is

45:58.422 --> 45:59.890 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
just incredible.

45:59.924 --> 46:10.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's almost -- you couldn't
believe you're
watching what you're seeing.

46:10.034 --> 46:18.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's almost -- you couldn't
believe you're
watching what you're seeing.

46:18.509 --> 46:29.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORLANDO VON EINSIEDEL: Yes.

46:29.754 --> 46:37.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's -- the tragedy is, scenes
like that are
playing out every day inside
Syria.

46:37.194 --> 46:43.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this particular rescue, the
very fact
that it's been documented, it
acts as a moment

46:43.634 --> 46:47.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of hope and something to rally
around that,
really, there is still hope in
Syria and there

46:48.005 --> 46:50.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are very brave people doing
incredible work.

46:50.408 --> 46:54.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For safety
reasons, interviews
and some of the filming were
done in Turkey,

46:54.945 --> 46:57.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
near the border and away from
the immediate
danger.

46:57.982 --> 47:00.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the filmmakers found a way
to get a close-up
view.

47:00.918 --> 47:07.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOANNA NATASEGARA: Usually, in
our work, we
would be on site in a location
even in a war

47:07.058 --> 47:08.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
zone filming ourselves.

47:08.859 --> 47:12.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in this situation, the White
Helmets themselves
said: Please don't, please don't
do that,

47:12.830 --> 47:16.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because, actually, you put our
teams at greater
risk as well.

47:16.967 --> 47:19.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, luckily, we didn't need to.

47:19.103 --> 47:24.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We found -- we were very lucky
to find a young
White Helmet called Khaled
Khateeb whose work

47:24.809 --> 47:27.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in photography had been used by
The New York
Times.

47:27.611 --> 47:31.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we brought him out to the
Turkish-Syrian
border, and we paired him with
our own cinematographer.

47:31.882 --> 47:36.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they worked together for
five weeks to
really -- you know, to learn a
common language.

47:36.954 --> 47:40.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Were there
surprises for you
in this process?

47:40.558 --> 47:43.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I assume you knew something
about it going
in, but...

47:43.961 --> 47:48.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ORLANDO VON EINSIEDEL: I think
we knew going
into this project just how --
the physical

47:48.833 --> 47:52.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stress and the physical violence
that the
White Helmets experience on a
daily basis.

47:52.770 --> 47:57.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we were really shocked by
the emotional
toll this work takes on them.

47:57.174 --> 48:01.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even inside Turkey, which is
relatively
safe, the guys at the end of the
training

48:01.879 --> 48:06.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every day, when they got their
phones and
they connected to Wi-Fi, they'd
suddenly get

48:06.484 --> 48:09.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this barrage of messages about
the day's bombings.

48:09.520 --> 48:13.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And they'd find out that
colleagues had been
killed or family members or
friends.

48:13.557 --> 48:15.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it was so shocking.

48:15.626 --> 48:19.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And yet, despite all of that,
they -- these
guys still have hope.

48:19.930 --> 48:30.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABU OMAR, White Helmet (through
translator):
I've learned many lessons from
baby Mahmoud.

48:30.040 --> 48:37.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Patience, persistence, hard
work, and never
to lose hope.

48:37.047 --> 48:42.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No matter what happens, they
will live.

48:42.486 --> 48:47.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, at the end
of the film,
one of the White Helmets says,
"Tomorrow will

48:47.925 --> 48:49.360 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be better."

48:49.393 --> 48:51.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is the situation for them
today?

48:51.462 --> 48:52.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOANNA NATASEGARA: Oh, gosh.

48:52.696 --> 48:55.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
®MD-BO /You know, they -- they
have all dispersed
now.

48:55.900 --> 49:00.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The teams from Eastern Aleppo
are obviously
no longer in Eastern Aleppo.

49:00.304 --> 49:02.039 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're a target for the regime.

49:02.072 --> 49:04.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Eastern Aleppo is now under
regime control.

49:04.575 --> 49:10.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they have gone on to join
White Helmet
centers in other areas of Syria
and are continuing

49:10.948 --> 49:12.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to do their work.

49:12.683 --> 49:15.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But who knows what is next for
the conflict?

49:15.753 --> 49:21.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We certainly hope for the best,
but things
aren't looking to improve any
time soon.

49:21.725 --> 49:26.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Some news since
our interview
last week: After initial fear
they wouldn't

49:26.230 --> 49:30.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be able to enter the U.S.
following the travel
ban, it looks like White Helmets
cameraman

49:31.001 --> 49:36.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Khaled Khateeb and the group's
leader, Raed
Saleh, will attend the Oscars
ceremony this

49:36.740 --> 49:37.942 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sunday.

49:37.975 --> 49:41.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you can stream "The White
Helmets" now
on Netflix.

49:41.345 --> 49:44.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jeffrey Brown
from Los Angeles.

49:44.315 --> 49:48.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

HARI SREENIVASAN: Now to our
Brief But Spectacular
series, where we ask people to
describe their

50:15.279 --> 50:17.248 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
passions.

50:17.281 --> 50:21.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kathleen Collins was one of the
first African-American
women to direct a feature film,
"Losing Ground."

50:21.785 --> 50:26.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Having passed away from cancer
in 1988, she
is remembered tonight by her
daughter, Nina

50:26.056 --> 50:27.825 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Collins.

50:27.858 --> 50:31.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nearly 30 years after her death,
Collins has
restored her mother's work,
including a book

50:31.395 --> 50:35.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of her short stories, entitled
"Whatever Happened
To Interracial Love?"

50:35.366 --> 50:38.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NINA COLLINS, Daughter of
Kathleen Collins:
My mother was one of the first
black women,

50:38.202 --> 50:41.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the second black woman
to make a feature
film in America.

50:41.438 --> 50:43.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She wrote, produced, and
directed "Losing
Ground."

50:43.908 --> 50:45.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She made the film in 1982.

50:45.910 --> 50:50.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was before "The Cosby
Show," which, for
me, was the big time we really
saw black middle-class

50:50.080 --> 50:51.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Americans in popular culture.

50:51.882 --> 50:53.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Really, it had just not been
seen.

50:53.517 --> 51:02.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that was why the films
weren't released
in their time.

51:02.192 --> 51:08.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I turned 47 this year, and my
mother died
when she was 46.

51:08.666 --> 51:11.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And last year was a difficult,
complicated
year for me.

51:11.268 --> 51:12.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Her work was being released.

51:12.269 --> 51:15.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was the same age she was when
she died.

51:15.673 --> 51:20.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was really lucky to have a
mother who made
me feel like I could definitely
do anything.

51:20.811 --> 51:24.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She was enormously capable, but
it was also
hard.

51:24.114 --> 51:25.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think she was pretty
depressed.

51:25.582 --> 51:26.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She was always writing.

51:26.817 --> 51:29.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She was always in her room
typing and kind
of distracted.

51:29.920 --> 51:34.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She had first gotten cancer when
I was 11,
and then had a recurrence when I
was 15, and

51:34.124 --> 51:36.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then a third recurrence when I
was 18.

51:36.393 --> 51:38.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she kept all of that a
secret from me.

51:38.195 --> 51:40.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then I went off to study abroad
for a year.

51:40.597 --> 51:43.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I came home from Europe, and she
was very,
very sick.

51:43.567 --> 51:45.602 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And she died two weeks later.

51:45.636 --> 51:50.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the only thing that she was
explicit about
was that she wanted me to take
care of my

51:50.107 --> 51:51.842 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
brother.

51:51.875 --> 51:55.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was incredibly stressful, and
we had no
money, and I felt abandoned and
didn't know

51:55.346 --> 51:57.047 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what to do.

51:57.081 --> 51:59.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I collected all of her
writing that I
could find and her photographs
and copies

51:59.483 --> 52:02.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of everything, and put it in
this big trunk
that I found in our house.

52:02.319 --> 52:04.588 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I really couldn't go through it.

52:04.621 --> 52:06.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was just too painful.

52:06.490 --> 52:11.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, in my 30s, so, you
know, almost
20 years later, I was going
through a difficult

52:11.161 --> 52:18.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time in my own life and kind of
realized that
I hadn't looked at my history
enough.

52:18.168 --> 52:22.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I started looking through this
trunk and reading
her journals and her letters.

52:22.072 --> 52:27.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were screenplays and plays
and short
stories that I had never read
and an unfinished

52:27.745 --> 52:28.679 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
novel.

52:28.712 --> 52:30.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was a huge treasure trove of
material.

52:30.581 --> 52:34.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I had "Losing Ground" restored
really so that
it wouldn't be lost.

52:34.618 --> 52:37.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When the Lincoln Center
announced that they
wanted it for this festival, we
didn't expect

52:37.654 --> 52:39.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what happened to happen.

52:39.189 --> 52:40.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, suddenly, we started getting
all these
reviews.

52:40.824 --> 52:45.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I woke up to a "New Yorker"
review on my phone,
and I just couldn't stop crying.

52:45.262 --> 52:48.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it's very bittersweet.

52:48.132 --> 52:50.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's been dead now almost 30
years.

52:50.200 --> 52:54.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I can't imagine what she
would feel if
she knew all these things had
happened.

52:54.938 --> 52:57.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I feel like I'm championing my
mother.

52:57.174 --> 52:58.909 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm bringing her work to light.

52:58.942 --> 53:02.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm also working through my
own relationship
with her.

53:02.246 --> 53:08.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, as I get older, I'm
able to understand
better what she was going
through and to forgive

53:08.419 --> 53:12.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
her for some of the things that
I missed.

53:12.056 --> 53:16.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My name is Nina Collins, and
this is my Brief
But Spectacular take on my
mother.
