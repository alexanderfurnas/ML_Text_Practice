AND WE DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE IT, AND
PART OF THE REASON IS BECAUSE
PEOPLE WITH THIS DISEASE ARE

PEOPLE WITH THIS DISEASE ARE
JUDGED AND THEY'RE BLAMED, AND

DOESN'T EXIST WITH ANY OTHER
DISEASE.
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT.

50:09.669 --> 50:11.669
DISEASE.
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT.
PART OF THE REASON IS THAT WE

50:11.671 --> 50:13.941
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT.
PART OF THE REASON IS THAT WE
LOOK AT THIS, AND AS A CULTURE

50:13.943 --> 50:15.941
PART OF THE REASON IS THAT WE
LOOK AT THIS, AND AS A CULTURE
AND AS A SOCIETY, WE TREAT IT AS

LOOK AT THIS, AND AS A CULTURE
AND AS A SOCIETY, WE TREAT IT AS
A CRIMINAL PROBLEM.

AS IT'S A PROBLEM ABOUT MORALS.
THERE'S A STIGMA AROUND IT.
IN FACT, IT'S A HEALTH PROBLEM,

50:23.980 --> 50:25.945
THERE'S A STIGMA AROUND IT.
IN FACT, IT'S A HEALTH PROBLEM,
AND IT'S A HEALTH CRISIS GROOD

IN FACT, IT'S A HEALTH PROBLEM,
AND IT'S A HEALTH CRISIS GROOD
YOU TALK ABOUT THE APPROACH

YOU TALK ABOUT THE APPROACH
THAT'S NEEDED, THAT IT NEEDS TO

THAT'S NEEDED, THAT IT NEEDS TO
BE AN EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH,

50:32.391 --> 50:33.644
THAT'S NEEDED, THAT IT NEEDS TO
BE AN EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH,
AND SO MUCH OF WHAT WE'RE

BE AN EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH,
AND SO MUCH OF WHAT WE'RE
FAMILIAR WITH, PROGRAMS LIKE AA,

AND SO MUCH OF WHAT WE'RE
FAMILIAR WITH, PROGRAMS LIKE AA,

MANY OTHERS.

SOME ADDICTS BUT THEY DON'T HELP
MANY OTHERS.
>> ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS WITH

50:47.346 --> 50:49.141
MANY OTHERS.
>> ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS WITH
THE TREATMENT SYSTEM IS NOT THAT

50:49.143 --> 50:51.414
>> ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS WITH
THE TREATMENT SYSTEM IS NOT THAT
A.A. IS AVAILABLE AND PREVALENT.

50:51.416 --> 50:52.871
THE TREATMENT SYSTEM IS NOT THAT
A.A. IS AVAILABLE AND PREVALENT.
IT SAVES THE LIVES OF MANY

50:52.873 --> 50:53.210
A.A. IS AVAILABLE AND PREVALENT.
IT SAVES THE LIVES OF MANY
PEOPLE.

50:53.212 --> 50:54.770
IT SAVES THE LIVES OF MANY

AND EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT, AND
EVERYONE NEEDS DIFFERENT KINDS
OF TREATMENTS.

EVERYONE NEEDS DIFFERENT KINDS
OF TREATMENTS.
AND SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW IS SINCE

51:06.032 --> 51:07.793
OF TREATMENTS.
AND SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW IS SINCE
MOST OF THE REHABS IN AMERICA

51:07.795 --> 51:09.896
AND SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW IS SINCE
MOST OF THE REHABS IN AMERICA
ARE BASED ON THIS ONE PARADIGM,

THEY'RE KICKED OUT.
THEY GO BACK AND THEY RELAPSE.

THEY GO BACK AND THEY RELAPSE.
THEY HAVE THIS-- IT'S A

51:20.037 --> 51:20.645
THEY GO BACK AND THEY RELAPSE.
THEY HAVE THIS-- IT'S A
SELF-FULFILLING PROSSEE.

THEY HAVE THIS-- IT'S A
SELF-FULFILLING PROSSEE.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET WELL.

51:23.021 --> 51:24.783
SELF-FULFILLING PROSSEE.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET WELL.
THEY WON'T GET TREATED, THEY USE

51:24.785 --> 51:26.037
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET WELL.
THEY WON'T GET TREATED, THEY USE
MORE DRUGS, AND IT'S A CYCLE

THEY WON'T GET TREATED, THEY USE
MORE DRUGS, AND IT'S A CYCLE
THAT ENDS UP KILLING AS YOU SAID

MORE DRUGS, AND IT'S A CYCLE
THAT ENDS UP KILLING AS YOU SAID

IS NOT A MORAL FAILING OR A

51:36.993 --> 51:37.431
A COUPLE OF TIMES THAT ADDICTION
IS NOT A MORAL FAILING OR A
SHORTCOMING.

51:37.433 --> 51:38.415
IS NOT A MORAL FAILING OR A
SHORTCOMING.
THERE ARE REVIEWERS OF YOUR BOOK

51:38.417 --> 51:40.789

THERE ARE REVIEWERS OF YOUR BOOK
WHO SAY THAT YOU-- THAT-- THAT

51:40.791 --> 51:42.620
THERE ARE REVIEWERS OF YOUR BOOK
WHO SAY THAT YOU-- THAT-- THAT
THERE SHOULD BE SOME WEIGHT PUT

WHO SAY THAT YOU-- THAT-- THAT
THERE SHOULD BE SOME WEIGHT PUT
ON THIS ARGUMENT THAT PEOPLE

51:44.012 --> 51:45.265
THERE SHOULD BE SOME WEIGHT PUT
ON THIS ARGUMENT THAT PEOPLE
MAKE A CHOICE.

51:45.267 --> 51:47.503
ON THIS ARGUMENT THAT PEOPLE
MAKE A CHOICE.
WHEN THEY FIRST GO TURN TO

51:47.505 --> 51:50.420
MAKE A CHOICE.
WHEN THEY FIRST GO TURN TO
DRUGS, TURN TO ALCOHOL, THEY'RE

51:50.422 --> 51:51.810
WHEN THEY FIRST GO TURN TO
DRUGS, TURN TO ALCOHOL, THEY'RE
MAKING THAT CHOICE, AND,

MAKING THAT CHOICE, AND,
THEREFORE, THEY BEAR SOME

THEREFORE, THEY BEAR SOME
RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT'S

THEREFORE, THEY BEAR SOME
RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT'S
HAPPENED.

51:54.051 --> 51:55.236
RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT'S
HAPPENED.
>> I TOTALLY GET THAT.

51:55.238 --> 51:57.338
HAPPENED.
>> I TOTALLY GET THAT.
THE PROBLEM IS THAT IS THINK

51:57.340 --> 51:59.237
>> I TOTALLY GET THAT.
THE PROBLEM IS THAT IS THINK
ABOUT 10 KIDS WHO GO OUT AFTER

51:59.239 --> 52:00.763
THE PROBLEM IS THAT IS THINK
ABOUT 10 KIDS WHO GO OUT AFTER
SCHOOL AND THEY GO TO THE

52:00.765 --> 52:02.289
ABOUT 10 KIDS WHO GO OUT AFTER
SCHOOL AND THEY GO TO THE
PLAYGROUND, OR WHEREVER THEY GO,

52:02.291 --> 52:03.679
SCHOOL AND THEY GO TO THE
PLAYGROUND, OR WHEREVER THEY GO,
AND THEY ALL SMOKE A JOINT.

52:03.681 --> 52:05.409
PLAYGROUND, OR WHEREVER THEY GO,
AND THEY ALL SMOKE A JOINT.
ONE OF THOSE KIDS IS GOING TO

52:05.411 --> 52:06.223
AND THEY ALL SMOKE A JOINT.
ONE OF THOSE KIDS IS GOING TO
BECOME ADDICTED.

52:06.225 --> 52:08.020
ONE OF THOSE KIDS IS GOING TO
BECOME ADDICTED.
SO ALL OF THOSE KIDS MADE THAT

52:08.022 --> 52:08.360
BECOME ADDICTED.
SO ALL OF THOSE KIDS MADE THAT
CHOICE.

52:08.362 --> 52:10.088
SO ALL OF THOSE KIDS MADE THAT
CHOICE.
THAT ONE KID DID NOT MAKE THE

52:10.090 --> 52:11.377
CHOICE.
THAT ONE KID DID NOT MAKE THE
CHOICE TO BECOME ADDICTED.

52:11.379 --> 52:13.005
THAT ONE KID DID NOT MAKE THE
CHOICE TO BECOME ADDICTED.
THE REASON HE BECOMES ADDICTED

52:13.007 --> 52:15.073
CHOICE TO BECOME ADDICTED.
THE REASON HE BECOMES ADDICTED
IS BECAUSE HIS BRAIN IS

52:15.076 --> 52:15.515
THE REASON HE BECOMES ADDICTED
IS BECAUSE HIS BRAIN IS
DIFFERENT.

52:15.517 --> 52:17.007
IS BECAUSE HIS BRAIN IS
DIFFERENT.
HIS NEUROLOGICAL SYSTEM IS

52:17.009 --> 52:17.414
DIFFERENT.
HIS NEUROLOGICAL SYSTEM IS
DIFFERENT.

52:17.416 --> 52:18.770
HIS NEUROLOGICAL SYSTEM IS
DIFFERENT.
IT RESPONDS TO DRUGS, IT DOESN'T

52:18.772 --> 52:19.923
DIFFERENT.
IT RESPONDS TO DRUGS, IT DOESN'T
PROCESS THEM THE SAME AS

PROCESS THEM THE SAME AS
EVERYBODY ELSE.

52:20.570 --> 52:21.822
PROCESS THEM THE SAME AS
EVERYBODY ELSE.
SO THAT'S NOT A CHOICE.

52:21.824 --> 52:23.043
EVERYBODY ELSE.
SO THAT'S NOT A CHOICE.
AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM IS WE

52:23.045 --> 52:24.569
SO THAT'S NOT A CHOICE.
AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM IS WE
LOOK AT-- MANY OF US LOOK AT IT

52:24.571 --> 52:26.366
AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM IS WE
LOOK AT-- MANY OF US LOOK AT IT
AS A CHOICE, AND, THEREFORE, WE

LOOK AT-- MANY OF US LOOK AT IT
AS A CHOICE, AND, THEREFORE, WE
BLAME PEOPLE FOR BECOMING

AS A CHOICE, AND, THEREFORE, WE
BLAME PEOPLE FOR BECOMING
ADDICTED AND WE BLAME THEM WHEN
