04:53.360 --> 04:55.562

THE ROBOTIC SHIPS ARE ARMED WITH

04:58.832 --> 05:01.301
50 CALIBER MACHINE GUNS BUT

05:21.421 --> 05:22.289
THE WAR ON ISIS.

05:22.289 --> 05:23.290
EXTENDED CONVERSATIONS WITH

05:23.290 --> 05:24.224
LEADING EXPERTS TO TRY TO MAKE

05:24.224 --> 05:25.325
SENSE OF WHAT'S OCCURRING ON THE

05:25.325 --> 05:26.526
BATTLEFIELD IN SYRIA AND IRAQ.

05:26.526 --> 05:27.694
TONIGHT, WE ARE JOINED FROM

05:27.694 --> 05:28.728
WASHINGTON BY DOUGLAS OLLIVANT.

05:28.728 --> 05:29.763
HE SERVED AS A DIRECTOR WITH

05:29.763 --> 05:30.564
THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL

05:30.564 --> 05:32.032
UNDER PRESIDENTS BUSH AND OBAMA.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.567
PRIOR TO THAT, HE WAS A MILITARY

05:33.567 --> 05:35.335
PLANNER IN IRAQ AND A

05:35.335 --> 05:36.469
COUNTERINSURGENCY ADVISOR IN

05:39.139 --> 05:42.976
INTERNATIONAL.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.578
PARTNER WITH SO FIRST, LET'S

05:44.578 --> 05:45.712
TALK TURKEY BECAUSE OF ITS

05:45.712 --> 05:46.713
LOCATION AND ITS MEMBERSHIP IN

05:46.713 --> 05:47.681
NATO.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.716
IT LOOKS LIKE A CRUCIAL PARTNER

05:49.716 --> 05:52.219
ON THIS WAR ON I.S.I.S.

05:52.219 --> 05:56.590
THIS WEEK TURKISH PARLIAMENT

05:56.590 --> 05:58.325
SAYS THEY WILL AUTHORIZE THE USE

05:58.325 --> 05:59.526
OF FORCE IN SYRIA.

05:59.526 --> 06:00.894
IS THAT THE KEY TO DEFEATING

06:00.894 --> 06:01.895
I.S.I.S?

06:01.895 --> 06:05.065
>> I DOUBT THEY'RE GOING TO SEND

06:05.065 --> 06:07.767
GROUND TROOPS AND THE KEY TO

06:07.767 --> 06:08.935
FIGHTING I.S.I.S.

06:08.935 --> 06:10.203
QUITE FRANKLY WHAT THE COALITION

06:10.203 --> 06:11.504
WOULD REALLY LIKE FROM THE TURKS

06:11.504 --> 06:12.872
IS MORE ACTION IN SHUTTING THEIR

06:12.872 --> 06:14.307
BORDERS.

06:14.307 --> 06:17.077
TURKEY HAS BEEN THE CONDUIT FOR

06:17.077 --> 06:19.079
MOST OF THE FOREIGN FIGHTERS

06:19.079 --> 06:20.814
COMING IN TO FIGHT WITH THE

06:20.814 --> 06:22.349
ISLAMIC STATE, AND IT WOULD

06:22.349 --> 06:24.884
REALLY BE HELPFUL, WERE THEY TO

06:24.884 --> 06:27.153
SHUT THAT BORDER DOWN VERY

06:27.153 --> 06:28.455
EFFECTIVELY.

06:28.455 --> 06:30.423
IT'S BEEN TALK THAT MUCH OF THE

06:30.423 --> 06:31.858
MONEY FLOW IS COMING THROUGH

06:31.858 --> 06:33.827
TURKEY SO MORE HELP SHUTTING

06:33.827 --> 06:37.631
DOWN THESE BLACK MARKETS FOR

06:37.631 --> 06:39.232
ANTIQUITIES, OIL, ET CETERA WILL

06:39.232 --> 06:42.535
BE ASKED OF THE TURKS SHORTLY.

06:42.535 --> 06:44.471
>> IF THEY DON'T SEND GROUND

06:44.471 --> 06:45.639
TROOPS WHO DOES?

06:45.639 --> 06:48.275
>> BOTH THE IRAQI ARMY, THE

06:48.275 --> 06:51.177
IRAQI POLICE AND THE KURDISH

06:51.177 --> 06:53.580
PESHMERGA FORCES.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.548
THOSE ARE THE BULK OF THE FORCES

06:55.548 --> 06:58.051
THAT WILL DO THE HEAVY LIFTING.

06:58.051 --> 07:00.787
>> KOBANI, THE FIGHT HAS BEEN

07:00.787 --> 07:01.955
CONTINUING THERE FOR QUITE SOME

07:01.955 --> 07:02.756
TIME.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.557
WHY IS THIS FIGHT SIGNIFICANT?

07:04.557 --> 07:08.795
>> KOBANI IS AN IMPORTANT BORDER

07:08.795 --> 07:10.563
TOWN.

07:10.563 --> 07:12.599
ONE, KURD PUSHED OUT OF THIS

07:12.599 --> 07:19.673
AREA YET KURDS PUSHED OUT OF

07:19.673 --> 07:22.375
THIS AREA, IT GIVES THE ISLAMIC

07:22.375 --> 07:24.678
STATE YET ANOTHER IMPORTANT

07:24.678 --> 07:26.012
CROSSING WITH TURKEY THAT IT

07:26.012 --> 07:27.614
WOULD CONTROL.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.350
>> IS THE AIR CAMPAIGN FROM

07:30.350 --> 07:34.321
AMERICA AND ITS ALLIES WORKING?

07:34.321 --> 07:37.190
>> IT IS CERTAINLY HELPING.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.658
GETTING ACCURATE REPORTING FROM

07:38.658 --> 07:41.895
THIS AREA, DESPITE HAVING

07:41.895 --> 07:42.996
CORRESPONDENTS JUST ACROSS THIS

07:42.996 --> 07:44.431
AREA IS MURKY.

07:44.431 --> 07:46.933
THE AIR ATTACK IS HAVING SOME

07:46.933 --> 07:49.469
EFFECT YET THE ATTACK IS PUSHING

07:49.469 --> 07:51.571
VERY HEAVILY TOWARDS THIS TOWN.

07:51.571 --> 07:55.575
>> THE ANBAR PROVINCE, I.S.I.S.

07:55.575 --> 07:58.712
CONTINUES TO MAKE GAINS THIS

07:58.712 --> 08:02.315
WEEK, HIT AND KUBISA, THESE

08:02.315 --> 08:03.783
GAINS ARE JEOPARDIZING AN

08:03.783 --> 08:04.984
IMPORTANT MILITARY BASE IN THE

08:04.984 --> 08:07.487
AREA AND THE CHROME OF A NEARBY

08:07.487 --> 08:08.955
DAM.

08:08.955 --> 08:09.823
TELL US MORE.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.092
>> THESE HITS ARE IMPORTANT AND

08:12.092 --> 08:14.327
THE ISLAMIC STATE SEEMS TO BE

08:14.327 --> 08:16.262
MAKING EFFECTIVE MOVES IN ANBAR.

08:16.262 --> 08:18.231
IN SHORT WE SEE THE BATTLEFIELD

08:18.231 --> 08:19.432
IN FLUX.

08:19.432 --> 08:20.433
THE ISLAMIC STATE IS BEING

08:20.433 --> 08:23.837
PUSHED BACK IN SOME AREAS, WE

08:23.837 --> 08:26.973
SAW MINOR GAINS BY THE IRAQI

08:26.973 --> 08:30.443
ARMY AND IRAQI KURDS, WE HAVE

08:30.443 --> 08:32.645
YET TO SEE A FULL CAMPAIGN AND

08:32.645 --> 08:33.947
WE'RE SEEING MINOR FLUCTUATIONS

08:33.947 --> 08:35.882
IN THE FRONT LINES SO TO SPEAK,

08:35.882 --> 08:36.950
THROUGHOUT IRAQ.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.518
>> HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THE

08:38.518 --> 08:39.586
CONTROL OF THE BASE, AND THE

08:39.586 --> 08:40.553
DAM?

08:40.553 --> 08:42.021
>> THE CONTROL OF ANY BASE IS

08:42.021 --> 08:43.056
SIGNIFICANT.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.892
ANY TIME YOU LOSE A LARGE PIECE

08:45.892 --> 08:47.260
OF INFRASTRUCTURE, THAT'S VERY,

08:47.260 --> 08:48.695
VERY HARD TO GET BACK.

08:48.695 --> 08:50.797
AND FRANKLY THAT'S WHEN WE SEE

08:50.797 --> 08:52.499
THINGS LIKE THE ISLAMIC STATE

08:52.499 --> 08:54.567
GETTING LARGE QUANTITIES OF

08:54.567 --> 08:55.568
TRUCKS, LARGE QUANTITIES OF

08:55.568 --> 08:57.070
OTHER MILITARY EQUIPMENT,

08:57.070 --> 08:58.171
MISSILES.

08:58.171 --> 08:59.939
SO WE DEFINITELY DO NOT WANT THE

08:59.939 --> 09:01.141
ISLAMIC STATE TO TAKE OVER THE

09:01.141 --> 09:02.075
SPACE.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.443
>> WHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE OF

09:03.443 --> 09:06.012
THE DAM THAT WE ARE NEARING

09:06.012 --> 09:07.080
CONTROL OF?

09:07.080 --> 09:09.048
>> YOU CAN USE A DAM POSITIVELY.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.316
YOU CAN GET THE POWER THAT'S

09:10.316 --> 09:12.886
COMING FROM FROM IT.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.554
YOU CAN DIVERT THE WATER TO

09:14.554 --> 09:16.956
WHERE YOU WANT IT OR CONCEIVABLY

09:16.956 --> 09:18.792
YOU CAN USE IT AS A WEAPON OF

09:18.792 --> 09:21.628
MASS DESTRUCTION WERE THEY ABLE

09:21.628 --> 09:25.765
TO FLOOD THIS DAM THEY COULD --

09:25.765 --> 09:27.033
CONTROL THIS DAM THEY COULD

09:27.033 --> 09:32.505
FLOOD THE TOWNS BELOW THIS.

09:32.505 --> 09:33.773
>> ARE THEY CLOSE TO GETTING

09:33.773 --> 09:34.707
CONTROL?

09:34.707 --> 09:36.276
>> I DON'T THINK THEY'RE CLOSE.

09:36.276 --> 09:37.911
THEY ARE CERTAINLY THREATENING

09:37.911 --> 09:40.013
IT BUT MOST OF US BELIEVE THAT

09:40.013 --> 09:42.482
THAT REMAINS FAIRLY CERTAINLY

09:42.482 --> 09:43.516
UNDER IRAQI CONTROL.

09:43.516 --> 09:46.119
>> WE HAVE ALSO HEARD REPORTS IN

09:46.119 --> 09:47.821
THE PAST FEW DAYS ABOUT THE

09:47.821 --> 09:49.689
AMBUSH AND KILLING OF IRAQI

09:49.689 --> 09:50.924
GOVERNMENT TROOPS JUST NORTH OF

09:50.924 --> 09:51.825
THE CAPITAL CITY.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.860
IS THERE ANY REAL THREAT THAT

09:53.860 --> 09:54.994
I.S.I.S. COULD TAKE THE CAPITAL?

09:54.994 --> 09:56.563
>> NO, THERE'S NO REAL THREAT TO

09:56.563 --> 09:57.530
BAGHDAD.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.132
THE NUMBER OF TROOPS THAT ARE IN

09:59.132 --> 10:00.834
BAGHDAD IS VERY IMPRESSIVE.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.202
AND WERE THE ISLAMIC STATE TO

10:02.202 --> 10:04.204
GET CLOSE THE CITIZENS OF

10:04.204 --> 10:05.505
BAGHDAD THEMSELVES I THINK WOULD

10:05.505 --> 10:07.040
RALLY AGAINST THE ISLAMIC STATE.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.075
THIS IS NOT LIKE THE NORTH,

10:09.075 --> 10:13.713
WHERE THERE WERE SUNNI

10:13.713 --> 10:15.315
CO--RELIGIONISTS, SOME OF WHOM

10:15.315 --> 10:16.549
GAVE AID AND ASSISTANCE TO THE

10:16.549 --> 10:17.317
ISLAMIC STATE.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.185
AS THEY PUSHED INTO BAGHDAD WITH

10:19.185 --> 10:20.887
ITS PREDOMINANTLY SHIA

10:20.887 --> 10:24.090
POPULATION, THEY WOULD ENCOUNTER

10:24.090 --> 10:25.692
A VERY, VERY HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT

10:25.692 --> 10:28.394
AND PROBABLY BE THROWN OUT

10:28.394 --> 10:29.329
FAIRLY QUICKLY.

10:29.329 --> 10:32.065
>> ARE I.S.I.S. TROOPS ABLE TO

10:32.065 --> 10:35.335
GO FREELY FROM SYRIA TO IRAQ TO

10:35.335 --> 10:36.736
GET REINFORCEMENTS AND MOVE

10:36.736 --> 10:37.604
TROOPS AND SUPPLIES?

10:37.604 --> 10:39.172
>> I DON'T THINK THEY ARE MOVING

10:39.172 --> 10:40.907
AS FREELY AS THEY WERE BEFORE WE

10:40.907 --> 10:41.908
STARTED AIR STRIKES.

10:41.908 --> 10:43.176
AND THAT'S BULK OF WHAT WE WANT

10:43.176 --> 10:44.878
THE AIR STRIKES TO DO ON THE

10:44.878 --> 10:47.113
SYRIAN SIDE, WE'RE DROPPING

10:47.113 --> 10:49.282
BOMBS OR DESTROYING TARGETS BUT

10:49.282 --> 10:50.416
IT'S LESS ABOUT DESTROYING

10:50.416 --> 10:52.352
THINGS ON THE SYRIAN SIDE OF THE

10:52.352 --> 10:54.587
BORDER THAN MAKING THEM UNABLE

10:54.587 --> 10:56.923
TO ACT FREELY TO BE ABLE TO

10:56.923 --> 10:58.291
REINFORCE IN THE MANNER YOU'VE

10:58.291 --> 11:01.528
BEEN TALKING ABOUT, PUSH

11:01.528 --> 11:03.963
RESUPPLIES, BE IT MATERIAL OR

11:03.963 --> 11:05.265
TROOPS ACROSS THE BORDER.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.267
THEY ARE STILL COMING, YOU CAN'T

11:07.267 --> 11:08.401
CLOSE THAT BORDER BUT THEY CAN

11:08.401 --> 11:11.604
NO LONGER COME IN CONVOYS OF 50

11:11.604 --> 11:13.473
SUVS FLYING THE BLACK FLAG.

11:13.473 --> 11:14.440
THAT'S NOT HAPPENING ANYMORE.

11:14.440 --> 11:15.775
>> IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT

11:15.775 --> 11:17.744
ANY OF THIS PRESSURE IS APPLIED

11:17.744 --> 11:20.780
TO MAYOR FINANCIAL

11:20.780 --> 11:21.648
INFRASTRUCTURE -- THEIR

11:21.648 --> 11:22.715
FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE HOW

11:22.715 --> 11:24.117
THEY ARE FUNDING THESE MOVES

11:24.117 --> 11:25.585
INTO IRAQ?

11:25.585 --> 11:27.420
>> IT DOESN'T APPEAR WE HAVE

11:27.420 --> 11:30.056
FOUND A WAY TO FUNDAMENTALLY

11:30.056 --> 11:31.291
CHOKE THIS OFF.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.693
THEIR FUNDING SOURCES ARE SO

11:33.693 --> 11:35.562
DISPERSED, THEY DO GET EXTERNAL

11:35.562 --> 11:36.896
FUNDS WHICH WE CONTINUE TO TRY

11:36.896 --> 11:38.097
TO CUT OFF.

11:38.097 --> 11:41.000
BUT THEY ARE SELF-FUNDED, THEY

11:41.000 --> 11:42.902
TAX THE VILLAGES THAT THEY'VE

11:42.902 --> 11:43.803
TAKEN OVER.

11:43.803 --> 11:46.105
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF AS I'VE

11:46.105 --> 11:47.373
DISCUSSED EARLIER, THERE ARE

11:47.373 --> 11:48.575
BLACK MARKET OIL SALES.

11:48.575 --> 11:51.945
THEY HAVE TAKEN A LARGE ALMOST

11:51.945 --> 11:55.348
INDUSTRIAL ANTIQUITIES MARKET,

11:55.348 --> 11:58.151
THEY ARE LOOTING ANTIQUITIES ON

11:58.151 --> 12:00.353
A GRAND SCALE AND MOVING THEM

12:00.353 --> 12:01.854
ONTO THE GRAY AND BLACK MARKET

12:01.854 --> 12:03.823
AS WELL.

12:03.823 --> 12:05.758
STOPPING IS HARD BECAUSE IT'S

12:05.758 --> 12:09.429
SO DISPARATE.

12:09.429 --> 12:19.505
>> THANK YOU DOUGLAS.

12:19.505 --> 12:21.074

12:21.074 --> 12:25.545
SIGNATURE SEGMENT.

12:25.545 --> 12:26.980
ISIS' RELEASE FRIDAY OF YET

12:26.980 --> 12:28.581
ANOTHER VIDEOTAPE SHOWING THE

12:28.581 --> 12:29.983
BEHEADING OF A WESTERN HOSTAGE

12:29.983 --> 12:31.250
ONCE AGAIN HAS DRAWN

12:31.250 --> 12:32.919
INTERNATIONAL CONDEMNATION AND

12:32.919 --> 12:34.554
REFOCUSED ATTENTION ON THE VERY

12:34.554 --> 12:36.089
PRACTICE.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.590
IN FACT, BEHEADINGS DATE BACK TO

12:37.590 --> 12:38.458
ANCIENT TIMES.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.492
AND TODAY, THEY ARE HARDLY

12:39.492 --> 12:40.493
LIMITED TO WHAT ISIS IS DOING IN

12:40.493 --> 12:41.494
IRAQ AND SYRIA.

12:41.494 --> 12:42.528
THE NEWSHOUR'S IVETTE FELICIANO

12:42.528 --> 12:43.529
TELLS US WHERE ELSE THEY ARE

12:43.529 --> 12:44.564
OCCURRING AND TALKS TO A

12:44.564 --> 12:45.698
RELIGIOUS SCHOLAR ABOUT WHETHER

12:45.698 --> 12:46.766

12:46.766 --> 12:49.435
JUSTIFICATION FOR THE ACT.

12:56.976 --> 12:58.144
OUTRAGED THE PUBLIC, AND

12:58.144 --> 12:59.679
PROMPTED AN AMERICAN MILITARY

12:59.679 --> 13:01.881
RESPONSE.

13:01.881 --> 13:03.082
>> IF YOU THREATEN AMERICA, YOU

13:03.082 --> 13:05.685
WILL FIND NO SAFE HAVEN.

13:05.685 --> 13:06.953

13:06.953 --> 13:07.820
BRITISH AID WORKER, ALAN

13:07.820 --> 13:08.921
HENNING, HAS SUFFERED THE SAME

13:08.921 --> 13:11.224
FATE.

13:11.224 --> 13:12.625
A STORY THAT PROMPTED ANOTHER

13:12.625 --> 13:16.729
ROUND OF INTENSE COVERAGE.

13:16.729 --> 13:17.830
DESPITE THE WIDESPREAD COVERAGE

13:17.830 --> 13:19.499
OF THE FOUR RECENT ISIS

BEHEADINGS, DR. DAWN PERLMUTTER,

AN AUTHOR AND SCHOLAR WHO FOR

13:22.502 --> 13:23.670
YEARS HAS STUDIED RITUALISTIC

13:23.670 --> 13:25.071
CRIMES AND RELIGIOUS TERRORISM,

13:25.071 --> 13:26.172
SAYS VIDEO-TAPED BEHEADINGS ARE

13:26.172 --> 13:27.407
NOTHING NEW, AND THAT THESE

13:27.407 --> 13:28.775
RECENT EVENTS ARE ACTUALLY JUST

13:28.775 --> 13:34.747
THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.315
SHE TOLD US JUST YESTERDAY, IT

13:36.315 --> 13:37.517
WOULD BE SAFE TO SAY THERE HAVE

13:37.517 --> 13:38.618
BEEN AT LEAST TWO DOZEN

13:38.618 --> 13:39.619
BEHEADINGS AROUND THE WORLD

13:39.619 --> 13:40.653
SINCE THE START OF SEPTEMBER.

13:40.653 --> 13:41.754
AMONG THEM, FOUR PEOPLE KILLED

13:41.754 --> 13:43.823
BY MEXICAN DRUG CARTELS, FOUR BY

13:43.823 --> 13:45.324
AN EXTREMIST GROUP IN THE SINAI

13:46.526 --> 13:48.227
BEHEADED BY BOKO HARAM MILITANTS

13:48.227 --> 13:49.762
WHO POSTED THEIR OWN VIDEO JUST

13:49.762 --> 13:53.466
THIS PAST FRIDAY.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.468
FEW, IF ANY, OF THOSE INCIDENTS

13:55.468 --> 13:56.636
EVEN MADE THE NEWS IN THIS

13:56.636 --> 13:58.471
COUNTRY.

13:58.471 --> 14:04.544
>> THERE'S HUNDREDS OF THEM.

HUNDREDS OF VIDEOS OF-- EASILY

14:05.611 --> 14:06.713
ACCESSIBLE ONLINE FOR ANYONE TO

14:13.853 --> 14:16.155
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD.

14:16.155 --> 14:17.657
>> Reporter: SHE SAYS THE

14:17.657 --> 14:18.925
BEHEADINGS THAT HAVE OCCURRED

14:18.925 --> 14:20.560
AFTER ISIS FIGHTERS OVERRAN

14:20.560 --> 14:21.761
VILLAGES IN NORTHERN AND WESTERN

14:21.761 --> 14:22.929
IRAQ AND IN SYRIA, HAVE TAKEN

14:22.929 --> 14:24.297
VIOLENCE TO A LEVEL THAT EVEN

14:24.297 --> 14:26.099
AL-QAEDA HAS CHOSEN TO DISTANCE

14:26.099 --> 14:28.468
ITSELF FROM.

14:28.468 --> 14:29.869
>> THE ONE CONSISTENCY IN ALL OF

14:29.869 --> 14:34.574
THE FORMAL BEHEADINGS OF THE

14:34.574 --> 14:35.575
DIFFERENT AL-QAEDA LINKED GROUPS

14:35.575 --> 14:36.776
HAS BEEN THAT THEY HAVE NEVER

14:36.776 --> 14:40.179
FORMALLY BEHEADED A WOMAN.

14:40.179 --> 14:41.581
WHAT DIFFERS WITH ISIS IS THAT

14:41.581 --> 14:42.782
THEY ARE BEHEADING WOMEN AND

14:42.782 --> 14:44.650
CHILDREN AND STICKING THEIR

14:44.650 --> 14:49.155
HEADS ON PIKES.

14:49.155 --> 14:51.157
>> Reporter: WHY IS THE WAY YOU

14:51.157 --> 14:52.525
CHOOSE TO KILL SOMEONE,

14:52.525 --> 14:54.293
ESPECIALLY PUBLICLY, SO

14:54.293 --> 14:55.294
IMPORTANT?

14:55.294 --> 14:58.698
WHY BEHEADINGS OF ALL THE WAYS?

14:58.698 --> 15:00.900
>> BEHEADING IS THE ULTIMATE

15:00.900 --> 15:04.971
SIGN THAT YOU'RE IN POWER.

15:04.971 --> 15:07.306
IT IS SO ORGANICALLY PRIMAL,

15:07.306 --> 15:09.041
OFFENSIVE, AND FRIGHTENING THAT

15:09.041 --> 15:13.179
IT'S EFFECTIVE.

15:13.179 --> 15:16.616
PERLMUTTER BELIEVES ADVANCES IN

15:19.619 --> 15:20.653
EPIDEMIC" OVER THE LAST TEN

15:20.653 --> 15:21.754
YEARS.

15:21.754 --> 15:22.655
HUNDREDS OF VIDEOS HAVE BEEN

15:22.655 --> 15:24.023
UPLOADED TO THE WEB BY GROUPS

15:24.023 --> 15:25.057
SUCH AS THE TALIBAN AND AL-QAEDA

15:27.760 --> 15:31.097

15:31.097 --> 15:33.699

15:33.699 --> 15:34.834
TECHNOLOGY FURTHER BECAUSE NOW,

15:34.834 --> 15:36.269
WE HAVE TWITTER.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.638
WE HAVE INSTAGRAM.

15:38.638 --> 15:41.274
IT'S SORT OF THIS UNBELIEVABLE

15:41.274 --> 15:43.976
NEW PHENOMENON OF PRIMAL WARFARE

15:43.976 --> 15:49.182
COMBINED WITH MODERN TECHNOLOGY.

15:49.182 --> 15:51.717
>> Reporter: IN FACT, BEHEADINGS

15:51.717 --> 15:53.419
IN THE FORM OF PUNISHMENT FOR

15:53.419 --> 15:54.720
CRIMES GOES BACK CENTURIES.

15:54.720 --> 15:55.955
IT WAS COMMON IN THE GREEK AND

15:55.955 --> 15:57.223
ROMAN EMPIRES.

15:57.223 --> 15:58.624
HENRY THE VIII HAD BOTH ANNE

15:58.624 --> 15:59.592
BOLEYN AND CATHERINE HOWARD

15:59.592 --> 16:00.793
BEHEADED, AND THE FRENCH

16:00.793 --> 16:01.961
GUILLOTINE REMAINED FRANCE'S

16:01.961 --> 16:03.095
STANDARD METHOD OF JUDICIAL

16:03.095 --> 16:07.099
EXECUTION UNTIL 1981.

16:07.099 --> 16:08.768
EVEN TODAY, BEHEADING AS A FORM

16:08.768 --> 16:10.369
OF PUNISHMENT IS STILL ALLOWED

16:10.369 --> 16:12.338
IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES INCLUDING

16:12.338 --> 16:14.473
SAUDI ARABIA, YEMEN AND IRAN.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.075
YET, SAUDI ARABIA IS THE ONLY

16:16.075 --> 16:17.176
COUNTRY THAT ACTUALLY CONTINUES

16:17.176 --> 16:19.712
TO BEHEAD OFFENDERS.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.347
THERE WERE REPORTEDLY 80 PUBLIC

16:21.347 --> 16:22.782
EXECUTIONS THERE LAST YEAR, MOST

16:22.782 --> 16:27.286
OF THEM BEHEADINGS.

16:27.286 --> 16:28.321
>> AS FAR AS COUNTRIES LIKE, YOU

16:28.321 --> 16:29.422
KNOW, WESTERN COUNTRIES,

16:29.422 --> 16:30.990
INCLUDING, THE UNITED STATES,

16:30.990 --> 16:32.525
WHO HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR HORROR

16:32.525 --> 16:34.060
OVER THE EXECUTIONS BY THE

16:34.060 --> 16:36.262
ISLAMIC STATE GROUP IN IRAQ AND

16:36.262 --> 16:38.130
SYRIA, WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE SAME

16:38.130 --> 16:39.265
HORROR OVER JUST REGULAR

16:39.265 --> 16:40.499
BEHEADINGS THAT TAKE PLACE IN

16:40.499 --> 16:41.801
SAUDI ARABIA, SEVERAL A MONTH ON

16:41.801 --> 16:47.073
AVERAGE.

MIDDLE EAST RESEARCHER FOR HUMAN

16:49.542 --> 16:50.476

16:50.476 --> 16:51.410
SPOKE TO HIM VIA SKYPE A FEW

16:51.410 --> 16:53.279
DAYS AGO.

16:53.279 --> 16:54.714
>> WHEN YOU TALK TO SAUDI

16:54.714 --> 16:56.482
OFFICIALS ABOUT THIS THEY WILL

16:56.482 --> 16:57.483
USUALLY TELL YOU THAT THEIR USE

16:57.483 --> 16:58.784
OF PUBLIC BEHEADINGS IS ROOTED

16:58.784 --> 17:00.152
IN ISLAMIC LAW AND ISLAMIC

17:00.152 --> 17:03.589
TRADITION.

17:03.589 --> 17:04.790
IF SAUDI ARABIA WERE TO TRY TO

17:04.790 --> 17:06.325
REFORM THEIR PRACTICES ON

17:06.325 --> 17:07.827
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT THEY WOULD

17:07.827 --> 17:09.362
FACE A CONSIDERABLE RESISTANCE

17:09.362 --> 17:10.630
AND THEY WOULD BE ACCUSED BY THE

17:10.630 --> 17:11.731
CORE CONSTITUENCY OF YOU KNOW

17:11.731 --> 17:12.832
BASICALLY GOING BACK ON THEIR

17:12.832 --> 17:18.471
ISLAMIC ROOTS.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.339
>> Reporter: SOME ANALYSTS SAY

17:20.339 --> 17:22.742
MUSLIM EXTREMIST GROUPS LIKE

17:22.742 --> 17:24.310
ISIS CHOOSE THE ACT OF BEHEADING

17:24.310 --> 17:25.845
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALSO ALIGNING

17:25.845 --> 17:27.813
THEMSELVES WITH WHAT THEY THINK

17:27.813 --> 17:30.616
IS AN AUTHENTIC ISLAM, POINTING

17:30.616 --> 17:31.751
TO KORANIC PASSAGES THEY BELIEVE

17:31.751 --> 17:33.152
CONDONE THE ACT.

17:33.152 --> 17:35.855
>> THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE TO

17:35.855 --> 17:37.790
ALWAYS HAVE THIS READING OF

17:37.790 --> 17:41.761
OFFENSES, IDENTIFYING-- HAVING

17:41.761 --> 17:46.299
THE PERSON CONFESS, HAVING THE

17:46.299 --> 17:47.934
PERSON IN FRONT OF THEM,

17:47.934 --> 17:49.302
KNEELING.

17:49.302 --> 17:53.339
IT IS AN EXECUTION RITUAL.

17:53.339 --> 17:54.540
>> THEREFORE WHEN YOU MEET THE

17:54.540 --> 17:55.741
UNBELIEVERS-- PRESUMABLY IN A

17:55.741 --> 17:57.343
BATTLE-- SMITE AT THEIR NECKS.

17:57.343 --> 17:58.544
>> Reporter: YET, ISLAMIC

17:58.544 --> 17:59.578
SCHOLARS, LIKE PROFESSOR

17:59.578 --> 18:00.713
KHALIDI, DISPUTE THAT THE KORAN

18:00.713 --> 18:01.480
OFFERS ANY JUSTIFICATION FOR

18:01.480 --> 18:02.782
BEHEADING.

18:02.782 --> 18:05.217
HE CITES THE LINES COMING

18:05.217 --> 18:07.853
IMMEDIATELY AFTER ONE OF THE TWO

18:07.853 --> 18:10.990
USED TO JUSTIFY BEHEADINGS.

18:10.990 --> 18:13.125
>> AT LENGTH WHEN YE HAVE

18:13.125 --> 18:14.994
THOROUGHLY SUBDUED THEM, BIND

18:14.994 --> 18:16.362
THE CAPTIVES FIRMLY.

18:16.362 --> 18:17.463
THEREFORE IS THE TIME FOR EITHER

18:17.463 --> 18:21.334
GENEROSITY OR RANSOM.

18:21.334 --> 18:22.301
I'VE JUST READ SURA 47 VERSE

18:22.301 --> 18:23.703
FOUR.

18:23.703 --> 18:24.837
IF YOU CUT OFF THEIR HEADS

18:24.837 --> 18:25.938
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BIND THEM,

18:25.938 --> 18:29.942
AND YOU'RE NOT BINDING THEM TO

18:29.942 --> 18:31.110
CUT OFF THEIR HEADS, YOU'RE

18:31.110 --> 18:32.378
BINDING THEM TO EITHER BE

18:32.378 --> 18:33.679
GENEROUS TO THEM, RELEASE THEM,

18:33.679 --> 18:35.014
OR HOLD THEM FOR RANSOM.

18:35.014 --> 18:36.282
SO THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT

18:36.282 --> 18:37.450
CUTTING OFF THEIR HEADS IN THIS

18:37.450 --> 18:39.685
PASSAGE.

18:39.685 --> 18:42.488
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THIS

18:42.488 --> 18:43.422
ACT CLAIMING THIS AS

18:43.422 --> 18:44.423
JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS PRACTICE.

18:44.423 --> 18:45.825
IT IS NOT.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.159
AND IT JUST SHOWS THAT THEY KNOW

18:47.159 --> 18:47.860
NOTHING ABOUT ISLAM AND THEY

18:47.860 --> 18:48.761
DON'T KNOW HOW TO READ THIS

18:48.761 --> 18:50.062
PROPERLY.

18:50.062 --> 18:51.497
>> Sreenivasan: FOR MORE ABOUT

19:04.577 --> 19:05.678
AMERICA'S BIGGEST, AND MOST

19:05.678 --> 19:06.412
EXPENSIVE, CITIES ARE ACTING ON

19:06.412 --> 19:08.447
THEIR OWN TO INCREASE THE

19:08.447 --> 19:09.315
MINIMUM WAGE.

19:09.315 --> 19:10.182
FOR SOME INSIGHT, YESTERDAY I

19:10.182 --> 19:12.551
SPOKE WITH MATT FLEGENHEIMER, A

19:12.551 --> 19:13.953
REPORTER WITH THE "NEW YORK

19:13.953 --> 19:17.256
TIMES."

19:17.256 --> 19:18.791
NEW YORK IS SOMETHING SO DID

19:18.791 --> 19:19.892
L.A. WHAT DID THEY DO?

19:19.892 --> 19:20.693
>> SO NEW YORK AT LEAST ON

19:20.693 --> 19:21.761
TUESDAY MAYOR DeBLASIO SIGNED

19:21.761 --> 19:24.597
A LAW THAT STATED ON CITY

19:24.597 --> 19:27.633
SUBSIDIZE ED PROJECTS THE WORKER

19:27.633 --> 19:31.370
WAS ENTITLED TO A LIVING WAGE,

19:31.370 --> 19:35.207
13.13, ANY TENANTS OR SUBTENANTS

19:35.207 --> 19:37.877
THAT RECEIVE CITY SUBSIDIES, ARE

19:37.877 --> 19:39.278
ENTITLED TO MINIMUM WAGE.

19:39.278 --> 19:41.914
>> IF IT GOES THROUGH AND MAKES

19:41.914 --> 19:43.315
IT THROUGH CITY COUNCIL, RIGHT?

19:43.315 --> 19:45.785
>> NO, THIS IS AN EXECUTIVE

19:45.785 --> 19:47.219
ORDER.

19:47.219 --> 19:53.626
SOME CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS HAVE

19:53.626 --> 19:54.560
CHAIFD OVER THAT.

19:54.560 --> 19:58.197
>> ERIC GARCETTI, DID SOMETHING

19:58.197 --> 19:59.632
DIFFERENT.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.901
>> BROADER PACKAGE I BELIEVE

20:01.901 --> 20:03.269
13.25 AND THEN FOR HOTEL WORKERS

20:03.269 --> 20:05.004
IN A LOT OF CASES THEY HAVE GONE

20:05.004 --> 20:06.906
FOR A SORT OF EXPANSIVE MOVE

20:06.906 --> 20:07.973
THROUGH COUNCIL AS WELL.

20:07.973 --> 20:09.675
WHICH HAS BEEN FACED BY

20:09.675 --> 20:11.043
OPPOSITION OBVIOUSLY.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.211
SOME OPPOSITION GROUPS SAY THIS

20:12.211 --> 20:13.112
COST JOBS.

20:13.112 --> 20:15.347
IN THE LONG RUN, IF EMPLOYERS

20:15.347 --> 20:17.783
DON'T WANT TO PLAY THIS WITH

20:17.783 --> 20:20.186
WORKERS THEY'LL TAKE THEIR JOBS

20:20.186 --> 20:21.353
TO ELSEWHERE.

20:21.353 --> 20:22.988
>> MOST PEOPLE DON'T RECOGNIZE

20:22.988 --> 20:26.358
THAT LOS ANGELES HAS A FUJ

20:26.358 --> 20:28.227
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY THERE,

20:28.227 --> 20:29.929
AND THIS MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE

20:29.929 --> 20:32.498
IF IT WENT THROUGH, IT WOULD

20:32.498 --> 20:33.766
AFFECT A HALF A MILLION PEOPLE.

20:33.766 --> 20:34.800
>> ABSOLUTELY.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.136
THERE'S A FACTOR OF L.A. BEING

20:37.136 --> 20:40.272
THE BIGGEST INCOME DISPARITY

20:40.272 --> 20:44.176
AMONG THE LARGE CITIES OF

20:44.176 --> 20:44.977
AMERICA.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.178
COSTING JOBS EVEN HIGHER PAYING

20:46.178 --> 20:47.113
JOBS.

20:47.113 --> 20:48.380
>> WHAT ABOUT THOSE BUSINESSES

20:48.380 --> 20:50.216
ARE THEY PLANNING TO PUSH BACK

20:50.216 --> 20:52.184
OR MOVE TO OTHER TOWNS?

20:52.184 --> 20:53.986
THAT'S ONE OF THE ECONOMIC KIND

20:53.986 --> 20:55.321
OF RESISTANCE TO INCREASED

20:55.321 --> 20:57.323
MINIMUM WAGE IS THEY'LL STIFLE

20:57.323 --> 20:58.657
JOB CREATION.

20:58.657 --> 21:02.294
>> THAT'S THE DOOMSDAY PRE

21:02.294 --> 21:04.563
PREDICTION, THE L.A. CHAMBER OF

21:04.563 --> 21:05.564
COMMERCE, PARTICULARLY L.A. YOU

21:05.564 --> 21:07.199
CAN MOVE ACROSS THE STREET AND

21:07.199 --> 21:09.602
CHARGE A DIFFERENT WAGE THAN YOU

21:09.602 --> 21:11.604
MIGHT HAVE, IF YOU WERE STAYING

21:11.604 --> 21:12.538
IN LOS ANGELES.

21:12.538 --> 21:14.406
>> SEATTLE GOT A LOT OF PRESS

21:14.406 --> 21:16.275
FOR PUSHING IT UP TO $15 BUT

21:16.275 --> 21:19.778
THAT'S A CITY THAT'S NOT NEARLY

21:19.778 --> 21:21.480
AS IMPOVERISHED AS LOS ANGELES.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.082
AVIATION IS THE CENTRAL HUB

21:23.082 --> 21:24.984
THERE AND THEY MAY ACTUALLY MAKE

21:24.984 --> 21:26.085
MORE THAN 15 BUCKS TO START WITH

21:26.085 --> 21:26.986
RIGHT?

21:26.986 --> 21:28.687
>> THAT'S ONE OF THE LEADING

21:28.687 --> 21:30.856
CITIES BUT VERY GREATLY

21:30.856 --> 21:31.790
DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES AS FAR

21:31.790 --> 21:33.192
AS THE INCOME SITUATION.

21:33.192 --> 21:35.194
>> HOW DOES THIS PLAY OUT, WHEN

21:35.194 --> 21:38.330
YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL MAP,

21:38.330 --> 21:42.101
THESE CITIES, IS THIS HAVING A

21:42.101 --> 21:43.802
RIPPLE EFFECT, PERHAPS TAKE

21:43.802 --> 21:45.304
ADVANTAGES IF THESE THINGS ARE

21:45.304 --> 21:46.272
UNCOMPETITIVE FOR BUSINESSES?

21:46.272 --> 21:48.741
>> IT SEEMS SORT OF EARLY IN

21:48.741 --> 21:50.242
THIS KINDS OF CITY LEVEL

21:50.242 --> 21:52.645
MOVEMENT I SPOKE WITH THE LABOR

21:52.645 --> 21:53.979
SECRETARY TOM PEREZ EARLIER IN

21:53.979 --> 21:55.347
THE WEEK.

21:55.347 --> 21:57.116
HE SAID MOVEMENT ON THIS,

21:57.116 --> 21:58.250
PRESIDENT OBAMA OBVIOUSLY CAME

21:58.250 --> 22:01.086
OUT IN FAVOR OF A 10.10 MINIMUM

22:01.086 --> 22:03.556
WAGE BUT THERE HASN'T BEEN A

22:03.556 --> 22:04.423
MOMENTUM IN CONGRESS.

22:04.423 --> 22:07.393
IT HAS TO BE ON A LOCAL LEVEL.

22:07.393 --> 22:10.863
NEW YORK, L.A., CHICAGO, BEING

22:10.863 --> 22:12.131
OTHERS, BUT EVEN IN NEW YORK

22:12.131 --> 22:14.066
CITY THE MINIMUM WAGE IS SET AT

22:14.066 --> 22:16.368
A CERTAIN LEVEL, THAT'S THE

22:16.368 --> 22:18.170
MINIMUM, AND STATE WORKERS HERE.

22:18.170 --> 22:21.907
>> AND MATT FLEGENHEIMER, THANKS

22:21.907 --> 22:34.553
SO MUCH.

22:34.553 --> 22:36.155
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW TO

22:36.155 --> 22:37.189
VIEWERS LIKE YOU: YOUR FEEDBACK

22:37.189 --> 22:38.257
ABOUT SOME OF OUR RECENT WORK.

22:38.257 --> 22:39.124
MANY OF YOU COMMENTED ON

22:39.124 --> 22:40.159
FACEBOOK ABOUT OUR PIECE

22:40.159 --> 22:41.327
EXAMINING FLORIDA'S NEW LAW

22:41.327 --> 22:42.494
REQUIRING LOW-PERFORMING

22:42.494 --> 22:43.462
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE AN

22:43.462 --> 22:44.697
EXTRA HOUR OF READING EVERY DAY.

22:44.697 --> 22:45.598
A COMMON REACTION: PARENTS NEED

22:45.598 --> 22:46.532
TO DO MORE TO HELP KIDS READ.

22:46.532 --> 22:47.566
PATRICIA MARSHALL WROTE:

22:47.566 --> 22:48.567
I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO READ,

22:48.567 --> 22:49.568
READ, READ TO THEIR KIDS.

22:49.568 --> 22:50.336
ONCE A CHILD LEARNS TO LIKE

22:50.336 --> 22:51.203
READING, IT BECOMES A LIFELONG

22:51.203 --> 22:52.238
COMPANION.

22:52.238 --> 22:53.339
THIS SHOULD BE THE

22:53.339 --> 22:54.740
RESPONSIBILITY OF PARENTS AND

22:54.740 --> 22:56.609
OTHER RELATIVES, INCLUDING

22:56.609 --> 22:57.643
SIBLINGS.

22:57.643 --> 22:59.144
SANDRA MILLER ADDED THIS:

22:59.144 --> 23:00.112
PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE AND

23:00.112 --> 23:01.547
IT BEGINS BY READING TO INFANTS

23:01.547 --> 23:03.382
DAILY.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.416
ED WEIGANDT WAS MUCH MORE BLUNT

23:04.416 --> 23:05.251
ABOUT IT:

23:05.251 --> 23:06.685
HOW ABOUT PARENTS ACTUALLY DO

23:06.685 --> 23:09.188
SOME PARENTING AND STOP USING

23:09.188 --> 23:10.456
THE TELEVISION, X-BOX OR OTHER

23:10.456 --> 23:11.123
ELECTRONIC GADGETS AS A

23:11.123 --> 23:12.825
BABYSITTER?

23:12.825 --> 23:14.093
FAILURE OF OUR KIDS TO LEARN ON

23:14.093 --> 23:15.094
A GLOBAL LEVEL SHOULD NEVER BE

23:15.094 --> 23:16.128
DEEMED THE FAULT OF THE

23:16.128 --> 23:20.132
EDUCATION SYSTEM ALONE.

23:20.132 --> 23:21.300
AS FOR THE PROGRAM ITSELF, SONJI

23:21.300 --> 23:22.568
WEBB WROTE:

23:22.568 --> 23:24.203
PERSONALLY, I THINK KIDS HAVE

23:24.203 --> 23:26.805
TOO MUCH HOMEWORK.

23:26.805 --> 23:28.540
I THINK THEIR SCHOOL DAYS ARE

23:28.540 --> 23:29.775
TOO LONG AS WELL.

23:29.775 --> 23:32.244
THEY NEED MORE KID AND FAMILY

23:32.244 --> 23:33.946
TIME.

23:33.946 --> 23:34.813
HELEN MARIE BRADY MARSHALL SAID

23:34.813 --> 23:35.914
IT MADE SENSE:

23:35.914 --> 23:37.149
ONLY IF THE CHILDREN ARE

23:37.149 --> 23:40.119
ENCOURAGED TO READ BOOKS ON A

23:40.119 --> 23:41.120
SUBJECT THAT INTERESTS THEM.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.121
AND ROBERTO MARTINEZ ADDED THIS:

23:42.121 --> 23:43.222
TEACHERS NEED TO ENGAGE IN

23:43.222 --> 23:44.156
CREATING THE DESIRE TO READ, NOT

23:44.156 --> 23:45.591
GIVING EXTRA READING

23:45.591 --> 23:47.059
ASSIGNMENTS.

23:47.059 --> 23:48.060
GREAT STORYTELLING ALWAYS LEAVES

23:48.060 --> 23:49.528
LISTENERS CRAVING MORE.

23:49.528 --> 23:51.063
FINALLY, THIS FROM ELLEN LESSE

23:51.063 --> 23:52.631
GERSHENBAUM:

23:52.631 --> 23:53.599
AS AN INNER CITY TEACHER, THE

23:53.599 --> 23:54.700
ANSWER IS NOT EXTRA READING

23:54.700 --> 23:57.169
TIME.

23:57.169 --> 23:58.604
24 HOURS A DAY WOULDN'T MAKE A

23:58.604 --> 23:59.938
DIFFERENCE!

23:59.938 --> 24:01.573
THE ANSWER LIES IN THE EDUCATION

24:01.573 --> 24:03.442
OF PARENTS SO THEY KNOW HOW TO

24:03.442 --> 24:05.010
RAISE THEIR KIDS!

24:05.010 --> 24:06.312
THEY ARE FIVE YEARS BEHIND WHEN

24:06.312 --> 24:07.813
THEY ENTER KINDERGARTEN, AND

24:07.813 --> 24:08.981
THAT CAN NEVER BE MADE UP.

24:08.981 --> 24:10.182
AS ALWAYS, YOU CAN LET US KNOW

24:10.182 --> 24:11.450
