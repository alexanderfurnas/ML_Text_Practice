JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:05.706 --> 00:06.840 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:06.874 --> 00:08.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:

00:08.709 --> 00:11.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
I said I would take process
seriously, and

00:11.745 --> 00:15.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I did. I chose a serious man and
an exemplary
judge.

00:15.148 --> 00:20.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
appoints federal
Judge Merrick Garland to the
Supreme Court,

00:20.921 --> 00:24.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Republicans double down on
their pledge
to block the nominee.

00:24.758 --> 00:31.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead this
Wednesday: As
the GOP field narrows, Ted Cruz
and John Kasich

00:31.365 --> 00:36.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
brand themselves as the
alternative to Donald
Trump. But is it too late?

00:36.136 --> 00:41.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And an exclusive
report on
the details surrounding why Army
Sergeant

00:41.608 --> 00:45.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bowe Bergdahl walked off his
post in Afghanistan
in 2009.

00:45.846 --> 00:50.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EUGENE FIDELL, Attorney for Bowe
Bergdahl:
Feeling that there was no
alternative way

00:50.183 --> 00:55.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get his concerns about
circumstances in
the unit and the lack of
leadership in the

00:55.188 --> 00:59.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
unit, Sergeant Bergdahl
concluded that he
had to get to a higher echelon.

00:59.293 --> 01:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:06.633 --> 01:09.002 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:09.036 --> 01:20.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The battle was
officially joined
today over the vacancy on the
U.S. Supreme

01:20.280 --> 01:24.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Court. The president formally
opened the fray,
nominating the head of the
federal appeals

01:24.685 --> 01:26.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
court for the District of
Columbia.

01:26.520 --> 01:30.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Today, I am nominating chief
Judge Merrick

01:30.424 --> 01:33.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Brian Garland to join the
Supreme Court.

01:33.493 --> 01:38.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The announcement was
greeted with
applause in the Rose Garden as
the president

01:38.966 --> 01:40.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hailed his nominee.

01:40.834 --> 01:44.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Judge Garland has
earned a track
record of building consensus as
a thoughtful,

01:44.604 --> 01:49.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fair-minded judge who follows
the law. He's
shown a rare ability to bring
together odd

01:49.643 --> 01:56.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
couples, assemble unlikely
coalitions, persuade
colleagues with wide-ranging
judicial philosophies

01:56.383 --> 01:58.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to sign onto his opinions.

01:58.185 --> 02:02.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That was calculated
to make the
case that Senate Republicans
should at least

02:03.023 --> 02:04.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
give Garland a chance.

02:04.958 --> 02:10.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: To suggest that
someone as qualified
and respected as Merrick Garland
doesn't even

02:10.330 --> 02:16.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deserve a hearing, let alone an
up-or-down
vote, to join an institution as
important

02:16.069 --> 02:21.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as our Supreme Court, when
two-thirds of Americans
believe otherwise, that would be
unprecedented.

02:21.775 --> 02:23.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDGE MERRICK GARLAND, U.S.
Supreme Court
Nominee: This is the greatest
honor of my

02:23.910 --> 02:25.645 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

02:25.679 --> 02:28.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The judge choked
back tears as
he thanked the president, and he
seemed to

02:28.648 --> 02:30.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
make his own appeal.

02:30.550 --> 02:36.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDGE MERRICK GARLAND: Fidelity
to the Constitution
and the law has been the
cornerstone of my

02:36.189 --> 02:43.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
professional life, and it's the
hallmark of
the kind of judge I have tried
to be for the

02:43.363 --> 02:50.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
past 18 years. If the Senate
sees fit to confirm
me to the position for which I
have been nominated

02:50.404 --> 02:54.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today, I promise to continue on
that course.

02:54.241 --> 03:00.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Garland is 63. He
left private
practice for the Justice
Department in 1993,

03:01.014 --> 03:06.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and oversaw its response to the
Oklahoma City
bombing. President Clinton then
nominated

03:06.753 --> 03:10.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him to the D.C. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
He was confirmed in 1997.

03:10.390 --> 03:16.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the time, he drew praise from
the likes
of Republican Orrin Hatch, then
chair of the

03:17.030 --> 03:18.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Senate Judiciary Committee.

03:18.765 --> 03:23.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. ORRIN HATCH (R), Utah: He
belongs on
the court. And I believe he is
not only a

03:23.036 --> 03:28.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fine nominee, but is as good as
Republicans
can expect from this
administration. In fact,

03:28.909 --> 03:30.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I would place him at the top of
the list.

03:30.744 --> 03:34.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That was then. This
is now.

03:34.114 --> 03:39.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now Garland is being nominated
to replace
conservative Justice Antonin
Scalia, who died

03:39.486 --> 03:45.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last month. Republicans fear
that confirming
him to the high court would
create a liberal

03:45.459 --> 03:47.394 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
majority.

03:47.427 --> 03:51.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, within minutes of the
president's announcement,
Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell went

03:51.164 --> 03:55.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the Senate floor to double
down on his
pledge to deny the president as
much as a

03:55.902 --> 03:57.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hearing on his nominee.

03:57.704 --> 04:01.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader:
The decision the Senate
announced weeks ago

04:01.241 --> 04:10.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remains about a principle and
not a person,
about a principle, and not a
person. It seems

04:10.317 --> 04:16.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clear that President Obama made
this nomination
not, not with the intent of
seeing the nominee

04:16.456 --> 04:21.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
confirmed, but in order to
politicize it for
purposes of the election.

04:21.962 --> 04:27.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the presidential
campaign trail,
Republicans Ted Cruz and John
Kasich seconded

04:27.567 --> 04:32.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that notion, while Democrats
Hillary Clinton
and Bernie Sanders issued
statements of support

04:32.739 --> 04:34.541 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for Garland.

04:34.574 --> 04:39.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, that sentiment was far
from universal,
even among the president's own
party. Civil

04:39.246 --> 04:44.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
rights activists and
progressives wanted an
African-American woman or
another minority

04:44.684 --> 04:49.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nominee, possibly Indian-born
federal appeals
Judge Sri Srinivasan.

04:49.623 --> 04:54.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a "NewsHour" interview today,
White House
senior adviser Valerie Jarrett
explained the

04:54.060 --> 04:55.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
president's thinking.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VALERIE JARRETT, Senior
Presidential Adviser:
He's nominated two women to the
court before,

04:57.797 --> 05:01.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of them a Latino woman, so
obviously he
believes there are lots of
people who are

05:01.601 --> 05:05.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
qualified. The question isn't,
is the person
qualified? The question is, who
is the best

05:05.906 --> 05:07.440 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
person for it?

05:07.474 --> 05:09.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In this instance, he made the
judgment that
that would be the chief judge.

05:09.709 --> 05:14.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The White House says
Judge Garland
began making calls to senators
this afternoon,

05:14.648 --> 05:21.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and will go to Capitol Hill
tomorrow for meet-and-greets.
And in spite of the pushback,
several Republicans

05:21.087 --> 05:24.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have said they may meet with, if
not vote
for him.

05:24.824 --> 05:30.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will have a closer look at
Judge Garland
and hear from both sides in the
Senate after

05:30.297 --> 05:32.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the news summary.

05:32.232 --> 05:35.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: Republican
Donald Trump warned against
trying to deny

05:35.702 --> 05:41.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him the party's presidential
nomination if
it comes down to a contested
convention. Trump

05:41.675 --> 05:46.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Democrat Hillary Clinton
padded their
delegate leads in Tuesday's
primaries, and

05:46.913 --> 05:51.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their rivals became even longer
shots. We
will have a full report later in
the program.

05:51.618 --> 05:56.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Federal Reserve
decided to
keep short-term interest rates
unchanged today.

05:56.356 --> 06:00.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Policy-makers at the Central
Bank said the
economy is growing, but still
faces risks

06:00.994 --> 06:02.896 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from abroad.

06:02.929 --> 06:08.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Fed Chair Janet Yellen
underscored that two
rate hikes are still possible
this year, depending

06:08.101 --> 06:09.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on economic growth.

06:09.970 --> 06:15.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANET YELLEN, Federal Reserve
Chair: If events
continue to unfold in that way,
we are likely

06:15.809 --> 06:22.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to gradually raise rates over
time. Again,
that's not fixed in stone. We
will watch how

06:22.148 --> 06:29.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the economy behaves. We're
prepared to respond
if things transpire differently.

06:29.756 --> 06:34.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The fed raised it's
key rate in
December after years at a record
low.

06:35.028 --> 06:38.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wall Street had
been lower
before the Fed's announcement,
but stocks

06:39.032 --> 06:46.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rose on the news. The Dow Jones
industrial
average gained 74 points to
close at 17325.

06:46.673 --> 06:50.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 35, and the S&amp;P
500 added
11.

06:50.777 --> 06:55.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The state Supreme
Court in Ohio
gave the green light today for
officials to

06:55.415 --> 07:01.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
execute a convicted killer
again. They tried
and failed in 2009 to put Romell
Broom to

07:01.421 --> 07:07.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
death by lethal injection. After
two hours
and 18 attempts, the
executioners could not

07:07.460 --> 07:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
find a vein. The court today
rejected Broom's
argument that, under double
jeopardy, the

07:12.799 --> 07:14.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
state gets only one try.

07:14.634 --> 07:19.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: An American
tourist arrested
in North Korea was sentenced
today to 15 years

07:19.906 --> 07:25.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of hard labor. Otto Warmbier is
a 21-year-old
student at the University of
Virginia. He

07:25.912 --> 07:31.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was charged with subversion
after confessing
he tried to steal a propaganda
banner. The

07:31.351 --> 07:37.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
verdict came down after just an
hour in court,
where Warmbier offered a tearful
plea to be

07:37.324 --> 07:39.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
forgiven and sent home.

07:39.159 --> 07:51.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OTTO WARMBIER, American Student:
My brother
and my sister need me. I beg
that you see

07:51.071 --> 07:55.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that I am only human, how I have
made the
worse mistake of my life.

07:56.009 --> 08:01.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. State
Department called
the sentence unduly harsh. And
in a separate

08:01.848 --> 08:06.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
development, President Obama
ordered new sanctions
against the North over its
recent nuclear

08:06.820 --> 08:08.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and missile tests.

08:08.722 --> 08:13.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In Nigeria, two
women blew themselves
up at a mosque, killing at least
24 people

08:13.593 --> 08:19.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and wounding 18. It happened in
Maiduguri
during dawn prayers. One
attacker struck inside

08:19.499 --> 08:25.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the mosque. The second targeted
worshipers
trying to escape. Officials
suspect Boko Haram,

08:25.438 --> 08:28.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the militants trying to carve
out their own
Islamic State.

08:28.141 --> 08:33.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A manhunt is
under way in Brussels
for two suspects with possible
ties to last

08:33.880 --> 08:40.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year's Paris attacks. They fled
last night
after a police raid turned into
a shoot-out.

08:40.186 --> 08:46.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An Algerian man was killed, and
investigators
uncovered a trove of weapons and
ammunition.

08:46.593 --> 08:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They also found an Islamic State
flag. The
November shootings in Paris left
130 dead.

08:53.433 --> 08:59.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, today, French police
arrested four people
suspected of planning a new
attack.

08:59.472 --> 09:05.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Brazil's president
and her predecessor
moved today to stay ahead of a
growing corruption

09:05.145 --> 09:11.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scandal. Former President Luiz
Inacio Lula
da Silva was named chief of
staff, with legal

09:11.384 --> 09:16.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
protections that could keep him
out of jail.
He's also expected to help
President Dilma

Rousseff fight to fend off
impeachment.

09:18.425 --> 09:24.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And with
apologies to Disneyland,
Denmark is now officially the
happiest place

09:24.898 --> 09:30.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on earth. The United Nations
says so in a
new survey of countries based on
health data,

09:31.004 --> 09:38.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
job security rates and other
social and political
factors. The United States
ranked 13th. Burundi

09:38.178 --> 09:38.845 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
came in last.

09:38.878 --> 09:40.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I'm happy enough.

09:40.447 --> 09:41.247 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

09:41.281 --> 09:43.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I guess 13th is
OK.

09:43.082 --> 09:47.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Still to come on the
"NewsHour"
senators weigh in on President
Obama's Supreme

09:47.387 --> 09:53.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Court nominee; Donald Trump and
Hillary Clinton's
improved path to the White
House; an exclusive

09:53.393 --> 10:01.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
report on Army Sergeant Bowe
Bergdahl; and
much more.

10:01.501 --> 10:15.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: If confirmed,
he'd become the
third justice appointed to the
Supreme Court

10:15.148 --> 10:19.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by President Obama. So, who is
Merrick Garland?

10:19.219 --> 10:24.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To answer that question, we turn
to Seth Waxman.
He was the U.S. solicitor
general under President

10:24.757 --> 10:30.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton, in charge of that
administration's
cases before the Supreme Court.
He now focuses

10:30.296 --> 10:36.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Supreme Court litigation in
private practice.
And Marcia Coyle, chief
Washington correspondent

10:36.503 --> 10:40.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for "The National Law Journal"
and a "NewsHour"
regular.

10:40.106 --> 10:42.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome to you both.

10:42.041 --> 10:46.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Seth Waxman, you have known
Merrick Garland
since you were in college
together. What should

10:46.646 --> 10:48.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we know about him?

10:48.414 --> 10:53.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SETH WAXMAN, Former U.S.
Solicitor General:
Merrick Garland is a grand slam
nominee for

10:53.186 --> 10:57.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Supreme Court, not just a
home run, but
a grand slam nominee.

10:57.824 --> 11:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has every qualification to be
a truly great
Supreme Court justice. He is --
he has a very

11:06.933 --> 11:16.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
keen intellect. He thinks,
writes and speaks
very clearly. He is the
consummate collegial

11:17.010 --> 11:24.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
human being in his personal life
and in his
professional life. He is a
terrific, terrific,

11:24.651 --> 11:29.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and always has been a terrific
listener to
other people's views.

11:29.756 --> 11:39.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He decides everything very
deliberately. He
is a very careful person, a very
considerate

11:39.165 --> 11:48.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
person. I doubt very much that
there is anybody
who has known Merrick Garland
personally or

11:48.641 --> 11:55.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
has been a professional
colleague or adversary
of his that wouldn't say that
this man has

11:55.081 --> 12:01.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all the qualifications to be an
important
jurist and a valued colleague
for the other

12:02.021 --> 12:05.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Supreme Court justices, whatever
their jurisprudential
views.

12:05.758 --> 12:08.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's quite an
endorsement.

12:08.761 --> 12:11.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Marcia Coyle, where does he fit
on the ideological
spectrum?

12:11.931 --> 12:15.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, "The National Law
Journal":
Well, I think his reputation is
as a centrist.

12:15.802 --> 12:22.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he has that reputation
because you can't
peg him as always liberal or
always conservative.

12:22.775 --> 12:30.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is not, on the D.C. Circuit,
always pro-government
when agency cases come before
him. He's not

12:30.083 --> 12:38.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
always pro-environmentalist, or
pro-business.
He is in the middle. So, on
those types of

12:38.257 --> 12:44.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cases that the D.C. Circuit gets
-- and that
court has a very heavy, steady
diet of federal

12:44.564 --> 12:48.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
regulatory cases -- he is a
centrist.

12:48.101 --> 12:53.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we don't know is how he
might rule in
sort of the culture war issues
that currently

12:53.706 --> 12:58.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are now before the Supreme
Court, because
he hasn't had those types of
issues.

12:58.044 --> 13:01.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Because those are
the type
cases that presumably don't come
up.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: That's right,
Judy.

13:02.882 --> 13:07.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it is fair to say that
President Obama
wouldn't have nominated someone
like Justice

13:07.754 --> 13:13.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Scalia, for example. He
nominated Merrick
Garland because at least he sees
in Merrick

13:13.326 --> 13:19.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Garland, aside from his really
unassailable
qualifications, someone who
shares a similar

13:19.232 --> 13:20.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
approach to the law.

13:20.733 --> 13:23.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What would you
add to that,
Seth Waxman?

13:23.169 --> 13:30.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SETH WAXMAN: You know, I think
Merrick has
a reputation for being a
centrist, a prudent

13:30.443 --> 13:32.412 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
jurist.

13:32.445 --> 13:36.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I want to say that, you
know, since we
were in college together,
Merrick has had

13:36.149 --> 13:42.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the deserved reputation for
being a careful,
deliberate, prudent person. I
don't mean to

13:42.388 --> 13:47.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say that he's timid. He makes
decisions, and
he makes them when they have to
be made, and

13:47.994 --> 13:53.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he makes difficult decisions,
but he doesn't
decide anything, he doesn't
decide things

13:53.266 --> 13:58.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in his -- with the exception of
his decision
to marry Lynn, he doesn't decide
things based

13:58.604 --> 13:59.672 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on emotion.

13:59.706 --> 14:00.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which he
mentioned today at
the...

14:00.506 --> 14:02.275 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

14:02.308 --> 14:05.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SETH WAXMAN: And he doesn't make
decisions
based on the received wisdom of
other people.

14:05.812 --> 14:09.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He doesn't say, oh, well, all
these people
that I respect think this, so I
should think

14:09.248 --> 14:11.017 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

14:11.050 --> 14:16.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, Merrick goes back to
first principles
when deciding things like which
ski run to

14:16.923 --> 14:24.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take when we're skiing together.
He is a careful,
prudent person. And, you know,
honestly, in

14:24.297 --> 14:29.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the 45 years we have known each
other, I don't
think that we have ever had a
political discussion.

14:29.335 --> 14:35.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nobody would call me politically
astute, and
nobody would call Merrick
politically active.

14:35.775 --> 14:40.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I honestly can say I don't know
what his views
are on some of these hot-button
issues. I

14:40.913 --> 14:49.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think the president's decision
to nominate
him reflects a determination to
make an unassailable,

14:49.122 --> 14:51.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
merits nomination.

14:51.057 --> 14:56.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Marcia, how does
this -- you
were telling -- you were saying
to us earlier

14:56.662 --> 15:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is kind of an unprecedented
situation,
where the Senate is not only
saying we're

15:00.767 --> 15:04.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not going to hold hearings. Many
of the Republicans
are saying, we don't even want
to meet with

15:04.537 --> 15:05.204 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Yes, that's true.

15:06.539 --> 15:08.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How does this
compare with
other nominations?

15:08.407 --> 15:13.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Well, it doesn't
compare with
any in my past, and I have
covered confirmation

15:13.646 --> 15:18.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hearings and nominations since
the Robert
Bork hearings in 1987.

15:18.985 --> 15:24.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even as controversial as Robert
Bork was,
the Senate did have a hearing.
To say they

15:24.457 --> 15:30.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- some -- some senators to say
they wouldn't
even meet Judge Garland, I
think, is unprecedented,

15:30.530 --> 15:37.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, you know, personally, a
little disrespectful.
This is a presidential
nomination to the U.S.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.572 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Supreme Court.

15:39.605 --> 15:43.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Seth Waxman,
finally, you know,
it's already being said that
Merrick Garland

15:43.476 --> 15:48.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a sacrificial lamb, that,
given the disposition
of the Senate majority, that he
isn't going

15:48.214 --> 15:53.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get a hearing, that his name
is being put
out there and it's going
nowhere. Is he prepared

15:53.753 --> 15:56.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- knowing him, is he prepared
to be just
that?

15:57.023 --> 16:01.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SETH WAXMAN: Well, I should say
that, as close
as I feel to Merrick, I haven't
spoken to

16:01.127 --> 16:05.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him since Justice Scalia passed
away. We haven't
had a conversation on this.

16:05.565 --> 16:10.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, based on what I know about
him, I can
tell you that he is the kind of
person who

16:10.203 --> 16:15.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think feels tremendously
honored to have
been nominated, to have been
even considered

16:15.775 --> 16:21.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the president. And he doesn't
-- he's not
the kind of person who holds a
grudge or gets

16:21.047 --> 16:23.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
angry or ever displays anger.

16:23.249 --> 16:28.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it turns out that he's not
given a fair,
respectful treatment by the
Senate, it would

16:28.554 --> 16:33.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be regrettable for the nation,
but he will
go on being a terrific jurist as
the chief

16:33.326 --> 16:34.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
judge of the D.C. Circuit.

16:34.894 --> 16:38.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Seth Waxman,
Marcia Coyle,
we thank you both.

16:38.264 --> 16:38.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SETH WAXMAN: Thank you.

16:38.965 --> 16:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Thank you, Judy.

16:40.833 --> 16:44.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Now that the
president has announced
his nomination for the Supreme
Court vacancy,

16:44.804 --> 16:50.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the responsibility falls
squarely on the Senate
to act or perhaps, in this case,
not to act.

16:50.476 --> 16:55.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke a short time ago to two
members of
the Senate Judiciary Committee,
first, Republican

16:55.147 --> 16:57.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah.

16:57.116 --> 16:58.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, Senator.

16:58.918 --> 17:02.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you probably are aware,
several of your
Republican colleagues have said
they at least

17:02.288 --> 17:05.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plan to meet with Judge Merrick
Garland. Do
you plan to?

17:05.892 --> 17:09.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. ORRIN HATCH (R), Utah:
We're friends.
I would be happy to meet with
him any time,

17:09.662 --> 17:11.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but it isn't going to change the
viewpoint.

17:11.430 --> 17:16.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the viewpoint is, is that we
ought to
put this off until the next
election, or until

17:16.969 --> 17:21.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after the election, so that it's
fair to both
sides and we get it out of this
what really

17:22.008 --> 17:25.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- what really is a toxic
presidential election
process. It's just terrible.

17:25.778 --> 17:29.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, you're saying if
this were
not a toxic election process, it
would be

17:29.081 --> 17:31.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OK for any president to be able
to make his
nominee?

17:31.617 --> 17:33.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEN. ORRIN HATCH: Well, it
depends.

17:33.586 --> 17:36.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It depends on -- you know, I
don't know what's
going to happen after this
election, but putting

17:36.989 --> 17:42.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it off until after the election
seems to me
to be a wise thing to do. It
will bring people

17:42.128 --> 17:44.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
together better than just trying
to ram it
through this time.

17:44.897 --> 17:48.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Does it seem right
to you that
this should be about the
election process,

17:48.668 --> 17:50.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rather than about the quality of
the nominee?

17:50.403 --> 17:55.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. ORRIN HATCH: Yes, look, the
quality of
the nominee isn't an issue. The
person is

17:55.107 --> 17:56.809 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not an issue.

17:56.842 --> 18:02.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is an issue is, should we
do this during
this toxic presidential election
process?

18:02.815 --> 18:07.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because you have seen over the
recent years
-- and the Democrats started
this when they

18:07.320 --> 18:11.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really destroyed Bork, who was
one of the
all-time great legal minds.

18:11.557 --> 18:15.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So you're saying --
let me just
get this right -- that, all
things being equal,

18:15.461 --> 18:19.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if this were not an election
year, but it
was still this president making
the nomination,

18:19.832 --> 18:24.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
knowing what you know about
Merrick Garland,
you could conceive of supporting
him?

18:24.804 --> 18:28.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. ORRIN HATCH: Well, I didn't
say that.
I'm saying that, you know, we
have only had

18:28.741 --> 18:33.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a very few times in history
where somebody
has been put up during a
presidential election

18:33.646 --> 18:35.448 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

18:35.481 --> 18:40.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1916 was the last effective
time, and that's
when Chief Justice Charles Evans
Hughes decided

18:40.453 --> 18:48.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to leave the court and run for
president.
We had one other time when Judge
Kennedy was

18:48.327 --> 18:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
confirmed after -- during a
presidential year,
but he was nominated in the year
before, and

18:54.467 --> 19:02.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that only came after the toxic,
you know,
Bork proceedings, where his
reputation was

19:02.608 --> 19:04.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really attacked viciously by
Democrats.

19:04.777 --> 19:12.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So -- and I can tell you this.
If the table
were turned and this was -- and
the Democrats

19:12.118 --> 19:16.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are in charge, I guarantee you
-- or excuse
me -- Republicans had the
presidency, I guarantee

19:16.856 --> 19:20.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you the Democrats wouldn't do
anything different
from what the Republicans are
doing.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I think it's only right.

19:22.928 --> 19:26.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, since so much of
the toxicity,
as you describe it, in this
election has happened

19:26.766 --> 19:32.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the Republican side of the
competition,
do you worry that if a Democrat
were elected

19:32.671 --> 19:38.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president, you may have missed a
chance to
at least hear -- hold a hearing
for someone

19:38.611 --> 19:43.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you who might actually find more
acceptable
than a Democrat, the next
Democrat might nominate?

19:43.249 --> 19:46.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. ORRIN HATCH: Well, I think
it's been
toxic on both sides, and it's
going to get

19:47.019 --> 19:52.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worse, as far as I can see. So,
you know,
the Democrat election hasn't
been a walk in

19:52.658 --> 19:54.460 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the park either.

19:54.493 --> 19:57.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I will tell you one thing
I'm tired of.
And that is, when it comes to
the Supreme

19:57.296 --> 20:02.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Court, we should all be
venerating that court
and venerating the people on it.
And to put

20:02.401 --> 20:09.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them through -- put even a good
candidate
through this toxic process
during a presidential

20:09.075 --> 20:14.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election, which really hasn't
been done before
in this way, I think, is a
tremendous -- would

20:14.580 --> 20:16.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be a tremendous mistake.

20:16.449 --> 20:19.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Republicans just aren't
going to do that.
Neither would Democrats. If the
position was

20:19.585 --> 20:23.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
changed and it was the other way
around, the
Democrats wouldn't be going
ahead either.

20:23.422 --> 20:26.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, what happens
next? We just
go through the motions for a
couple months?

20:26.592 --> 20:31.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. ORRIN HATCH: Well, I think
-- I think
people ought to start accepting
that the Republicans

20:31.897 --> 20:34.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are not going to do this at this
time, in
this presidential election.

20:34.800 --> 20:39.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there will come a time when
it will have
to be done, regardless of who is
president.

20:39.839 --> 20:44.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, yes, to answer your
question, yes, I
would prefer having a Republican
president,

20:44.043 --> 20:45.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because I think you will get
better judges.

20:45.978 --> 20:53.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, if Mrs. Clinton
is elected,
she's certainly going to be able
to appoint

20:53.385 --> 20:57.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the judges that she thinks are
the better
type of judges. And they will be
much more

20:57.857 --> 21:04.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
liberal than the judges and
certainly justices
that the Republicans would
promote.

21:04.497 --> 21:07.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, I suppose
that's the gamble
then.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah,
thank you very
much.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEN. ORRIN HATCH: Well, nice to
be with you.

21:10.970 --> 21:15.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now we turn to a
Democrat on the
Senate Judiciary Committee,
Senator Al Franken

21:15.941 --> 21:17.743 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Minnesota.

21:17.776 --> 21:22.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator, what do you make of the
nominee that
was put forward this morning,
and, also, the

21:22.781 --> 21:24.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republican reaction to him
already?

21:24.216 --> 21:26.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. AL FRANKEN (D), Minnesota:
Well, I think
he was a great choice.

21:26.752 --> 21:33.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been hearing about Judge
Garland for
a long time. He, I know, was in
the running

21:33.692 --> 21:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Justice Kagan's seat, and I
think maybe
Sotomayor's. I have heard great
things about

21:40.599 --> 21:46.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him from a number of friends,
including from
Orrin Hatch, my Republican
colleague from

21:46.639 --> 21:50.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Utah, who is on the Judiciary
Committee.

21:50.576 --> 21:59.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that this was a great
nominee because
he's a consensus-builder. He's
widely respected.

21:59.652 --> 22:06.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that my Republican
colleagues
who are taking a very unpopular
position with

22:06.125 --> 22:13.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the American people, which was
not to meet
with, not to give a hearing to
the president's

22:13.432 --> 22:18.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nomination, not to do the job
that's there
in the Constitution for us to
do, to provide

22:18.837 --> 22:22.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
advice and consent, I think
they're going
to back off of that, and I think
we're going

22:22.841 --> 22:25.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to have a hearing and a vote on
Judge Garland.

22:25.911 --> 22:29.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: What indication do
you have that
that's going to happen? They
have been as

22:30.015 --> 22:35.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tough and firmer today, if
anything, about
their -- Senator McConnell has,
even Senator

22:35.187 --> 22:38.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hatch has -- that this is not
going to happen.
How do you get around that?

22:38.657 --> 22:46.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. AL FRANKEN: Well, for
example, the chairman
of the committee, Chairman
Grassley, has said

22:46.131 --> 22:53.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he wouldn't meet with the
-- any nominee,
and, today, he announced that he
was going

22:53.973 --> 22:59.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to have a phone call with Judge
Garland to
discuss a meeting.

22:59.311 --> 23:04.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think you announce that
you're calling
-- having a phone call to
discuss a meeting

23:04.083 --> 23:08.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unless you're going to have a
meeting. So
it feels like they're softening.
And I know

23:08.621 --> 23:16.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that there are seven meetings
scheduled from
Republican senators, including
someone as

23:16.695 --> 23:18.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
conservative as Senator Inhofe.

23:18.464 --> 23:26.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that has to do with the
unbelievably
stellar job that Judge Garland
did on the

23:26.639 --> 23:28.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Oklahoma City bombing.

23:28.440 --> 23:33.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, I certainly
don't have to
tell that you saying that you're
open to a

23:33.312 --> 23:37.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meeting is not saying that
you're opening
to a hearing or saying that
you're opening

23:37.616 --> 23:40.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to bringing it to a vote on the
floor of the
Senate.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEN. AL FRANKEN: I'm -- I'm
aware of that.

23:42.454 --> 23:48.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What I was saying is, it
represents a softening
of their position. It represents
movement

23:48.327 --> 23:55.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that happened in the first hours
after he
announced this nomination. So,
that seems

23:55.167 --> 23:56.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be movement in the right
direction.

23:56.935 --> 24:01.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, you know, the
American people
have spoken pretty clearly in
polls, about

24:01.240 --> 24:11.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2-1, saying this is a -- this is
a lousy idea
for Republicans not to do what's
in the Constitution,

24:11.750 --> 24:16.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our responsibility in the
Constitution, which
is provide advice and consent,
which we have

24:16.322 --> 24:23.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been doing through hearings
since 1916. They
refuse to have a hearing, and
they refuse

24:23.796 --> 24:25.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to vote on this at their peril.

24:25.597 --> 24:28.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Senator Franken,
you're a pretty
liberal guy. What do you say to
progressives

24:28.834 --> 24:32.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who think the president missed
an opportunity
to make a more liberal pick?

24:32.738 --> 24:36.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. AL FRANKEN: I think the
president made
a wise pick.

24:36.942 --> 24:44.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I -- the White House reached out
to Democrats
on the Judiciary Committee,
asked us what

24:44.516 --> 24:52.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of nominee we'd like to
see. I said,
I want somebody who, at the end
of the hearings,

24:52.358 --> 24:57.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the American people will say, "I
want nine
of those to be the Supreme
Court. That's what

24:57.963 --> 25:00.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I would like. I would like nine
of those."

25:00.933 --> 25:06.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it seems to me, from
everything I know
and I have heard about Judge
Garland, that

25:06.805 --> 25:08.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you would want nine of those.

25:08.340 --> 25:11.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Senator Al Franken,
Democrat of
Minnesota, thank you very much.

25:11.677 --> 25:20.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEN. AL FRANKEN: Thank you,
Gwen.

25:20.652 --> 25:32.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now the latest on
the presidential
race of 2016.

25:32.831 --> 25:37.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump
scored big
wins in Tuesday's voting, and
hold narrow

25:37.736 --> 25:43.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leads in Missouri, where the
races have not
yet been called. But their
remaining challengers

25:43.208 --> 25:45.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are soldiering on.

25:45.043 --> 25:47.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate:
Isn't it interesting, for the
first time,

25:47.279 --> 25:52.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people are getting to see my
name, my face,
and hear my message, because I
labored in

25:52.518 --> 25:52.851 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
obscurity?

25:52.885 --> 25:54.753 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

25:54.787 --> 25:58.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Republican
Governor John Kasich
got right back to campaigning
this morning,

25:58.424 --> 26:04.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hoping for a new lease on
political life,
after claiming his first win in
his own home

26:04.530 --> 26:05.531 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
state, Ohio.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AUDIENCE: Kasich! Kasich!
Kasich!

26:07.599 --> 26:12.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kasich's victory
was the only
loss last night for Donald
Trump. But the

26:12.971 --> 26:17.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New York billionaire steamrolled
to victories
in Florida, North Carolina, and
Illinois.

26:17.509 --> 26:20.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
We're going to go forward, and
we're going

26:20.979 --> 26:24.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to win. But, more importantly,
we're going
to win for the country. We're
going to win,

26:24.650 --> 26:26.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
win, win, and we're not
stopping.

26:26.552 --> 26:32.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Counting results
from Missouri,
Trump now has 673 delegates,
well ahead of

26:32.758 --> 26:37.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the competition, and more than
half what's
needed to win the GOP
nomination.

26:38.030 --> 26:44.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On CNN this morning, Trump
warned of possible
trouble if he keeps building
strength and

26:44.803 --> 26:46.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then is blocked by fellow
Republicans.

26:46.805 --> 26:52.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I think we will
win before getting
to the convention, but I can
tell you, if

26:52.044 --> 26:58.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we didn't, and if we're 20 votes
short or
if we're 100 short, and we're at
1,100 and

26:58.684 --> 27:04.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
somebody else is at 500 or 400,
because we're
way ahead of everybody, I don't
think you

27:04.156 --> 27:08.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can say that we don't get it
automatically.
I think it would be -- I think
you would have

27:08.293 --> 27:10.062 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
riots.

27:10.095 --> 27:15.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Texas Senator Ted
Cruz is Trump's
closest rival, with 411
delegates, despite

27:15.367 --> 27:19.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his failure to come in first
anywhere on Tuesday.

27:19.037 --> 27:25.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With Florida Senator Marco Rubio
dropping
out last night, Cruz insisted
it's now a two-man

27:25.677 --> 27:27.513 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
race.

27:27.546 --> 27:30.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
Only two campaigns have a
plausible path to

27:30.148 --> 27:37.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the nomination, ours and Donald
Trump's. Only
one campaign has beaten Donald
Trump over

27:37.256 --> 27:39.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and over and over again.

27:39.157 --> 27:40.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

27:41.026 --> 27:44.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Former House
Speaker John Boehner
had said he might back his own
successor,

27:45.030 --> 27:52.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Paul Ryan, for president at the
GOP Convention.
But Ryan said today he wouldn't
accept the

27:52.437 --> 27:53.372 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nomination.

27:53.405 --> 27:55.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: But I think we
have had enough.

27:55.307 --> 27:59.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the meantime,
FOX News canceled
a debate scheduled for next
Monday, after

27:59.678 --> 28:03.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first Trump and then Kasich said
they wouldn't
attend.

28:04.016 --> 28:10.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Democratic side, Hillary
Clinton is
moving on after a sweep of wins
in Florida,

28:10.122 --> 28:14.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Illinois, North Carolina, and
Ohio last night.

28:14.359 --> 28:18.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
This is another Super Tuesday
for our campaign.

28:18.964 --> 28:20.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) ú

28:20.766 --> 28:25.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: We are
moving closer
to securing the Democratic Party
nomination

28:25.404 --> 28:27.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and winning this election in
November.

28:27.506 --> 28:29.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

28:29.474 --> 28:35.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The contests,
including still-uncalled
Missouri, brought her delegate
count to 1,606,

28:35.213 --> 28:40.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than two-thirds of what is
needed for
the Democratic nomination. That
puts her far

28:40.552 --> 28:43.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ahead of Bernie Sanders, who has
851.

28:43.188 --> 28:51.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The candidates now turn toward
contests in
three Western states next
Tuesday, Arizona,

28:51.296 --> 28:54.199 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Utah and Idaho.

28:54.232 --> 28:59.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more of last night's results
and what's
ahead this campaign cycle we
turn to Susan

28:59.471 --> 29:05.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Page, Washington bureau chief
for USA Today,
and Reid Wilson, chief political
correspondent

29:05.777 --> 29:07.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for The Morning Consult.

29:07.679 --> 29:09.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome back to both of you.

29:09.114 --> 29:11.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, let's start by talking about
the Democrats.

29:11.483 --> 29:15.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Susan, let's look at -- you have
looked at
these exit polls last night,
what the voters

29:15.287 --> 29:19.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were saying. Are there messages
there for
Hillary Clinton? What should she
take away

29:19.057 --> 29:20.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from what happened yesterday?

29:20.959 --> 29:22.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau
Chief, USA Today:
Hillary Clinton continues to
have challenges

29:22.761 --> 29:28.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have seen all along in this
election cycle.
She does very poorly among
voters under 30.

29:28.667 --> 29:33.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders is carrying them by
about 7-1. And
she scores poorly on the issue
of, is she

29:33.405 --> 29:37.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
honest and trustworthy? This is
actually a
challenge that she shares with
Donald Trump.

29:37.743 --> 29:39.645 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there are things that she
needs to address.

29:39.678 --> 29:43.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, she probably
has -- went
for five for five, if Missouri
goes the way

29:43.949 --> 29:49.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it seems to be going. That's a
big victory,
especially after that surprise
defeat in Michigan

29:49.488 --> 29:53.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a week ago, when it looked like
Sanders might
be coming from behind in those
-- in a big

29:53.592 --> 29:56.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Midwestern state. That didn't
prove to be
the case in Ohio.

29:56.628 --> 30:00.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, overall, I think the message
for Hillary
Clinton is, she is on the verge
of having

30:00.399 --> 30:04.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an unstoppable lead in getting
the number
of delegates she will need to
become the first

30:04.736 --> 30:07.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
woman ever nominated by a major
party for
president.

30:07.172 --> 30:10.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Reid, what else
do you see
in what the results were
yesterday?

30:10.442 --> 30:13.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON, Morning Consult:
Susan makes
a good point about Donald
Trump's honest and

30:13.378 --> 30:15.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
trustworthy problem here.

30:15.047 --> 30:20.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have got two party nomination
contests
that are nearing an end. Donald
Trump has

30:20.152 --> 30:24.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a plausible path to the
Republican nomination.
Ted Cruz's is much more
troubling. But if

30:24.923 --> 30:29.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have got a Donald Trump vs.
Hillary Clinton
general election, both
candidates are going

30:29.061 --> 30:33.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to start with extremely high
negative ratings,
and honest and trustworthy
questions from

30:33.198 --> 30:35.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
within their own party.

30:35.100 --> 30:38.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not just Democrats who
don't like Trump.
It's Republicans, too, who have
big questions

30:38.704 --> 30:40.405 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about him.

30:40.439 --> 30:43.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But on the
Democratic side,
what -- can you read something
into this?

30:43.175 --> 30:47.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We keep hearing they believe
that many voters
say she is not honest and
trustworthy. But

30:47.079 --> 30:49.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what is that getting at? What
are they saying?

30:49.047 --> 30:53.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: Well, Democrats are
looking,
by and large, for a candidate
who can win

30:53.552 --> 30:55.420 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in November.

30:55.454 --> 30:59.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you ask them which
candidate is most
electable, which candidate has
the experience

30:59.357 --> 31:04.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be president, Hillary Clinton
wins by leaps
and bounds among those
candidates, as widely

31:04.996 --> 31:08.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as Bernie Sanders does among
younger voters,
who are his biggest supporters.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What were you
going to add?

31:10.669 --> 31:13.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: I was going to say,
Hillary Clinton
has another problem in this FBI
investigation

31:13.805 --> 31:17.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into her use of a private e-mail
server when
she was secretary of state.

31:17.275 --> 31:20.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that bothers some
voters and people
are waiting to see, what does
the FBI conclude?

31:20.712 --> 31:24.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Could she even be indicted? She
says that's
not a possibility. But that's
the one thing

31:24.116 --> 31:27.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that gives people some pause.
And it gives
the Democrats some chills as
they go toward

31:27.886 --> 31:30.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- down the path of making her
the all-but-certain
nominee.

31:30.856 --> 31:34.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, as we
showed, she's way
ahead in delegates, Reid, but
Bernie Sanders

31:34.993 --> 31:39.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is still in the race. He didn't
do very well
yesterday. But he says he's not
going away.

31:39.531 --> 31:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But what is his role at this
point?

31:42.134 --> 31:45.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: Well, Bernie
Sanders has the
money to continue on. He has got
the tens

31:45.771 --> 31:49.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of millions of dollars. He's
been very successful
at raising money, especially
from small-dollar

31:49.875 --> 31:51.576 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
donors.

31:51.610 --> 31:54.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He spent last night in Arizona,
which, as
we have said, is the next
contest down the

31:54.880 --> 31:59.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
road, and barely mentioned
during his speech
last night that voting had
happened anywhere

31:59.985 --> 32:01.720 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
else.

32:01.753 --> 32:05.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders' role, though, is still
to try to
nudge the party to the left. And
he has been

32:05.056 --> 32:09.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
successful in that, in moving
Hillary Clinton
to the left on a number of key
issues over

32:09.361 --> 32:14.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the last couple of months.
Clinton, though,
has signaled that she's sort of
wrapping up

32:14.099 --> 32:18.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Democratic nomination, maybe
in her own
head, ready to move on to a
general.

32:18.603 --> 32:22.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She spent all of her victory
speech last night
talking about Donald Trump, not
about Bernie

32:22.407 --> 32:24.276 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sanders.

32:24.309 --> 32:26.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan, how much
does Hillary
Clinton have to continue to
contend with Bernie

32:26.645 --> 32:28.680 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sanders?

32:28.713 --> 32:31.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Well, last night,
she said, congratulations
on your vigorous campaign, and
then she ignored

32:31.883 --> 32:33.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him. She turned entirely to
Donald Trump.

32:33.718 --> 32:37.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the fact is, she probably
won't get over
the finish line maybe until
early June. And

32:37.622 --> 32:41.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders will be in this
race. Hillary
Clinton has a hard argument to
make that he

32:41.493 --> 32:45.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
needs to get out, because, you
know what,
eight years ago, Barack Obama
was making the

32:45.664 --> 32:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
same argument to her, and she
stayed in until
the very end.

32:48.934 --> 32:52.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, well,
let's talk
about -- some more about the
Republicans,

32:52.204 --> 32:53.939 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Reid.

32:53.972 --> 32:57.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump didn't win every
state. John
Kasich won his home state, his
first win,

32:57.809 --> 33:02.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Ohio. But where does Trump
sit right now
on the road to the nomination?

33:02.047 --> 33:07.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: He sits better than
anybody else
does by a long shot. He grew his
lead over

33:07.619 --> 33:13.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Ted Cruz, his nearest
competitor, by nearly
200 pledge delegates, once all
the final numbers

33:13.225 --> 33:15.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are sussed out from last night.

33:15.794 --> 33:20.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the other two candidates are
having to
explain more and more how their
path forward

33:20.498 --> 33:25.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exists. John Kasich has won so
few delegates,
that it's almost mathematically
impossible

33:25.437 --> 33:27.839 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for him to get to a nomination.

33:27.873 --> 33:32.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, Ted Cruz is
trying to force
Kasich out of the race. There's
an argument

33:32.210 --> 33:37.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be made, though, that if the
two of them
focus on their core voters, very
conservative

33:37.148 --> 33:42.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters for Ted Cruz, more
moderate, centrist
voters for John Kasich, that
that is the only

33:43.021 --> 33:48.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
path forward for both of them by
denying Donald
Trump a majority at the
convention in Cleveland.

33:48.326 --> 33:50.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's
interesting, Susan,
because you also hear the
argument that, if

33:50.295 --> 33:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of them drops out, it
becomes a one-on-one,
and thus a better chance to
stand up to Donald

33:55.200 --> 33:57.035 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

33:57.068 --> 33:59.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: I know that the
Trump people wanted
to win in Ohio, and, obviously,
that would

33:59.504 --> 34:03.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been a big victory. But the
fact is,
you can make the argument that
this is helpful

34:03.708 --> 34:05.477 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Donald Trump.

34:05.510 --> 34:09.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, John Kasich is in this
race. It denies
Ted Cruz what he's wanted for so
long, which

34:09.214 --> 34:12.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is to go head to head against
Donald Trump.
I think it makes this -- I think
it makes

34:12.717 --> 34:17.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things easier for Trump in a
way. Trump now
needs to get, what, about 55
percent, of the

34:17.355 --> 34:19.224 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
remaining convention delegates.

34:19.257 --> 34:24.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is probably a doable number
in a three-person
race, especially when where John
Kasich, it's

34:24.329 --> 34:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really hard to see the state
that he wins.
I don't think John Kasich is
likely to meet

34:28.667 --> 34:32.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the rule that allows him to be
nominated at
the convention. You have to have
a majority

34:32.270 --> 34:34.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of delegates in eight states.

34:34.673 --> 34:41.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He now has one. Only Donald
Trump has gotten
over the margin only -- over
that hurdle of

34:41.680 --> 34:46.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being -- having a majority of
delegates in
eight states. So, Kasich, you
know, he goes

34:46.318 --> 34:51.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to Pennsylvania today.
Pennsylvania doesn't
even vote for a month. There's a
long interval

34:51.089 --> 34:56.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here where I think Donald Trump
will be getting
convention delegates and John
Kasich won't.

34:56.428 --> 34:58.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's
interesting about the
eight states. I think a lot of
people have

34:58.730 --> 35:00.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not focused on that.

35:00.532 --> 35:05.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But given that sort of
interregnum period
we're going into when there are
not very many

35:05.036 --> 35:09.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contests, what does Donald Trump
need to be
doing? You mentioned some of the
problems

35:09.140 --> 35:11.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he still has with voters'
perceptions of him.

35:11.843 --> 35:15.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: Well, I mean, what
he needs to
be doing is probably the
opposite of what

35:15.947 --> 35:17.782 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he will do.

35:17.816 --> 35:21.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has been rewriting the
playbook of how
a modern presidential campaign
has been operating

35:21.486 --> 35:27.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the longest time. I think
what he needs
to do is to begin convincing
voters, especially

35:27.292 --> 35:31.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the centrists and independents
who are going
to decide this election, that he
is, in fact,

35:31.329 --> 35:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presidential, that he can do
something other
than take shots at his opponents
or take shots

35:35.033 --> 35:40.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the media or Megyn Kelly on
FOX News or
whoever the target of the day
is.

35:40.505 --> 35:44.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if he can do that, then I
think Hillary
Clinton has got something to
worry about in

35:44.042 --> 35:47.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
November if it's a Trump-Clinton
matchup.
As a matter of fact, I think
she's got something

35:47.779 --> 35:52.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to worry about no matter what.
Somebody, a
friend of mine likened this
race, a presidential

35:52.717 --> 35:54.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
race to being in a boxing match.

35:54.786 --> 35:57.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're fighting another
professional boxer,
you kind of know where the
punches are coming

35:58.023 --> 36:02.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from. But if you're fighting
somebody who
is not a traditional boxer, a
punch can come

36:02.193 --> 36:03.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from anywhere and lay you out.

36:03.528 --> 36:05.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is that how you
see it?

36:05.296 --> 36:07.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: I think Trump's
biggest problem,
though, is that about four in 10
Republican

36:07.732 --> 36:12.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
primary voters say, if he's the
nominee against
Hillary Clinton, they will look
-- they will

36:12.070 --> 36:14.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seriously consider a third-party
candidate.

36:14.239 --> 36:17.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if that's the race we have,
if it's Trump
vs. Clinton, don't you think we
will have

36:17.042 --> 36:21.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a third-party candidate of some
sort? So,
I think the first task Trump has
to do is

36:21.880 --> 36:27.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to reach out a bridge to these
Republican
voters before he can have a hope
of reaching

36:27.152 --> 36:30.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out to the independent voters
who will determine
the general election.

36:30.455 --> 36:35.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So much to
contemplate in the
coming weeks.

36:35.060 --> 36:35.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Susan Page, Reid Wilson, thank
you both.

36:35.693 --> 36:37.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: Thanks a lot.

36:37.362 --> 36:46.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: Thank you.

36:46.337 --> 36:55.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A sincere, if
misguided, young
soldier, or a deserter and even
a traitor?

36:55.113 --> 37:01.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bowe Bergdahl, the Army sergeant
who walked
off his post in June 2009, now
faces court-martial

37:01.686 --> 37:05.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on charges of desertion and
endangering troops.

37:05.256 --> 37:09.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still unclear, what motivated
Bergdahl to
leave his comrades.

37:09.627 --> 37:13.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The "PBS NewsHour" and The New
York Times
were recently provided with the
transcript

37:13.798 --> 37:19.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Bergdahl's only interview
with the Army's
top investigating officer, in
which the sergeant

37:19.370 --> 37:21.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lays out what made him do it.

37:22.006 --> 37:24.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the exclusive
details.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: May 31, 2014.

37:25.944 --> 37:31.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
This morning, I called Bob and
Jani Bergdahl,

37:31.316 --> 37:37.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and told them that, after nearly
five years
in captivity, their son Bowe is
coming home.

37:37.822 --> 37:43.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Army Sergeant
Bowe Bergdahl's
release came after the U.S.
agreed to free

37:43.328 --> 37:49.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
five Taliban leaders being held
at Guantanamo
Bay. To some, the announcement
brought joy

37:49.267 --> 37:54.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and relief. But others,
including soldiers
who served in his unit, saw
something different.

37:54.239 --> 37:58.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH KORDER, Former U.S. Army
Sergeant: It's
very frustrating to me to see
Bergdahl's family

37:58.176 --> 38:06.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on the TV being shown to
everyone. He's, at
best, a deserter and, at worst,
a traitor.

38:06.684 --> 38:11.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Five years
earlier, Bergdahl
had served at a remote outpost
called Mest

38:11.122 --> 38:16.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Malak in Southeastern
Afghanistan. This is
one of the post's observation
points on the

38:16.594 --> 38:18.429 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
top of a hill.

38:18.463 --> 38:25.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these are the last known
pictures of Bergdahl
in the days before he walked off
the post.

38:25.103 --> 38:28.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was captured by the Taliban
the day after
he left.

38:28.072 --> 38:33.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SGT. BOWE BERGDAHL, U.S. Army:
All's I was
seeing was basically leadership
failure.

38:33.411 --> 38:38.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Bergdahl had told
the podcast
"Serial" that leadership
problems were endangering

38:38.449 --> 38:43.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his unit, and that he planned to
hike to another
post to alert a senior Army
commander.

38:43.721 --> 38:45.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SGT. BOWE BERGDAHL: I was fully
confident
that when somebody actually took
a look at

38:45.657 --> 38:51.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the situation, and when people
started investigating
the situation, that people would
understand

38:51.296 --> 38:53.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that I was right.

38:53.631 --> 38:58.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now there's more
insight into
Bergdahl's thinking. It comes in
a transcript

38:58.036 --> 39:02.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
provided exclusively to the
"NewsHour" and
The New York Times by his
attorney from an

39:02.106 --> 39:07.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interview Bergdahl gave two
months after his
release to the Army's senior
investigating

39:07.245 --> 39:09.013 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
officer.

39:09.047 --> 39:12.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In it, he speaks of concerns he
had with immediate
commanders from the very
beginning of his

39:12.951 --> 39:14.686 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
enlistment.

39:14.719 --> 39:18.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here, for example, in a passage
read by a
"NewsHour" producer, he
described a platoon

39:18.690 --> 39:21.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inspection before his deployment
to Afghanistan.

39:21.626 --> 39:26.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PRODUCER: "The sergeant major
opens with:
'I know you all joined because
you want to

39:26.364 --> 39:31.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rape, pillage, and kill. That's
why I joined.
However, you need to think about
counterinsurgency.'

39:32.003 --> 39:35.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was a little taken aback by
it, because
that's not why I joined."

39:35.807 --> 39:39.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Bergdahl's lead
attorney, Eugene
Fidell, spoke to the
"NewsHour"'s Dan Sagalyn:

39:39.877 --> 39:43.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EUGENE FIDELL, Attorney for Bowe
Bergdahl:
He takes things literally that
are said to

39:43.481 --> 39:48.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him. He came into the Army with
some ideals,
and he had a notion of what the
Army was about

39:49.020 --> 39:53.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and what the environment that he
was going
to be in with was going to be
like. And it

39:53.658 --> 39:58.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sounds to me like he was quite
surprised to
have this kind of guidance.

39:58.563 --> 40:03.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Elsewhere in the
transcript,
Bergdahl talked of his first
mission in Afghanistan,

40:03.835 --> 40:08.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a night patrol in which his job
was to look
for explosive devices. One of
his commanders,

40:08.673 --> 40:12.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he told the Army investigator,
yelled at him
to speed up the search.

40:12.277 --> 40:16.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PRODUCER: "Hurry up goes against
the common
sense. He was just saying,
there's a possible

40:16.381 --> 40:21.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mine field in front of you.
Hurry up and go
hit a mine. That's amazing
coming from the

40:21.219 --> 40:26.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
person sitting back in the car
or in the truck.
You're telling me to hurry up in
situations

40:26.190 --> 40:31.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I shouldn't be hurrying. That
was my first
mission. That was my first
experience in Afghanistan.

40:31.696 --> 40:33.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that basically continued."

40:33.598 --> 40:40.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EUGENE FIDELL: I think that
Sergeant Bergdahl
expected that his command, that
his superiors

40:40.071 --> 40:46.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the chain of command would be
attentive
to his personal safety and the
personal safety

40:46.144 --> 40:48.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of other members of the unit.

40:48.146 --> 40:55.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the kind of instruction or
reaction that
he got from a fellow soldier in
that particular

40:55.720 --> 41:00.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
incident displayed an
indifference to personnel
safety.

41:00.491 --> 41:05.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Later, Bergdahl
spoke of the
possibility he'd be sent on a
suicide mission.

41:05.129 --> 41:08.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was around this point that he
decided to
leave the base.

41:08.333 --> 41:12.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PRODUCER: "What could happen is
this battalion
commander could see us, my
platoon, as this

41:12.537 --> 41:17.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stain on his reputation. Now,
sending us on
a suicide mission wouldn't be
the first in

41:17.475 --> 41:22.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
military history. Somebody doing
-- somebody
giving out an order on personal
agendas or

41:22.513 --> 41:26.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
off personal grievances, it is
not going to
be a first in military history."

41:26.718 --> 41:32.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EUGENE FIDELL: Feeling that
there was no alternative
way to get his concerns about
circumstances

41:32.390 --> 41:38.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the unit and the lack of
leadership in
the unit, Sergeant Bergdahl
concluded that

41:38.162 --> 41:46.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he had to get to a higher
echelon. His view
was that the way to do that was
to walk over

41:46.604 --> 41:48.339 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
land.

41:48.373 --> 41:50.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Nonsense, says
former Army
lawyer Lieutenant Colonel
Geoffrey Corn.

41:51.008 --> 41:54.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. COL. ®MD-BO /GEOFFREY CORN
(RET.), Former
Army Lawyer: His concerns over
the unit originated

41:54.612 --> 42:00.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
long before he ended up on that
combat outpost.
So what did he do about it? Did
he talk to

42:00.551 --> 42:06.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the chaplain? Did he go see the
inspector
general? Did he try and see any
of the superior

42:06.758 --> 42:09.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
officers in the chain of
command?

42:09.994 --> 42:16.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are all options that a
soldier has.
Is it possible there were
decisions or statements

42:16.200 --> 42:23.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where we say, that might have
been a little
bit cavalier or maybe a
subordinate would

42:23.241 --> 42:27.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been concerned about what
they were being
asked to do? Of course. This is
the nature

42:27.445 --> 42:30.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the military. It's the nature
of combat
operations.

42:30.915 --> 42:37.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Last July, an
Army forensic
psychiatrist issued a report
diagnosing Bergdahl

42:37.054 --> 42:43.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with schizotypal personality
disorder, a condition
marked by distorted perceptions,
eccentric

42:43.594 --> 42:46.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
behavior, and magical thinking.

42:46.831 --> 42:51.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bergdahl's attorney adds that
his client's
problems were known earlier,
when he was discharged

42:51.269 --> 42:55.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the Coast Guard, and that
he shouldn't
have been allowed to enlist in
the Army.

42:55.506 --> 43:00.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EUGENE FIDELL: Sergeant Bergdahl
was released
prematurely from U.S. Coast
Guard boot camp

43:00.978 --> 43:08.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at Cape May, New Jersey, because
of a psychological
or psychiatric incident. That,
in turn, required

43:08.453 --> 43:13.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him to get a waiver in order to
be enlisted
into the Army. For reasons I'm
unable to explain,

43:13.691 --> 43:19.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was given that waiver. The
Army has said,
well, we think it was an OK
thing to do. That

43:19.230 --> 43:20.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will be an issue at the trial.

JEFFREY BROWN: Geoffrey Corn
says Bergdahl's
mental state could be a relevant
factor in

43:24.836 --> 43:26.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the later part of the
court-martial.

LT. COL. GEOFFREY CORN: I think
it would be
a consideration in sentencing,
but it's no

43:30.241 --> 43:38.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
surprise that, when the military
is trying
to fill the ranks in an
all-volunteer force

43:38.316 --> 43:45.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a time where it's hard to
bring in the
number of recruits they need,
that they accept

43:45.122 --> 43:52.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
greater risk with the people
they bring in,
although I do find it somewhat
ironic that,

43:52.129 --> 43:58.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
based on public information that
we have seen,
that members of his unit thought
that, up

43:58.269 --> 44:01.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to this point, he was a fairly
good soldier.

JEFFREY BROWN: In fact, the
results of the
Bergdahl investigation produced
a dramatic

44:06.277 --> 44:14.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
split within top Army ranks. The
senior Army
investigator, Lieutenant General
Kenneth Dahl,

44:14.452 --> 44:19.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recommended that Bergdahl not
face prison
time, saying it would be --
quote -- "inappropriate."

44:19.657 --> 44:25.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in December, a higher
official, General
Robert Abrams, ruled that a
court-martial

44:25.463 --> 44:31.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should go ahead. The trial is
tentatively
scheduled to start in August. If
convicted

44:31.269 --> 44:34.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of all charges, Bergdahl could
face life imprisonment.
