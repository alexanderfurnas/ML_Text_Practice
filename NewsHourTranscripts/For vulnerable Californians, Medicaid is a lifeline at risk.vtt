HARI SREENIVASAN: But first:
As we heard, Senate Republicans
are pushing hard to pass

00:03.633 --> 00:07.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
their own bill next week
to replace and overhaul
the Affordable Care Act.

00:07.600 --> 00:12.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One of the key issues,
major cuts to Medicaid,
the joint federal-state
program that provides

00:12.366 --> 00:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
health care to
low-income Americans,
the elderly and disabled.

00:16.100 --> 00:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was expanded under Obamacare.

00:18.333 --> 00:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But now 14 million Medicaid
recipients stand to lose that
coverage under a bill passed

00:23.300 --> 00:25.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by the House.

00:25.266 --> 00:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reports out tonight say there
will be even deeper cuts
under the Senate version.

00:28.833 --> 00:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Cat Wise
reports from Los Angeles on
how these cuts could directly

00:32.833 --> 00:34.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
affect patients.

00:34.933 --> 00:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: A homeless man on
Skid Row hoping to finally
get a roof over his head.

00:41.133 --> 00:44.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A middle-class mom
earning an income to
care of her disabled son.

00:44.566 --> 00:49.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A working-class truck
driver getting care for his
complex medical problems.

00:51.666 --> 00:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Three very different lives,
with a common thread now at
risk of being cut: Medicaid.

00:56.666 --> 01:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Los Angeles is well known
for its Hollywood stars
with glamorous lifestyles.

01:00.100 --> 01:03.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the city is also home to
many who are less fortunate.

01:03.933 --> 01:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The working poor and homeless
here have benefited from
the Affordable Care Act.

01:07.633 --> 01:12.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In fact, about 1.2
million residents gained
health insurance through
the Medicaid expansion.

01:13.766 --> 01:16.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But all that may
be about to change.

01:16.666 --> 01:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Republican plan to replace
the Affordable Care Act, passed
by the House of Representatives

01:21.066 --> 01:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in May and now being
considered by the Senate,
would fundamentally
alter Medicaid in two

01:25.900 --> 01:27.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
key ways.

01:27.866 --> 01:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, the ACA's Medicaid
expansion -- that offered states
the option of covering most

01:32.133 --> 01:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
non-disabled childless adults
with incomes below and just
above the poverty line -- would

01:38.000 --> 01:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
end within several years.

01:40.133 --> 01:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: We're going to
get this passed through the

01:41.033 --> 01:42.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Senate.

01:42.033 --> 01:44.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I feel so confident.

01:44.066 --> 01:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: The House bill, which
President Trump cheered in
May, but has since reportedly

01:46.800 --> 01:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
called mean, also calls for
converting the entire program
from one with no cap on dollars

01:53.266 --> 01:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spent to one where states
get a fixed amount of money.

01:55.766 --> 02:00.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would give state
governments more flexibility
about how to spend
Medicaid dollars, but would

02:00.400 --> 02:05.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cut the amount they receive
by more than $800 billion
over a decade, according
to the Congressional

02:06.133 --> 02:07.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Budget Office.

02:07.133 --> 02:09.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:09.100 --> 02:09.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: I think we will have
ample opportunity to read

02:09.966 --> 02:12.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and amend the bill.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: A Senate version,
which would eventually
need to be merged with
the House bill before

02:15.266 --> 02:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
becoming law, is still being
crafted, but is said to include
many of these same adjustments,

02:22.166 --> 02:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
though with a potentially
longer rollback of the
Medicaid expansion.

02:25.133 --> 02:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
California stands to lose more
than any other state under
the House version, $6 billion

02:31.566 --> 02:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a year starting in 2020, and
more than $24 billion by 2027.

02:36.766 --> 02:38.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those cuts could have a
big impact on this group.

02:38.500 --> 02:41.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WOMAN: I think you
have hypertension,
diabetes, neuropathy.

02:41.633 --> 02:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: For the last several
years, Los Angeles County
has been deploying teams of

02:49.166 --> 02:51.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nurses, mental health
and substance counselors
and formerly homeless
peer advocates throughout

02:52.600 --> 02:54.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Skid Row.

02:54.633 --> 02:58.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their goal is to improve health
outcomes for this medically
complex and costly homeless

02:58.266 --> 03:01.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
population by
giving them a home.

03:01.600 --> 03:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This Housing for Health program
uses Medicaid dollars to fund
supportive services, like

03:06.566 --> 03:11.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mental health counseling and
substance abuse treatment in
locations where new housing is

03:11.033 --> 03:13.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
being offered.

03:13.066 --> 03:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the day we tagged along, the
team reconnected with a client
who had been wanting to get

03:15.933 --> 03:17.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
off the streets.

03:17.133 --> 03:18.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Are you familiar
with the (INAUDIBLE)

03:18.533 --> 03:19.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
MAN: No?

03:19.533 --> 03:20.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: No?

03:20.533 --> 03:22.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK.

03:22.566 --> 03:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that's like -- that's the
one everyone likes, because
you can get your own room.

03:23.733 --> 03:24.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: That sounds
like my kind of room.

03:24.533 --> 03:25.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Yes, exactly.

03:25.633 --> 03:26.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

03:26.800 --> 03:29.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN: It was a blessing
to find him here.

03:29.900 --> 03:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will basically link him to
services and help him get to
the point where he wants to

03:35.366 --> 03:37.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
be.

03:37.466 --> 03:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Nearly 3,000 people
have received housing so far,
and the goal is to get 7,000

03:40.633 --> 03:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more off the streets by 2020.

03:41.933 --> 03:44.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH KATZ, Director,
Los Angeles County Health
Agency: We have had
dramatic drops in emergency

03:46.300 --> 03:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
department visits
and hospitalizations
following housing people.

03:52.533 --> 03:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Dr. Mitch Katz is
the director of the Los Angeles
Health Agency, and he has

03:56.800 --> 03:58.866 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
been leading the
county's effort.

03:58.866 --> 04:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We met at the Star Apartments,
a 100-unit building in the heart
of Skid Row with a community

04:02.666 --> 04:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
garden, various counseling
services and a health
clinic on the main floor.

04:09.633 --> 04:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The monthly rent is covered
by county general funds,
donations, and residents.

04:13.066 --> 04:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the services provided
are covered by Medicaid.

04:16.700 --> 04:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dr. Katz took me on a tour
of a recently vacated unit.

04:20.233 --> 04:22.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

04:22.266 --> 04:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH KATZ: You will see that,
although the space is small,
it has everything that you

04:25.866 --> 04:26.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
would need.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have a refrigerator,
stove, sink.

04:29.633 --> 04:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not grand, but it really
changes somebody's life.

04:33.133 --> 04:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over a hundred people
came directly out of the
hospital bed, or directly
from the emergency

04:39.266 --> 04:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
room, and are now living here.

04:41.300 --> 04:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I can take care of them for
way less than it costs to be
in the hospital, and they will

04:47.866 --> 04:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have a much higher-quality life.

04:49.933 --> 04:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: The ACA's Medicaid
changes have also been felt
by a much wider swathe of the

04:56.633 --> 04:59.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
population, low-income,
often working adults who
previously had no access
to health insurance.

05:02.100 --> 05:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that was the
story for 60-year-old
Jorge Arias, a former
self-employed truck driver.

05:09.100 --> 05:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Arias, who has had Medicaid
for the last two years, is a
patient at the Saban Community

05:14.200 --> 05:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinic, a non-profit federally
qualified health center which
opened its doors to low-income

05:17.600 --> 05:20.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
clients 50 years ago.

05:20.900 --> 05:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last year, Arias had emergency
surgery after a heart specialist
determined he had three

05:25.800 --> 05:27.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
blocked arteries.

05:27.166 --> 05:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Without insurance, he says:

05:29.233 --> 05:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JORGE ARIAS, Medicaid Recipient:
I would not even be alive, you
know, because, no medications,

05:32.333 --> 05:34.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
no doctors.

05:34.300 --> 05:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIE HUDMAN, CEO, Saban
Community Clinic: Well, we see
about 18,000 to 20,000 patients

05:37.900 --> 05:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a year; 10,000 of them have
Medicaid, and over 8,000 of
them got it with the expansion

05:44.500 --> 05:45.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
under the ACA.

05:45.966 --> 05:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAT WISE: Julie Hudman
is the CEO of the clinic.

05:48.400 --> 05:52.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIE HUDMAN: Before we had
the ACA, someone would come in
and, depending on their income,

05:52.933 --> 05:56.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
we'd take a co-pay,
and it typically was
around $18 per person.

05:56.833 --> 06:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, when a patient comes
in with Medicaid, we receive
about $200 for the visit.

06:03.833 --> 06:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The difference between the
$18 and the $200, $225 is, you
know, a huge source of revenue

06:09.733 --> 06:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for us, and allows us
to stabilize, to keep
our doors open, and then
actually expand services.

06:14.866 --> 06:17.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: So, how have
you been this week?

06:17.600 --> 06:18.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Fine.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Yes, I'm good.

06:20.700 --> 06:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Some of those new
services include mental health
counseling, which could be cut

06:24.266 --> 06:28.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
back if the clinic
loses funding.

06:28.200 --> 06:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Traditional Medicaid programs,
like those for the disabled
and long-term care for the

06:31.700 --> 06:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
elderly, could also be impacted.

06:38.733 --> 06:41.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Victoria and Steve Rosen
are the proud, adopted
parents of 16-year-old
Max, who has a number

06:43.400 --> 06:45.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of health problems due
to prenatal exposure
to drugs and alcohol.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VICTORIA ROSEN,
California: So this is Max.

06:47.333 --> 06:51.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
When we first met him
in the NICU, he had a
very rough beginning.

06:51.966 --> 06:56.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Max is the
recipient of a Medicaid-funded
program called In-Home
Supportive Services.

06:59.600 --> 07:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Victoria earns about
$3,500 a month through
the program to help Max
with things like personal

07:04.433 --> 07:06.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
care and feeding.

07:06.366 --> 07:10.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That financial support has
been key for the family because
helping Max is a full-time

07:10.366 --> 07:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
job, and Victoria hasn't been
able to work outside the home.

07:13.833 --> 07:15.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
VICTORIA ROSEN: It helps
us survive, basically.

07:15.766 --> 07:19.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, before this, we
were, you know, in debt.

07:19.833 --> 07:22.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We don't spend a
lot of extra money.

07:22.333 --> 07:24.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And all the money
we spend is on Max.

07:24.400 --> 07:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: But many supportive
Medicaid service programs like
this one are considered optional

07:31.066 --> 07:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
under traditional Medicaid,
and if states have to take on
more financial responsibility

07:37.800 --> 07:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for Medicaid with the new
Republican plan, health analysts
and program leaders say the

07:42.633 --> 07:46.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
optional services
are likely to be cut.

To the Rosens, that doesn't
make a lot of sense.

STEVE ROSEN, California:
IHSS saves money.

07:52.233 --> 07:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would be more expensive to
take care of someone like Max
in an institutional setting

07:58.366 --> 08:00.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
than it is to have
him in his own house.

CAT WISE: Many Republicans say
these programs may be important,
but Medicaid is simply out

08:05.933 --> 08:07.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of control.

08:07.933 --> 08:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL CANNON, Cato Institute:
Medicaid has grown into this
incredibly wasteful program,

08:10.000 --> 08:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rife with fraud, siphoning lots
of money away from the people
the program should be helping.

08:16.600 --> 08:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Michael Cannon is
the director of health policy
studies at the Cato Institute,

08:19.800 --> 08:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a libertarian think tank.

08:21.933 --> 08:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cannon is concerned the current
legislation being considered
by Congress wouldn't go far

08:26.333 --> 08:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
enough in axing federal
Medicaid regulations and turning
over control to the states.

08:31.333 --> 08:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL CANNON: So, what
Congress should be doing here
is saying to the states, look,

08:34.666 --> 08:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we don't know how to run these
programs better than you.

08:37.133 --> 08:41.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We will continue our
contribution to your
Medicaid programs, but
we're going to give

08:41.133 --> 08:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you a fixed amount of money.

08:43.133 --> 08:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not going to grow from
one year to the next, but we're
also going to give you full

08:46.633 --> 08:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
flexibility to run your
programs the way you think
is best for your state.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States will have a much greater
incentives then to eliminate
fraud, to make sure that

08:55.500 --> 09:00.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those Medicaid dollars are
being spent on the people the
program was meant to help,

09:00.000 --> 09:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and not on the people the
program wasn't meant to help.

09:02.233 --> 09:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Back in Los Angeles,
the health department's Dr.
Katz says he has no problem

09:06.533 --> 09:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
working within a budget as
long as it is a fair one.

09:09.266 --> 09:10.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

09:10.900 --> 09:13.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MITCH KATZ: If you
give me flexibility,
I can do a better job.

09:13.233 --> 09:15.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I could do a better
job for less money.

09:15.633 --> 09:18.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I can't do 70
cents on the dollar.

09:18.333 --> 09:20.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Then, I'm actually going
to have to cut services.

09:20.966 --> 09:25.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: While the health care
debates continue in Washington,
the teams on Skid Row are still

09:27.933 --> 09:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hitting the streets looking
for people to help, and hoping
they can do so for a very

09:30.933 --> 09:32.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
long time.

09:32.466 --> 09:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Cat
Wise in Los Angeles, California.
