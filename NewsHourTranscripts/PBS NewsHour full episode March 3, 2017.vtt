at the Philippines' president
violent crackdown.

interest rates are going up
again this month.

00:50.851 --> 00:55.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%

business lunch in
Chicago today, and suggested

00:55.656 --> 00:57.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ripe for another rate hike.

00:57.624 --> 01:02.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANET YELLEN, Federal Reserve
Chair: The committee

and inflation

01:02.195 --> 01:10.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are continuing to evolve in line
with our
expectations, in which case a
further adjustment

01:10.270 --> 01:13.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the federal funds rate would
likely be
appropriate.

01:13.307 --> 01:18.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Fed last
raised interest
rates in December, but officials

Juan Thompson was arrested in
Saint Louis.

01:32.559 --> 01:37.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Authorities say he made the
threats, and then
blamed an ex-girlfriend.

01:37.164 --> 01:40.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Federal investigators cleared
evidence from
Thompson's home today.

public business

while he was governor of
Indiana.

02:00.420 --> 02:05.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Indianapolis Star reported
that some of
the e-mails dealt with security
matters.

02:05.425 --> 02:11.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Pence had sharply criticized
Hillary Clinton's
use of a private e-mail server
as secretary

02:11.198 --> 02:12.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of state.

02:12.966 --> 02:17.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Today, during a trip to

different.

02:17.104 --> 02:21.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE, Vice President of
the United States:
No, there's no comparison
whatever between

02:21.942 --> 02:27.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton's practice of
having a private
server, mishandling classified
communication,

02:27.347 --> 02:32.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
destroying e-mails when they
were requested
by the Congress and by
officials.

02:32.419 --> 02:35.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have fully complied with all
Indiana's
laws.

02:35.422 --> 02:39.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A White House
spokeswoman said
Mr. Pence did everything --
quote -- "to the

02:40.027 --> 02:42.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
letter of the law as governor."

02:42.429 --> 02:47.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

a second night
of airstrikes against al-Qaida
fighters.

two provinces.

announced
the agreement in Tunis today.

03:11.958 --> 03:16.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

drove a truck
into a Berlin market last
December.

03:17.030 --> 03:21.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He killed a dozen people and
wounded scores
more.

03:21.101 --> 03:28.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Merkel's government took in some
900,000 migrants
and asylum seekers in 2015.

03:28.108 --> 03:33.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, President
Trump touted
school choice as he toured a
Catholic school

03:33.046 --> 03:35.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in Orlando, Florida, today.

03:35.182 --> 03:40.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He met teachers and a class of
fourth grade
students, accompanied by
secretary of education,

03:40.954 --> 03:42.456 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Betsy DeVos.

03:42.489 --> 03:46.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

educate disadvantaged children.

03:46.426 --> 03:51.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Education is the civil rights
issue of our

03:51.231 --> 03:53.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

03:53.100 --> 03:58.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's why I have asked
Congress to support
a school choice bill, and we
have come a long

03:58.171 --> 04:00.006 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

04:00.040 --> 04:05.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're right out there and we're
ahead of schedule
in so many ways when it comes to
education.

04:05.512 --> 04:09.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president
didn't say what
might be in the bill.

vehicles in the U.S.

04:16.890 --> 04:21.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They may have a faulty fuse that
can spark
a fire.

04:21.495 --> 04:29.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The recall covers C-class,
E-class and CLA
Sedans, plus GLA and GLC sport
utility models

04:29.269 --> 04:33.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
2015 through 2017.

04:33.039 --> 04:36.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

S&amp;P 500 added
just one point.

04:47.053 --> 04:52.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
how allegations
over President Trump's ties to
Russia affect

04:52.692 --> 04:58.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
relations between Moscow and
Washington; who
is carrying out the Philippines'
deadly war

04:58.832 --> 05:13.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on drugs; more than a dozen
states seek to
put limits on public protesters;
and much

05:13.813 --> 05:17.250 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

05:17.284 --> 05:22.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week brought more reports
of repeated
contacts between Trump campaign
aides and

05:22.789 --> 05:24.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Russian officials.

05:24.424 --> 05:26.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Margaret Warner begins with the
latest details.

05:26.893 --> 05:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Attorney
General Jeff Sessions
returned to work today, after
recusing himself

05:33.266 --> 05:37.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from any investigation into
Moscow's election
meddling.

05:37.404 --> 05:42.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His recusal came after conceding
he'd met
twice with the Russian
ambassador during the

05:42.709 --> 05:43.743 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

05:43.777 --> 05:46.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Earlier, he told a Senate
committee he had
not.

05:46.046 --> 05:50.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, today, Vice President Mike
Pence reaffirmed
his faith in Sessions.

05:50.317 --> 05:53.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE, Vice President of
the United States:
The president and I have full
confidence in

05:53.186 --> 05:54.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the attorney general.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He is a man of integrity.

05:56.223 --> 06:01.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Reports also
emerged that
campaign advisers J.D. Gordon
and Carter Page

06:01.127 --> 06:07.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
met Ambassador Sergey Kislyak,
as did Jared
Kushner, President Trump's
son-in-law and

06:07.500 --> 06:08.735 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
adviser.

06:08.768 --> 06:11.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That belied Page's own words to
the "NewsHour"
last month.

06:11.771 --> 06:17.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Did you have any
meetings last
year with Russian officials in
Russia, outside

06:17.110 --> 06:18.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Russia, anywhere?

06:18.712 --> 06:20.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARTER PAGE, Former Trump
Campaign Foreign
Policy Adviser: I had no
meetings.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.315 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No meetings.

06:22.349 --> 06:25.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: In Moscow,
Russian Foreign
Minister Sergei Lavrov dismissed
the ongoing

06:25.986 --> 06:27.854 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
furor.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SERGEI LAVROV, Russian Foreign
Minister (through
translator): I can only refer to
a quote that

06:29.589 --> 06:31.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was circulated today in the mass
media.

06:32.025 --> 06:36.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This strongly resembles a
witch-hunt or the
times of McCarthyism, which we
thought were

06:36.296 --> 06:38.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
long over in the United States
as a civilized
country.

06:39.032 --> 06:41.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Mr. Trump also
called it
a witch-hunt.

06:41.635 --> 06:48.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, today, he tweeted a photo
of Senate Minority
Leader Chuck Schumer meeting
with Russian

06:48.108 --> 06:50.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Vladimir Putin in
2003.

06:50.977 --> 06:55.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump said: "We should start
an immediate
investigation into Senator
Schumer and his

06:55.915 --> 06:57.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ties to Russia and Putin.

06:57.617 --> 06:59.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
A total hypocrite."

06:59.452 --> 07:04.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Schumer tweeted back that he'd
happily talk
about his contact with Putin,
asking, "Would

07:04.724 --> 07:06.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you and your team?"

07:06.459 --> 07:11.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later, the president also
demanded a probe
of House Minority Leader Nancy
Pelosi for

07:11.998 --> 07:15.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
having said she never met with
the Russian
ambassador.

07:15.835 --> 07:21.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Politico published a photo today
showing he
was part of a larger meeting
with Pelosi in

07:21.408 --> 07:23.243 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2010.

07:23.276 --> 07:27.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The political storm has
overshadowed any concrete
steps toward improving ties with
Russia, as

07:27.947 --> 07:29.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mr. Trump has advocated.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
If we have a good relationship
with Russia,

07:32.719 --> 07:34.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
believe me, that's a good thing.

07:34.521 --> 07:39.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Relations
turned icy at the
end of Obama administration,
over Russian

07:39.426 --> 07:45.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aggression in Ukraine, and its
military backing
for Damascus in the Syrian civil
war.

07:45.799 --> 07:51.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since Mr. Trump took office,
diplomacy between
the two sides, at least
publicly, has been

07:51.371 --> 07:52.706 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
limited.

07:52.739 --> 07:56.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president spoke with Putin
by phone after
the inauguration.

07:56.209 --> 08:01.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his secretary of state, Rex
Tillerson,
met with Lavrov at a G20 summit
in Germany.

08:01.715 --> 08:07.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, uncertainty over Mr.
Trump's intentions
toward Russia is rattling
American allies

08:07.654 --> 08:09.289 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Europe.

08:09.322 --> 08:14.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vice President Pence and Defense
Secretary
James Mattis tried last month to
reassure

08:14.461 --> 08:18.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NATO partners of Washington's
alliance solidarity.

08:18.898 --> 08:24.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One NATO partner, German
Chancellor Angela
Merkel, now plans to visit
Washington on March

08:24.437 --> 08:25.405 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
14.

08:25.438 --> 08:28.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

08:28.475 --> 08:34.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A broader look
now at the state
of U.S.-Russia relations and
what is at stake

08:34.514 --> 08:36.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for these two countries.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We get two views.

08:37.984 --> 08:42.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Andrew Weiss worked for both
Republican and
Democratic administrations as a
staffer on

08:42.722 --> 08:46.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the National Security Council in
the State
and Defense Departments.

08:46.760 --> 08:50.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He's now at the Carnegie
Endowment for International
Peace.

08:50.263 --> 08:54.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Paul Saunders, he focused on
Russia at
the State Department during the
George W.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Bush administration.

08:56.202 --> 08:59.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's now the executive director
of the Center
for the National Interest.

08:59.739 --> 09:01.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a foreign policy think
tank.

09:01.908 --> 09:04.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you back
to the program.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Andrew Weiss, to you first.

09:05.545 --> 09:09.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is the sense of the state
of U.S.-Russia
relations right now?

09:09.115 --> 09:10.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW WEISS, Carnegie Endowment
for International
Peace: The relationship between
the United

09:10.884 --> 09:12.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
States and Russia is broken.

09:12.419 --> 09:17.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are at a low point that goes
back to the
darkest days of the Cold War.

09:17.557 --> 09:21.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
President Trump has been
promising that there's
going to be some kind of
dramatic resurgence.

09:21.194 --> 09:26.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's talked about doing a grand
bargain with
Vladimir Putin, presumably
focused on the

09:26.199 --> 09:28.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
war in Syria, the fight against
ISIS.

09:28.034 --> 09:33.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He hopes to contain China and
deal with more
a meddlesome Iran by somehow
breaking ground

09:33.239 --> 09:34.340 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Russians.

09:34.374 --> 09:36.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think that's setting
expectations way too
high.

09:36.276 --> 09:41.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reasons for the relationship
being in
the doghouse are profound and
really go to

09:41.581 --> 09:43.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the heart of who we are as a
nation.

09:43.550 --> 09:46.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Paul Saunders,
how do you see
the state of relations right
now?

09:46.119 --> 09:49.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SAUNDERS, Center for the
National Interest:
Well, I agree with Andrew that
the relationship

09:49.889 --> 09:55.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is really at its worst state
today since probably
the 1980s.

09:55.128 --> 09:58.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think there is no question
about that.

09:58.298 --> 10:05.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where I would differ with Andrew
is, I think
there are opportunities to
improve the relationship.

10:05.104 --> 10:14.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think there are some
possibilities in
Syria on some other issues, arms
control perhaps,

10:14.781 --> 10:16.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some other areas, too.

10:17.016 --> 10:22.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, the president
seems determined
to try that.

10:22.088 --> 10:25.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If he does, I think Moscow would
be receptive.

10:25.725 --> 10:30.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's appropriate to keep
our expectations
in check.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I do believe there are some
possibilities.

10:32.365 --> 10:36.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why do you say
they're broken,
Andrew Weiss?

10:36.069 --> 10:39.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW WEISS: Well, it comes
back to the sort
of core question of, how does
the U.S. formulate

10:39.906 --> 10:41.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
its national security policy?

10:41.474 --> 10:44.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our view is that there is a
liberal international
order out there.

10:44.744 --> 10:48.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been sort of the guiding
structure of
U.S. foreign policy since the
end of World

10:48.915 --> 10:55.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
War II to build alliances,
institutions like
NATO alliance, support for the
E.U. and key

10:55.421 --> 10:57.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
alliances in East Asia.

10:57.357 --> 11:01.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Russians, on the other hand,
really want
to see that international order
chipped away

11:01.060 --> 11:02.428 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at.

11:02.462 --> 11:04.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They believe that that gives the
U.S. too
much authority in the world.

11:04.731 --> 11:09.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have seen that at home
the way to
build the legitimacy of the
Putin regime is

11:09.335 --> 11:12.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the back of this idea that
there is an
external threat, and to use the
United States

11:13.006 --> 11:16.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as a boogeyman that will
mobilize the Russian
people in support of the
Kremlin.

11:16.776 --> 11:21.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: If that's the
case, Paul Saunders,
what gives you any belief that
the Russians

11:21.714 --> 11:26.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- you listed Syria, you list
arms control
as two areas that you felt the
Russians would

11:26.786 --> 11:30.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be receptive to some sort of
overture from
President Trump.

11:30.623 --> 11:32.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What makes you believe that
that's the case?

11:32.458 --> 11:38.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SAUNDERS: Well, I think I
would disagree,
respectfully, with some of the
things that

11:38.064 --> 11:40.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Andrew said there.

11:40.266 --> 11:47.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, I think Vladimir
Putin's legitimacy
in Russia rests primarily
actually on Russia's

11:47.273 --> 11:49.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
economic success.

11:49.142 --> 11:54.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, the Russian economy
certainly has been
stalled for the last several
years.

11:54.080 --> 12:03.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There have been some further
slowdowns because
of the sanctions, but most
Russians are living

12:03.089 --> 12:08.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
far better than at any time in
the history
of that country.

12:08.728 --> 12:14.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secondly, as we think about the
international
system, the real threat to the
international

12:14.200 --> 12:17.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
system is an alignment between
China and Russia.

12:17.704 --> 12:20.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia, on its own, its economy
is a 10th
of ours.

12:21.007 --> 12:23.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're not going to destabilize
the international
system.

12:23.209 --> 12:25.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So what about
that, Andrew
Weiss?

12:25.111 --> 12:28.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW WEISS: Well, I think what
we have seen
in the past couple of years is a
lot of opportunism

12:28.915 --> 12:30.483 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and risk-taking.

12:30.516 --> 12:32.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That has now become the sort of
bread and
butter of Russian foreign
policy.

12:32.552 --> 12:38.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you see spur-of-the-moment,
improvised
decisions to seize Crimea, to
launch a covert

12:38.224 --> 12:39.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
war in Eastern Ukraine.

12:39.859 --> 12:43.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You then see this dramatic
military intervention
in Syria.

12:43.096 --> 12:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, most obviously,
recently, we have
seen this brazen interference in
our domestic

12:46.766 --> 12:48.234 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
political life.

12:48.267 --> 12:52.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So this is a different, much
more sort of
nimble Russian foreign policy.

12:52.972 --> 12:54.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's very destabilizing.

12:54.540 --> 12:58.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's created a lot of
apprehension, particularly
among our European allies.

12:58.378 --> 13:03.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the idea that the Russians
just want to
kind of go back to normal, I
think, is misplaced.

13:03.216 --> 13:08.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is in their interest to see a
destabilized
U.S., to have our political
system chaotic

13:08.388 --> 13:11.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and sort of locked in an
internal division.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That to them is a success.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That is the
picture many Americans
are getting, Paul Saunders,
isn't it?

13:16.095 --> 13:20.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SAUNDERS: I think many
Americans are
getting that picture.

13:20.700 --> 13:26.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, look, I mean, there are
serious problems
in Russia's conduct, and there
are serious

13:26.105 --> 13:29.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reasons for Americans to be
concerned.

13:29.142 --> 13:32.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think there are ways to deal
with that.

13:32.345 --> 13:36.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president has talked about
dealing with
Russia from a position of
strength.

13:36.916 --> 13:41.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think, if we take that
approach, we can
deal with many of these
concerns.

13:41.788 --> 13:43.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What's at risk
here?

13:43.656 --> 13:49.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's at stake, Andrew Weiss,
if this relationship
is in the condition that you
describe?

13:49.662 --> 13:51.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What stands to happen?

13:51.898 --> 13:56.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW WEISS: The worst thing,
which I can
see readily happening -- we had
an incident

13:56.569 --> 14:02.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about two days ago in Syria --
is some form
of unintentional either accident
or direct

14:02.141 --> 14:03.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conflict between our military
forces.

14:03.776 --> 14:04.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, just a couple...

14:04.777 --> 14:06.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Between Russian
and U.S. forces?

14:06.179 --> 14:07.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW WEISS: Exactly.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The risk of that happening is
uncomfortably
high.

14:09.382 --> 14:13.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Russians in Syria are
operating increasingly
close to our forces.

14:13.219 --> 14:17.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We had an incident a couple days
where they
were bombing Syrian opposition
forces supported

14:18.024 --> 14:22.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the United States, and our
special operators
were just four or five
kilometers away.

14:22.295 --> 14:25.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the air over Syria, we have
had a lot of
near misses.

14:25.832 --> 14:31.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You see brazen Russian efforts
in the airspace
over Europe to basically try to
get as obnoxious

14:31.170 --> 14:34.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and be in our face, and the idea
is, we will
put back, that we will be
intimidated.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Paul Saunders,
why isn't that
a worry?

14:36.375 --> 14:39.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SAUNDERS: I think it's a
very considerable
worry.

14:39.579 --> 14:44.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I view that as a reason to try
to engage with
Moscow.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there are a lot of other
reasons to
try to engage.

14:47.854 --> 14:54.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If this relationship slips from
adversarial
to truly hostile, and we start
to see Russia

14:54.327 --> 15:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
providing advanced weapons to
China, providing
more advanced weapons to Iran,
there are a

15:00.867 --> 15:04.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot of other things that could
happen that
could be much worse for the
United States.

15:04.537 --> 15:07.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Speaking of
which, in less
than a minute, nuclear weapons?

15:07.807 --> 15:11.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are the two countries with
the largest
nuclear arsenal in the world.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Andrew Weiss, what about that?

15:13.179 --> 15:15.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW WEISS: That part of the
agenda between
the United States and Russia is
deadlocked.

15:16.015 --> 15:22.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we're unlikely -- regardless
of what Donald
Trump's policies are on defense
spending,

15:22.054 --> 15:25.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on changes to our nuclear
arsenal, the reality
is, we have fundamental
disagreements with

15:25.491 --> 15:27.293 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Russians.

15:27.326 --> 15:31.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have violated a key arms
control treaty,
the INF Treaty, which Russia has
now fielded

15:31.230 --> 15:34.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
new cruise missiles that violate
that treaty.

15:34.400 --> 15:38.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're very concerned about
U.S. programs,
our missile defenses in Europe,
and these

15:38.204 --> 15:42.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new conventional strategic
systems which they
believe will threaten their
strategic deterrent.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally,
Paul Saunders,
how do you see the risks there?

15:44.877 --> 15:47.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SAUNDERS: Well, I think the
risks are
considerable.

15:47.747 --> 15:53.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time, our economy is
10 times
the size of the Russian economy.

15:53.286 --> 15:57.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They can't afford -- they can
afford even
less than the Soviet Union to
get into a nuclear

15:57.423 --> 15:59.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
arms race with the United
States.

15:59.258 --> 16:01.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think we hold the cards.

16:01.294 --> 16:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's an opportunity,
again, from a
position of strength, to try to
pursue that

16:07.099 --> 16:15.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agenda address the concerns we
have about
Russian conduct and try to lock
in some stability

16:15.441 --> 16:16.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the relationship.

16:16.876 --> 16:20.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Paul Saunders,
Andrew Weiss,
deadly serious subject.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you both very much.

16:23.616 --> 16:28.688 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SAUNDERS: Thank you.

16:28.721 --> 16:32.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW WEISS: Thanks.

16:32.558 --> 16:39.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's fair to say
a reign of
terror grips the Philippines, as
its president,

16:39.498 --> 16:44.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rodrigo Duterte, wages a brutal
war on drug
dealers and users.

16:44.737 --> 16:49.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to Human Rights Watch,
more than
7,000 people have been killed in
just the

16:49.275 --> 16:50.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
last nine months.

16:50.877 --> 16:53.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But who exactly is doing the
killing?

16:53.579 --> 16:59.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This story was reported by Kara
Magsanoc-Alikpala
and narrated by William
Brangham.

16:59.952 --> 17:02.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And a warning: There are some
disturbing images.

17:02.588 --> 17:08.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For decades,
slums here
in the Philippines have been
safe havens for

17:08.127 --> 17:10.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the illegal drug trade.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Crystal meth is sold in these
alleys just
like candy.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A gram costs at least $25.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's triple the daily minimum
wage.

17:17.970 --> 17:20.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's the cheapest drug on
the market.

17:20.439 --> 17:24.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In this drug den, users rent
space to smoke
without fear of being caught.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It does a brisk business.

17:26.712 --> 17:30.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government estimates that
meth can be
found in nearly every community
in the capital,

17:30.750 --> 17:36.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Manila, and, nationwide, there's
an estimated
1.3 million drug users.

17:36.555 --> 17:41.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even kids get in on the trade,
making homemade
foil pipes to sell.

17:41.761 --> 17:46.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This is the crisis that
Philippine President
Rodrigo Duterte has vowed to
end.

17:47.033 --> 17:49.268 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One of his many outlandish
solutions?

17:49.302 --> 17:51.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Encouraging addicts to commit
suicide.

17:51.370 --> 17:55.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RODRIGO DUTERTE, Philippine
President (through
translator): Feel free to call
us, the police,

17:55.308 --> 17:57.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or do it yourself if you have
the gun.

17:57.276 --> 17:59.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have my support.

17:59.145 --> 18:02.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Soon after the
new president
took office, a wave of summary
killings swept

18:02.248 --> 18:03.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
across the country.

18:03.883 --> 18:08.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Suspected users and dealers were
shot dead
on the streets by unknown hit
men.

18:08.554 --> 18:12.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
An estimated 40 people die
everyday.

18:12.058 --> 18:16.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Political analyst Ramon Casiple
believes the
violence is part of the
president's strategy

18:16.329 --> 18:17.997 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to sow fear.

18:18.030 --> 18:22.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RAMON CASIPLE, Political
Analyst: If what
they're saying is that he's
developing the

18:22.101 --> 18:28.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
environment for these killings,
then I think
I would say yes, precisely,
that's the effect

18:28.441 --> 18:31.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he wants, to sow fear among the
criminals.

18:31.544 --> 18:35.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, are these
killings changing
anything in the Philippines, or
simply a sign

18:35.614 --> 18:38.250 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of nationwide lawlessness?

18:38.284 --> 18:40.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We found answers from a
supporter of the president.

18:40.987 --> 18:44.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She goes by the name Zenny, and
she wants
to hide her identity.

18:44.590 --> 18:49.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Zenny says Duterte's war on
drugs had a positive
outcome in her neighborhood.

18:49.261 --> 18:52.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many users and dealers have
turned themselves
in, she says.

18:52.465 --> 18:58.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZENNY, Philippines (through
translator): Our
neighborhood became more orderly
and peaceful

18:58.170 --> 18:59.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
because of his war on drugs.

18:59.538 --> 19:02.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I voted for him because I want
the drug crisis
solved.

19:02.842 --> 19:04.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It really worked.

19:04.643 --> 19:07.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: She says her
own son was
so scared that he stopped doing
drugs, which

19:07.646 --> 19:09.181 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
made her happy.

19:09.215 --> 19:11.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But this mother's peace didn't
last long.

19:12.018 --> 19:16.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A group of half-a-dozen gunmen
shot her 34-year-old
son dead.

19:16.722 --> 19:21.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZENNY (through translator): Six
civilian men
barged themselves into our home.

19:21.394 --> 19:22.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They were carrying guns.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They told me to leave, so I
dashed out.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They were surrounding our place.

19:27.633 --> 19:32.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The media was there, the crime
investigators,
including a staff from the
funeral parlor.

19:32.538 --> 19:34.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I heard two gunshots.

19:34.306 --> 19:38.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: According to
police and
media reports, her son resisted
arrest, and

19:38.144 --> 19:40.046 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pulled a gun on his attackers.

19:40.079 --> 19:42.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But Zenny doesn't believe it.

19:42.214 --> 19:47.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZENNY (through translator): How
can my son
own a gun, for Christ's sake?

19:47.186 --> 19:51.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He doesn't even have a penny to
buy himself
a cigarette, much more a gun.

19:51.457 --> 19:54.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How was it possible for him to
resist arrest
when they had him cornered?

19:54.493 --> 19:57.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: She thinks
it's a cover-up
by the police.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZENNY (through translator):
Everything was
ready.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There were plenty of police, of
men in uniform.

20:02.768 --> 20:05.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It looks like they have a
systematic procedure
in place.

20:05.571 --> 20:09.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Currently,
Philippine police
say roughly 64 percent of these
deaths are

20:09.975 --> 20:12.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
vigilante-style killings.

20:12.278 --> 20:14.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the government says they're
not responsible.

20:14.880 --> 20:19.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They say only proper
investigations can determine
the real reasons.

20:19.118 --> 20:22.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Duterte's spokesman says the
government wants
these cases solved quickly.

20:22.521 --> 20:24.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERNESTO ABELLA, Presidential
Spokesman (through
translator): I don't have the
timeline, but

20:24.356 --> 20:27.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he wants things to be done
quickly and appropriately.

20:27.526 --> 20:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But nine
months into Duterte's
drug war, there hasn't been a
single arrest

20:33.499 --> 20:35.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for any of these murders.

20:35.301 --> 20:39.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This inaction is deeply
frustrating to the
Philippine's own Commission on
Human Rights.

20:39.705 --> 20:43.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN GANA, Commission on Human
Rights: The
investigation must be done
promptly.

20:43.142 --> 20:48.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And not only the investigation,
but it must
be shown that there is resolve
in really coming

20:48.814 --> 20:55.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out with a solution, or the
findings are really
clear and that it must be made
public right

20:55.888 --> 20:56.989 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
away.

20:57.022 --> 20:58.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So who is
committing these
murders?

20:58.924 --> 21:00.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And who's ordering them?

21:00.559 --> 21:05.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Correspondent Kara
Magsanoc-Alikpala talked
with a self-described hit man.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He uses an alias, Kevin.

21:08.033 --> 21:13.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says he belongs to a network
of assassins
who are protected by a political
figure.

21:13.139 --> 21:17.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He also says he's killed 15
people in the
last six months.

21:17.576 --> 21:20.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kara asked him who these killers
were and
why they were doing it?

21:20.846 --> 21:25.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN, Philippines (through
translator): They're
a lot, but most of them are
cops, because

21:25.384 --> 21:26.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
there is money involved.

21:26.585 --> 21:31.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are paid about 310 U.S.
dollars per person
killed.

21:31.590 --> 21:36.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In one night, you need to kill
at least four,
at least one drug lord and one
pusher per

21:36.262 --> 21:38.164 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
night.

21:38.197 --> 21:41.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This means a
night of killings
can earn these men more than the
average Filipino

21:41.767 --> 21:43.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
earns in a month.

21:43.569 --> 21:45.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kara asked, so where's the money
coming from?

21:45.971 --> 21:51.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN (through translator): From
our government,
from Duterte's office, from the
municipal

21:51.710 --> 21:53.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
government, from the mayors.

21:53.546 --> 21:57.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
president's spokesman
rejects these accusations and
says Duterte

21:57.683 --> 21:59.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
didn't order these executions.

21:59.552 --> 22:03.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says these killings are
likely just fellow
drug gangs targeting each other.

22:03.422 --> 22:07.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERNESTO ABELLA: References have
been made
that the deaths could be
attributed to internecine

22:07.793 --> 22:12.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
killings, meaning to say people
among their
own peers doing that.

22:12.198 --> 22:19.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Personally, the president has
said that he
doesn't condone this sort of
killing.

22:19.572 --> 22:22.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RODRIGO DUTERTE: There will be
no letup in
this campaign.

22:22.341 --> 22:26.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But critics
have reason
to doubt the president.

22:26.212 --> 22:31.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Duterte has been
linked to a secret
death squad back in his
hometown, Davao City.

22:31.550 --> 22:35.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the late '90s, then Mayor
Duterte launched
an anti-drug campaign.

22:35.754 --> 22:40.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, just like today, a number
of alleged
drug dealers and addicts were
murdered.

22:40.392 --> 22:45.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These killings were blamed on a
vigilante
group called the Davao Death
Squad.

22:45.364 --> 22:49.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And many said that Mayor Duterte
was behind
them.

22:49.401 --> 22:53.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: If you're a drug pusher, if
you're a
drug lord here, do not come for
(INAUDIBLE)

22:53.572 --> 22:54.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I will not give you any.

22:54.573 --> 22:55.874 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Who killed them?

22:55.908 --> 22:57.209 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

22:57.243 --> 22:58.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You're asking me?

22:58.611 --> 23:00.446 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm not the one.

23:00.479 --> 23:06.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But political
analyst Ramon
Casiple says Duterte's seeming
inaction serves

23:06.285 --> 23:08.187 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his goals.

23:08.220 --> 23:14.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RAMON CASIPLE: His own
assessment of the situation
was that he thinks there is a
sense to the

23:14.526 --> 23:22.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vigilantism, in the sense that
this protects
the community, this protects his
people.

23:22.401 --> 23:27.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Father Amado
Picardal, who
lived in Davao, believes the
president was

23:27.439 --> 23:31.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
behind the formation of the
Davao Death Squad.

23:31.143 --> 23:35.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Philippines is a majority
Catholic country,
and the church is considered a
supporter of

23:35.180 --> 23:40.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the president, so Father
Picardal's accusations
are not made easily.

23:40.619 --> 23:45.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Picardal says former members of
the Death
Squad told him and his fellow
priests that

23:45.291 --> 23:47.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Duterte was directly involved.

23:47.126 --> 23:52.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FATHER AMADO PICARDAL,
Philippines: I believe
what is happening now is a
replication and

23:52.631 --> 23:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
multiplication of the Davao
experience.

23:55.134 --> 23:56.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Davao is the template.

23:56.902 --> 24:01.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KARA MAGSANOC-ALIKPALA,
Journalist: I have
been around this area and seen a
lot of wakes

24:01.206 --> 24:04.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from extrajudicial killings
almost every day.

24:04.576 --> 24:08.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You also must get confessions
here from policemen
or just vigilantes.

24:09.014 --> 24:15.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FATHER AMADO PICARDAL: You know,
I heard from
my fellow priests that a number
of policemen

24:15.321 --> 24:18.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
coming for confession has
increased.

24:18.424 --> 24:22.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And many of them are really
bothered by their
conscience.

24:22.294 --> 24:28.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what I would advise to
policemen who would
come for confession is, don't
follow illegal

24:28.667 --> 24:29.635 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
orders.

24:29.668 --> 24:31.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Follow your conscience.

24:31.537 --> 24:36.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In 2009, Human
Rights Watch
and the Philippines' human
rights agency traced

24:36.475 --> 24:39.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
1,000 deaths tied to the Davao
Death Squad.

24:39.445 --> 24:44.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They attempted to pursue a case
against then
Mayor Duterte for, at the least,
tolerating

24:44.616 --> 24:46.085 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these killings.

24:46.118 --> 24:49.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But no one was willing to take
the witness
stand and no case was filed.

24:49.988 --> 24:55.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, throughout the Philippines,
the body
count continues to grow, as
murderers remain

24:55.794 --> 24:56.795 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the loose.

24:56.829 --> 25:03.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham.

25:03.502 --> 25:13.178 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

25:13.212 --> 25:17.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Mark Shields
and David Brooks analyze the
latest political

25:17.783 --> 25:24.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
news; and new revelations
surrounding the
death of Emmett Till, a
14-year-old killed

25:24.123 --> 25:26.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
during the civil rights
movement.

25:26.191 --> 25:32.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: It's a battle playing
out around
the country that you may not
know about.

25:32.765 --> 25:37.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Lawmakers are targeting
protesters' tactics
in many state capitals, setting
up debates

25:37.669 --> 25:40.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over free speech vs. public
safety.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has the story.

25:42.875 --> 25:50.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Clashes over a North
Dakota oil
pipeline, demonstrations after a
Minnesota

25:50.249 --> 25:56.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
police shooting, the women's
march in Washington
on inauguration weekend.

25:56.088 --> 26:02.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mass protests are playing out on
a scale not
seen since the 1960s and '70s.

26:02.094 --> 26:03.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Some have turned violent.

26:03.862 --> 26:08.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, in state capitals across
the country,
Republican lawmakers are trying
to rein in

26:08.600 --> 26:10.002 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
protests.

26:10.035 --> 26:14.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say it's a matter of public
safety and
limiting economic damage.

26:14.840 --> 26:19.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Protesters and civil liberties
advocates say
it's an attack on free speech.

26:19.111 --> 26:23.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Minnesota, pending
legislation would increase
fines for blocking highways and
airports.

26:23.916 --> 26:26.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL INGEBRIGTSEN (R), Minnesota
State Senator:
Not any of us, the 67 senators
at least that

26:26.985 --> 26:30.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I work with here in the
Minnesota Senate,
want to squelch any First
Amendment rights

26:30.789 --> 26:32.624 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at all.

26:32.658 --> 26:40.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it goes over the top when
public safety,
the potential of public safety
is interfered

26:40.299 --> 26:42.034 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with.

26:42.067 --> 26:43.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN THOMPSON, Community
Activist: Do you
honestly think that you are
penalizing people?

26:43.268 --> 26:44.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's already against the law.

26:44.736 --> 26:47.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You honestly think that you
raising the fine
-- there's already a fine.

26:47.105 --> 26:48.907 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's not going to stop us.

26:48.941 --> 26:52.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Last week, North
Dakota's governor
signed four bills aimed at
making it easier

26:52.711 --> 26:58.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to control protests like those
over the Dakota
Access pipeline.

26:58.150 --> 27:00.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Legislation is pending in 17
other states.

27:00.819 --> 27:02.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Among their provisions?

27:02.855 --> 27:08.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Increasing penalties, including
in some cases
prison time, for blocking
roadways, increasing

27:08.227 --> 27:13.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
penalties for rioting, allowing
authorities
to seize the assets of anyone
involved in

27:13.398 --> 27:19.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a violent protest, and relieving
drivers of
liability if they accidentally
hit protesters

27:19.204 --> 27:21.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
blocking a street.

27:21.607 --> 27:25.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For a deeper look at this, we're
joined by
Christopher Ingraham of The
Washington Post.

27:25.677 --> 27:30.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's been tracking these
legislative efforts
across the country, and he joins
us from Fargo,

27:30.616 --> 27:31.583 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
North Dakota.

27:31.617 --> 27:33.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Christopher, thanks for being
with us.

27:33.452 --> 27:37.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Christopher, we heard some of
the provisions
of some of this pending
legislation in the

27:37.589 --> 27:38.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
piece, but how much farther?

27:39.024 --> 27:43.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where will this take us if some
of these bills
are enacted into law?

27:43.128 --> 27:45.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much farther will this take
us than where
we are now?

27:45.597 --> 27:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER INGRAHAM, The
Washington Post:
Well, that's the question.

27:47.566 --> 27:51.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that's what a lot of
civil liberties
advocates are worried about.

27:51.203 --> 27:55.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They frame this essentially as
an assault
on free speech.

27:55.507 --> 27:59.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the things they're
worried about,
the interesting thing about
these bills is

27:59.444 --> 28:04.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they have been completely
100 percent
across the board introduced by
Republican

28:04.249 --> 28:06.018 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lawmakers only.

28:06.051 --> 28:10.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, one of the concerns is that
if these laws
get enacted, they can be used as
cudgels by

28:10.255 --> 28:12.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whoever is in power at a given
time.

28:12.958 --> 28:15.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for instance, you look at
some of these
bills, including the one that
was signed in

28:15.861 --> 28:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Dakota, they would do
things like make
it illegal to wear masks or
costumes a protest.

28:22.134 --> 28:27.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, that could apply to a guy
wearing, say,
a Guy Fawkes mask at the North
Dakota Access

28:27.406 --> 28:29.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
pipeline protest.

28:29.308 --> 28:33.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It could also apply to, say, a
guy wearing
a George Washington mask at a
Tea Party process.

28:33.412 --> 28:37.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So when you have these things,
they could
potentially be really broadly
applied.

28:37.716 --> 28:41.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that's what a lot of
observers
are really worried about here.

28:41.153 --> 28:43.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What is driving this
legislation?

28:43.155 --> 28:47.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you see a lot of bills
introduced in
state legislatures across the
country like

28:47.359 --> 28:50.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this, sometimes, there's a group
behind it
are pushing it.

28:50.395 --> 28:52.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is there anything like that in
this case?

28:52.898 --> 28:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER INGRAHAM: We're not
really seeing
that.

28:55.167 --> 28:59.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You're not really seeing
evidence of a group
like, say, ALEC, groups who
drafts model legislation.

28:59.838 --> 29:04.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is some evidence that in
some of the
Western states, you see energy
and oil companies

29:04.276 --> 29:08.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lobbying legislatures to pass
these bills,
because, say, you know, they're
worried about

29:08.947 --> 29:11.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the coming Keystone Access
pipeline.

29:11.383 --> 29:15.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't want another North
Dakota pipeline
situation unfolding.

29:15.721 --> 29:18.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there is some interest from
energy groups
to do this.

29:18.590 --> 29:23.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in a lot of cases, it's just
legislators,
it seems, taking initiative to
do it themselves

29:23.195 --> 29:29.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in response to protests they
see, like protests
for Donald Trump, protests for
black men who

29:29.401 --> 29:30.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have been shot by police
officers.

29:30.936 --> 29:34.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's really just a lot of
different things
all kind of converging on this.

29:34.473 --> 29:39.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: I know in your
reporting, you have
talked to civil liberties
advocates.

29:39.311 --> 29:42.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do they think these laws
would stand up
to court challenges?

29:43.015 --> 29:45.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER INGRAHAM: That's
really an interesting
question.

29:45.250 --> 29:48.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One thing that multiple people
-- and these
are people in the university, as
well as people

29:48.954 --> 29:50.956 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as the ACLU.

29:50.989 --> 29:54.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One thing that they have said is
that the
Supreme Court and the federal
courts have

29:54.326 --> 29:59.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been really clear in the past 10
years or
so, specifically calling out
public places

29:59.264 --> 30:04.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like streets as places that are
protected,
where protest is protected.

30:04.236 --> 30:08.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have some real doubts about
whether or
not these would pass
constitutional muster.

30:08.373 --> 30:11.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One thing they say is that,
look, you look
all across the country, there is
basically

30:11.910 --> 30:16.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not a single jurisdiction that
doesn't already
have some sort of law on the
books making

30:17.015 --> 30:19.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it a crime to obstruct traffic.

30:19.651 --> 30:22.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think where they might get
into trouble
legally -- and we will have to
see how this

30:22.954 --> 30:29.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plays out -- is where you try to
make it a
crime to specifically protest in
a public

30:29.428 --> 30:31.163 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
street.

30:31.196 --> 30:33.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that might be a dividing
line that
some of the courts might be
interested in

30:33.098 --> 30:34.499 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
exploring.

30:34.533 --> 30:38.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: How much public
support are there
for bills like these?

30:38.170 --> 30:40.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is the public sentiment,
from what you
can tell?

30:40.505 --> 30:42.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER INGRAHAM: It's all
over the place.

30:42.541 --> 30:45.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I haven't found any good polling
on this.

30:45.343 --> 30:51.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I look at the responses to the
article that
I wrote, and they're really
cleaved down partisan

30:51.817 --> 30:53.585 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lines.

30:53.618 --> 30:57.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have half the folks saying,
I was driving
home the other night and I was
stopped by

30:57.289 --> 31:00.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a protest on the highway and it
took me six
hours to get home, and it was a
huge headache,

31:00.759 --> 31:03.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and I think we really need this
legislation.

31:03.295 --> 31:06.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then I hear from people who
say, look,
I have been to some of these
protests.

31:06.998 --> 31:11.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm infuriated that lawmakers
are trying to
crack down on this, and this
only strengthens

31:11.536 --> 31:12.871 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my resolve.

31:12.904 --> 31:15.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It makes me more likely to go
out there and
protest some more.

31:15.040 --> 31:18.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, on that measure,
you can kind
of look at these bills as kind
of an indicator

31:18.977 --> 31:24.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the success that these
protesters have
had at bringing these issues up
to a national

31:24.549 --> 31:27.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
level, to the extent that
lawmakers feel they
have to respond to them.

31:27.686 --> 31:30.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Christopher Ingraham
of The Washington
Post, thanks for joining us.

31:30.822 --> 31:35.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER INGRAHAM: Thanks for
having me.

31:35.427 --> 31:47.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: From a joint
address to Congress
to the recusal of the attorney
general, it's

31:47.405 --> 31:48.774 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been a big week.

31:48.807 --> 31:52.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To help make sense of it all,
the analysis
of Shields And brooks.

31:52.077 --> 31:56.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and
New York Times columnist David
Brooks.

31:56.715 --> 32:01.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I thought we were going to
be talking
tonight, first of all, about the
president's

32:01.253 --> 32:02.487 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
address.

32:02.521 --> 32:05.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, David, Russia, Russia,
Russia, it just
doesn't go away.

32:05.524 --> 32:10.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We now have the attorney general
of the United
States having to recuse himself
from any investigation

32:10.762 --> 32:13.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into what happened with the
Trump campaign.

32:13.398 --> 32:14.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you make of all this?

32:14.633 --> 32:16.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: This is like
Napoleon and the
Russian winter.

32:16.868 --> 32:22.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just coming in droves for
the past few
months, just Russian issues.

32:22.174 --> 32:25.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, I would draw a distinction
between Sessions
and a lot of the other stuff.

32:25.944 --> 32:30.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So far, we don't know if
Sessions had any
substantive contacts on the
campaign stuff

32:30.048 --> 32:32.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or anything that might be really
incriminating.

32:32.184 --> 32:36.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's worth remembering he
was asked specifically
did he talk to Russians about
campaign stuff.

32:36.721 --> 32:39.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so there are a lot of
pointless meetings
in Washington.

32:39.457 --> 32:44.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he could have just had
pointless meeting
to see the ambassador.

32:44.529 --> 32:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he had something nefarious,
would they
really have done it in the
Senate office?

32:47.899 --> 32:51.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I'm not sure the Sessions
stuff will rise
to scandal level.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think he was right to recuse
himself.

32:53.872 --> 33:00.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, on the
general Trump world,
there is contact after contact
with the Russians,

33:00.212 --> 33:02.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and some of them which are
fishy.

33:02.480 --> 33:05.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the two questions that I'm
wondering about
-- and I'm not sure we will ever
know the

33:05.584 --> 33:07.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
answer -- the first is the
obvious one.

33:07.786 --> 33:10.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Did they have contact with
Russians on their
campaign meddling?

33:10.989 --> 33:15.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the second and the more
troubling one
is, who's been investing in
Donald Trump's

33:15.293 --> 33:18.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
companies for all these years?

33:18.096 --> 33:19.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Does he owe somebody something?

33:19.998 --> 33:21.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Should we know about that?

33:21.333 --> 33:23.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And why didn't he release his
taxes?

33:23.401 --> 33:25.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is Russia at the heart of that
as well?

33:25.370 --> 33:30.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so until we get to an answer
of -- and
this is why taxes get released,
so you can

33:30.108 --> 33:34.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know if somebody is really in
debt to some
other foreign power.

33:34.179 --> 33:36.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we don't know the answer to
that because
of his secrecy.

33:36.248 --> 33:39.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Mark, those
are questions
that we're unlikely to get the
answers to

33:39.551 --> 33:40.919 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
any time soon.

33:40.952 --> 33:43.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, under the
status quo,
I think that is true.

33:43.121 --> 33:46.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the questions David
asks are salient
and important.

33:46.725 --> 33:54.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As far as Senator Sessions is
concerned, Judy,
it follows the pattern that
these come out

33:54.532 --> 33:56.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
after there's a press report.

33:56.501 --> 33:58.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It happened with General Flynn.

33:58.470 --> 34:07.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And unlike General Flynn, where
there really
is strong, more than suspicion,
that he discussed

34:07.479 --> 34:12.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policy and actions with the
Russian ambassador,
I don't think anybody who knows
Jeff Sessions

34:12.951 --> 34:14.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thinks that's the case.

34:14.152 --> 34:17.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there is one question that
just demands
an answer.

34:17.789 --> 34:20.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is, he testifies before
Al Franken.

34:20.959 --> 34:22.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Yes, it's a rambling question.

34:22.761 --> 34:29.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then Pat Leahy, the senior
senator, pro
tem of the Senate, writes it out
in longhand,

34:29.067 --> 34:32.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
any contacts from campaign
post-election?

34:32.971 --> 34:38.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, you leave that hearing, you
give that
answer, you go back to your
office, staff

34:38.576 --> 34:42.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people are with you, your
scheduler is with
you, your press person is with
you.

34:42.847 --> 34:46.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why not just come out and say,
hey, look,
this was -- I did have these
meetings with

34:46.918 --> 34:47.886 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the ambassador?

34:47.919 --> 34:48.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And the question, why?

34:48.920 --> 34:52.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why does it have to come out
this way?

34:52.223 --> 34:53.191 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it does.

34:53.224 --> 34:54.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It does fit a pattern.

34:54.225 --> 34:55.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no two ways about it.

34:55.627 --> 34:58.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think it's a disturbing
pattern.

34:58.396 --> 35:00.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a distressing pattern.

35:00.332 --> 35:05.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And whether it's Roger Stone or
Carter Page
or -- I mean, these are not
attractive, appealing

35:05.737 --> 35:11.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people, whether it's Paul
Manafort and his
Russian contacts.

35:11.776 --> 35:14.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not a question simply of
dealing with
Russia.

35:14.346 --> 35:20.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a question that we have now
17 intelligence
agencies in the United States of
America unanimously

35:20.585 --> 35:26.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agreeing that Russia meddled in
this -- and
tried to discredit our
democratic process.

35:26.224 --> 35:29.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I mean, you know, that's
whom they were
dealing with.

35:29.160 --> 35:30.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It wasn't a question of just
making a quick
buck.

35:31.029 --> 35:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, David, all
sorts of questions
come out of this.

35:34.399 --> 35:37.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it enough for the attorney
general to recuse
himself?

35:37.869 --> 35:39.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do we need to think about
something bigger?

35:39.971 --> 35:44.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a lot of conversation
now about whether
there should be an outside,
independent investigation.

35:44.476 --> 35:47.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, what needs to happen
right now?

35:47.512 --> 35:48.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I think the
recusal is right.

35:48.813 --> 35:52.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The calls for resignation strike
me as completely
over the top.

35:52.117 --> 35:54.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think we need to know, why
Russia?

35:54.486 --> 35:57.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are 200-odd countries in
the world.

35:57.422 --> 36:00.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Why has so much of this
administration focused
on Russia?

36:00.425 --> 36:05.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, is it because Donald Trump
is very sensitive
to the charge that he was handed
the election

36:05.430 --> 36:07.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by Russia and he is sort of
Russia-focused?

36:07.832 --> 36:15.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the Russian obsession
predates that, which
is why I think, after he
declared bankruptcy,

36:15.140 --> 36:17.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of Americans actually
wanted to invest
in Donald Trump.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So who was doing all the
investing?

36:19.677 --> 36:22.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has got all these luxury
properties around
the world.

36:22.113 --> 36:23.081 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Who was buying?

36:23.114 --> 36:27.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, so to me, it's, why the
Russia focus?

36:27.052 --> 36:30.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is it some ideological thing he
has for Russia?

36:30.188 --> 36:32.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is it some man crush on Vladimir
Putin?

36:32.690 --> 36:33.958 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

36:33.992 --> 36:35.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, somehow, that's the part
that needs to
be investigated.

36:35.827 --> 36:39.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't -- I'm not -- I'm
generally not for
special prosecutors and things,
because they

36:39.064 --> 36:40.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tend to run out of control.

36:40.932 --> 36:45.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But getting to the core of that
issue, I don't
know how you do it, but that is
how you -- I

36:45.203 --> 36:46.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
think we need to do it.

36:46.671 --> 36:48.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, that's the
only way you
could get to some of this.

36:48.506 --> 36:53.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I think,
Judy, first of
all, I think David raises the
questions that

36:53.611 --> 36:57.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do demand an answer, and how are
we going
to get that answer?

36:57.248 --> 37:02.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The recusal, he had no choice
but to recuse
himself.

37:02.120 --> 37:06.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The red Republican wall was
breaking.

37:06.057 --> 37:11.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When Kevin McCarthy, the
Republican House
leader, calls for his recusal,
when Jason

37:11.796 --> 37:17.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chaffetz, one of the last
defenders of Donald
Trump, having said, after the
"Hollywood Access"

37:17.836 --> 37:23.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tape that he couldn't face his
14-year-old
daughter and then still support
Donald Trump,

37:23.475 --> 37:28.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then two weeks later endorsed
again Donald
Trump for president, he said he
had to recuse

37:28.546 --> 37:29.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
-- Jeff Sessions had to.

37:29.948 --> 37:32.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so did Rob Portman, the
senator from Ohio.

37:32.917 --> 37:37.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I think this was what he had
to do.

37:37.555 --> 37:43.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the problem with the House
Intelligence
Committee and the Senate
Intelligence Committee

37:43.728 --> 37:50.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that the White House felt
comfortable enough
to call them and ask them to be
their character

37:50.268 --> 37:56.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
witness with the press, Richard
Burr, the
senator from North Carolina, and
Devin Nunes,

37:56.608 --> 37:58.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the congressman from California.

37:58.643 --> 38:05.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the question is, the only
time you move
to an independent, if you had an
ideal Baker-Hamilton,

38:05.583 --> 38:10.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
9/11-type group, is, quite
honestly, when
there is a lack of faith and a
lack of faith

38:10.555 --> 38:12.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and confidence in the existing
process.

38:12.123 --> 38:14.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, this is why
institutions
matter so much.

38:14.526 --> 38:18.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Watergate, you had -- sure,
it was partisan,
but you still could go to a
congressional

38:18.630 --> 38:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hearing and there would be some
sense there
would a Howard Baker, who would
be an honest

38:22.033 --> 38:23.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
broker, or Hamilton, Lee
Hamilton.

38:23.268 --> 38:24.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's exactly
right.

38:24.536 --> 38:26.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Or you had people
like that.

38:26.738 --> 38:28.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And maybe there are people like
that floating
around in Washington who you
could appoint,

38:28.940 --> 38:31.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like a 9/11 Commission.

38:31.109 --> 38:35.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the official institutions of
Congress,
not a lot of credibility there
right now,

38:35.613 --> 38:39.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and not a lot of expectation
they would act
in any way, other than as
partisan bodies.

38:39.984 --> 38:42.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so this is what we see when
we get the
breakdown of institutions.

38:42.287 --> 38:43.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, meanwhile...

38:43.922 --> 38:46.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Angus King --
Angus King from
Maine and John McCain from
Arizona.

38:46.257 --> 38:48.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: An independent
and a Republican.

38:48.693 --> 38:50.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: An independent.

38:50.361 --> 38:52.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both established independents
and respected,
you're going to go that
direction.

38:52.096 --> 38:55.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But I was just
going to say,
the way the president is
responding today

38:55.500 --> 39:01.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is by tweeting pictures of Nancy
Pelosi and
Chuck Schumer meeting with the
Russian ambassador

39:01.306 --> 39:03.208 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a few years ago.

39:03.241 --> 39:05.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's talk about the speech
Tuesday night.

39:05.043 --> 39:08.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It feels longer ago than that,
Mark.

39:08.646 --> 39:13.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do we know now more about what
Donald Trump's,
President Trump's priorities are
after that

39:13.952 --> 39:14.919 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
speech?

39:14.953 --> 39:16.688 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Not really.

39:16.721 --> 39:22.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, we have absolutely -- we
know general
objectives, but we have no idea
how we're

39:22.160 --> 39:24.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to get from here to there.

39:24.929 --> 39:31.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he got an enormous amount of
praise, and
which basically lasted until the
stories about

39:32.003 --> 39:34.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia and Attorney General
Sessions came
out.

39:34.739 --> 39:38.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But there is a low bar, Judy.

39:39.010 --> 39:47.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is somebody who has called
other politicians,
other Republicans, dopey,
hypocrite, stupid,

39:47.852 --> 39:51.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lying, weak, loser, choker.

39:51.489 --> 39:57.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, and so he comes in, and
he doesn't
do this, and, all of a sudden,
my goodness

39:57.262 --> 39:59.497 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
gracious, you know, it is.

39:59.530 --> 40:01.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's the Gettysburg Address.

40:01.266 --> 40:05.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the -- FDR's Four Freedom
speech.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What he did was, he was
controlled for an
hour.

40:07.672 --> 40:08.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There was no invective.

40:08.806 --> 40:11.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was no vitriol, or very
little.

40:11.175 --> 40:18.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as far as specifics, we
know health care
is going to be bigger, and
better, and cheaper,

40:18.116 --> 40:19.417 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and more access.

40:19.450 --> 40:22.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And now you can't even get ahold
of the plan.

40:22.620 --> 40:25.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's like the Manhattan Project
at Los Alamos.

40:25.623 --> 40:27.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They keep it in a locked room.

40:27.191 --> 40:29.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maybe David has seen it, but I
don't know
anybody else who has.

40:29.494 --> 40:30.461 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

40:30.495 --> 40:31.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: It's in my dry
cleaner.

40:31.496 --> 40:32.463 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

40:32.497 --> 40:33.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: OK.

40:33.498 --> 40:34.932 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

40:34.966 --> 40:36.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I thought the
speech was Shakespearian,
Lincolnesque.

40:36.067 --> 40:37.835 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

40:37.869 --> 40:43.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I would say I
think we do have
a -- I got a better sense of him
-- or I got

40:43.408 --> 40:46.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lesser sense of him, because,
usually, it's
all about him.

40:46.978 --> 40:50.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it's about the clown
behavior or the things
Mark is talking about.

40:50.248 --> 40:51.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

40:51.683 --> 40:53.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But, here, you
have got a little
idea of the project.

40:53.484 --> 40:59.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, frankly, I got a little
sense of why
the guy got elected, because we
were all having

40:59.324 --> 41:02.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debates about big government vs.
small government,
our normal debates.

41:02.894 --> 41:07.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Republicans were standing
for certain
sort of things, eliminate the
national debt,

41:07.865 --> 41:11.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be global policemen, restore the
right to
life.

41:11.836 --> 41:13.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He ignores all that.

41:13.771 --> 41:15.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's just not doing any of that
stuff.

41:15.440 --> 41:20.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's saying, you, Americans, you
feel endangered,
and I'm going to protect you.

41:20.978 --> 41:27.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the line I had was that
he's privatized
compassion and nationalized
intimidation.

41:27.218 --> 41:29.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what I meant by that --
probably too proud
of that line.

41:29.187 --> 41:30.154 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:30.188 --> 41:31.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: What I meant by
that...

41:31.889 --> 41:32.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're allowed to
repeat your
good lines on the program any
time.

41:32.256 --> 41:34.192 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:34.225 --> 41:38.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: What I meant, that
all the compassionate
parts of government, giving
people a hand

41:38.162 --> 41:40.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up or a safety net, he wants to
cut all that.

41:40.698 --> 41:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's just not part of the
emotional
repertoire.

41:43.034 --> 41:47.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But being tough on our enemies,
whether foreign
or domestic, that, he's doing in
magnitudes.

41:47.372 --> 41:51.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, if that is
what he is doing,
if we know a little more,
Mark...

41:51.409 --> 41:53.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Privatize profit
and socialize
loss.

41:53.544 --> 41:54.979 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:55.012 --> 41:57.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That was the
Republican economic
mandate for a long time.

41:57.148 --> 41:58.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Updating it.

41:58.149 --> 42:00.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

42:00.084 --> 42:02.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, is he in any
better shape,
Mark, in terms of getting his
programs through?

42:03.020 --> 42:05.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I realize we don't know a lot of
detail right
now.

42:05.556 --> 42:07.058 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But is...

42:07.091 --> 42:08.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, they have
made a calculation,
a political calculation.

42:08.926 --> 42:10.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's hard to argue with it.

42:10.461 --> 42:12.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a Republican Congress.

42:12.630 --> 42:14.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's playing very much to his
base.

42:14.332 --> 42:16.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's not expanding his base.

42:16.667 --> 42:20.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's not reaching across the
divide, except
by not insulting.

42:20.705 --> 42:28.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he is catering to and
holding and speaking
to and speaking for his base,
those who supported

42:28.346 --> 42:29.280 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

42:29.313 --> 42:32.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, he's 85 or 87 to nine among
Republicans.

42:32.683 --> 42:37.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As long as he's there, OK, as
long as his
numbers are that high,
Republicans are going

42:37.755 --> 42:39.557 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to fall in line.

42:39.590 --> 42:42.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're going to support him, or
they're going
to at least think two or three
times before

42:42.794 --> 42:44.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
breaking with him.

42:44.228 --> 42:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, Judy, there is no sense of
how he's going
to pay for any of this.

42:48.866 --> 42:51.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there's no sense of the
specifics.

42:52.003 --> 42:57.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have no more specific idea on
what he wants
to do on tax cuts and tax reform
than we had

42:57.708 --> 42:58.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
before the speech.

42:58.709 --> 43:00.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

43:00.578 --> 43:03.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they can find the health care
plan under
the magic sofa cushion in the
Capitol, wherever

43:03.881 --> 43:07.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's hiding, they're going to
find a lot of
opposition on the right.

43:07.418 --> 43:09.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is actually going to be
a trope of
the Trump administration.

43:09.287 --> 43:12.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they ever actually come up
with an agenda,
there is going to be a lot of
people on his

43:13.024 --> 43:17.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right who are Republicans who
are going to
be very unhappy with the levels
of spending

43:17.295 --> 43:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or even the levels of tax cuts
-- or tax credits
in the health care plan.

43:22.233 --> 43:26.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think, on substantive
matters on a lot
of these issues, they're going
to have a big

43:26.137 --> 43:27.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
issue, big problem.

43:27.972 --> 43:32.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, secondly, a lot of these
programs, like
the health care, it shifts risk
down to the

43:32.343 --> 43:33.311 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
individuals.

43:33.344 --> 43:35.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: It does.

43:35.079 --> 43:37.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And I happen to
think it could
create good markets and reduce
costs.

43:37.448 --> 43:39.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But you're definitely shifting
risk.

43:39.317 --> 43:41.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a lot of Americans are like,
I have got
enough risk in life.

43:41.052 --> 43:42.019 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No thank you.

43:42.053 --> 43:43.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that is going to
come back.

43:43.855 --> 43:46.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we're eight
going to
be looking at the sofa on the
Hill or at David's

43:46.557 --> 43:47.525 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
dry cleaner.

43:47.558 --> 43:50.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: David's dry
cleaner.

43:50.161 --> 44:03.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Brooks,
Mark Shields,
thank you both.

44:03.841 --> 44:10.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now: unexpected revelations more
than 60 years
after one of the more seminal
moments in the

44:10.715 --> 44:12.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
civil rights era.

44:12.617 --> 44:17.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the focus of Timothy
Tyson's new book,
"The Blood of Emmett Till," the
latest addition

44:17.355 --> 44:19.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the "NewsHour" Bookshelf.

44:19.390 --> 44:21.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown spoke with him
recently.

44:21.192 --> 44:23.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Why retell this
story?

44:23.661 --> 44:25.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What drove you to want to take
another look?

44:25.496 --> 44:28.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIMOTHY TYSON, Author, "The
Blood of Emmett
Till": I was actually working on
another book,

44:28.132 --> 44:32.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a nice woman from Raleigh
called on the
phone and wanted to tell me how
much she liked

44:32.370 --> 44:34.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
my previous book.

44:34.238 --> 44:36.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She said, well, my mother-in-law
is coming
next week.

44:36.741 --> 44:40.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's -- I gave her the book for
Christmas,
and she liked it very much, and
we'd like

44:40.077 --> 44:41.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to have a cup of coffee with
you.

44:41.178 --> 44:43.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She said, well, you might know
my mother-in-law.

44:43.948 --> 44:46.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Her name was Carolyn Bryant.

44:46.384 --> 44:52.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, of course, being a
historian of the 20th
century civil rights movement, I
knew that

44:52.423 --> 44:58.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carolyn Bryant had not uttered a
word in public
about the lynching of Emmett
Till since 1955.

44:58.129 --> 45:04.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The woman at the
store who
made the claims about Emmett
Till.

45:04.335 --> 45:06.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TIMOTHY TYSON: In whose name he
was lynched.

45:06.270 --> 45:09.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Remind us what
she had said,
and what she says now.

45:09.407 --> 45:15.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIMOTHY TYSON: In court, she
testified to
something that was tantamount to
sexual assault,

45:15.613 --> 45:20.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to coming around the counter,
grabbing her
by the waist with his hands, and
not letting

45:20.618 --> 45:23.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
go, and speaking to her
sexually.

45:23.287 --> 45:29.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You have broken
some new ground
here with having her say that
the most sensational

45:29.226 --> 45:31.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
parts of her testimony were not
true.

45:31.529 --> 45:33.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TIMOTHY TYSON: Yes.

45:33.064 --> 45:39.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In reference to the sort of
physical piece,
she said, that part's not true.

45:40.004 --> 45:43.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nothing that boy did could ever
justify what
happened to him.

45:43.608 --> 45:48.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You know, I read
that in your
book, when she says that, and,
in one way,

45:48.145 --> 45:50.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's the most obvious statement
possible,
right?

45:50.514 --> 45:54.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course nothing that he did
could justify
what happened to him.

45:54.785 --> 45:59.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what importance do you feel,
if any, of
her finally saying it?

45:59.624 --> 46:05.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIMOTHY TYSON: I'm sure it's
important to
the Till family and to other
people who have

46:05.162 --> 46:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- you know, have a kind of
connection to
the case.

46:08.866 --> 46:13.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, you know, I certainly never
thought she
was telling the truth at trial.

46:13.938 --> 46:15.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People are really interested
because it's
a mystery.

46:15.906 --> 46:21.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's been in hiding almost for
all these
60-some years.

46:21.879 --> 46:25.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was her husband who did the
killing and
her brother-in-law.

46:25.149 --> 46:27.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not clear what role she had
in that.

46:27.852 --> 46:34.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the FBI investigated this in
2005 and
said there was nothing to
prosecute her on.

46:34.158 --> 46:39.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a grand jury that had a
black majority
ruled not to indict her.

46:39.997 --> 46:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Do you know why
she finally
spoke?

46:41.799 --> 46:43.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TIMOTHY TYSON: I can't say for a
fact.

46:43.100 --> 46:44.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I can't read her mind.

46:44.101 --> 46:45.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And she didn't say.

46:45.803 --> 46:48.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was kind of an implication
that she
was in poor health and getting
on in years

46:48.239 --> 46:52.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and wanted to have her say and
tell what she
knew.

46:52.810 --> 46:58.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The real heroine
of that -- of
the whole episode is Emmett
Till's mother,

46:58.049 --> 46:59.016 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Mamie.

46:59.050 --> 47:01.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TIMOTHY TYSON: Yes, so
courageous.

47:01.686 --> 47:09.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She brings Emmett's body back
from Mississippi
and has an open casket funeral,
so everybody

47:09.460 --> 47:12.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can see what the world did to my
boy, she
said.

47:12.663 --> 47:18.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She also gets on the phone even
before the
body comes back and starts
calling reporters,

47:18.035 --> 47:23.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and just becomes a clearinghouse
for this
media operation.

47:23.040 --> 47:26.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's fascinating,
because she
took her personal grief and made
it into a

47:26.444 --> 47:27.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
kind of public awareness.

47:28.012 --> 47:30.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIMOTHY TYSON: That's right.

47:30.147 --> 47:31.115 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

47:31.148 --> 47:32.116 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's right.

47:32.149 --> 47:34.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And she knows Chicago.

47:34.051 --> 47:41.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she leverages the strength
of black Chicago,
of the institutions that had
been built there

47:41.292 --> 47:47.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the decades, The Chicago
Defender, Johnson
Publishing, which is "Ebony" and
"Jet," black

47:47.131 --> 47:49.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
labor unions, and so on.

47:49.734 --> 47:53.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With that, a movement emerges
that becomes
the infrastructure for the
national civil

47:53.370 --> 47:55.206 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
rights movement.

47:55.239 --> 48:00.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the grassroots activists
in Mississippi
spoke at Dexter Street Baptist
Church, invited

48:00.945 --> 48:04.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there by an unknown pastor named
Martin Luther
King.

48:04.348 --> 48:06.951 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Rosa Parks was in the
congregation.

48:06.984 --> 48:11.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And four days later, she was
asked to move
to the back of the bus.

48:11.455 --> 48:15.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She later says, "I thought about
Emmett Till,
and I could not move."

48:15.092 --> 48:19.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And the name
Emmett Till cited
to this day.

48:19.764 --> 48:27.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIMOTHY TYSON: He's emblematic
of racial injustice
in America, and of violence
against young

48:27.104 --> 48:32.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
black men in particular, and the
ruthless
indifference to the lives of
young black men.

48:32.309 --> 48:36.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, yes, this is a story that
won't let us
go.

48:36.914 --> 48:38.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What compels you?

48:38.749 --> 48:40.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What pushes you personally to
look at this
history?

48:40.885 --> 48:45.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIMOTHY TYSON: The summer that I
turned 11,
a boy that I played with every
day, his father

48:45.856 --> 48:52.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and his brothers murdered this
young black
man in public for speaking
perhaps something

48:52.563 --> 48:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
flirtatious to a white woman at
the store
counter.

48:56.066 --> 49:01.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they chased him out of the
store and shot
him from behind and then beat
his head in

49:01.205 --> 49:02.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with stocks of the rifles.

49:02.740 --> 49:04.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And this wasn't a murder
mystery.

49:04.341 --> 49:08.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they were acquitted really
in protest
against school integration.

49:08.379 --> 49:11.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was almost an atmosphere of
war.

49:11.182 --> 49:16.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I wondered, how did this all
get started?

49:16.987 --> 49:18.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why am I in this craziness?

49:18.989 --> 49:26.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that began a process of
discovery that
led me, you know, a long way.

49:26.564 --> 49:29.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The book is "The
Blood of Emmett
Till."

49:29.500 --> 49:30.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Timothy Tyson, thank you very
much.

49:30.568 --> 49:32.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TIMOTHY TYSON: Well, thank you,
Jeffrey.

49:32.870 --> 49:35.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for having me.

49:36.006 --> 49:48.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, as the
world's Christians
begin Lent, a six-week period of
introspection

49:48.953 --> 49:55.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in preparation for Easter,
reflections from
Casper ter Kuile, a researcher
at Harvard

49:55.559 --> 50:01.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
University, who shares his
humble opinion
on the soul survival happening
outside America's

50:01.632 --> 50:03.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
churches.

50:03.133 --> 50:05.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CASPER TER KUILE, Harvard
University: I grew
up never going to church.

50:05.703 --> 50:11.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as a 30-year-old married
man, I still
don't, not because I don't value
reflection,

50:11.742 --> 50:14.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
community, even the experience
of the divine.

50:14.144 --> 50:15.446 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I do.

50:15.479 --> 50:18.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But traditional religious
congregations don't
appeal to me.

50:18.649 --> 50:20.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I'm not alone.

50:20.818 --> 50:24.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Millennials are turning away
from religion
faster than any other age group.

50:24.388 --> 50:30.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And according to the Pew
Research Center,
more than a third of Americans
between 18

50:30.327 --> 50:34.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and 35 are now unaffiliated,
meaning, when
asked on a survey what religious
identity

50:34.665 --> 50:37.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they hold, they answer none of
the above.

50:37.735 --> 50:43.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what's really interesting is
that the
overwhelming majority of us
nones aren't necessarily

50:43.107 --> 50:44.842 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
atheists.

50:44.875 --> 50:50.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two-thirds believe in God or a
universal spirit,
and one in five even pray every
day.

50:50.481 --> 50:52.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We aren't young people who hate
religion.

50:52.850 --> 50:58.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a growing group that feel
like they have
been left behind by religious
institutions.

50:58.155 --> 51:02.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a move that confused a lot of
my friends
and family, I have found
countless examples

51:02.159 --> 51:07.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of other millennials creating
new forms of
community that often fulfill the
same functions

51:07.431 --> 51:10.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that a traditional religious
group would have.

51:10.200 --> 51:12.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they come in all shapes and
sizes.

51:12.603 --> 51:17.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It might be a regular meal with
strangers
to share honestly one's
experience after losing

51:17.408 --> 51:20.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a loved one, like the
organization The Dinner
Party.

51:20.911 --> 51:27.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Within a few years, The Dinner
Party has spread
to 116 cities across the U.S.
hosted by volunteers

51:27.952 --> 51:30.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who create sacred spaces for
their guests.

51:30.854 --> 51:35.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It might be lifting weights and
climbing ropes
five mornings a week like at
CrossFit.

51:35.592 --> 51:40.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And if you have a friend
involved in a CrossFit,
you will know how evangelical
that community

51:40.064 --> 51:41.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is.

51:41.999 --> 51:47.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or it might be experiencing
healing and forgiveness
through movement and meditation
at Afro Flow

51:47.104 --> 51:48.906 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yoga.

51:48.939 --> 51:53.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Each of these communities and
others like
them shape participants' world
views, ethics

51:53.143 --> 51:55.012 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and behaviors.

51:55.045 --> 51:59.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in a culture where many are
hungry for
connection, these communities
offer the experience

51:59.316 --> 52:05.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of being part of something
bigger than themselves,
what some theologians might
describe as experiencing

52:05.289 --> 52:06.991 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the divine.

52:07.024 --> 52:11.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, you may dismiss these
communities as
simple entertainment, but we're
convinced

52:11.395 --> 52:15.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that this is the new face of
religious life
in America.

52:15.366 --> 52:19.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just as you would expect in a
religious congregation,
people in these communities
build friendships

52:19.970 --> 52:22.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and drive one another to the
hospital when
they need a ride.

52:22.973 --> 52:25.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They help each other raise money
to fight
cancer.

52:25.509 --> 52:29.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And some are even getting
involved in struggles
for more affordable housing.

52:29.713 --> 52:33.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
While a few thousand churches
close every
year, many fewer open.

52:33.817 --> 52:39.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, as you drive through your
town and notice
an empty house of worship, pay
attention next

52:39.256 --> 52:43.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
time you see a community
workspace, a climbing
gym or a micro-brewery.

52:43.894 --> 52:54.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They may just be the new center
of soulful
community that you have been
looking for.

52:54.905 --> 53:03.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online right
now: We preview a new
documentary on PBS'

53:03.213 --> 53:07.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"American Masters" about country
music star
Patsy Cline.

53:07.284 --> 53:12.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We visit her hometown and learn
about her
hardscrabble early days before
she found fame.

53:12.823 --> 53:18.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:18.529 --> 53:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And tune in later tonight on
"Washington Week":
the reporter who broke the story
that led

53:23.367 --> 53:27.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Attorney General Sessions to
recuse himself
from the investigation.

53:27.971 --> 53:33.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On "PBS NewsHour Weekend"
Saturday: As cities
become more densely populated, a
new film

53:34.011 --> 53:37.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
looks at how that might spur
innovation.

53:37.781 --> 53:39.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:39.450 --> 53:40.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:40.451 --> 53:41.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Have a great weekend.

53:41.752 --> 53:49.393 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you, and see you soon.
