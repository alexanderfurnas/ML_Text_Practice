ESTABLISHMENT GOVERNING WING WAS

01:58.852 --> 02:00.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON FULL DISPLAY BECAUSE YOU

VOTING MEMBERS.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE NEEDED 218 TO CROSS THE

02:18.805 --> 02:20.073 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THRESHOLD TO WIN.

02:20.073 --> 02:21.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT ON THAT FIRST ROUND OF

02:21.842 --> 02:24.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BALLOTING, PEREZ WAS ONE SHORT

02:24.745 --> 02:26.346 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ELLISON WAS AT 200.

02:26.346 --> 02:28.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT TOOK HIM TO THAT SECOND

02:28.548 --> 02:29.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROUND.

02:29.182 --> 02:30.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FOUR OTHER CANDIDATES ENDED

02:30.751 --> 02:32.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UP DROPPING OUT AND HE WOUND

02:32.386 --> 02:34.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UP BEING ABLE TO GET PAST THAT

02:34.654 --> 02:35.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THRESHOLD.

02:35.222 --> 02:36.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

02:36.456 --> 02:39.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN PEREZ WAS NAMED THE WINNER,

02:39.192 --> 02:40.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WAS STANDING IN FRONT OF A

02:40.394 --> 02:42.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HUGE CROWD OF ELLISON SUPPORTERS

02:42.996 --> 02:45.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO CONTINUED TO KEEP CHANTING,

02:45.799 --> 02:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"MONEY OUT OF POLITICS," AND

02:47.300 --> 02:48.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING

02:48.668 --> 02:49.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM PEREZ.

02:49.636 --> 02:51.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEREZ MADE A VERY DEFT MOVE BY

02:51.071 --> 02:53.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NAMING ELLISON HIS DEPUTY AND

02:53.940 --> 02:56.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT SEEMED TO QUIET THE CROWD.

02:56.143 --> 02:57.711 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: THESE TENSIONS

02:57.711 --> 03:00.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON'T DISSIPATE IMMEDIATELY.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.982 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> NO, THEY DON'T GO AWAY

03:01.982 --> 03:02.649 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMMEDIATELY.

03:02.649 --> 03:04.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE

03:04.317 --> 03:05.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WIND UP DOING-- IT'S KIND OF FUN

03:05.452 --> 03:07.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO ME TO SEE PEOPLE PUT THIS

03:07.087 --> 03:09.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUCH STOCK INTO A PARTY

03:09.623 --> 03:10.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHAIRMAN.

03:10.290 --> 03:11.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE, THEY'RE NOT THE PERSON

03:11.858 --> 03:12.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.

03:12.893 --> 03:15.295 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE NOT THE PERSON WHO, YOU

03:15.295 --> 03:16.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW, IS GOING TO WAVE A MAGIC

03:16.730 --> 03:18.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAND AND CHANGE THE FACT THAT

03:18.465 --> 03:21.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRATS ARE OUT OF POWER IN

03:21.034 --> 03:23.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATE LEGISLATURES, IN

03:23.103 --> 03:25.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNORSHIPS, IN CONGRESS.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, AT THEIR LOWEST POINT

03:27.507 --> 03:29.643 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF POWER IN MORE THAN 100 YEARS,

03:29.643 --> 03:30.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY.

03:30.444 --> 03:31.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO IS AN

03:31.611 --> 03:33.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORGANIZATIONAL FIGURE, SOMEONE

03:33.413 --> 03:34.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO

03:34.181 --> 03:35.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RAISE MONEY, AND THAT'S NOT

03:35.582 --> 03:37.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING DEMOCRATS-- THIS GROUP

03:37.451 --> 03:38.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF DEMOCRATS WANTS TO

03:38.385 --> 03:39.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NECESSARILY BE TALKING ABOUT.

03:39.686 --> 03:40.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW THEY

03:40.921 --> 03:42.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STOP DONALD TRUMP AND THAT'S A

03:42.556 --> 03:44.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOT HARDER TO DO FOR A PARTY

03:44.491 --> 03:45.125 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHAIRMAN.

03:45.125 --> 03:46.059 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS INTERESTING FOR ME TO

03:46.059 --> 03:47.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WATCH THAT, ESPECIALLY IN

03:47.627 --> 03:49.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPARISON WITH REPUBLICANS WERE

03:49.396 --> 03:50.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN 2009.

03:50.330 --> 03:51.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DID SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR

03:51.531 --> 03:52.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN THEY HAD MICHAEL STEELE

03:52.799 --> 03:54.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WINNING, WHEN THE PARTY DIDN'T

03:54.501 --> 03:59.840 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WANT TO BE ALIGNED WITH DAWSON

03:59.840 --> 04:02.075 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND APPEARED TO BE SIDING WITH A

04:02.075 --> 04:05.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHITE SOUTHERN REPUBLICAN WHEN

04:05.112 --> 04:06.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU HAD THE FIRST BLACK

04:06.379 --> 04:07.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT.

04:07.047 --> 04:08.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO SOME OF THOSE SAME SPLITS

04:08.615 --> 04:09.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
START TO EMERGE HERE ON THE

04:09.850 --> 04:11.351 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRATIC SIDE WITH THEM OUT OF

04:11.351 --> 04:11.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POWER.

04:11.885 --> 04:12.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: YOU KNOW, BOTH

WE'LL SORT THAT STUFF OUT.

10:12.545 --> 10:13.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

POINT.

10:14.314 --> 10:15.482 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TRUMP SAYS HE'LL RETURN.

10:18.184 --> 10:19.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A YEAR FROM NOW, WE WILL SEE

10:19.686 --> 10:20.954 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHETHER THEY HAVE ACCOMPLISHED

10:20.954 --> 10:22.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

BEEN SAYING.

10:37.770 --> 10:38.972 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> RIGHT.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.106 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT'S A BIG UNIFYING

10:40.106 --> 10:41.841 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT AS A WHOLE

10:47.780 --> 10:48.982 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NECESSARILY.

10:48.982 --> 10:49.983 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION

10:49.983 --> 10:51.284 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THINGS LIKE FREE SPEECH ON

10:51.284 --> 10:52.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAMPUS, WHICH THE YOUNGER

10:52.485 --> 10:53.853 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

10:53.853 --> 10:55.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND, SURE, WHEN YOU ATTACK THE

MEDIA, THAT'S SOMETHING

10:56.389 --> 10:57.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERYBODY ON THE RIGHT CAN GET

10:57.690 --> 10:58.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

10:58.258 --> 10:59.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

AREN'T ACCURATELY REFLECTED.

TRUMP'S TIES TO RUSSIA.

11:10.970 --> 11:12.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
