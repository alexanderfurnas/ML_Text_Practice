GOING TO HIT THE CONGRESS AND

03:03.984 --> 03:05.652 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SPEAKER BECAUSE A LOT OF

WHAT HE DID WAS JUST

03:06.520 --> 03:07.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MYSTIFYING.

A LOT OF THE POLICY IN THE

PRESIDENT SAID IN TERMS OF

03:13.660 --> 03:16.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSURANCE FOR EVERYBODY.

03:16.063 --> 03:17.264 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN THE ENDLESS AND

03:17.264 --> 03:18.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO FEED THE

03:18.799 --> 03:20.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

DOZEN MODERATES.

03:26.973 --> 03:30.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

MADE-- "I AM THE OUTSIDER, I AM

03:56.770 --> 03:58.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DEAL CUTTER, I KNOW HOW TO

03:58.505 --> 03:59.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GET THINGS DONE AND CUT THROUGH

03:59.773 --> 04:01.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MORASS OF WASHINGTON"--

04:01.741 --> 04:03.343 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS CLEARLY TAKEN A HIT.

04:03.343 --> 04:05.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK THE SECOND THING,

04:05.412 --> 04:06.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALTHOUGH WHY THIS SHOULD HAVE

04:06.146 --> 04:08.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN A SURPRISE TO ANYBODY, IS

04:08.081 --> 04:09.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP-- LET ME BE BLUNT

04:09.950 --> 04:12.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THIS-- SIMPLY DOESN'T CARE

04:12.385 --> 04:14.020 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THE POLICY IMPLICATIONS.

04:14.020 --> 04:15.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S ABOUT WINNING.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S ABOUT BEATING HIS ENEMIES.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S ABOUT LOOKING SUCCESSFUL.

04:18.325 --> 04:20.560 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO FOR THE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE

04:20.560 --> 04:21.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW SAYING, "ALL RIGHT, WE'LL DO

04:21.561 --> 04:22.529 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAX CUTS, WE'LL DO

04:22.529 --> 04:24.264 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFRASTRUCTURE," HOW ARE THEY

04:24.264 --> 04:25.632 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO DEAL WITH A PRESIDENT

04:25.632 --> 04:28.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO REALLY ISN'T INTERESTED IN

04:28.335 --> 04:30.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DETAILS OF THINGS LIKE TAX

04:30.337 --> 04:31.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CUTS AND HOW WE GET

04:31.271 --> 04:32.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFRASTRUCTURE?

04:32.272 --> 04:33.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: YOU'VE WATCHED

04:33.340 --> 04:35.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A FEW PRESIDENTS NOW COMING

04:35.375 --> 04:36.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT OF THE BLOCKS, ALL OF THEM

04:36.610 --> 04:38.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE SOME SPEED BUMPS.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT COMPARE THIS RASH IN THE

04:40.480 --> 04:42.549 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAST 60 DAYS TO PREVIOUS

04:42.549 --> 04:43.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENTS.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT.

04:45.418 --> 04:48.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BILL CLINTON HAD THE ATTEMPT TO

04:48.321 --> 04:49.356 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
END THE BAN ON GAYS IN THE

04:49.356 --> 04:50.857 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITARY.

04:50.857 --> 04:52.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN KENNEDY HAD THE BAY OF PIGS

04:52.058 --> 04:55.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN APRIL OF 1961, WHICH REALLY

04:55.228 --> 04:56.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAUSED HIM TO TAKE A VERY

04:56.463 --> 04:58.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SERIOUS RETHINKING OF HIS

04:58.798 --> 05:01.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE C.I.A.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SPATE OF THEM, YOU KNOW, THE

05:02.836 --> 05:04.204 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRAVEL BAN, THE SECOND TRAVEL

05:04.204 --> 05:05.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BAN THAT'S IN TROUBLE WITH THE

05:05.272 --> 05:08.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COURTS, THE HIRING AND FIRING OF

05:08.775 --> 05:10.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATIONAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATOR

05:10.744 --> 05:12.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL FLYNN, THE

05:12.045 --> 05:13.213 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STILL-UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT

05:13.213 --> 05:13.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIA.

05:13.780 --> 05:15.749 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK THIS ONE GOES TO THE

05:15.749 --> 05:18.218 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEART OF WHAT PEOPLE THOUGHT WAS

05:18.218 --> 05:19.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO HAPPEN, YOU KNOW.

05:19.352 --> 05:20.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT OUT OF THE BLOCKS, HE

05:20.253 --> 05:22.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID-- HE NOW SAYS HE NEVER

05:22.055 --> 05:24.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTENDED TO... NEVER PROMISED

05:24.191 --> 05:26.626 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPEAL OF OBAMACARE QUICKLY.

05:26.626 --> 05:28.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEAR, HE DID.

05:28.195 --> 05:30.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS NOW

05:30.297 --> 05:31.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACING IS A CHALLENGE TO THE

05:31.965 --> 05:34.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY PREMISE OF HIS ELECTION, AS

05:34.067 --> 05:35.402 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I SAID EARLIER, "I CAN GET

05:35.402 --> 05:36.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINGS DONE."

05:36.736 --> 05:38.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHEN YOU REALIZE THE HEALTH

05:38.004 --> 05:40.373 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARE REPEAL WAS THE PRECURSOR TO

05:40.373 --> 05:42.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINGS LIKE THE TAX CUT PLAN,

05:42.142 --> 05:43.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW ARE THEY GOING TO DO THAT IN

05:43.043 --> 05:44.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ABSENCE OF REPEAL?

05:44.678 --> 05:46.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEAH, HE IS NOW FACING NOT TO

05:46.513 --> 05:47.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MENTION THE APPROVAL RATINGS--

05:47.681 --> 05:49.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH ARE DISMAL, HISTORICALLY

05:49.015 --> 05:50.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISMAL-- HE'S FACING A VERY

05:50.517 --> 05:51.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOUGH ROAD.

05:51.585 --> 05:52.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST ONE QUICK THING, THOUGH.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE JOURNALISTS ARE OLYMPIC

05:54.554 --> 05:55.722 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHAMPIONS IN THE JUMPING TO

05:55.722 --> 05:57.224 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCLUSIONS EVENT.

05:57.224 --> 06:00.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF THIS WERE SEPTEMBER OF '18,

06:00.060 --> 06:01.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REPUBLICANS WOULD BE FACING

06:01.228 --> 06:02.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A DISASTER.

06:02.062 --> 06:04.464 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE A YEAR AND A HALF TO GO.

06:04.464 --> 06:05.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFTER WHAT WE LIVED THROUGH THE

06:05.298 --> 06:06.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAST YEAR AND A HALF, YOU WANT

06:06.099 --> 06:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO TELL ME WE KNOW WHAT'S

06:06.933 --> 06:07.601 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMING?

06:07.601 --> 06:08.301 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WE DON'T.

06:08.301 --> 06:10.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL RIGHT, JEFF GREENFIELD,

06:09.135 --> 06:11.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THANKS SO MUCH.

06:11.338 --> 06:12.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON, SOON AFTER

06:12.572 --> 06:13.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REPUBLICAN HEALTHCARE BILL

06:13.773 --> 06:15.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS PULLED BEFORE ANY VOTE TOOK

06:15.642 --> 06:17.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACE, PRESIDENT TRUMP INDICATED

06:17.944 --> 06:19.579 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE FOCUS WILL NOW SHIFT TO

06:19.579 --> 06:21.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REFORMING THE TAX CODE.

06:21.414 --> 06:22.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TREASURY SECRETARY STEVEN

06:22.849 --> 06:24.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MNUCHIN ECHOED THAT SENTIMENT AT

06:24.584 --> 06:25.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AN EVENT EARLIER IN THE DAY,

06:25.986 --> 06:27.153 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAYING HE WOULD PUSH FOR

06:27.153 --> 06:29.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPREHENSIVE TAX REFORM FOR

06:29.456 --> 06:30.924 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDIVIDUALS AND CORPORATIONS

06:30.924 --> 06:32.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEFORE THE CONGRESSIONAL RECESS

06:32.759 --> 06:33.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN AUGUST.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.061 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MNUCHIN SAID THAT THE PRESIDENT

06:35.061 --> 06:36.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WANTS A TAX CUT FOR THE MIDDLE

06:36.463 --> 06:39.032 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLASS, NOT THE TOP 1%.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST HOW THAT PROCESS WILL BEGIN

06:40.767 --> 06:41.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HOW COMPLICATED IT WILL

06:41.835 --> 06:43.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECOME ARE OPEN QUESTIONS.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOINING US FROM WASHINGTON,

06:44.037 --> 06:45.538 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
D.C., TO DISCUSS WHAT LIES AHEAD

06:45.538 --> 06:47.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR TAX REFORM IS NICK TIMIRAOS

06:47.040 --> 06:48.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL."

06:48.708 --> 06:52.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, SECRETARY MNUCHIN SAYS IT

06:52.979 --> 06:55.282 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS EASIER TO REFORM HEALTH CARE

06:55.282 --> 06:57.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAN THE TAX CODE?

06:57.717 --> 06:58.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YEAH, THAT'S-- THAT'S WHAT HE

06:58.618 --> 06:59.219 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND, YOU KNOW, THERE'S AN

07:01.454 --> 07:03.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARGUMENT THAT HE MADE WHICH WAS

07:03.056 --> 07:05.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALONG THE LINES OF, LOOK, TAXES

07:05.525 --> 07:07.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE SOMETHING REPUBLICANS ARE ON

07:07.060 --> 07:08.061 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SAME PAGE ON.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERYBODY IS GOING TO WANT LOWER

07:09.829 --> 07:10.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAXES.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S A VISCERAL THING FOR

07:12.399 --> 07:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK THE CHALLENGE HERE IS

07:15.302 --> 07:18.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE HEALTH CARE DEBACLE HAS

07:18.905 --> 07:19.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REMINDED EVERYBODY THAT THE

07:19.939 --> 07:21.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DETAILS DO MATTER, RIGHT?

07:21.308 --> 07:23.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE REPUBLICANS FOR YEARS

07:23.376 --> 07:25.779 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOOK VOTE AFTER VOTE ON

07:25.779 --> 07:27.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPEALING OBAMACARE.

07:27.247 --> 07:28.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS SOMETHING EVERYBODY SAID

07:28.214 --> 07:30.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WANTED TO DO, JUST THE SAME

07:30.116 --> 07:31.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS ALL REPUBLICANS SAY WE WANT

07:31.918 --> 07:33.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO LOWER TAXES, WE WANT TO LOWER

07:33.720 --> 07:35.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CORPORATE TAX RATE, TO MAKE

07:35.555 --> 07:37.924 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INVESTMENT AND U.S. BUSINESSES

07:37.924 --> 07:39.326 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE COMPETITIVE.

07:39.326 --> 07:40.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PROBLEM IS GOING TO BE THE

07:40.827 --> 07:41.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAME.

07:41.394 --> 07:42.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DETAILS MATTER.

07:42.829 --> 07:44.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

07:44.664 --> 07:45.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DETAILS YET FROM THE

07:45.665 --> 07:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION.

07:46.533 --> 07:48.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, YOU KNOW, THE BALL IS KIND

07:48.368 --> 07:50.370 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF ON THE TEE FOR THEM HERE TO

07:50.370 --> 07:51.538 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SWING AWAY AND PROPOSE

07:51.538 --> 07:52.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING, BUT WE DON'T YET

07:52.672 --> 07:55.075 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY

07:55.075 --> 07:55.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WANT.

07:55.775 --> 07:57.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ONCE YOU PUT THOSE DETAILS

PROPOSALS WE'VE HEARD REPEATEDLY

08:03.416 --> 08:04.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM REPUBLICANS IS TO LOWER THE

08:04.818 --> 08:06.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM, SAY,

08:06.119 --> 08:07.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
35% TO 20%.

08:07.721 --> 08:08.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THAT COMES WITH ITS OWN

08:08.655 --> 08:10.824 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSEQUENCES.

08:10.824 --> 08:11.424 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> RIGHT.

08:11.424 --> 08:12.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU LOSE A LOT OF REVENUE.

08:12.859 --> 08:14.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND REPUBLICANS ARE TALKING

08:14.260 --> 08:16.830 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT DOING THIS USING THE SAME

08:16.830 --> 08:18.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KIND OF PROCEDURAL VEHICLE

08:18.698 --> 08:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEGISLATIVELY THAT WOULD ALLOW

THEM TO BYPASS THE 60-VOTE

08:22.102 --> 08:23.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THRESHOLD IN THE SENATE SO THAT

08:23.837 --> 08:25.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY CAN DO THIS ON A PARTY LINE

08:25.105 --> 08:25.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTE.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THAT PROCEDURAL HURDLE

08:27.540 --> 08:29.209 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

08:35.882 --> 08:37.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARDER TO DO THIS AFTER HEALTH

08:37.083 --> 08:37.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARE?

08:37.784 --> 08:39.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, SPEAKER RYAN SAID THAT

08:39.486 --> 08:40.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON FRIDAY.

08:40.086 --> 08:41.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE SAID THAT THIS DOES GET

08:41.721 --> 08:42.455 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARDER BECAUSE THERE WERE

08:42.455 --> 08:44.190 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CERTAIN TAXES IN OBAMACARE THAT

08:44.190 --> 08:45.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WERE GOING TO REPEAL.

08:45.325 --> 08:46.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO REPEAL

08:46.259 --> 08:47.027 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE NOW.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.928 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK IT ADDS TO THE URGENCY

08:48.928 --> 08:49.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE.

08:49.429 --> 08:51.464 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WILL BE A GREATER IMPETUS

08:51.464 --> 08:52.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO

08:52.532 --> 08:54.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WANT TO SHOW THEY CAN GET

08:54.501 --> 08:54.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING DONE.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.403 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO WANT

08:56.403 --> 08:58.204 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO HAVE BILL TO SIGN.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK THE OTHER QUESTION IS--

08:59.606 --> 09:01.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT TAX

09:01.241 --> 09:01.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REFORM.

09:01.941 --> 09:03.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

09:03.276 --> 09:05.078 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAX REFORM AND TAX CUTS.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.346 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND YOU HEAR THE PRESIDENT A LOT

09:06.346 --> 09:08.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAYING HE JUST WANTS TO CUT THE

09:08.448 --> 09:09.649 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HECK OUT OF TAXES.

09:09.649 --> 09:11.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WANTS A BIG TAX CUT.

09:11.718 --> 09:12.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS DIFFERENT.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT COULD BE THAT THE

09:14.587 --> 09:15.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION DECIDES, LOOK,

09:15.822 --> 09:16.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE JUST GOING TO TRY TO CUT

09:16.823 --> 09:17.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAXES HERE.

09:17.690 --> 09:19.626 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'LL DEAL WITH THE DEFICITS

09:19.626 --> 09:20.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LATER.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, WE'LL PROPOSE MAYBE

09:21.661 --> 09:23.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROWTH ESTIMATES THAT SHOW THAT

09:23.062 --> 09:24.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DEFICITS WON'T MATTER AS

09:24.798 --> 09:25.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUCH BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO GROW

09:25.832 --> 09:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ECONOMY MORE.

09:26.866 --> 09:28.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THAT'S ANOTHER AREA WHERE

09:28.401 --> 09:29.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU'RE NOT QUITE SURE YET IF

09:29.769 --> 09:31.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
