00:06.573 --> 00:10.277
HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.
I'm Hari Sreenivasan. Gwen Ifill
and Judy Woodruff are away.

00:10.277 --> 00:15.649
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Nearly 10,000 troops will stay
in Afghanistan through 2016, as

00:15.649 --> 00:20.587
President Obama pledges to keep
that country from becoming a
safe haven for terrorists.

00:20.587 --> 00:25.459
Then, following a recent
"Frontline" investigation,
authorities have identified two
new suspects

00:25.459 --> 00:29.963
in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am
jet over Lockerbie, Scotland.

00:29.963 --> 00:33.700
Also ahead, a program to help
inmates stay out of prison.

00:33.700 --> 00:37.070
DONNA ROJAS, American Jobs
Center: How do I live my life
when I go back into the same

00:37.070 --> 00:41.642
community where I may have been
selling drugs and making $1,000
a week, and now you're sending

00:41.642 --> 00:45.212
me out there to
make $8.25 an hour?

00:45.212 --> 00:49.483
HARI SREENIVASAN: We follow
three prisoners on a journey to
get out of jail.

00:49.483 --> 00:53.553
Plus, you might not need as
much sleep as you think.

00:53.553 --> 00:56.456
JERRY SIEGEL, Director, UCLA
Center for Sleep Research:
There's been speculation that
humans

00:56.456 --> 01:00.727
basically used to sleep when it
got dark, which would mean
they'd sleep 10, 11, even

01:00.727 --> 01:04.131
12 hours. But it turns
out that's not the case.

01:04.131 --> 01:06.600
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's "PBS
NewsHour."

01:06.600 --> 01:13.006
(BREAK)

01:13.006 --> 01:26.019
HARI SREENIVASAN: President
Obama announced today he will
keep American troops in
Afghanistan

01:26.019 --> 01:31.091
through the end of his
presidency, extending America's
longest war.

01:31.091 --> 01:35.862
The policy reversal comes after
weeks of worsening violence and
significant gains by Taliban

01:35.862 --> 01:40.567
fighters. We will have more on
the details of the decision
right after the news summary.

01:40.567 --> 01:44.438
Meanwhile, the Associated Press
revealed new details today about
the U.S. airstrike that

01:44.438 --> 01:49.710
killed 22 patients and staff at
a Doctors Without Borders
hospital in Afghanistan. It

01:49.710 --> 01:55.282
said U.S. special operations
analysts knew the Kunduz clinic
was a medical site, but

01:55.282 --> 02:00.420
believed it was being used by a
Pakistani operative coordinating
Taliban activity. Doctors

02:00.420 --> 02:04.358
Without Borders has
disputed that claim.

02:04.358 --> 02:07.461
At the White House, Press
Secretary Josh Earnest said he
wasn't aware of the AP's report,
but

02:07.461 --> 02:09.830
pledged a complete
investigation.

02:09.830 --> 02:14.735
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary: The president's
expectation is that he will

02:14.735 --> 02:20.007
receive a full accounting of
these facts, in the context of a
thorough, objective and

02:20.007 --> 02:23.744
transparent report from the
Department of Defense.

02:23.744 --> 02:27.447
HARI SREENIVASAN: Pentagon
officials initially said the
strike aimed to protect American

02:27.447 --> 02:31.318
troops during a firefight. But
the top U.S. general in
Afghanistan has since
acknowledged

02:31.318 --> 02:34.621
the strike was a mistake.

02:34.621 --> 02:39.593
Former House Speaker Dennis
Hastert will plead guilty in his
federal hush money case. His

02:39.593 --> 02:43.030
attorney said the plea agreement
will be submitted to the judge
Monday, but stopped short of

02:43.030 --> 02:47.868
detailing the specifics. The
73-year-old Illinois Republican
is charged with violating
banking

02:47.868 --> 02:55.876
laws and lying to the FBI in an
effort to pay someone $3.5
million in a cover-up. Multiple

02:55.876 --> 02:58.779
media outlets reported the
payments concealed claims of
sexual misconduct with an
unnamed

02:58.779 --> 03:02.382
male decades ago.

03:02.382 --> 03:07.954
In economic news, stocks on Wall
Street recorded their steepest
gains in nearly two weeks today.

03:07.954 --> 03:11.658
That was due in part to strong
bank earnings and speculation
the Federal Reserve will hold

03:11.658 --> 03:16.596
off on raising interest rates
until next year. The Dow Jones
industrial average soared 217

03:16.596 --> 03:24.905
points to close at 17141. The
Nasdaq rose 87 points, and the
S&P 500 added 29.

03:24.905 --> 03:29.543
In Syria, government troops
launched a major new offensive
against rebel forces today.

03:29.543 --> 03:34.147
They targeted strongholds in
central Homs province and
captured the town of Khalidiya,

03:34.147 --> 03:39.252
near Hama. The push was backed
by days of Russian airstrikes in
the region. Amateur

03:39.252 --> 03:42.422
video today showed plumes of
smoke rising above towns while
residents sifted through

03:42.422 --> 03:45.725
wreckage.

03:45.725 --> 03:49.663
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said today he's
perfectly open to meeting

03:49.663 --> 03:54.801
with Palestinian President
Mahmoud Abbas in an effort to
end weeks of bloodshed. That

03:54.801 --> 03:59.840
came a day after Abbas claimed
Israelis executed a 13-year-old
Palestinian boy involved in

03:59.840 --> 04:02.943
a stabbing attack
earlier this week.

04:02.943 --> 04:06.646
The Israeli prime minister
sharply refuted that allegation
today in Jerusalem, insisting

04:06.646 --> 04:10.584
the boy is recuperating
in an Israeli hospital.

04:10.584 --> 04:14.488
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, Israeli
Prime Minister: I think
President Abbas has to stop this
incitement.

04:14.488 --> 04:22.529
You just saw examples of him
lying, bare-faced lies. An
innocent child executed by
Israelis.

04:22.529 --> 04:27.968
No, he's not innocent and he
wasn't executed. He tried to
murder innocent people, almost

04:27.968 --> 04:32.572
succeeded. That's a lie.

04:32.572 --> 04:36.510
HARI SREENIVASAN: At the same
time, the Israeli military
announced today it will deploy
hundreds

04:36.510 --> 04:41.681
more troops throughout Jerusalem
in the coming days in an effort
to boost security there.

04:41.681 --> 04:46.086
Meanwhile, in the West Bank,
Palestinian protesters clashed
with Israeli troops in
Bethlehem.

04:46.086 --> 04:51.625
Demonstrators threw stones as
Israeli forces fired back with
tear gas.

04:51.625 --> 04:55.829
Back in this country, there's
word the FBI has begun an
inquiry into the business
practices

04:55.829 --> 05:02.536
of the multibillion-dollar daily
fantasy sports gambling
industry. Last week, an employee

05:02.536 --> 05:08.942
of the Web site DraftKings won
$350,000 on rival site FanDuel,
spawning allegations of

05:08.942 --> 05:14.714
insider trading. The New York
Times reported the FBI probe
will also assess whether the

05:14.714 --> 05:20.820
sites encourage bets from
players in states where the
contests are illegal.

05:20.820 --> 05:25.725
The preservation group World
Monuments Fund announced its
biennial watch list for
endangered

05:25.725 --> 05:32.933
World Heritage Sites today. The
50 places, spanning 36
countries, include a Spanish
mission

05:32.933 --> 05:38.071
in New Mexico badly in need of
restoration, an ancient
underwater city in Southern
Greece

05:38.071 --> 05:43.610
at risk of pollution from
passing ships, and the entire
country of Nepal, struggling to

05:43.610 --> 05:49.449
protect its heritage in the
aftermath of April's devastating
earthquake.

05:49.449 --> 05:54.554
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a new timeline for troop
drawdowns in Afghanistan; a
fresh

05:54.554 --> 05:59.259
lead emerges in the 27-year-old
Lockerbie bomber case; can a
prison break the cycle

05:59.259 --> 06:14.874
of incarceration, and much more.

06:14.874 --> 06:21.214
Now a change of course in
Afghanistan and call for the
United States to stay.

06:21.214 --> 06:26.987
It's already the longest-running
war in American history, and now
U.S. troops will be in
Afghanistan

06:26.987 --> 06:30.957
even longer. The word came today
from President Obama during a
speech in the White House
Roosevelt

06:30.957 --> 06:32.459
Room.

06:32.459 --> 06:34.728
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: I have repeatedly
argued against marching

06:34.728 --> 06:41.001
into open-ended military
conflicts that do not serve our
core security interests.

06:41.001 --> 06:46.840
Yet, given what's at stake in
Afghanistan, and the opportunity
for a stable and committed

06:46.840 --> 06:51.144
ally that can partner with us in
preventing the emergence of
future threats, I am firmly

06:51.144 --> 06:54.814
convinced that we should
make this extra effort.

06:54.814 --> 06:58.918
HARI SREENIVASAN: The new war
plan calls for keeping nearly
10,000 troops in Afghanistan

06:58.918 --> 07:03.123
through most of 2016, drawing
down to 5,500 in 2017.

07:03.123 --> 07:06.559
BARACK OBAMA: Now we're
finishing the job we started.

07:06.559 --> 07:10.730
HARI SREENIVASAN: Today's
announcement is an about-face
from the plan laid out last

07:10.730 --> 07:14.968
May, to leave Afghanistan
completely by the end of next
year. It would have left just

07:14.968 --> 07:19.239
a small embassy-based
military presence in Kabul.

07:19.239 --> 07:23.543
But in the last few months,
commanders have signaled that
the Afghans need more help to

07:23.543 --> 07:30.717
beat back the Taliban and hold
onto gains made over the last 14
years. Kunduz, in Northern

07:30.717 --> 07:36.222
Afghanistan, is a case in point.
Taliban fighters briefly took
control there last month. The

07:36.222 --> 07:41.328
New York Times compiled U.N.
data with on-the-ground
reporting that shows the
insurgency has spread

07:41.328 --> 07:46.433
through more of Afghanistan than
at any time since 2001, and more
than half the country's

07:46.433 --> 07:52.339
districts face a substantial,
high, or extreme risk of attack.

07:52.339 --> 07:55.809
There are also now concerns
about the presence of Islamic
State militants.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.044
Defense Secretary Ash Carter:

07:58.044 --> 08:00.714
ASHTON CARTER, U.S. Defense
Secretary: We're adjusting our
presence based on conditions

08:00.714 --> 08:06.319
on the ground to give the United
States and our allies the
capability to sustain a robust

08:06.319 --> 08:10.790
counterterrorism platform,
denying a safe haven for
terrorists and violent extremist

08:10.790 --> 08:13.126
organizations.

08:13.126 --> 08:17.330
HARI SREENIVASAN: U.S. forces
will be stationed in four
locations, Kabul, Bagram,
Jalalabad,

08:17.330 --> 08:19.432
and Kandahar.

08:19.432 --> 08:22.202
President Obama said it's
the right thing to do.

08:22.202 --> 08:27.707
BARACK OBAMA: This decision is
not disappointing. As I have
continually said, my approach is

08:27.707 --> 08:32.545
to assess the situation on the
ground, to figure out what is
working, and figure out

08:32.545 --> 08:36.282
what is not working, and make
adjustments where necessary.
This isn't the first time

08:36.282 --> 08:39.986
those adjustments have been
made. This won't probably be the
last.

08:39.986 --> 08:43.523
HARI SREENIVASAN: The move puts
the decision on how to go
forward in Afghanistan firmly

08:43.523 --> 08:48.695
in the hands of the president's
successor after 2017.

08:48.695 --> 08:51.064
We get more on today's
announcement from Washington
Post reporter Greg Jaffe.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.700
Greg, how did he get
to this decision?

08:53.700 --> 08:57.871
GREG JAFFE, The Washington Post:
You know, in the spring, they
started a review to decide

08:57.871 --> 09:00.740
what they were going to do. The
plan had been to go to
essentially a Kabul-based force,

09:00.740 --> 09:02.976
a small force.

09:02.976 --> 09:07.247
And I think most in the
administration, especially the
president's inner circle, seemed
to think

09:07.247 --> 09:12.085
that that's where they were
going to land. The discussions
carried on through the summer.

09:12.085 --> 09:16.489
In August, General Dempsey came
forward, then the chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff

09:16.489 --> 09:21.528
-- he just recently stepped down
-- with a plan for a sustaining
force of about 5,000

09:21.528 --> 09:23.730
focused on counterterrorism.

09:23.730 --> 09:27.333
And it was then, it seemed to
me, that the debate changed, and
the president seemed open

09:27.333 --> 09:29.302
to that.

09:29.302 --> 09:32.906
HARI SREENIVASAN: So what were
the tensions here? Is this
partly the political pressure

09:32.906 --> 09:37.477
of making a campaign promise to
get the country out of this war,
and then the military reality

09:37.477 --> 09:40.180
on the ground, where all his top
advisers are saying something
different?

09:40.180 --> 09:44.184
GREG JAFFE: You know, I don't
think politics played a big role
in it. I think the president

09:44.184 --> 09:49.722
has a real skepticism about
military forces' ability to
effect solutions in places like

09:49.722 --> 09:53.726
Afghanistan, so he's a really
hard sell on these sorts of
issues, just because he doesn't

09:53.726 --> 09:57.430
think military force fixes the
problems, that they're really
political problems. No military

09:57.430 --> 10:00.200
solutions has sort
of become a mantra.

10:00.200 --> 10:03.870
So, it took a lot of convincing
to bring him around, I think.

10:03.870 --> 10:08.041
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, if you
have insight to this, what was
the menu card of options

10:08.041 --> 10:11.911
that the generals presented him,
here's A, here's B, here's C?
What were his choices?

10:11.911 --> 10:15.915
GREG JAFFE: You know, I think
that the main choices, as I
understand them, were there

10:15.915 --> 10:21.087
was an option to essentially
stay at 9,800, where they are,
indefinitely.

10:21.087 --> 10:25.425
The real choice and the real
focus of the debate in terms of
a sustaining presence beyond

10:25.425 --> 10:33.166
2016 into 2017 was really this
5,500 option. That was the one
that sucked most of the oxygen

10:33.166 --> 10:36.135
in the room. That was the one
that they really focused on.

10:36.135 --> 10:39.105
HARI SREENIVASAN: And so what
were the costs and benefits of
doing either one plan or
increasing

10:39.105 --> 10:41.241
it to 10?

10:41.241 --> 10:45.445
GREG JAFFE: You know, well, 10
is where we are now. And so I
think 10 felt to a lot of

10:45.445 --> 10:47.547
people lets you do things
that you can't do with five.

10:47.547 --> 10:49.949
HARI SREENIVASAN: For example?

10:49.949 --> 10:52.719
GREG JAFFE: Yes, I think that,
in terms of counterterrorism, I
think you can pretty much

10:52.719 --> 10:55.889
do the similar things with both.

10:55.889 --> 11:00.860
What the extra 5,000 gets you
is, it gets you out in the field
with Afghans a little

11:00.860 --> 11:05.698
bit more. You know, we have been
using them. Up in Kunduz, for
example, special forces

11:05.698 --> 11:10.870
helped the Afghans retake that
city by calling in airstrikes
and providing advice.

11:10.870 --> 11:16.676
I think it also gives you a
sense of how Afghans are
performing in other places. I
think we

11:16.676 --> 11:22.115
were all shocked by how fast the
Iraqi forces crumbled and
collapsed. On paper, they looked

11:22.115 --> 11:26.386
pretty good. On paper, the
Afghan forces sometimes look
pretty good. But things like
will and

11:26.386 --> 11:29.622
resolve are really
hard to measure.

11:29.622 --> 11:33.393
And if you're present, you can
get a much better sense of those
things than you can

11:33.393 --> 11:36.696
if you're, you know, hundreds of
miles or thousand of miles away.

11:36.696 --> 11:40.233
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is part of
this that nobody has figured out
the equation on how to train

11:40.233 --> 11:43.903
up Afghan forces well enough?

11:43.903 --> 11:48.107
GREG JAFFE: Yes, I think not
just Afghan forces, but all of
these kind of indigenous forces

11:48.107 --> 11:53.046
in these broken societies, where
governments are corrupt or
deeply flawed.

11:53.046 --> 11:56.950
General Dempsey said in an exit
interview -- I thought it was
fascinating -- he essentially

11:56.950 --> 12:02.221
asked himself in this exit
interview with a publication
called "Joint Forces Quarterly,"

12:02.221 --> 12:05.091
you know, can we do this
mission? And he answered his own
question by saying, I don't
know,

12:05.091 --> 12:08.394
but I'm not sure
we have a choice.

12:08.394 --> 12:11.464
HARI SREENIVASAN: What's the
next step then? If we're keeping
these troop levels at the

12:11.464 --> 12:13.800
same thing, are there going to
be additional perhaps
deployments of special units in
certain

12:13.800 --> 12:15.735
cities?

12:15.735 --> 12:20.807
GREG JAFFE: I think if there are
problems like you saw in Kunduz,
where you have the

12:20.807 --> 12:26.079
Taliban taking the cities and
the Afghans have to retake it, I
think you could see special

12:26.079 --> 12:33.119
forces units embedded with
Afghan units to retake those
kinds of places.

12:33.119 --> 12:37.624
You know, I think it's
interesting way the president
talked about the 9800, or
essentially

12:37.624 --> 12:43.630
10,000. He said that will be the
force through late 2016. You
know, by late 2016, his
successor

12:43.630 --> 12:48.701
will be in place. I think he
could be signaling some
flexibility there, too, that
rather than

12:48.701 --> 12:53.473
go down to 5,500, if his
successor were to say, I really
would be much more comfortable

12:53.473 --> 12:56.876
at 10,000, I think it would be
hard for him not to stay there.

12:56.876 --> 13:02.315
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Greg Jaffe of The Washington
Post, thanks so much.

13:02.315 --> 13:10.289
GREG JAFFE: Yes. Thank you.

13:10.289 --> 13:16.496
HARI SREENIVASAN: Scottish
prosecutors announced today that
they have identified two Libyan

13:16.496 --> 13:22.502
suspects in the 1988 bombing of
a passenger jet over the town of
Lockerbie.

13:22.502 --> 13:27.240
Scotland and U.S. -- Scottish
and U.S. authorities are asking
the Libyan government to allow

13:27.240 --> 13:33.579
Scottish detectives and FBI
officers to interview the
suspects in Tripoli, Libya. The
Washington

13:33.579 --> 13:39.085
Post is reporting, according to
a U.S. official, that the two
individuals are Abdullah
al-Senussi,

13:39.085 --> 13:43.089
a former intelligence chief for
ousted Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi, and Abu Agila Mas'ud,

13:43.089 --> 13:44.857
an alleged bomb-maker.

13:44.857 --> 13:47.293
Jeffrey Brown has more.

13:47.293 --> 13:51.497
JEFFREY BROWN: The development
comes just two days after
"Frontline" aired the final

13:51.497 --> 13:55.635
installment of "My Brother's
Bomber," a three-part
documentary by Ken Dornstein
that went back

13:55.635 --> 13:59.572
and reexamined the files
from the Lockerbie case.

13:59.572 --> 14:03.576
Here's a short clip of part
three, where Dornstein is
following the trial in Libya of
former

14:03.576 --> 14:06.713
Gadhafi officials by
the new government.

14:06.713 --> 14:11.117
MAN: In Libya, a trial has begun
for the sons of Moammar Gadhafi
and more than two dozen

14:11.117 --> 14:13.453
of his ex-officials.

14:13.453 --> 14:16.489
KEN DORNSTEIN, Brother of
Lockerbie Bombing Victim: At the
same time in Tripoli, the new

14:16.489 --> 14:20.059
government was continuing its
trial of former Gadhafi
officials.

14:20.059 --> 14:24.731
MAN: The ruler's ex-spy chief,
Abdullah al-Senussi, was among
the defendants fenced off behind

14:24.731 --> 14:29.435
bars from corruption to war
crimes related to the 2011
uprising.

14:29.435 --> 14:33.706
KEN DORNSTEIN: The Libyans were
interested in crimes during the
revolution, but I was

14:33.706 --> 14:38.277
listening at home for details
about the men on my list.

14:38.277 --> 14:46.919
Then, in the middle of the
trial, a photo arrived by e-mail
from Musbah Eter. It was

14:46.919 --> 14:52.358
poor quality and came with no
explanation, but in the center
of the frame was a dark-skinned

14:52.358 --> 14:57.363
man. The blue jumpsuit and
prison bars made it pretty clear
that he was one of the men

14:57.363 --> 15:05.371
on trial in Tripoli, so I went
looking for every photo I could
find of these men on trial.

15:05.371 --> 15:10.743
And there in one of them, behind
Abdullah al-Senussi, the former
intelligence chief,

15:10.743 --> 15:18.684
was the dark-skinned man. The
more I looked, the more photos I
found of him.

15:18.684 --> 15:26.259
I captured these images and sent
them to Musbah Eter in Berlin.
He said this was indeed will

15:26.259 --> 15:34.801
Bob expert, Abu Agila, 100
percent. It was hard to believe
I was now looking at the man

15:34.801 --> 15:40.339
I had been trying to
find for so many years.

15:40.339 --> 15:44.443
But I still wanted more
confirmation. So, I connected
with a human rights worker who'd

15:44.443 --> 15:45.611
been monitoring the
trials in Libya.

15:45.611 --> 15:46.479
WOMAN: Hi, ken.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.748
KEN DORNSTEIN: Hey, how are you?

15:48.748 --> 15:51.651
WOMAN: We can attempt cameras,
but I'm not sure it's going to
last.

15:51.651 --> 15:56.756
KEN DORNSTEIN: I told her who I
was looking for. At first, she
couldn't find Abu Agila's

15:56.756 --> 15:58.624
name on the list, but then:

15:58.624 --> 16:03.396
WOMAN: Wait, wait, wait. Wait. I
have a name. It's just written
slightly differently.

16:03.396 --> 16:07.066
KEN DORNSTEIN: What does
it look like to you?

16:07.066 --> 16:12.471
WOMAN: I think it's defendant
number 28 in this case. So, his
first name is Abu Agila.

16:12.471 --> 16:19.979
That would be his first name.
And as to my understanding, the
biggest case against him

16:19.979 --> 16:26.586
seems to be bomb-making in
relation to the 2011 conflict,
charges of setting up bombs

16:26.586 --> 16:28.387
in vehicles.

16:28.387 --> 16:31.858
KEN DORNSTEIN: Wow.
That sounds like him.

16:31.858 --> 16:36.195
WOMAN: Yes. I would say that's
for sure the same person.

16:36.195 --> 16:40.600
KEN DORNSTEIN: The main trial of
these guys, there's 36, 37 of
them, and they're there

16:40.600 --> 16:42.835
for what is more or
less a show trial.

16:42.835 --> 16:43.736
MAN: Right.

16:43.736 --> 16:45.137
KEN DORNSTEIN: That's
Abdullah Senussi.

16:45.137 --> 16:46.973
MAN: OK.

16:46.973 --> 16:49.976
KEN DORNSTEIN: But if you look
behind Abdullah Senussi...

16:49.976 --> 16:53.012
MAN: There's a dark-skinned man.

16:53.012 --> 16:56.883
KEN DORNSTEIN: There's a
dark-skinned man. You pull all
the images, and you keep finding

16:56.883 --> 16:57.950
a dark-skinned man.

16:57.950 --> 17:00.286
MAN: Right.

17:00.286 --> 17:03.823
KEN DORNSTEIN: But I still would
like to know more. So, I said,
is there -- there's 36 men

17:03.823 --> 17:05.791
on trial. Is there a
charge sheet here?

17:05.791 --> 17:08.294
MAN: Yes, what are they
charged with? Yes.

17:08.294 --> 17:12.765
KEN DORNSTEIN: Number 28 on the
charge sheet. And I translate
it, and you can even grab

17:12.765 --> 17:18.404
it, and put it into Google
Translate, and it's Abu Agila
Mas'ud. And the charge is
bomb-making.

17:18.404 --> 17:22.208
MAN: My goodness.

17:22.208 --> 17:25.745
JEFFREY BROWN: Up until now,
only one person has ever been
convicted in connection with

17:25.745 --> 17:28.414
the Lockerbie bopping.

17:28.414 --> 17:31.884
To talk about today's
development is writer and
filmmaker Ken Dornstein. His
older brother

17:31.884 --> 17:34.820
was killed in the attack.

17:34.820 --> 17:40.760
So, Ken, two new suspects, but
not officially named. Do you
have any information that links

17:40.760 --> 17:44.697
them to the two people that you
identified that we just saw in
that clip?

17:44.697 --> 17:49.502
KEN DORNSTEIN: I don't have any
information from the Scottish
government or from the U.S.

17:49.502 --> 17:53.606
government, but everything I
know about the investigation and
everything I know about

17:53.606 --> 17:59.512
the 36 men being held by the
Libyans would suggest to me that
the two men who have been

17:59.512 --> 18:07.720
alluded to in today's news are
Abdullah Senussi, and the man
who I identified as the bomb
expert

18:07.720 --> 18:10.256
for the Lockerbie case,
Abu Agila Mas'ud.

18:10.256 --> 18:14.427
JEFFREY BROWN: Tell us a little
bit about them, first with the
latter, the bomb expert.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.728
What do you know about them?

18:15.728 --> 18:17.997
KEN DORNSTEIN: Yes.

18:17.997 --> 18:25.171
This is a figure who was a
mystery, was a ghost. The
original Lockerbie investigators

18:25.171 --> 18:30.076
had gathered information about
him. There was information about
him from a CIA informant

18:30.076 --> 18:35.548
who was speaking to the CIA in
the months before the bombing,
and in the cables that

18:35.548 --> 18:40.653
were produced from the -- from
the time with that informant.
This person was named. And

18:40.653 --> 18:43.489
this person was named in
connection with Abdel Basset
al-Megrahi, who I think you
mentioned

18:43.489 --> 18:46.359
is the one person who had been
convicted for the bombing.

18:46.359 --> 18:50.696
He was tied to Megrahi at
several key moments in the weeks
and months before the bombing,

18:50.696 --> 18:55.534
including records indicated that
he had been at the airport in
Malta where the bomb was

18:55.534 --> 19:00.072
said to have originated on the
morning of the bombing. The CIA
thought he was a technical

19:00.072 --> 19:02.808
expert, that that's what you
find in the CIA cables.

19:02.808 --> 19:07.346
Beyond that, they didn't know.
They had his landing card when
he landed in Malta, and

19:07.346 --> 19:12.451
it had his fingerprint on it and
there was a passport number, as
any of us who travel

19:12.451 --> 19:16.756
to a foreign country have to
fill out landing cards, where
you say the flight you came in

19:16.756 --> 19:19.558
on and your passport
information. And they had that
passport number.

19:19.558 --> 19:24.664
And, really, that is what clung
to for several years to really
match the fingerprint and

19:24.664 --> 19:29.735
that passport number to a
flesh-and-blood real person who
I felt that, if I could prove

19:29.735 --> 19:33.939
he existed and fully flesh out
who he was, I thought I would
solve any of the remaining

19:33.939 --> 19:36.909
questions there were about
who carried out the bombing.

19:36.909 --> 19:40.546
JEFFREY BROWN: And the other
figure, Abdullah Senussi, was a
more known character, right,

19:40.546 --> 19:44.784
as head of
intelligence in Libya?

19:44.784 --> 19:48.687
KEN DORNSTEIN: Yes. Abdullah
Senussi is a very well-known
figure. He is the brother-in-law

19:48.687 --> 19:52.925
of Moammar Gadhafi. He was
arguably the second most
powerful man in the country at
the time,

19:52.925 --> 19:57.430
at the end of the regime.

19:57.430 --> 20:01.767
He had been linked to many
crimes against Libyans
themselves, including a massacre
at

20:01.767 --> 20:07.239
a prison in the '90s that killed
1,500 people. He also was linked
to a number of foreign

20:07.239 --> 20:11.677
attacks, including the bombing
of a French passenger plane. He
was tried and convicted

20:11.677 --> 20:15.648
in absentia by the French for
bombing a French passenger plane
or for helping conceive of

20:15.648 --> 20:17.450
that.

20:17.450 --> 20:23.222
So, the list of charges against
Senussi is long. The list of
parties who are interested

20:23.222 --> 20:30.696
in having Senussi tell them the
full truth is also long. And he
was well-known. And the

20:30.696 --> 20:34.233
U.S. government may or may not
have already spoken to him. He's
been in detention in various

20:34.233 --> 20:39.505
forms for a number of years, but
it's Abu Agila Mas'ud who really
was the target of

20:39.505 --> 20:42.875
what I did and what
"Frontline" just put out.

20:42.875 --> 20:46.378
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, you went
back to look at this, of course,
in part because of the

20:46.378 --> 20:51.283
personal connection, I assume,
but also through a sense that
this was incomplete. Right? What

20:51.283 --> 20:55.454
happened to the investigation?
Do we know whether either of
these characters were ever

20:55.454 --> 20:58.791
spoken to, were
ever investigated?

20:58.791 --> 21:03.529
KEN DORNSTEIN: They both came up
in the original investigation.
That's not new to me.

21:03.529 --> 21:08.667
I started, from a sense, from
the original investigators, most
of whom are now retired,

21:08.667 --> 21:13.439
a sense from them of how
unresolved the whole case was,
that they had a number of people

21:13.439 --> 21:18.711
in their sights. They were only
able to indict two, and after
that indictment, which was

21:18.711 --> 21:23.816
way back in 1991, the FBI would
continue to say that it's an
ongoing investigation, but

21:23.816 --> 21:26.485
there had been no other public
announcements. There had been no
other indictments in the

21:26.485 --> 21:28.554
25 years.

21:28.554 --> 21:33.592
I think that was a source of
frustration to some of the
original investigators. And the

21:33.592 --> 21:38.964
particular character who I
focused on, this Abu Agila
Mas'ud, as the bomb expert, I
think

21:38.964 --> 21:44.603
he was a ghost. I mean, I -- on
the Moby-Dick analogy, he was
the white whale that everyone

21:44.603 --> 21:45.404
was pursuing.

21:45.404 --> 21:47.306
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.376
KEN DORNSTEIN: And they never
got a chance to really identify
him.

21:50.376 --> 21:51.677
And I ultimately did.

21:51.677 --> 21:53.679
JEFFREY BROWN: OK.

21:53.679 --> 21:56.348
Ken Dornstein,
thank you so much.

21:56.348 --> 22:06.692
KEN DORNSTEIN: Sure. Thank you.

22:06.692 --> 22:13.899
HARI SREENIVASAN: There's
perhaps no greater bipartisan
push today than the effort to
reform

22:13.899 --> 22:18.737
the American criminal justice
system. One of those reforms is
trying to cut back on

22:18.737 --> 22:22.308
recidivism, where criminals
serve their time, but then wind
up back behind bars soon after

22:22.308 --> 22:24.810
their release.

22:24.810 --> 22:28.847
For the past few months, the
"NewsHour" was granted rare
access to a maximum security

22:28.847 --> 22:33.118
prison in Maryland where a
unique pilot program is trying
to stop the revolving door from

22:33.118 --> 22:34.286
spinning.

22:34.286 --> 22:35.921
William Brangham has the story.

22:35.921 --> 22:41.627
CARLOS COLON, Inmate: Mostly,
I'm a thief. I'm a car thief. I
mean, I'm not 100 percent

22:41.627 --> 22:46.332
proud, but at the same time, I
had a good run, I mean, pretty
decent.

22:46.332 --> 22:51.070
ASHLEY WILSON, Inmate: I was
arrested for prostitution,
possession of paraphernalia,

22:51.070 --> 22:55.207
possession of heroin, possession
of marijuana, issuing false
documents, felony theft,
misdemeanor

22:55.207 --> 22:58.043
theft and forgery.

22:58.043 --> 23:01.013
JORDAN TAYLOR, Inmate:
Conspiracy to commit robbery,
wrong place, wrong time, so I
got

23:01.013 --> 23:03.115
conspiracy for it.

23:03.115 --> 23:07.186
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: These three
prisoners are among the more
than 2.2 million people behind

23:07.186 --> 23:12.091
bars in the U.S. That's more
people locked up than in any
other country.

23:12.091 --> 23:16.795
And like most prisoners, they
will be released back into
society, so making sure they're

23:16.795 --> 23:21.734
ready and that they won't commit
more crimes has become a hugely
important public policy

23:21.734 --> 23:27.306
issue. Over the last few months,
we followed these three
prisoners, Jordan Taylor, Carlos

23:27.306 --> 23:31.710
Colon, and Ashley Wilson, to see
whether one pilot program can
defy the odds, and stop

23:31.710 --> 23:34.580
them from ending up
right back in jail.

23:34.580 --> 23:37.116
ROBERT GREEN, Montgomery County
Correctional Facility: In this
facility today, we have

23:37.116 --> 23:43.789
500 or so individuals. It could
be a lower-level misdemeanor
crime, driving while
intoxicated,

23:43.789 --> 23:45.257
something of that level, to
individuals who have allegedly
killed multiple or allegedly

23:45.257 --> 23:47.826
killed multiple people.

23:47.826 --> 23:51.730
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Robert Green
is the director of the
Montgomery County maximum
security

23:51.730 --> 23:56.035
facility in rural Maryland. He's
been in corrections over half
his life, and he's the driving
force

23:56.035 --> 24:00.673
behind the program to try and
stop prisoners from going right
back to a life of crime.

24:00.673 --> 24:05.644
ROBERT GREEN: This idea that
solely, solely taking someone's
freedom away changes behavior,

24:05.644 --> 24:09.448
in many cases, it changes it for
the worse. And that's not what
America's correctional

24:09.448 --> 24:12.217
facilities were founded on.

24:12.217 --> 24:14.320
Why would you not want to put
people back on the streets in
your community better than

24:14.320 --> 24:16.522
they came in the door?

24:16.522 --> 24:20.059
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: He oversees a
program in the jail called the
American Jobs Center.

24:20.059 --> 24:24.029
It's received some pilot federal
funding. It's based on research
that shows that one

24:24.029 --> 24:29.535
of the best ways to reduce
recidivism is to help prisoners
find legitimate work immediately

24:29.535 --> 24:35.574
upon their release. So, they're
taught how to write an effective
resume and how to handle

24:35.574 --> 24:37.776
a job interview.

24:37.776 --> 24:41.814
WOMAN: So tell me what job
you're looking to interview for
today.

24:41.814 --> 24:42.781
MAN: Well, buddy,
you got the job.

24:42.781 --> 24:45.017
JORDAN TAYLOR: All
right, thanks.

24:45.017 --> 24:47.286
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In this
program, inmates are called
customers, and the program
leaders

24:47.286 --> 24:49.421
are called coaches.

24:49.421 --> 24:52.858
CARLOS COLON: These people, they
actually care, but -- and they
show it. And that's

24:52.858 --> 24:55.994
the reason I'm even trying
to work it 100 percent.

24:55.994 --> 25:00.766
DONNA ROJAS, American Jobs
Center: We're helping them to go
from job-ready to life-ready,
because

25:00.766 --> 25:06.805
getting the job is not the most
difficult part. The hard part is
the life-ready piece.

25:06.805 --> 25:11.744
How do I live my life when I go
back into the same community
where I may have been selling

25:11.744 --> 25:17.850
drugs and making $1,000 a week,
and now you're sending me out
there to make $8.25 an hour?

25:17.850 --> 25:21.387
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The grim
details of Ashley Wilson's life
give you a sense of the huge

25:21.387 --> 25:25.023
challenges she's going to
face when she gets out.

25:25.023 --> 25:30.662
ASHLEY WILSON: I was like a
really good student and all
that. So, perfect poster child,
right?

25:30.662 --> 25:37.202
But I had some traumas in my
childhood and some problems
within me.

25:37.202 --> 25:41.740
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Like three out
of four incarcerated adults,
Ashley has a history of
substance

25:41.740 --> 25:46.078
abuse. She was 10 when she
started stealing her parents'
vodka. She left home at 15. A

25:46.078 --> 25:48.814
year later, she was
shooting heroin.

25:48.814 --> 25:53.685
ASHLEY WILSON: First time, I had
someone inject it to me. And
from there, it was just off

25:53.685 --> 25:55.988
to the races.

25:55.988 --> 26:00.659
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: She began
having sex for money to pay for
her habit, and then she
overdosed,

26:00.659 --> 26:04.696
twice, in between stints in
rehab. Pregnant at 18, she tried
to stay clean for the baby,

26:04.696 --> 26:06.932
but she relapsed again.

26:06.932 --> 26:14.039
ASHLEY WILSON: I had a young
infant, no job, behind on rent,
very little support.

26:14.039 --> 26:18.610
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Police caught
her in a sting at 19 and a judge
sentenced her to 18 months

26:18.610 --> 26:24.416
in jail. Ashley's incarceration
was part of the nation's war on
drugs, an unprecedented

26:24.416 --> 26:29.188
10-fold increase in arrests and
prosecutions for nonviolent drug
crimes.

26:29.188 --> 26:32.524
But now, because of good
behavior, Ashley will soon be
transferred to a halfway house,

26:32.524 --> 26:34.993
where she will serve the
remainder of her sentence.

26:34.993 --> 26:37.729
What plans do you have?

26:37.729 --> 26:43.302
ASHLEY WILSON: I need to get a
job. I need to maintain that
job. I need to maintain my

26:43.302 --> 26:52.911
sobriety. I need to get a good,
sober support system to help me.
But along with that comes

26:52.911 --> 26:58.951
the fear, the fear of the
unknown, the fear of inadequacy,
that I can't do it.

26:58.951 --> 27:02.988
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Staffing a
jobs center, educating
prisoners, treating their
addictions,

27:02.988 --> 27:07.526
it's labor-intensive work. And
while there's a growing
bipartisan support for these
types

27:07.526 --> 27:11.864
of programs, getting prisoners
ready for life after prison is
not cheap.

27:11.864 --> 27:16.368
I have got to imagine that there
are plenty of people outside
these walls who look at

27:16.368 --> 27:20.105
the services you offer here and
think, I would love that in my
community college, I would

27:20.105 --> 27:22.641
love that in my public school,
and yet you're here giving it to
people who have done real

27:22.641 --> 27:23.775
harm in the community.

27:23.775 --> 27:26.712
What do you say to that?

27:26.712 --> 27:31.149
ROBERT GREEN: If we lessen the
burden of the criminal justice
system, doesn't that give

27:31.149 --> 27:35.487
us more money to put into our
schools? Doesn't that give us
more money to put into education

27:35.487 --> 27:37.789
and our community?

27:37.789 --> 27:42.160
JORDAN TAYLOR: I consider myself
a normal person, just played
sports when I was growing

27:42.160 --> 27:44.563
up. Went to school, just like
everybody else did. I got into
some trouble, just like everyone

27:44.563 --> 27:46.532
else did.

27:46.532 --> 27:50.035
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Jordan Taylor
is near the end of his one-year
sentence. He violated

27:50.035 --> 27:55.007
probation after serving time for
conspiracy to commit armed
robbery. Two-thirds of young

27:55.007 --> 27:59.845
black men who don't finish high
school will serve time in jail.
And Jordan became another

27:59.845 --> 28:04.216
one of those statistics. He was
arrested just three weeks before
his high school graduation.

28:04.216 --> 28:07.886
JORDAN TAYLOR: You realize who
you are when you're in the cell,
because you have no -- nothing

28:07.886 --> 28:11.189
but time, time to think about
what you're going to do when you
get out, time to think

28:11.189 --> 28:14.059
about anything. There's
nothing but time.

28:14.059 --> 28:17.930
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Jordan's been
part of the jobs program for two
months. His release date

28:17.930 --> 28:23.635
is just days away. He says he
wants to get his GED, a job on
day one, and, long term,

28:23.635 --> 28:27.205
study to become an electrician
like his grandfather.

28:27.205 --> 28:29.775
Unlike a lot of prisoners,
Jordan has two loving parents
and a home to live in when

28:29.775 --> 28:32.311
he gets out.

28:32.311 --> 28:36.815
CARLOS COLON: Some people don't
have nowhere to go who leave
here, especially my case,

28:36.815 --> 28:42.354
if you look at it, right? So I
have to depend on me to take
care of what I got to do.

28:42.354 --> 28:45.490
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Carlos Colon
has been in and out of
correctional systems since he
was

28:45.490 --> 28:49.294
9 years old. He's now serving a
three-year sentence for
second-degree assault and
burglary.

28:49.294 --> 28:52.731
He was a car thief. He
says he was a good one.

28:52.731 --> 28:56.802
But those are skills that, along
with his long rap sheet, don't
make him very appealing

28:56.802 --> 29:01.139
to possible employers. Carlos
works in the jail's kitchen and
housing units, doling out

29:01.139 --> 29:05.310
meals to inmates. It's unpaid
work, but he can put it on his
resume.

29:05.310 --> 29:09.548
One of the key things this jobs
program does is get inmates
interviews with companies even

29:09.548 --> 29:10.716
before they're released.

29:10.716 --> 29:12.918
MAN: Hey. How you doing, sir?

29:12.918 --> 29:16.355
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The company
interviewing Carlos today is a
national firm most of us

29:16.355 --> 29:19.324
have heard of, but they would
only let us film if we didn't
name them. They don't want

29:19.324 --> 29:21.026
their brand publicly
associated with convicts.

29:21.026 --> 29:23.195
MAN: Do you want to do it?

29:23.195 --> 29:26.565
CARLOS COLON: I definitely want
to do it. I would love to do it.
Like, I do need it.

29:26.565 --> 29:28.934
I normally don't get these
types of opportunities.

29:28.934 --> 29:32.804
ROBERT GREEN: We realize, and
the data tells us and the
research tells us, for every day

29:32.804 --> 29:38.910
of employment we lose with that
individual, that the opportunity
for recidivism and returning

29:38.910 --> 29:43.015
to bad choices and bad
behaviors is increased.

29:43.015 --> 29:47.152
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For Carlos,
Ashley and Jordan, the odds
aren't in their favor. More than

29:47.152 --> 29:51.823
two-thirds of prisoners are back
behind bars within three years
of their release. Carlos

29:51.823 --> 29:55.360
isn't sure where he will go when
he gets out. Several halfway
houses rejected him because

29:55.360 --> 29:59.197
of a prior prison escape.
Plus, he's also broke.

29:59.197 --> 30:04.069
Do you worry that if you get out
and you can't find a job, you
know you have these criminal

30:04.069 --> 30:06.338
skills -- you're a
good car thief?

30:06.338 --> 30:07.406
CARLOS COLON: Yes, I already
thought about that. Yes, I
already thought about that.

30:07.406 --> 30:09.841
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: How are
you going to resist that?

30:09.841 --> 30:15.347
CARLOS COLON: I'm going to
resist it for as long as I can,
but it's not guaranteed, because

30:15.347 --> 30:20.218
the time comes and I'm
struggling, I'm not going to be,
like -- you know, I'm not going

30:20.218 --> 30:23.588
to be struggling for long. So,
if I have to steal a car, then
that's what it's going to

30:23.588 --> 30:25.557
have to be.

30:25.557 --> 30:27.559
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Tomorrow, we
will show you what happened to
these prisoners when they

30:27.559 --> 30:29.728
got out.

30:29.728 --> 30:33.365
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham in Montgomery
County, Maryland.

30:33.365 --> 30:38.303
JORDAN TAYLOR: You all right,
mom? You knew I was going to
home. You knew I was going

30:38.303 --> 30:40.305
to home.

30:40.305 --> 30:43.542
HARI SREENIVASAN: For an early
look at what happened next, go
to our Web site. Our multimedia

30:43.542 --> 30:48.113
project has additional video and
an in-depth look at Ashley,
Carlos and Jordan's stories.

30:48.113 --> 30:50.916
Find that on our home
page, PBS.org/NewsHour.

30:50.916 --> 30:53.251
Stay with us.

30:53.251 --> 30:57.155
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
new book details how
entrepreneurs seek to change the
world

30:57.155 --> 31:02.127
for good; what our ancestors can
tell us about how much sleep we
really need; and John Merrow

31:02.127 --> 31:05.597
reflects on the
future of education.

31:05.597 --> 31:10.902
But, first, just how much sleep
do you really need? There's been
plenty of concern, as people

31:10.902 --> 31:15.107
spend more time looking at their
screens ever later into the
night.

31:15.107 --> 31:19.277
Previous research has shown that
a lack of sleep is associated
with a series of problems,

31:19.277 --> 31:24.583
ranging from lack of
concentration to health effects
like obesity and heart disease.

31:24.583 --> 31:28.987
But a new study out today finds
seven or eight hours a night may
not be as essential as we

31:28.987 --> 31:30.188
think.

31:30.188 --> 31:34.059
I went to California
to learn more.

31:34.059 --> 31:41.266
They are among the last
hunter-gatherers in the world,
the Hadza of Northern Tanzania,

31:41.266 --> 31:47.205
the San of Namibia's Kalahari
Desert, and in the Andean
foothills of Bolivia the
Chimane.

31:47.205 --> 31:51.977
By studying the sleep habits of
these three groups, who still
live the way humans have

31:51.977 --> 31:56.848
for thousands of years, a team
of scientists led by UCLA's
Jerry Siegel is challenging

31:56.848 --> 32:00.585
conventional wisdom about
how much sleep we need.

32:00.585 --> 32:02.587
JERRY SIEGEL, Director, UCLA
Center for Sleep Research: It's
absolutely incorrect to think

32:02.587 --> 32:06.258
that the more you sleep, the
healthier you're going to be.

32:06.258 --> 32:09.728
HARI SREENIVASAN: The study,
reported today in the journal
"Current Biology" says we in

32:09.728 --> 32:13.698
the industrialized world sleep
as much as our ancestors did.

32:13.698 --> 32:17.536
JERRY SIEGEL: There's been
speculation that humans
basically used to sleep when it
got

32:17.536 --> 32:24.176
dark, which would mean they'd
sleep 10, 11, even 12 hours. But
it turns out that's not

32:24.176 --> 32:29.915
the case. These groups sleep
five, six, seven hours. None of
them average over eight hours

32:29.915 --> 32:32.217
of sleep.

32:32.217 --> 32:36.655
HARI SREENIVASAN: Just like us,
when the sun sets, these people
do not go right to sleep.

32:36.655 --> 32:39.791
JERRY SIEGEL: There's a thin
yellow line here that indicates
the light level, and you can

32:39.791 --> 32:43.495
see also that they remain awake.

32:43.495 --> 32:48.466
HARI SREENIVASAN: In fact,
regardless of what time they go
to bed, all three groups, on

32:48.466 --> 32:53.104
different parts of the planet,
wake up exactly when one very
specific thing happens. And,

32:53.104 --> 32:55.574
no, it's not the sunrise.

32:55.574 --> 33:02.280
JERRY SIEGEL: They're sleeping
as the temperature falls, and
they seem to quite consistently

33:02.280 --> 33:07.185
wake up at the lowest point of
temperature in the day. So, when
the temperature stops

33:07.185 --> 33:10.655
falling, that's
when they wake up.

33:10.655 --> 33:14.326
There's been a lot of emphasis
on light and the effects of
light, and there's no question

33:14.326 --> 33:21.333
that light affects sleep. But
light may have been connected to
sleep largely because of

33:21.333 --> 33:24.069
its connection to temperature.

33:24.069 --> 33:26.037
HARI SREENIVASAN: Temperature
swings are a thing of the past.
Now we just have to turn

33:26.037 --> 33:28.640
a dial.

33:28.640 --> 33:33.678
The connections between sleep
and many things have been
thoroughly studied. Thanks to a

33:33.678 --> 33:37.415
smartwatch, I have been a
student for the past
year-and-a-half, trying to
figure out

33:37.415 --> 33:42.087
ways to get a better night's
rest. Between late-night
check-ins at hotel rooms and
early-morning

33:42.087 --> 33:46.024
flights, I have become
a lousy sleeper.

33:46.024 --> 33:51.229
My smartwatch tracks when I'm in
deep sleep, light sleep, REM
sleep, when I move around,

33:51.229 --> 33:55.500
and how many interruptions I
have, and it even gives me a
score for the night. But there

33:55.500 --> 34:00.038
are much more accurate ways
to measure sleep in a lab.

34:00.038 --> 34:05.010
So, for the good of the story, I
put on a hospital gown and
pajamas and got wired up

34:05.010 --> 34:05.277
at the UCLA Sleep
Disorder Center.

34:05.277 --> 34:05.744
That's a lot of wires.

34:05.744 --> 34:06.611
(LAUGHTER)

34:06.611 --> 34:11.383
JOEL RECTOR, UCLA Sleep Disorder
Center: Yes, I believe 32.

34:11.383 --> 34:18.056
HARI SREENIVASAN: Lab manager
Joel Rector placed sensors on
specific parts of my head

34:18.056 --> 34:23.461
to measure electrical activity
in my brain, stuck some near my
eyes and on my legs to

34:23.461 --> 34:27.132
measure even the slightest
twitches, and strapped sensors
around my chest and stomach to
gauge

34:27.132 --> 34:28.566
my breaths.

34:28.566 --> 34:31.269
JOEL RECTOR: I'm going to put
this over your shoulder.

34:31.269 --> 34:34.306
HARI SREENIVASAN: Doesn't feel
like the most natural way to go
to sleep.

34:34.306 --> 34:39.010
And I did something I have never
done at work. I tried to fall
asleep on the job.

34:39.010 --> 34:44.182
So, just to run through this,
all these are measuring my brain
waves. This is measuring

34:44.182 --> 34:48.320
my breath and oxygen. This is
measuring how much I'm moving
here and here and on my legs.

34:48.320 --> 34:49.254
And this is measuring my oxygen.

34:49.254 --> 34:50.388
JOEL RECTOR: Yes.

34:50.388 --> 34:52.190
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK.

34:52.190 --> 34:56.194
JOEL RECTOR: All righty. Well,
I will get the lights off.

34:56.194 --> 34:59.664
HARI SREENIVASAN: Good night.

34:59.664 --> 35:02.734
While I napped, Rector
monitored my patterns.

35:02.734 --> 35:06.671
JOEL RECTOR: He's in stage two
sleep, which is what most people
are in for the majority

35:06.671 --> 35:10.608
of the night. He's kind
of just sleeping quietly.

35:10.608 --> 35:13.945
HARI SREENIVASAN: When I woke
up, I had a chat with
neuroscientist Alon Avidan, who

35:13.945 --> 35:17.549
runs the sleep disorders
lab, to tell me what he saw.

35:17.549 --> 35:22.787
DR. ALON AVIDAN, UCLA Sleep
Disorder Center: Typically, when
we ask someone to fall asleep,

35:22.787 --> 35:28.860
we don't see them fall asleep in
less than eight minutes. You
fell asleep in less a minute,

35:28.860 --> 35:29.794
which means that...

35:29.794 --> 35:30.862
(LAUGHTER)

35:30.862 --> 35:33.865
DR. ALON AVIDAN: ... you are
probably sleep-deprived.

35:33.865 --> 35:37.869
HARI SREENIVASAN: What can
happen if you're chronically
sleep-deprived?

35:37.869 --> 35:44.509
DR. ALON AVIDAN: The data shows
that in people who are
chronically sleep-deprived, the
immune

35:44.509 --> 35:53.651
system doesn't work as well.
You're more prone to develop
obesity, diabetes. Cognitive
function

35:53.651 --> 35:55.920
tends to become depressed.

35:55.920 --> 36:00.325
HARI SREENIVASAN: But what
constitutes sleep deprivation?

36:00.325 --> 36:05.363
Max Hirshkowitz is chair of the
National Sleep Foundation, and a
guest lecturer at Stanford

36:05.363 --> 36:08.967
Medical School. He recently
convened a panel of experts to
recommend how much sleep we

36:08.967 --> 36:11.202
should get.

36:11.202 --> 36:15.173
MAX HIRSHKOWITZ, National Sleep
Foundation: About seven to nine
hours. It's a range. Now,

36:15.173 --> 36:19.878
six may be appropriate under
unusual circumstances, but,
otherwise, seven to nine,
somewhere in

36:19.878 --> 36:21.880
there.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.949
HARI SREENIVASAN: There is no
shortage of pills that try to
deliver those seven to nine

36:24.949 --> 36:25.784
hours.

36:25.784 --> 36:28.286
NARRATOR: Sleep
better, sleep longer.

36:28.286 --> 36:31.723
NARRATOR: There's a land of
restful sleep. We can help you
go there.

36:31.723 --> 36:34.225
HARI SREENIVASAN: And
that concerns Siegel.

36:34.225 --> 36:39.764
JERRY SIEGEL: The thing that
alarms me is this thought that
-- and this was the motivation

36:39.764 --> 36:44.702
for undertaking the study, to
find out if this true -- that we
used to sleep much more,

36:44.702 --> 36:52.377
and that we need to increase our
sleep from whatever number we
get to be closer to 10,

36:52.377 --> 36:57.982
11 hours of sleep. The data that
we have gathered indicates
that's not the case.

36:57.982 --> 37:01.519
HARI SREENIVASAN: In fact, these
people Siegel studied average
less than six-and-a-half-hours,

37:01.519 --> 37:03.822
and they seem fine.

37:03.822 --> 37:07.525
JERRY SIEGEL: In general, the
adults are more healthy than
those in our society. They may

37:07.525 --> 37:15.233
for some reason need less sleep,
but there certainly doesn't seem
to be any negative

37:15.233 --> 37:19.971
consequence resulting
from their sleep pattern.

37:19.971 --> 37:23.074
HARI SREENIVASAN: They also
don't appear tired during the
day. They hardly nap and they
sleep

37:23.074 --> 37:25.610
soundly when they do.

37:25.610 --> 37:30.748
JERRY SIEGEL: One thing we found
is that these groups have very
little insomnia, maybe at

37:30.748 --> 37:37.489
a 10th the incidence we have,
and so there's something
different there that's going on.

37:37.489 --> 37:40.558
HARI SREENIVASAN: That something
will take more research to
figure out.

37:40.558 --> 37:56.708
So, back to the lab, or,
in this case, back to bed.

37:56.708 --> 38:00.879
Now a look at how individuals
are tackling social issues
around the globe through
innovative

38:00.879 --> 38:04.949
programs, the concept known
as social entrepreneurship.

38:04.949 --> 38:08.786
It's the focus of a new book
called "Getting Beyond Better:
How Social Entrepreneurship

38:08.786 --> 38:13.091
Works." The co-author is Sally
Osberg, president and CEO of the
Skoll Foundation.

38:13.091 --> 38:16.161
For the record, the Skoll
Foundation is an underwriter of
the "NewsHour."

38:16.161 --> 38:19.764
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman, sat down with her
in New York, part of our

38:19.764 --> 38:23.568
weekly series Making Sense,
which airs every Thursday on the
"NewsHour."

38:23.568 --> 38:26.037
PAUL SOLMAN: Sally
Osberg, welcome.

38:26.037 --> 38:26.404
SALLY OSBERG, Co-Author,
"Getting Beyond Better: How
Social Entrepreneurship Works":
Thank

38:26.404 --> 38:28.573
you, Paul. It's
wonderful to be here.

38:28.573 --> 38:34.345
PAUL SOLMAN: You write about the
key to social entrepreneurship
being an equilibrium shift.

38:34.345 --> 38:36.014
What do you mean?

38:36.014 --> 38:40.418
SALLY OSBERG: It's a status quo
in which -- which affects
everybody.

38:40.418 --> 38:45.823
But it takes the entrepreneur to
see how to shift that status
quo. Think of Larry Page

38:45.823 --> 38:50.795
and Sergey Brin. There's this
Internet full of information,
and yet there's no ability

38:50.795 --> 38:56.568
for the ordinary person to
search out and retrieve what she
or he wants to know.

38:56.568 --> 39:01.472
They develop a search engine,
Google. The rest is history,
right? The difference is

39:01.472 --> 39:08.646
that the social entrepreneur
also understands that this
equilibrium, this status quo, is

39:08.646 --> 39:14.485
affecting some marginalized
population in some very
significant way, and that
population

39:14.485 --> 39:21.192
very rarely has the power or the
means to effect the transition
on its own. Enter the

39:21.192 --> 39:23.795
social entrepreneur.

39:23.795 --> 39:29.300
PAUL SOLMAN: Like Molly
Melching, whose organization
Tostan, has been working in West
African villages

39:29.300 --> 39:36.040
for 30 years now on human rights
issues, most notably,
eliminating the painful and
dangerous

39:36.040 --> 39:39.177
2,000-year-old practice of
female genital mutilation.

39:39.177 --> 39:42.547
SALLY OSBERG: Something that
seems pretty horrific to many of
us in the West.

39:42.547 --> 39:43.481
PAUL SOLMAN: Disgusting,
even, right?

39:43.481 --> 39:44.983
SALLY OSBERG: Yes. Yes. Yes.

39:44.983 --> 39:46.384
PAUL SOLMAN: How dare
you? You're doing what?

39:46.384 --> 39:48.720
SALLY OSBERG: Yes.

39:48.720 --> 39:52.523
But we don't get there by
wagging our fingers at these
populations and saying, how
could

39:52.523 --> 39:57.128
you? It's up to those people
themselves to decide whether
they're going to cut their

39:57.128 --> 39:59.631
daughters or not.

39:59.631 --> 40:05.670
PAUL SOLMAN: And what's the key
to changing people's attitudes
or empowering women?

40:05.670 --> 40:10.942
SALLY OSBERG: It wasn't until
Molly Melching realized that
Senegal had actually signed

40:10.942 --> 40:16.347
onto the conventions to
eliminate all forms of violence
against women that she realized

40:16.347 --> 40:20.518
that these people had rights
they weren't even aware of.

40:20.518 --> 40:27.692
Once they understand they have
these rights, they can begin to
poke their heads up from

40:27.692 --> 40:33.031
this equilibrium, from this
status quo, and determine what's
in their best interest.

40:33.031 --> 40:38.536
PAUL SOLMAN: Another custom
moving quickly from locally
accepted to globally rejected,

40:38.536 --> 40:43.741
child labor, an illegal, but
persistent practice in India's
rug industry.

40:43.741 --> 40:47.645
CHILD (through translator): We
work from 8:00 a.m. until
midnight.

40:47.645 --> 40:54.118
PAUL SOLMAN:

40:54.118 --> 41:00.658
Peace Prize, had been rescuing
children from virtual slavery
for decades, but, says Osberg:

41:00.658 --> 41:05.930
SALLY OSBERG: Kailash understood
that rescuing children wasn't
going to do the job, 20 kids

41:05.930 --> 41:11.102
at a time, when there were 200
who were being trafficked and
brought into these camps, their

41:11.102 --> 41:16.741
tiny little fingers, you know,
tying the knots in these rugs?
He came up with the idea for

41:16.741 --> 41:22.547
a label that would send a clear
signal to consumers that this
rug was made without child

41:22.547 --> 41:25.116
labor.

41:25.116 --> 41:30.021
Target, for example, has just
committed to sourcing all its
handwoven rugs with the
GoodWeave

41:30.021 --> 41:33.191
label. That's an equilibrium
change in motion.

41:33.191 --> 41:35.993
MAN (through
translator): I am free.

41:35.993 --> 41:42.367
SALLY OSBERG: In fact, child
labor in the handwoven carpet
industry in India has come

41:42.367 --> 41:45.903
down from a million children
to something around 200,000.

41:45.903 --> 41:50.575
PAUL SOLMAN: And there are
plenty of higher-tech examples,
like Kiva.

41:50.575 --> 41:56.381
SALLY OSBERG: The founders of
Kiva were among the first social
entrepreneurs to try to create

41:56.381 --> 42:03.621
a technology platform for
micro-lending, creating that
opportunity for ordinary people
to invest

42:03.621 --> 42:11.162
$25, $100, $500 in the
micro-entrepreneurs who were
bootstrapping themselves out of
poverty

42:11.162 --> 42:14.766
in the developing world.

42:14.766 --> 42:17.835
And that actually is what
enabled Kiva to scale.

42:17.835 --> 42:20.505
PAUL SOLMAN: Scale, you
mean to go from small to...

42:20.505 --> 42:21.639
SALLY OSBERG: Right.

42:21.639 --> 42:24.142
PAUL SOLMAN: ... big
with a huge impact.

42:24.142 --> 42:30.481
SALLY OSBERG: From 20,000 people
on the platform, to today
millions of people on the
platform,

42:30.481 --> 42:36.154
millions of lenders, millions of
borrowers, and, of course,
dozens and dozens of
micro-finance

42:36.154 --> 42:39.824
institutions sitting
in the middle.

42:39.824 --> 42:45.630
PAUL SOLMAN: And speaking of
scale, consider APOPO, the
lifesaving non-governmental
organization

42:45.630 --> 42:52.737
that grew out of Bart Weetjens'
childhood fascination with
rodents and his grown-up

42:52.737 --> 43:00.311
realization that the African
giant pouched rat could be
trained to detect land mines.

43:00.311 --> 43:01.612
These are suicide rats?

43:01.612 --> 43:03.581
(LAUGHTER)

43:03.581 --> 43:07.952
SALLY OSBERG: Actually, they're
not, because the rats are much
lighter than, for example,

43:07.952 --> 43:14.625
dogs, who also do this work, but
are -- who are heavy enough to
set off the explosives,

43:14.625 --> 43:19.897
or humans, who are exposing
themselves to risk with, you
know, handheld mine detectors.

43:19.897 --> 43:25.837
PAUL SOLMAN: So, there are
economies of scale to raising
trained rats?

43:25.837 --> 43:32.210
SALLY OSBERG: There are indeed,
because rats multiply quickly,
which is why this solution

43:32.210 --> 43:36.347
is scaling, and why it's gotten
to the point that a country like
Mozambique has declared

43:36.347 --> 43:39.884
itself just this past
September mine-free.

43:39.884 --> 43:46.724
PAUL SOLMAN: As I understand it,
the movement within development
these days is to be able

43:46.724 --> 43:50.895
to measure whether or not a
project is successful. How do
you measure your projects?

43:50.895 --> 43:55.399
SALLY OSBERG: Actually, we rely
upon the social entrepreneurs to
measure the difference that

43:55.399 --> 43:58.536
they are making.

43:58.536 --> 44:07.512
So, a Molly Melching, 7,000
Senegalese villages who have
publicly renounced the practice
of

44:07.512 --> 44:13.117
female genital cutting, that's
evidence. APOPO's unit of
analysis, a cleared square meter
of

44:13.117 --> 44:16.821
mined land. That's evidence.

44:16.821 --> 44:20.324
PAUL SOLMAN: But if you're
relying on the social
entrepreneurs, and they're
asking you

44:20.324 --> 44:23.961
for money, aren't they going to
tell you what you want to hear?

44:23.961 --> 44:29.967
SALLY OSBERG: They don't. People
think there's no accountability
for philanthropy.

44:29.967 --> 44:34.906
But when you're working with
social entrepreneurs, they will
tell us when we're
undercapitalizing

44:34.906 --> 44:41.145
them, they will tell us when our
expectations for measurement or
for -- for documentation

44:41.145 --> 44:45.716
are out of line. They give
us feedback no-holds-barred.

44:45.716 --> 44:48.986
PAUL SOLMAN: Is that because
they already know they're doing
something so virtuous that

44:48.986 --> 44:54.191
they don't need to be defensive
in asking you for more money for
it?

44:54.191 --> 44:59.797
SALLY OSBERG: Actually, they
understand that there is no
argument for philanthropy
without

44:59.797 --> 45:03.801
what they are doing, without
their work on the front lines
driving change. And they're

45:03.801 --> 45:05.036
right.

45:05.036 --> 45:09.173
PAUL SOLMAN: Sally Osberg,
thank you very much.

45:09.173 --> 45:16.180
SALLY OSBERG: Thank you, Paul.

45:16.180 --> 45:22.420
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally
tonight: a career of covering
education and some of the
observations

45:22.420 --> 45:25.189
learned along the way.

45:25.189 --> 45:28.326
John Merrow has been a special
correspondent for education for
the "NewsHour" for more

45:28.326 --> 45:33.097
than three decades now, covering
everything from the importance
of reading to young children,

45:33.097 --> 45:36.901
to battles over reform, to the
rising price of higher
education.

45:36.901 --> 45:38.903
He's now retiring.

45:38.903 --> 45:41.305
And Judy Woodruff sat down with
him recently to discuss his
career.

45:41.305 --> 45:43.007
JUDY WOODRUFF: John
Merrow, welcome.

45:43.007 --> 45:45.543
JOHN MERROW: Thank you.

45:45.543 --> 45:49.914
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you have had
quite a career. Take us back.
How did it all begin? You were

45:49.914 --> 45:51.582
a teacher.

45:51.582 --> 45:55.519
JOHN MERROW: I was a high school
teacher. I went off to graduate
school.

45:55.519 --> 46:00.057
I got hired by a think tank in
Washington. I don't have the
capability of sitting around

46:00.057 --> 46:05.796
thinking. My boss said, start a
forum, told me I could spend
$10,000. I knocked on the

46:05.796 --> 46:10.167
door of National Public Radio,
which was brand-new, said, I had
10 -- they said, come on in.

46:10.167 --> 46:14.138
And I stayed for eight years,
and then ended up coming over
here, and stayed here for a

46:14.138 --> 46:18.042
long, long time as well,
41 years altogether, yes.

46:18.042 --> 46:21.012
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's an amazing
journey, John Merrow. You have
done so many extraordinary

46:21.012 --> 46:24.715
reports for the "NewsHour."

46:24.715 --> 46:28.653
As I think about, if there's
been any kind of a common theme
over that time what, would

46:28.653 --> 46:29.720
you say it is? I mean, I think
of reform. It's just
something...

46:29.720 --> 46:30.621
JOHN MERROW: Reform is it.

46:30.621 --> 46:31.756
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... that
keeps coming back.

46:31.756 --> 46:32.523
JOHN MERROW: Yes.

46:32.523 --> 46:33.557
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do
you think about that?

46:33.557 --> 46:36.193
JOHN MERROW: I think
you're absolutely right.

46:36.193 --> 46:42.433
We started -- the first real
wave of education reform was
1983, with the publication of "A

46:42.433 --> 46:47.204
nation at Risk" that warned we
were drowning in a rising tide
of mediocrity. We have been

46:47.204 --> 46:50.074
reforming ever since.
Here it is 2015.

46:50.074 --> 46:55.579
In fact, I'm writing a book
called "Addicted to Reform," a
12-step program that -- get

46:55.579 --> 47:02.319
us out of it. But -- and we have
made some great improvements.
Public Law 94-142, Education

47:02.319 --> 47:08.526
for All Handicapped Children Act
of 1975 changed things for
millions of children.

47:08.526 --> 47:13.097
We're not -- got a long we way
to go yet, but that's a great
improvement. People forget

47:13.097 --> 47:14.632
we have made a lot
of improvements.

47:14.632 --> 47:16.000
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back when
the term was handicapped.

47:16.000 --> 47:16.667
JOHN MERROW: Handicapped,
exactly, yes.

47:16.667 --> 47:20.438
JUDY WOODRUFF: Handicapped
children. Of course, it's
changed since then.

47:20.438 --> 47:24.141
But there are so many milestones
along the way. I mean, I think
of No Child Left Behind,

47:24.141 --> 47:26.711
14 -- what, 14 years ago,
under President Bush.

47:26.711 --> 47:27.812
JOHN MERROW: That's right.

47:27.812 --> 47:29.814
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you think
about when you think about
milestones?

47:29.814 --> 47:33.718
JOHN MERROW: Well, that law
expired a long time ago, but the
Congress is so divided,

47:33.718 --> 47:38.556
it has been unable to create new
legislation. They're still
trying.

47:38.556 --> 47:44.462
But that law has been -- done a
lot of damage, because it said
everybody is going to be
proficient

47:44.462 --> 47:52.870
by 2014. Well, nowhere near, but
then it started imposing
penalties. The current secretary

47:52.870 --> 47:58.342
of education has been granting
waivers, saying, you don't have
to follow that, but he has

47:58.342 --> 48:04.348
said, you have to do these
things, which has created a
whole new thing called Race to
the

48:04.348 --> 48:09.186
Top, which, with the Common Core
-- I mean, and we're so
polarized now, that these are

48:09.186 --> 48:11.756
stories that reporters are
going to keep on telling.

48:11.756 --> 48:14.892
But I don't think they're really
helping schools in a lot of
ways.

48:14.892 --> 48:19.163
JUDY WOODRUFF: We do seem to be
talking about education more,
though, today as a country.

48:19.163 --> 48:22.399
I mean, we don't -- we don't
seem to take it for granted, the
way we used to.

48:22.399 --> 48:25.236
JOHN MERROW: We talk
a lot about it.

48:25.236 --> 48:31.375
We -- I think, Judy, that we ask
the wrong question,
fundamentally. And this is sort

48:31.375 --> 48:36.781
of a bumper sticker way of
thinking about it. But I think
the system looks at each child

48:36.781 --> 48:42.953
and says, how intelligent are
you, how intelligent are you,
and then tests, whereas the
question

48:42.953 --> 48:47.491
we really -- it seems like we
ought to be asking is, how are
you intelligent, how are

48:47.491 --> 48:51.796
you intelligent, and then figure
out a way to build on what --
the strengths that kid

48:51.796 --> 48:55.032
has, which you can do
with technology today.

48:55.032 --> 49:00.571
I mean, we have the potential to
transform public education.
Whether we do it is an open

49:00.571 --> 49:01.005
question.

49:01.005 --> 49:03.674
OK, you ready to
read this story?

49:03.674 --> 49:07.311
JUDY WOODRUFF: You have been in
so many classrooms around this
country. Is there a moment or

49:07.311 --> 49:10.981
moments you think more
about than any other?

49:10.981 --> 49:17.054
JOHN MERROW: I think back on --
we followed -- for the
"NewsHour" back in 2000,
followed

49:17.054 --> 49:20.691
five first-year teachers for a
whole year. Jim Lehrer used to
call it the PBS version

49:20.691 --> 49:21.492
of "Survivor."

49:21.492 --> 49:23.360
(LAUGHTER)

49:23.360 --> 49:26.931
JOHN MERROW: And then there were
some remarkable times then, as
those young people did their

49:26.931 --> 49:29.333
best without much training.

49:29.333 --> 49:37.074
WOMAN: I want everyone to raise
their hands now. You guys don't
want to learn much of

49:37.074 --> 49:40.211
anything, do you?

49:40.211 --> 49:46.684
JOHN MERROW: We followed New
Orleans since Katrina for --
actually for six years, followed

49:46.684 --> 49:49.186
Michelle Rhee in Washington,
D.C., for three years.

49:49.186 --> 49:51.989
So, there were some
memorable moments there.

49:51.989 --> 49:51.856
MICHELLE RHEE, Former
Chancellor, District Of Columbia
Public Schools: I'm terminating

49:51.856 --> 49:54.959
your principalship now.

49:54.959 --> 50:00.664
I think that, when you're doing
the kind of work I'm doing in
public education, where

50:00.664 --> 50:06.437
the lives and futures of
children hang in the balance,
you cannot -- you can't -- you

50:06.437 --> 50:08.505
can't play with that.

50:08.505 --> 50:13.844
JOHN MERROW: She became the face
of a kind of what you would call
test-based accountability,

50:13.844 --> 50:19.817
which was using test scores to
judge teachers. Most countries
use test scores to judge
students,

50:19.817 --> 50:23.120
and tests are designed to
measure what students are doing.
But we, I think, alone among
advanced

50:23.120 --> 50:28.158
countries use them to fire or
hire or evaluate teachers.

50:28.158 --> 50:31.495
JUDY WOODRUFF: I think the
question a lot of people would
like to ask you, John Merrow,

50:31.495 --> 50:38.035
given all the time you have
spent looking at our schools, is
-- is, are they as bad

50:38.035 --> 50:38.869
as the worst critics
say they are?

50:38.869 --> 50:40.471
JOHN MERROW: No.

50:40.471 --> 50:45.042
JUDY WOODRUFF: Or are they as
good as some of their fierce
defenders say they are?

50:45.042 --> 50:49.013
JOHN MERROW: Judy, I would say
that probably a third of our
schools are better than schools

50:49.013 --> 50:53.250
have ever been in this country.

50:53.250 --> 50:59.290
But that creates a real problem.
We tend to focus on the
achievement gap, and we say,

50:59.290 --> 51:04.428
well, you know, there's this big
difference between whites and
non-whites and so on. It

51:04.428 --> 51:09.433
would be useful if we talked
about an opportunity gap, and
maybe even an expectations gap,
because

51:09.433 --> 51:13.904
if you close the opportunity gap
and the expectations gap, I have
a hunch the outcomes would take

51:13.904 --> 51:16.040
care of themselves.

51:16.040 --> 51:20.377
JUDY WOODRUFF: What should the
focus be for the future? I mean,
as you go off to do other

51:20.377 --> 51:26.717
projects, what should parents,
what should schools -- what
should the priority be now?

51:26.717 --> 51:31.488
JOHN MERROW: I think there are
two terms that are floating
around. One is called blended

51:31.488 --> 51:35.626
learning, which is excellent
teachers using technology. And
the other is what they call

51:35.626 --> 51:41.265
deeper learning, which is really
digging deeply into things.

51:41.265 --> 51:46.136
Kids -- you and I, even our own
children, went to school, you
had to go to school because

51:46.136 --> 51:49.606
that's where they kept the
knowledge. Today's kids are
growing up in a sea of 24/7. But

51:49.606 --> 51:53.177
it's information, not knowledge.

51:53.177 --> 51:58.215
So, schools need to be teaching
kids how to ask questions. How
do you figure out what's

51:58.215 --> 52:03.620
true? Instead, too many of our
schools get kids regurgitating.
So what we have to do

52:03.620 --> 52:09.193
is get away from regurgitation.
It's Aristotle. We are what we
repeatedly do.

52:09.193 --> 52:14.565
If we repeatedly fill in
bubbles, that is not much of a
preparation for the future.

52:14.565 --> 52:19.470
Kids need to be taught to -- not
to be cynical, but to be
skeptical, to look for evidence.

52:19.470 --> 52:23.307
They need to be taught
to be good journalists.

52:23.307 --> 52:28.679
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Merrow, you
have taught us so much about
education.

52:28.679 --> 52:32.316
Thank you. It doesn't do it
justice, but we thank you.

52:32.316 --> 52:34.718
JOHN MERROW: This has been a
great ride, Judy. The "NewsHour"
is the best. Thank you very

52:34.718 --> 52:35.519
much.

52:35.519 --> 52:38.622
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're
going to miss you.

52:38.622 --> 52:42.226
HARI SREENIVASAN: Although John
is retiring, the "NewsHour"'s
coverage of education issues

52:42.226 --> 52:44.628
continues, of course.

52:44.628 --> 52:48.699
And that includes a new
partnership with Education Week.
John's colleagues at Learning
Matters

52:48.699 --> 52:52.703
have joined Education Week and
will bring regular reports from
the nation's classrooms

52:52.703 --> 53:08.118
and communities on important
issues from kindergarten up
through higher education.

53:08.118 --> 53:12.289
On the "NewsHour" online:
Astronaut Sally Ride showed
millions of young girls and boys

53:12.289 --> 53:18.595
that they, too, could reach the
stars by learning science. But
behind the icon was a private

53:18.595 --> 53:23.734
person with a curious nature,
and that is part of a new
photobiography by Tam
O'Shaughnessy,

53:23.734 --> 53:26.503
Ride's life and
business partner.

53:26.503 --> 53:29.773
We spoke with Tam, who shared
many photos from the collection.
And you can see those

53:29.773 --> 53:32.076
on our home page,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:32.076 --> 53:37.681
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

53:37.681 --> 53:41.852
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening with Mark
Shields and David Brooks.

53:41.852 --> 53:42.619
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank you, and good
night.
