JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:07.941 --> 00:13.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: a
chilling attack
at Turkey's busiest airport. At
least 41 are

00:13.847 --> 00:19.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dead and hundreds wounded, the
latest in a
wave of violence to hit a
country active in

00:19.720 --> 00:22.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the anti-ISIS coalition.

00:22.389 --> 00:27.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead this Wednesday, I sit
down with
CIA Director John Brennan to
talk repercussions

00:27.961 --> 00:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the Istanbul bombing, the
ISIS threat,
and the Benghazi report.

00:33.066 --> 00:39.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, hope behind bars, how
convicted juveniles
in Massachusetts are planning
for a brighter

00:39.306 --> 00:42.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
future by earning their degree
while serving
time.

00:42.910 --> 00:47.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH, Resident: I have two
younger brothers,
so they look up to me. I have
people that

00:47.547 --> 00:51.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see a lot in me, and I don't
want to really
let them down, or myself down.

00:51.118 --> 00:54.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
""PBS NewsHour."

00:54.621 --> 00:59.092 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:59.126 --> 01:11.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Investigators in
Istanbul,
Turkey, have spent this day
trying to reconstruct

01:11.905 --> 01:16.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the assault that turned Ataturk
Airport into
a killing field.

01:16.276 --> 01:24.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Three suicide bombers left
widespread carnage,
42 dead, more than 230 wounded,
but no claim

01:24.518 --> 01:26.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of responsibility.

01:26.186 --> 01:30.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Jane
Ferguson begins
our coverage from Istanbul.

01:30.223 --> 01:36.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Operations
resumed at Europe's
third busiest airport, amid the
stark signs

01:36.797 --> 01:42.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of terror, glass panels riddled
with bullet
holes, and blood splattered on
ceilings.

01:42.569 --> 01:49.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The attack began last night,
shortly before
10:00 p.m. local time. Security
cameras captured

01:49.176 --> 01:56.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one attacker just after being
shot by police,
and then setting off his bomb.
That touched

01:56.049 --> 01:58.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
off a stampede to get outside,
and away from
danger.

01:58.852 --> 02:02.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: One guy had holes in his
back from shrapnel
or from glass.

02:03.023 --> 02:09.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HACER PEKSEN, Witness (through
translator):
People were wounded. People fell
down in front

02:09.262 --> 02:13.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of me. Four people fell in front
of me. They
were torn into pieces.

02:13.767 --> 02:19.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: In the hours
after the attack,
Turkish officials pointed to the
Islamic State.

02:19.473 --> 02:24.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The group was blamed for a
suicide bombing
in January that killed several
tourists near

02:24.077 --> 02:27.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the famed Blue Mosque in
Istanbul.

02:27.581 --> 02:33.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And today marked two years since
ISIS declared
its so-called caliphate in Syria
and Iraq.

02:34.021 --> 02:40.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Moreover, Turkey backs the U.S.
bombing campaign
against ISIS in Syria, and on
Monday, the

02:40.427 --> 02:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turks moved to improve relations
with Russia,
which carries out its own
airstrikes in Syria.

02:46.199 --> 02:51.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both Russian President Putin and
President
Obama called Turkey's President
Recep Tayyip

02:51.638 --> 02:57.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Erdogan today to offer
condolences. Back in
Istanbul, the human toll of this
latest attack

02:57.744 --> 03:01.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is still being felt by relatives
and friends
of the wounded.

03:01.448 --> 03:05.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We are
waiting for
some kind of solution. We can
hear that people

03:06.019 --> 03:09.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are wailing here. We cannot cope
anymore.
We can't stand still.

03:09.790 --> 03:13.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: The Turkish
government has
worked for years to build an
international

03:13.460 --> 03:19.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
airline and to make Istanbul
Airport one of
the biggest hubs in the world.
Any attack

03:19.099 --> 03:24.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against this airport is an
attack against
the economic ambitions of the
Turkish government.

03:24.504 --> 03:26.373 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They know that.

03:26.406 --> 03:30.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so just a day after the
attack, the airport
is completely reopened and it's
business as

03:30.444 --> 03:36.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
usual. Some travelers at Ataturk
today were
trying to do the same. They say
the risk of

03:36.183 --> 03:40.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attacks at major airports is now
a reality
they have come to terms with.

03:40.720 --> 03:45.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I think the best option
is to just
go on and try not to be so
nervous, and, of

03:45.926 --> 03:49.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
course be cautious, but to live
your live
as it was before.

03:49.296 --> 03:54.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: In the end,
Tuesday's bombings
are yet another reminder that
international

03:54.134 --> 03:57.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
travel remains a major target
for terror attacks.

03:57.871 --> 04:02.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Jane
Ferguson
in Istanbul, Turkey.

04:02.709 --> 04:07.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will take a
closer look
at the situation in Turkey after
the news

04:07.914 --> 04:09.749 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
summary.

04:09.783 --> 04:14.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the shockwaves from
Istanbul also
reverberated in the U.S.
presidential campaign.

04:14.454 --> 04:20.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At a rally last night,
Republican Donald Trump
warned of dangers at home and
abroad. He said

04:20.393 --> 04:25.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- quote -- "We better get
tough, or we're
not going to have much of a
country left."

04:25.599 --> 04:29.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in a statement, Democrat
Hillary Clinton
called the attack -- quote -- "a
reminder

04:29.936 --> 04:32.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the United States cannot
retreat."

04:32.839 --> 04:38.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama and the leaders
of Mexico
and Canada defended free trade
today at a

04:38.278 --> 04:43.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North American summit. Their
comments were
partly in response to Donald
Trump's threats

04:43.717 --> 04:50.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to quit the North American and
Pacific trade
deals. Mr. Obama met in Ottawa
with Canadian

04:50.056 --> 04:56.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prime Minister Trudeau and
Mexican President
Pena Nieto. He said cutting off
trade will

04:56.096 --> 04:57.864 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
only make everyone poorer.

04:57.898 --> 05:05.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
The prescription of withdrawing
from trade

05:05.438 --> 05:12.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deals and focusing solely your
local market,
that's the wrong medicine. We
can't disengage.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.848 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have got to engage more.

05:14.881 --> 05:19.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The leaders also
called for
more liberal immigration
policies and action

05:19.953 --> 05:22.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
against climate change.

05:22.322 --> 05:27.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
European Union leaders issued a
warning today.
If Britain wants continued
access to the euro

05:27.894 --> 05:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
market, it must accept European
workers. Member
states met in Brussels just days
after Britain

05:34.034 --> 05:36.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
voted to quit the E.U.

05:36.369 --> 05:40.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
French President Francois
Hollande summed
up the message to leaders in
London.

05:40.640 --> 05:45.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANCOIS HOLLANDE, French
President (through
translator): They have to
understand that

05:45.178 --> 05:50.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they can't just hang on to their
existing
advantages. You can't just say
what is ours

05:50.183 --> 05:55.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is ours, and what is yours is up
for negotiations.
It's an old principle, but, no,
it doesn't

05:55.789 --> 05:57.524 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
work like that.

05:57.557 --> 06:01.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Part of what
drove the Brexit
vote was opposition to accepting
thousands

06:01.561 --> 06:04.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of workers from other E.U.
states.

06:04.331 --> 06:08.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. Senate moved today to
give final
approval to a financial rescue
package for

06:09.002 --> 06:15.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Puerto Rico. It cleared a key
procedural hurdle
with votes to spare. The bill
already passed

06:15.075 --> 06:21.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the House. It would let the
island restructure
$70 billion in debt, and it
would set up an

06:21.047 --> 06:26.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
oversight board. Puerto Rico
faces a $2 billion
debt payment on Friday.

06:26.720 --> 06:33.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Toyota has announced two major
recalls affecting
almost 3.4 million vehicles
worldwide. About

06:34.027 --> 06:39.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
half-a-million of those are in
North America.
The recalls involve faulty air
bags and fuel

06:39.566 --> 06:45.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
emissions controls. The
automaker says there
have been no reports of injuries
or fatalities

06:45.639 --> 06:47.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
related to the problems.

06:47.874 --> 06:53.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Wall Street made up more of
its losses
from the Brexit sell-off. The
Dow Jones industrial

06:53.213 --> 07:02.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average gained back nearly 285
points to close
at 17694. The Nasdaq rose 87
points, and the

07:02.522 --> 07:05.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
S&amp;P 500 added 34.

07:05.458 --> 07:11.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the CIA director
talks global security after the
Istanbul attacks;

07:11.698 --> 07:18.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
overcoming barriers to educate
incarcerated
teens; a spacecraft's five-year
journey to

07:18.872 --> 07:32.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jupiter, and much more.

07:32.052 --> 07:37.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We return now to the terror
attacks in Turkey
with "NewsHour" special
correspondent Jane

07:37.157 --> 07:43.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ferguson, who is in Istanbul,
and Amberin
Zaman. She's a journalist and a
public policy

07:43.063 --> 07:46.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
scholar at the Wilson Center
here in Washington.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

07:48.902 --> 07:52.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jane, to you first. I know you
have been reporting
on this all day. What have you
learned about

07:52.839 --> 07:55.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where exactly these attacks at
the airport
took place?

07:55.809 --> 08:01.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Well, Judy, those
blasts took
place at the very entrance of
the airport,

08:01.348 --> 08:06.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
basically at the door where you
would have
had people gathering in the
street, getting

08:06.186 --> 08:09.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out of taxies and trying to
enter into the
building.

08:09.489 --> 08:14.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ironically, that's actually
where the security
screening is in Istanbul Airport
at Ataturk

08:14.861 --> 08:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here behind me. They always
screen bags of
everybody who is coming into the
airport.

08:19.899 --> 08:24.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As soon as you get in through
glass doors,
there is a screening area and
the bags have

08:24.571 --> 08:26.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to go through the machine to be
checked.

08:26.339 --> 08:31.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's been in place for
some time now.
However, that also leads up to a
buildup of

08:31.411 --> 08:36.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people, and people will be there
queuing to
get in, so, of course, that
makes it very

08:36.516 --> 08:40.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vulnerable to such an attack
right at the
entrance there.

08:40.086 --> 08:45.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jane, you have
also been out
and around the city of Istanbul
today. What

08:45.325 --> 08:50.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are people saying? We know there
have been
a string of attacks in Turkey.
Do they view

08:50.563 --> 08:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this as just one more in what's
been going
on?

08:53.933 --> 08:58.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Speaking at a
people in a hospital
today in the city where people
are waiting

08:58.571 --> 09:02.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anxiously to hear about their
loved ones and
their friends, people were
saying that this

09:02.876 --> 09:08.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attack seems to hit home even
harder for them,
partly because it was at an
airport.

09:08.882 --> 09:15.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One person said to me today that
the airport
should be the most secure area
in the country,

09:15.922 --> 09:19.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that those are places that are
typically secure,
places where typically there is
a lot of police

09:19.826 --> 09:24.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and there is a lot of checks. So
people feel
extremely vulnerable, and
they're also pointing

09:24.831 --> 09:31.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out this attack was extremely
brazenly against
civilians. That's something
that's not lost

09:31.438 --> 09:37.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on people here. Of course, many
Turks killed
as well, as civilians in this
attack, and

09:37.243 --> 09:40.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so people are increasingly
feeling very vulnerable.

09:40.046 --> 09:46.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amberin Zaman,
you know Turkey
well. Officials say this has the
earmarks

09:46.519 --> 09:51.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of ISIS, but they don't know for
sure. Why
would ISIS want to make this
kind of an attack?

09:51.291 --> 09:55.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMBERIN ZAMAN, Wilson Center:
Well, this isn't
the first time that ISIS has
attacked inside

09:55.795 --> 09:57.530 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Turkey.

09:57.564 --> 10:01.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This would be the seventh attack
so far, but
it's drawn a lot more attention,
precisely

10:01.568 --> 10:07.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as your correspondent was
saying, because
it's such a high-value target,
it's an international

10:07.106 --> 10:13.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
airport. Last year, you had
around 40 million
people transit through Istanbul
Airport. Let's

10:13.413 --> 10:18.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not forget it's the holy month
of Ramadan
and that Turkey is a
predominantly Muslim

10:18.384 --> 10:23.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country, so, of course, that
sort of has a
multiplier effect in terms of
the horror and

10:23.189 --> 10:24.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
indecency of it all.

10:24.958 --> 10:30.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Turkey, you know, is an
active member
of the anti-ISIS coalition, and
since June

10:30.430 --> 10:38.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2015, it's allowed the anti-ISIS
coalition
led by the United States to fly
missions,

10:38.071 --> 10:44.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
combat missions out of the
Incirlik Air Base
in Southern Turkey. Turkey
itself has stepped

10:44.210 --> 10:47.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up artillery attacks against
ISIS.

10:47.514 --> 10:53.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And since May, we think around
800 ISIS militants
may have been killed in those
attacks and

10:53.720 --> 10:59.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of pressure inside Turkey
also against
ISIS, where, sadly, ISIS is very
well-organized.

10:59.592 --> 11:05.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, tell us
about that. I
mean, how much of a presence
does ISIS have

11:05.198 --> 11:06.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
inside Turkey?

11:06.599 --> 11:10.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
AMBERIN ZAMAN: Well, the
trajectory has been
quite sort of sinuous.

11:10.370 --> 11:17.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Initially, Turkey was not that
concerned,
or it certainly didn't seem to
be that concerned

11:17.076 --> 11:22.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the ISIS threat. And, as you
know, this
term the jihadi highway was
being applied

11:22.382 --> 11:28.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Turkey because they were so
lax about the
fighters that were going in and
out of Turkey.

11:28.755 --> 11:34.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And why? Because Turkey's stated
policy in
Syria is to overthrow the regime
of Bashar

11:34.661 --> 11:42.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Assad on the one hand and also
to combat Kurdish
separatists inside Northern
Syria.

11:42.702 --> 11:48.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, the conundrum is
that those
very same Kurdish separatists
are the United

11:48.041 --> 11:53.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States' top allies in the fight
against ISIS,
so it's a very complicated sort
of architecture

11:53.813 --> 11:59.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we have there, but Turkey
has not only
used these rebel also against
Assad, but also

11:59.218 --> 12:04.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
against the Kurds inside
Northern Syria, because
they regard them as a security
threat.

12:04.891 --> 12:10.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back to you,
Jane, there at
the airport. Are you already
seeing security

12:10.697 --> 12:12.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stepped up? What are you seeing
there?

12:12.932 --> 12:14.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Well, it's
interesting, Judy.

12:14.767 --> 12:19.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Being at the airport earlier on
today, things
were getting back to normal at a
remarkable

12:19.539 --> 12:25.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pace. Huge amounts of travelers
arriving and
leaving. Of course, the area
that had been

12:25.478 --> 12:32.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bombed has been cordoned off
now, and that
will need to face a very large
cleanup operation.

12:32.752 --> 12:36.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now what we're seeing is a
little bit
of extra security. We're seeing
some extra

12:36.723 --> 12:41.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
police, police who are heavily
armed. We're
seeing cars that aren't allowed
to stop in

12:41.527 --> 12:45.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
front of the building for a long
period of
time and they just need to drop
off people

12:45.565 --> 12:47.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and move on quickly.

12:47.433 --> 12:53.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we're not seeing anything
significantly
different, the usual security
measures that

12:53.139 --> 12:57.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I discussed earlier, where you
enter through
the glass doors and then you
have to have

12:57.510 --> 13:02.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your baggage checked. Those are
still going
on. That still seems to be the
security protocol

13:02.749 --> 13:03.516 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

13:03.549 --> 13:05.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It is
complicated.

13:05.118 --> 13:11.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Amberin Zaman, thank you very
much. And Jane
Ferguson in Istanbul, thank you.

13:11.891 --> 13:17.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now to my interview with
America's top spy,
the director of the Central
Intelligence Agency,

13:17.697 --> 13:19.365 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
John Brennan.

13:19.399 --> 13:23.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke with him this afternoon
at the Council
on Foreign Relations in
Washington.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Director John Brennan, thank you
very much
for talking with us.

13:25.838 --> 13:27.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN, CIA Director:
Thank you, Judy.

13:27.740 --> 13:31.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, the
administration, you
and others have said that this
attack in Istanbul

13:31.244 --> 13:37.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has all the earmarks of an ISIS
attack. What
are the odds that they can pull
off something

13:37.050 --> 13:38.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like that in the United States?

13:38.785 --> 13:41.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: Well, I think it's
much more
difficult for them to carry out
something

13:41.921 --> 13:43.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like that in the United States.

13:43.723 --> 13:48.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, Turkey is a lot
closer to their
core, to the Syria-Iraq theater.
And there

13:48.728 --> 13:52.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are a lot of steps that they
would have to
go through in order to be able
to carry out

13:52.465 --> 13:57.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something like that, where they
have deployed
fighters, whether or not these
are individuals

13:57.303 --> 14:03.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who came from inside Syria or
Iraq, but they
are close to that area.

14:03.142 --> 14:09.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have the benefit of an
ocean between
us, as well as some very, very
comprehensive

14:09.882 --> 14:13.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
efforts that have been
undertaken since 9/11
to help protect this homeland.

14:13.853 --> 14:18.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does the fact,
though, that
they continue to be able to pull
off these

14:18.558 --> 14:24.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kinds of attacks give you any
better understanding
of what is lacking in either the
U.S. approach

14:24.797 --> 14:28.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or the approach of U.S. allies
in fighting
ISIS?

14:28.334 --> 14:33.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: It gives me better
insight into
their determination to continue
to kill as

14:33.473 --> 14:36.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
many innocent men, women and
children as possible.

14:36.309 --> 14:40.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it also, I think,
demonstrates that we
really have to be on our guard
against all

14:40.146 --> 14:44.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
different types of attacks,
particularly since
individuals who try to carry out
these attacks

14:45.017 --> 14:52.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are suicide bombers and
shooters. That makes
it very difficult for law
enforcement security

14:52.759 --> 14:55.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agencies to be able to stop them
from carrying
them out.

14:55.128 --> 15:02.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think we're ever going
to have a situation
where we are immune from this
type of violence.

15:02.735 --> 15:08.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Of course, the
core of what's
behind so much of ISIS activity
has to do

15:08.541 --> 15:12.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the war in Syria, the civil
war going
on there that's brought in so
many different

15:13.012 --> 15:14.914 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
elements.

15:14.947 --> 15:21.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of State John Kerry
said yesterday
that Iran had been helpful in
the fight against

15:21.554 --> 15:24.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIS. Is that how you see Iran's
role there?

15:24.190 --> 15:28.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: Well, I think the
Iranians have
a vested interest in doing what
they can to

15:28.761 --> 15:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prevent the growth of ISIS in
that area, because
ISIS has a very strong anti-Shia
dimension

15:34.433 --> 15:39.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to it, so there are some things
that the Iranians
can do and even some things that
the Iranians

15:39.272 --> 15:43.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have done that have helped to
inhibit the
further growth of ISIS.

15:43.609 --> 15:49.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are a lot of things
that Iran does
that tends to facilitate
terrorism, and they

15:49.448 --> 15:52.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still are the leading state
sponsor of terrorism
in the world.

15:52.518 --> 15:55.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, on balance,
would you say
Iran is more helpful in the
fight against

15:56.022 --> 15:57.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
terrorism or less?

15:57.924 --> 16:00.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: On balance, I
think they have
to do more. I think they have
done some things,

16:00.560 --> 16:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but they need to demonstrate
their commitment
to helping defeat these
terrorist organizations

16:07.166 --> 16:12.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and being able to work with
regional states,
their neighbors and doing it in
a way that

16:12.839 --> 16:15.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is really going to be designed
to destroy
these organizations.

16:15.708 --> 16:22.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The attack in
Orlando by the
young man who said he was
inspired or was

16:22.248 --> 16:28.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- pledged allegiance to ISIS,
there is no
direct connection that's been
shown yet to

16:28.487 --> 16:36.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISIS. Is this the new normal for
seeing what
we call these lone wolf attacks
in the United

16:36.095 --> 16:37.797 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States?

16:37.830 --> 16:39.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN BRENNAN: Well, it's
certainly one of
the more worrisome features of
this phenomenon

16:39.665 --> 16:45.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of ISIS, which has been able to
use the Internet
and to exhort and incite
individuals to carry

16:45.404 --> 16:47.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out attacks in its name.

16:47.306 --> 16:51.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there needn't be a direct
connection. And,
unfortunately, as we saw in
Orlando, individuals

16:51.410 --> 16:56.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can take it upon themselves and
with the availability
to weapons or access to
material, they can

16:56.883 --> 17:02.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
carry out these attacks. This is
something
that not just the FBI and
intelligence agencies

17:02.221 --> 17:05.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are challenged with. It's also
the local police
communities.

17:05.124 --> 17:10.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And is there --
is intelligence
up to this challenge, or are we
in a whole

17:10.997 --> 17:12.932 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
new frontier?

17:12.965 --> 17:16.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: This is really --
it needs to
be almost an all-of -- not just
an all-of-government,

17:16.068 --> 17:20.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but an all-of-nation effort, and
not just
here in the United States, but
other places

17:20.373 --> 17:21.540 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as well.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does that
necessarily involve
profiling?

17:23.109 --> 17:25.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: No, I don't think
it does.

17:25.278 --> 17:29.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It doesn't mean that any
individual of any
particular faith or background
or ethnicity

17:30.016 --> 17:31.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is more prone to doing this.

17:31.684 --> 17:36.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.K. vote to
leave the
European Union, the Brexit vote,
you have

17:36.722 --> 17:43.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said that this won't have any
material effect
on intelligence-gathering
partnership with

17:43.095 --> 17:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the U.K., with Great Britain, or
with Europe.

17:47.099 --> 17:52.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet it certainly is creating
political
turmoil. Are you saying it won't
have any

17:52.071 --> 17:57.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
effect on the ability of the
U.S. and its
allies to work together against
the many threats?

17:57.276 --> 18:01.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: Well, it certainly
won't have
any effect or adverse effect on
the U.S.-British

18:01.113 --> 18:04.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
intelligence and security
cooperation and
partnership. That is going to
stay strong.

18:04.951 --> 18:09.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There will be some complications
associated
with how are they going to move
from being

18:09.322 --> 18:14.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
part of the E.U. to being
outside of the E.U.
as far as border agreements and
other types

18:14.427 --> 18:19.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of arrangements, whereby they're
going to
try to protect the flow of
people and goods,

18:19.532 --> 18:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because they have been part of
the E.U.

18:21.334 --> 18:25.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they are going to have to
establish some
new structures. But as far as
intelligence

18:25.171 --> 18:30.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cooperation between ourselves
and the United
Kingdom, that is going to remain
exceptionally

18:30.242 --> 18:31.877 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
strong.

18:31.911 --> 18:34.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A question about
the report
that was issued yesterday by the
House of

18:34.380 --> 18:40.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Representatives' special
committee looking
into Benghazi, Libya, attack in
2012.

18:40.553 --> 18:45.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among other things, it singled
out what it
called a lack of proper
assessment of the

18:45.157 --> 18:50.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
threat level in Benghazi and at
other U.S.
installations at the time of the
attack. Is

18:50.463 --> 18:55.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that a fair criticism, and, if
it is, what's
been done since then to make the
situation

18:55.601 --> 18:56.836 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
better?

18:56.869 --> 18:58.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: Oh, I don't
believe it's a fair
criticism.

18:58.604 --> 19:03.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These situations, these types of
assaults
and attacks against the
compounds frequently

19:03.809 --> 19:10.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take place in a very dynamic
environment.
And I think it was no secret to
anybody that

19:10.282 --> 19:16.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the situation in Libya was
rather tenuous.
And so I think that the agency
and the rest

19:16.589 --> 19:20.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the intelligence community
had highlighted
that, in terms of the strategic
concerns and

19:20.659 --> 19:22.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
warnings that we had.

19:22.661 --> 19:27.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's very difficult to get the
tactical intelligence.
But we always try to take
lessons away from

19:28.000 --> 19:32.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these types of incidents,
particularly when
there was tragic loss of life on
the part

19:32.238 --> 19:34.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of U.S. personnel and others
that were there.

19:34.473 --> 19:38.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, with each of these
incidents, I think
what we do is to make any type
of adjustments

19:38.911 --> 19:42.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we believe are necessary in
terms of
our processes and procedures.
But I'm very

19:42.782 --> 19:48.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
proud of what the agency
officers heroically
did that night in Benghazi, and
it could have

19:48.654 --> 19:53.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been much worse, except for the
work that
we and others did at that time.

19:53.325 --> 19:57.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Director,
what are your
counterparts in other countries
saying about

19:57.363 --> 20:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the rhetoric of Donald Trump,
the potential
that he may be the president of
the United

20:01.734 --> 20:04.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
States? Do you hear any reaction
from them?

20:04.937 --> 20:11.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: Well, without
addressing the
particular comments of any
individual, I do

20:11.110 --> 20:18.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see a real concern on the part
of my counterparts
about some of the commentary
that is taking

20:18.484 --> 20:26.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
place that is related to the
growth of terrorism
and various proposals in terms
of how to address

20:26.292 --> 20:28.060 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

20:28.094 --> 20:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there is quite a bit of
attention being
paid by our partners, by our
allies, by our

20:35.034 --> 20:40.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
adversaries about what is
happening in the
political circles here.

20:40.406 --> 20:46.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But my job is to make sure that
they're reassured
that the intelligence
relationship between

20:46.112 --> 20:50.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the CIA and their services are
going to remain
strong, irrespective of what
happens in a

20:50.883 --> 20:54.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presidential campaign. It's one
of the most
important things about the
agency is that

20:54.286 --> 20:59.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we need to continue to soldier
on, irrespective
of what political party or what
candidate

20:59.992 --> 21:01.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
might prevail in an election.

21:01.293 --> 21:02.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Director,
thank you very
much.

21:03.028 --> 21:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: Thank you, Judy.

21:07.800 --> 21:20.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next: a look into
the poor
state of education for the
60,000 children

21:20.546 --> 21:24.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
locked up in juvenile detention
facilities
across the nation.

21:24.517 --> 21:29.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan takes us inside
one state
that is working to do better.
It's another

21:29.321 --> 21:33.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in our ongoing series Broken
Justice.

21:33.225 --> 21:40.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Graduation day
in Lowell,
Massachusetts, with all the
typical fanfare,

21:40.466 --> 21:43.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
balloons, beaming parents and
motivational
speeches.

21:43.636 --> 21:47.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: All of you are sitting
there trying to
figure out, OK, where is this
going to go?

21:47.706 --> 21:51.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What am I going to be when I
grow up? I guarantee
you that every single adult in
this room had

21:51.844 --> 21:54.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the same thought at 17, 18, 19.

21:54.180 --> 21:57.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yet these kids
aren't like
most graduating from high school
this time

21:57.917 --> 22:03.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of year. At some point in their
young lives,
each was convicted of a crime
and sentenced

22:03.122 --> 22:08.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the care of the Department of
Youth Services,
the state's juvenile corrections
agency, and

22:08.093 --> 22:12.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
though they have since earned
back far more
freedom, they graduate in
custody.

22:12.464 --> 22:18.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Getting committed to DYS is
a stressful
time, and I'm proud of all of
you and myself

22:18.137 --> 22:22.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for sticking to what's
important, getting
an education and bettering
ourselves.

22:22.141 --> 22:27.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: On any given
day across
the country, 36,000 teenagers
and young people

22:27.279 --> 22:33.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are held in long-term state
custody more than
60 days, and two-thirds of them
are black

22:33.285 --> 22:35.154 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Latino.

22:35.187 --> 22:39.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the past 20 years, this
incarcerated population
has dropped by about half, and
many are now

22:39.992 --> 22:45.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looking at how to improve
education, and thus
outcomes, for juveniles who end
up in this

22:45.698 --> 22:47.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
system.

22:47.399 --> 22:49.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL THOMPSON, Director,
Council of State
Governments Justice Center: When
you look

22:49.235 --> 22:51.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at this population, they have
been suspended
multiple times, haven't
progressed very far

22:51.570 --> 22:57.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the educational system,
dropped out, been
expelled. And we wanted to make
sure that

22:57.109 --> 23:00.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when these kids are coming back
to the community,
we knew education was key.

23:00.613 --> 23:03.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Michael
Thompson is executive
director of the Council of State
Governments

23:03.882 --> 23:09.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Justice Center, a nonprofit
whose recent report
looked at education in juvenile
detention

23:09.088 --> 23:10.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
settings in all 50 states.

23:10.856 --> 23:14.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL THOMPSON: If you asked
anybody on
the street, what's important to
helping turn

23:14.460 --> 23:17.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this kid's life around, they are
going to
say, well, they need an
education.

23:17.263 --> 23:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think everybody assumes
they get a certain
quality of education while
they're incarcerated.

23:21.567 --> 23:26.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it turns out this is not an
educational
system that is held accountable
to the same

23:26.572 --> 23:29.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kind of standards that the
public education
system is.

23:29.341 --> 23:33.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: His group
found large gaps
from state to state in education
available

23:33.846 --> 23:39.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to juvenile populations, and
that only one-third
of states require incarcerated
kids meet the

23:39.818 --> 23:42.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
same educational standards as
those in public
schools.

23:42.554 --> 23:45.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LYNNE ALLEN, Judge John J.
Connelly Detention
Facility: We have art class, we
have gym class,

23:45.758 --> 23:49.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
math, history. Everything you
would find in
a regular school, we have here
as well.

23:49.428 --> 23:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One state that
is doing
better is Massachusetts by
matching standards

23:54.199 --> 23:59.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inside detention with what
students would
receive on the outside, tracking
students'

23:59.171 --> 24:04.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
progress through the system, and
helping kids
return to the community.

24:04.743 --> 24:09.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LYNNE ALLEN: Welcome to Judge
Connelly.

24:09.548 --> 24:14.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lynne Allen runs the Judge John
Connelly detention
facility in Boston, the state's
most restrictive.

24:14.853 --> 24:20.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One advantage, unlike most
states, Massachusetts
centralizes juvenile education,
rather than

24:20.459 --> 24:23.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spreading it among state, local
and private
agencies.

24:23.729 --> 24:27.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm assuming some of these young
these kids
are in for pretty serious
crimes.

24:27.533 --> 24:29.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LYNNE ALLEN: They are.

24:29.401 --> 24:36.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This facility works with young
men up to manslaughter
charges. So we do have some kids
who have

24:36.408 --> 24:40.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a pretty good history behind
them. But the
charges that have brought you
here don't have

24:40.612 --> 24:42.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to define who you are.

24:42.348 --> 24:46.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In 2015,
17-year-old Josh
was convicted of manslaughter.
He's spent

24:46.752 --> 24:51.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the past 10 months at Connelly
and has another
eight to go.

24:52.024 --> 24:57.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like the other 14 young men
here, he lives
on a secure detention floor, his
movement

24:57.096 --> 25:05.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
constantly monitored. But for
5.5 hours a
day, he and the others are in
school downstairs,

25:05.904 --> 25:14.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attending academic classes like
English, and
math, vocational courses like
A.V. engineering,

25:14.613 --> 25:20.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AKA deejaying, or how to build
copper wiring
and ethernet jacks.

25:20.719 --> 25:25.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Josh recently began psychology
classes online
through Bunker Hill Community
College, credits

25:25.824 --> 25:29.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he hopes to put towards the
University of
California when he gets out.

25:29.461 --> 25:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH, Resident: I always wanted
to go to California,
and I skateboard, and I always
wanted to go

25:34.199 --> 25:38.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to college, so I feel like, put
them all together,
that would just be dope.

25:38.103 --> 25:44.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is the goal of
the state
to make you realize the gravity
of what you

25:44.042 --> 25:44.610 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have done?

25:44.643 --> 25:46.345 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JOSH: Yes.

25:46.378 --> 25:50.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is that going
to happen
while you're here and in class,
and taking

25:50.516 --> 25:52.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an online course?

25:52.284 --> 25:55.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH: Well, for me, I just have
goals for
myself. And I definitely do feel
bad for what

25:55.621 --> 25:59.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happened. And I definitely want
to do better
for the people.

25:59.558 --> 26:04.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have two younger brothers, so
they look
up to me. I have people that see
a lot in

26:04.663 --> 26:07.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me, and I don't want to really
let them down,
or myself down, for that matter.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LYNNE ALLEN: They're coming back
to communities.
We want these kids to come out
with the skills

26:12.137 --> 26:17.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to succeed. And we know they can
succeed,
because they're amazingly
resilient.

26:17.443 --> 26:23.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Another key
difference is
Massachusetts' support through
education coordinators

26:23.348 --> 26:29.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and caseworkers, people assigned
to guide
each student into and out of
this system,

26:29.254 --> 26:34.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
making sure education plans,
grades and credits
transfer from and back to
school.

26:34.359 --> 26:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL THOMPSON: When a kid who
is incarcerated,
they are going to get out, and
you ask the

26:41.400 --> 26:45.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
question, then, well, how is
that student
going to follow up and enroll in
school once

26:45.604 --> 26:49.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are released? And many of
these schools,
for reasons you can probably
imagine, want

26:49.842 --> 26:51.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nothing to do with the student
when they come
back.

26:51.810 --> 26:54.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the question then becomes,
well, who is
going to manage this transition?
Who is going

26:54.880 --> 26:59.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do that? Well, it turns out
that in most
states, it is up to the parent
and the kid

26:59.852 --> 27:02.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to actually manage that
transition.

27:02.087 --> 27:06.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Education and
career counselor
Kelly McMorrow works with Josh
and about 75

27:06.892 --> 27:09.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other young men at any given
time.

27:09.361 --> 27:12.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seems in some way that there
are these
big systemic forces weighing
down on them

27:12.931 --> 27:17.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the time they get here.
Right? They made
a bad decision, clearly, by the
time they

27:17.102 --> 27:21.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have gotten here. How do you
turn that around
in the limited amount of time
that you have

27:21.707 --> 27:24.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with them in a place like this?

27:24.409 --> 27:26.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLY MCMORROW, Education and
Career Counselor:
It's challenging, but I think
that's our biggest

27:26.945 --> 27:31.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
goal, is to find what makes them
tick, what
passions they have, and try to
figure -- help

27:31.483 --> 27:36.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them figure out what path they
want to take,
so that they can go down a
positive road,

27:36.455 --> 27:39.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so that they're not labeled and
defined by
whatever their charge is.

27:39.491 --> 27:44.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally,
managing the transition
from lockup to a secure facility
like Connelly

27:44.897 --> 27:49.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and eventually back to the
community often
through halfway houses like this
one is crucial,

27:49.902 --> 27:51.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
says commissioner Peter Forbes.

27:51.803 --> 27:53.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER FORBES, Commission,
Massachusetts Department
of Youth Services: Because, if
we have kids

27:53.605 --> 27:58.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come in and advance grade levels
and do great
work, and we don't hand that off
to anything

27:58.377 --> 28:05.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
constructive in the community,
it's half-a-loaf.
So we're really trying to
leverage the work

28:05.484 --> 28:11.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that goes on while they're in
placement with
a positive transition that
translates into

28:11.623 --> 28:13.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
traction in the community.

28:13.825 --> 28:17.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Back in
Lowell, 20-year-old
John Coady estimates that he
lived in nearly

28:17.663 --> 28:23.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two dozen different juvenile
facilities around
the state during his
more-than-six-year tenure.

28:23.335 --> 28:26.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This fall, he's headed to a
four-year college,
where he plans to play football.

28:26.572 --> 28:33.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN COADY, Resident: Being
locked up, you
lose a lot of life experiences
where you gain

28:33.779 --> 28:35.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wisdom and stuff.

28:35.581 --> 28:39.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And if you can get your
education in there,
like, at least you will have
something going

28:39.284 --> 28:44.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for you. If you don't have
education or work
experience, or anything, I mean,
you're lost.

28:44.523 --> 28:48.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you come out, you're going
to have no
friends. You're going -- your
family is probably

28:48.727 --> 28:53.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not going to care much. You're
not going to
have anything.

28:53.332 --> 28:57.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And many say
that's a prospect
still far too many young people
across the

28:57.936 --> 28:59.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nation continue to face.

28:59.905 --> 29:02.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From Boston, Massachusetts, I'm
Hari Sreenivasan
for the "PBS NewsHour."

29:02.808 --> 29:16.254 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

29:16.288 --> 29:22.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": why
the head
of Rio 2016 says Olympic worries
are overblown;

29:22.594 --> 29:29.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plus, a book about tribal
societies and what
they teach us about banding
together.

29:29.067 --> 29:36.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: NASA is hoping for a
big Fourth
of July this year as it closes
in on the planet

29:36.108 --> 29:41.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jupiter for an unprecedented
look. The moment
is arriving after a
five-year-long journey

29:42.014 --> 29:45.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of more than 1.8 billion miles.

29:45.584 --> 29:49.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scientists hope to gain new
understandings
about the largest planet in our
system and

29:49.888 --> 29:51.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the solar system itself.

29:51.356 --> 29:55.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is the focus of our weekly
segment on
the Leading Edge of science.

29:55.927 --> 29:57.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham takes it from
there.

29:57.729 --> 30:02.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The holiday
weekend is often
a time for big blockbuster
movies, and it's

30:02.167 --> 30:05.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
safe to say that concept has not
been lost
on NASA.

30:05.671 --> 30:09.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The space agency has just
released a kind
of movie trailer about what it
hopes will

30:09.474 --> 30:13.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be a nail-biting night on the
Fourth of July.
That's when the Juno spacecraft,
which is

30:13.979 --> 30:19.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to fly closer to Jupiter
than any spacecraft
has before, is supposed to reach
its destination.

30:19.685 --> 30:22.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But getting to Jupiter comes
with its own
risks.

30:22.254 --> 30:24.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is how NASA describes it in
the trailer.

30:24.856 --> 30:36.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: It's a monster. It's
unforgiving. It's
relentless. It's spinning around
so fast its

30:36.568 --> 30:43.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
gravity is like a giant
slingshot, slinging
rocks, dust, electrons, whole
comets. Anything

30:43.442 --> 30:47.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that gets close to it becomes
its weapon.

30:47.079 --> 30:50.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: OK, that got
my attention.

30:50.816 --> 30:53.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our science correspondent Miles
O'Brien is
here to spell out some more.

30:53.885 --> 30:56.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: William, I should
have brought
the popcorn.

30:56.221 --> 30:56.822 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

30:56.855 --> 30:58.757 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Exactly.

30:58.790 --> 31:02.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have been to Jupiter before.
NASA's been
there a couple of times. What's
different

31:02.861 --> 31:04.696 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this time?

31:04.730 --> 31:06.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, depending
on how you
count, we have had about 10
missions to Jupiter.

31:06.832 --> 31:12.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most of them have been flybys,
Voyager, Pioneer
notable among them, New Horizons
as well.

31:12.571 --> 31:18.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We of course had the orbiting
mission of Galileo,
which began in the mid-'90s into
the early

31:18.143 --> 31:22.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
2000s, which did most science
around Jupiter
and its moons.

31:22.380 --> 31:26.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's the big treasure
trove of data.
And all the while, the Hubble
telescope has

31:26.818 --> 31:32.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
captured a lot of interesting
data from Jupiter.
And in particular, back in 1994,
you may recall

31:32.491 --> 31:37.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet,
that fragment
comet, struck Jupiter, Hubble
got some amazing

31:37.729 --> 31:39.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
images of those impacts.

31:39.164 --> 31:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But all off this is skin-deep.

31:41.099 --> 31:43.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So what are we
trying to
learn this time?

31:43.902 --> 31:47.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, there's a
lot of things
we can learn from Jupiter.

31:47.839 --> 31:51.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jupiter, of course, is the
biggest plant in
our solar system of eight
planets. It's about

31:51.843 --> 31:56.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two-and-a-half times the mass of
all the rest
of the solar system combined, of
the planets,

31:56.782 --> 32:04.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is. And it's really like a
big deep freeze
for how our solar system began
four billion

32:04.122 --> 32:05.991 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
years ago.

32:06.024 --> 32:08.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It really hasn't changed very
much. So scientists
want to understand what's kind
of beneath

32:08.794 --> 32:13.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the surface there, how much
hydrogen, how
much water, what about the
magnetic field,

32:13.799 --> 32:18.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what about the gravitational
pull, is there
a solid core? All these are
important clues

32:18.837 --> 32:24.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and information for us to
understand how our
solar system progressed, how it
developed

32:24.442 --> 32:28.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and really how we came to be
where we are
today.

32:28.680 --> 32:32.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The principal investigator of
the mission
is Scott Bolton, and he fills us
in on some

32:32.818 --> 32:34.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the big questions.

32:34.719 --> 32:38.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT BOLTON, NASA: The major
science objectives
of Juno are, one, to understand
how Jupiter

32:38.323 --> 32:44.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
formed and what is it made out
of. We want
the recipe of solar systems, and
we are at

32:44.229 --> 32:46.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the ingredient list level.

32:46.364 --> 32:51.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So we're gathering the
ingredient list and
understanding how Jupiter is
structured. So

32:51.837 --> 32:56.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the most important objectives
are understanding
Jupiter's formation and how that
relates to

32:56.975 --> 32:59.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the formation of other planets,
including
us

32:59.044 --> 33:03.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, if Juno
isn't landing
on Jupiter, how is it going to
see beneath

33:03.415 --> 33:05.250 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the surface?

33:05.283 --> 33:07.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It's not so easy,
is it? You're
talking about, first of all, a
very hazardous

33:07.853 --> 33:09.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
place to do business, if you
will.

33:09.988 --> 33:14.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the key is, they to
understand things
about, for example, the magnetic
fields. They're

33:14.993 --> 33:20.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
using things like magnetometers.
They're using
microwave detection capability
which will

33:20.065 --> 33:24.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be able to see beneath the
clouds and sort
of identify the composition of
what lies beneath

33:24.736 --> 33:31.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the clouds, spectrometers, a
device which
actually measure the
gravitational pull from

33:31.509 --> 33:36.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the planet itself on the
spacecraft, and will
be able to give scientists on
the ground exactly

33:36.748 --> 33:38.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how strong it is at any given
point.

33:38.950 --> 33:46.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, you can imagine, this is
the closest
orbit ever to Jupiter. This will
be a 14-day

33:46.057 --> 33:50.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
orbit once it gets into its
science mode,
and building devices that are
able to gather

33:51.029 --> 33:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things on things like radiation,
which are
important, but which, of course,
are very

33:55.433 --> 33:58.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hazardous to the spacecraft
itself, is difficult.

33:58.169 --> 34:03.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they built a titanium box
with has just
enough shielding to protect the
instruments

34:03.208 --> 34:08.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and yet allow the data to come
in. One of
the main people on the team is
the deputy

34:08.079 --> 34:09.848 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
chief engineer, Tracy Drain.

34:09.881 --> 34:13.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACY DRAIN, NASA: If you want
to pick, aside
from the sun, the scariest
environments we

34:13.985 --> 34:19.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know of to send a spacecraft to,
Jupiter would
be the place to go, because
Jupiter has this

34:19.991 --> 34:25.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gigantic magnetic field, which
traps a lot
of charged particles that get
accelerated

34:25.297 --> 34:27.198 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
along the magnetic field lines.

34:27.232 --> 34:32.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It builds up this huge radiation
field. If
we were to leave our spacecraft
bathing in

34:32.537 --> 34:37.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that radiation, it's just not
designed to
deal with that. So we are going
to go through

34:37.575 --> 34:41.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the radiation belts to get into
orbit and
then we will going in and out of
the radiation

34:41.780 --> 34:43.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
belts as we do our science
phase.

34:43.848 --> 34:46.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, Monday is
the big day.
What are we actually going to
see? What's

34:47.018 --> 34:48.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going to happen Monday?

34:48.820 --> 34:53.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: It's the
denouement to a story
which began five years ago with
a launch.

34:53.291 --> 34:59.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It launched in August of 2011,
on its way,
traveling more than a billion
miles in space,

34:59.364 --> 35:03.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
making its way toward Jupiter,
unfurling these
giant solar arrays, the biggest
arrays to

35:03.735 --> 35:08.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ever to go on a deep space
probe. There's
only 4 percent of the sun's
power at Jupiter

35:08.473 --> 35:09.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
relative to what we have here.

35:09.774 --> 35:11.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It's that dim
out there?

35:11.576 --> 35:14.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It's that dim
that they had
to build these giant arrays.
Those have been

35:14.679 --> 35:17.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spread and they're operating
just fine.

35:17.248 --> 35:22.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's traveling now, as it
speeds up toward
Jupiter, being captured by the
gravity, at

35:22.053 --> 35:27.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than 153,000 miles an hour,
making it
one of the fastest manmade
objects ever. So,

35:27.125 --> 35:32.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the trick will be reducing that
speed enough
so that it doesn't just whiz by
the planet,

35:32.364 --> 35:34.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like some of those other probes
we talked
about.

35:34.132 --> 35:37.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it will turn its rocket in
the opposite
direction, sort of the reverse
direction,

35:37.869 --> 35:42.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fire it for about 35 minutes.
And that should
slow it down just enough for
Jupiter to pull

35:43.008 --> 35:47.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it into its grasp. And that will
be a nail-biting
moment for the folks at the Jet
Propulsion

35:47.679 --> 35:53.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lab in Pasadena, California, as
they wait
to hear, subsequent to all that
happening

35:53.218 --> 35:55.020 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- this is all on autopilot.

35:55.053 --> 35:58.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's nothing they can do to
make this happen
or not happen. It will either
happen or it

35:58.356 --> 36:04.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
won't. It's kind of the die is
cast. They
will get, like, a three-second
beep, and that

36:04.062 --> 36:07.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will be it. And that will be the
best beep
these guys have ever heard,
hopefully.

36:07.465 --> 36:11.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the mission begins. The
scientific
mission ultimately will begin
toward the fall

36:11.669 --> 36:17.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with 14-day orbits lasting for
about 16 months.
And then, when they're done with
Juno, Juno

36:17.142 --> 36:20.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will dive right into Jupiter and
have a fiery
conclusion.

36:20.812 --> 36:23.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Are we going
to see images
coming back from Juno?

36:23.815 --> 36:28.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It's not an
imagery mission
for the scientists, per se. All
the data they

36:28.186 --> 36:31.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want is more on the squiggly
lines, if you
will.

36:31.589 --> 36:35.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, there is a camera on
board. It's
designed primarily for public
affairs. And

36:35.994 --> 36:40.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the imagery should be
interesting for us,
because the orbit of Juno is
polar. And we

36:40.465 --> 36:45.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really haven't had a good look
at the poles
of Jupiter. And in particular,
one of the

36:45.737 --> 36:50.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scientific goals here is to
understand their
amazing auroras, which are much
stronger than

36:50.041 --> 36:51.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we have here on Earth.

36:51.476 --> 36:53.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, we
will be watching
on the Fourth of July.

36:53.711 --> 36:56.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Miles O'Brien, thank you so
much.

36:56.081 --> 37:03.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: You're welcome,
William.

37:03.455 --> 37:10.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Summer
Olympics are less
than six weeks away. And even
for the usual

37:10.628 --> 37:16.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drama and tension that often
precedes the
Games, the road to Rio has been
especially

37:16.267 --> 37:17.168 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rocky.

37:17.202 --> 37:18.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang has that story.

37:19.003 --> 37:23.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: For most Olympic host
cities, the
usual concern is whether all the
venues will

37:23.041 --> 37:28.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be ready on time. But Rio
presents other worries,
like security and crime.

37:28.446 --> 37:33.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier today, parts of a body
washed up on
Copacabana Beach. There's the
Zika virus outbreak

37:33.585 --> 37:38.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and whether it poses risks to
athletes and
visitors, and the state of a
heavily polluted

37:38.223 --> 37:41.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
bay where some of the
competition will take
place.

37:41.192 --> 37:47.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier this week, I sat down
with Sidney
Levy, the CEO of Rio's Olympic
Organizing

37:47.232 --> 37:48.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Committee.

37:48.733 --> 37:50.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Sidney Levy, welcome.

37:50.568 --> 37:57.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the Olympics were awarded
in 2009, things
were very different in Brazil
and in Rio.

37:57.075 --> 38:03.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What assurances can you give the
athletes,
the spectators, the broadcasters
around the

38:03.948 --> 38:08.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world who are going to be
watching this that
things will be ready to go in
less than six

38:08.887 --> 38:10.421 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weeks?

38:10.455 --> 38:12.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SIDNEY LEVY, CEO, Rio 2016
Olympic Organizing
Committee: Well, we are ready.

38:12.323 --> 38:17.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why are we ready? Because we
have been working
hard for seven years. We have
thousands of

38:17.395 --> 38:23.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people working. We spent a lot
of money. And
we put all the resources, all
the creativity

38:23.067 --> 38:28.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have to deliver great Games,
and that's
a commitment for the people to
do that and

38:28.940 --> 38:32.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the country. We are doing
this for the
people of our country.

38:32.076 --> 38:34.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: You say you're ready,
you have
been working hard, but there are
a lot of

38:35.013 --> 38:38.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
challenges that are still there,
for instance,
the Zika virus.

38:38.483 --> 38:44.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have got just recently Rory
McIlroy, one
of the world's top golfers,
saying he's not

38:44.289 --> 38:50.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to go. You have got other
athletes who
are expressing concern about
going for various

38:50.161 --> 38:55.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reasons. What assurances can you
give them
that it's not going to be a
problem?

38:55.900 --> 39:01.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIDNEY LEVY: Well, the World
Health Organization
issued a study stating very
clearly that the

39:01.973 --> 39:06.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Zika virus is not a threat
during the winter
months.

39:06.477 --> 39:12.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brazil just entered the winter
now. So, the
mosquitoes, they die during the
winter. It's

39:12.617 --> 39:19.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a proved thing. So we now have
-- for example,
I have 4,000 people working for
me in the

39:19.290 --> 39:25.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
streets of Rio, in the beaches,
in the parks,
in T-shirts, not a single case
of virus, of

39:25.396 --> 39:27.131 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Zika today.

39:27.165 --> 39:31.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But how do you -- the
concern is
still there. You say it's not
the mosquito

39:31.269 --> 39:34.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
season. You say it's the winter.
But the concern
is still there.

39:34.505 --> 39:39.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIDNEY LEVY: Well, but I have a
friend of
mine who went to Rio the other
day in long

39:39.978 --> 39:46.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sleeves with the hat, put the
spray on, and
went down to the beach. And
there is thousands

39:46.384 --> 39:50.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of people in the beach naked, as
Brazilians
go to the beach naked.

39:50.822 --> 39:56.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not a single worry. So we're not
feeling that.
We're seeing that the rest of
the world is

39:56.094 --> 40:01.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much more vocal about that. But
we, who are
living there, we're not being
threatened by

40:01.633 --> 40:08.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Zika. And so we think this
is a little
bit out of proportion. And it's
one athlete.

40:08.072 --> 40:11.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have 11,000 athletes
confirmed for
Rio.

40:11.209 --> 40:17.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Huge questions about
who's actually
going to be in the Games,
whether Russia will

40:17.415 --> 40:22.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a track and field team or
not. What cloud
does that put over the Olympics?

40:22.553 --> 40:27.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SIDNEY LEVY: The commitment is
for clean Games.
We need to deliver clean Games.

40:27.392 --> 40:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to have zero tolerance
for doping.
So Brazil built a lab, a
brand-new lab, and

40:34.799 --> 40:40.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we brought people in. People
were tested.
Didn't work well, the first
test. We are,

40:40.672 --> 40:47.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in fact, today, bringing
international experts
to supervisor our work. So we
are pretty committed

40:47.211 --> 40:49.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to deliver clean Games, and
that's what we're
going to do.

40:49.247 --> 40:52.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But that lab has been
suspended
by the Anti-Doping Agency.

40:52.583 --> 40:59.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIDNEY LEVY: Because the people
we brought
in didn't pass the first test.
So we're bringing

40:59.157 --> 41:01.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in international supervision
right now.

41:01.059 --> 41:06.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Talk about clean
Games, concern
about clean water in the bay,
where the sailing

41:06.864 --> 41:10.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
events are going to be, I think
some rowing
events are going to be.

41:10.168 --> 41:13.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government said it was going
to clean
it up. We just had a reporting
team down there

41:13.471 --> 41:17.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looking at it. It's still -- in
the pictures
that we have brought back, still
raw sewage

41:18.009 --> 41:24.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still being dumped into that
bay. I think
one health expert said that
three teaspoons

41:24.549 --> 41:31.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of water, exposure to three
teaspoons of water,
99 percent risk of infection, of
illness.

41:31.689 --> 41:37.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
How can you reassure the
competitors who are
going to be in that water that
they're going

41:37.328 --> 41:38.963 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be safe?

41:38.996 --> 41:45.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIDNEY LEVY: We run test events.
We ran in
2014, 2015, where we exposed 350
athletes

41:45.970 --> 41:50.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the same bay. So we ran
those. Nobody got
sick.

41:50.808 --> 41:56.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have five competition areas
around the
bay. We are tracking them every
day. Four

41:56.180 --> 42:02.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are clean. We -- some days yes,
some days
no. If that doesn't work, closer
to the Games,

42:02.887 --> 42:06.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we are going to change the area
where the
competition goes.

42:06.324 --> 42:11.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The further away you go, the
cleaner they
are. So that's what they are
going to do to

42:11.496 --> 42:13.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
assure a clean competition.

42:13.331 --> 42:19.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: So you may have to
move some events
to other parts of the bay in
order to get

42:19.203 --> 42:20.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- in order to hit clean water?

42:20.638 --> 42:22.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SIDNEY LEVY: Yes. Absolutely, we
have to move.

42:22.173 --> 42:27.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: We have less than a
minute left.
What's keeping you up at night?

42:27.345 --> 42:28.479 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:28.513 --> 42:31.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SIDNEY LEVY: Very tough job.
It's a very tough
job.

42:31.716 --> 42:38.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the combination of all
that. I'm sure
certain things won't go right,
but they need

42:38.256 --> 42:47.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be small. So how to keep
everybody working
together -- there's 300,000
people working

42:47.465 --> 42:54.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
together to deliver the Games,
between contractors
and -- so how to operate that in
a seamless

42:54.939 --> 42:58.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fashion, in peace, and it's a
very tough job.

42:58.943 --> 43:01.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But no single issue
is -- no big
issue?

43:01.045 --> 43:03.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SIDNEY LEVY: No, I don't have a
single issue.

43:03.681 --> 43:09.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm pretty confident,
because I think
this is a unique opportunity.
The Olympic

43:09.353 --> 43:15.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Games is a wonderful thing. It's
a peace movement.
It's where Israelis and
Palestinians have

43:15.259 --> 43:18.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
breakfast at the same table, so
it's a very
good thing.

43:18.529 --> 43:24.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rio is a wonderful city. The
people are very
warm. The nature is wonderful.
These two things

43:24.502 --> 43:30.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
together, it's once in a
lifetime. It won't
be repeated so soon. So, I hope
people come

43:30.775 --> 43:31.943 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and enjoy.

43:31.976 --> 43:33.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: We will see in six
weeks how it
all goes.

43:33.744 --> 43:34.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SIDNEY LEVY: Thank you.

43:34.879 --> 43:37.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Sidney Levy, thanks
for being with
us.

43:37.482 --> 43:44.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SIDNEY LEVY: Thank you.

43:44.922 --> 43:52.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
we add another
book to our summer reading list.

43:52.263 --> 43:57.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a modern take on what we
can learn from
tribal societies when it comes
to loyalty,

43:57.902 --> 43:59.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
belonging and the quest for
meaning.

44:00.004 --> 44:05.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the recent BookExpo America
in Chicago,
Jeffrey Brown talked to
journalist and author

44:05.142 --> 44:10.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sebastian Junger. His new book
is "Tribe:
On Homecoming and Belonging."

44:10.548 --> 44:13.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Start with the
definition.
What do you mean by tribe?

44:13.784 --> 44:16.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER, Author,
"Tribe: On Homecoming
and Belonging": The real an
ancient meaning

44:16.287 --> 44:21.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of tribe is the community that
you live in
that you share resources with
that you would

44:21.959 --> 44:23.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
risk your life to defend.

44:23.761 --> 44:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, that's the real meaning
of tribe.
Of course, in modern society,
that structure,

44:29.166 --> 44:33.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that tribal structure has been
lost. That
loss of tribe also costs people
psychologically.

44:33.437 --> 44:38.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Did this grow
specifically
out of your work as a war
reporter or...

44:38.809 --> 44:41.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Well, there
was this puzzling
thing that I noticed.

44:41.946 --> 44:45.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of the soldiers that I was
with -- and
I was at a remote outpost called
Restrepo.

44:45.850 --> 44:47.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

44:47.718 --> 44:50.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: It was a
20-man position,
everyone sleeping basically
shoulder to shoulder

44:50.121 --> 44:52.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the dirt at first and then in
these little
hooches.

44:52.957 --> 44:59.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was very intimate, very
close, very
connected, emotionally connected
experience.

44:59.230 --> 45:03.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And after the deployment, which
was -- the
deployment was hellish. And
afterward the

45:03.200 --> 45:09.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deployment, a lot of those guys
missed the
combat and they didn't want to
come home to

45:09.574 --> 45:11.342 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
America.

45:11.375 --> 45:14.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is it about modern society
that's so
repellent even to people that
are from there?

45:14.979 --> 45:17.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And my book "Tribe" is an
attempt to answer
that question.

45:17.548 --> 45:22.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, tribe can be
any kind of
community? Does it have to be a
certain size?

45:22.687 --> 45:26.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does it have to be -- how
organized does it
have to be?

45:26.057 --> 45:32.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Well, humans
lose the ability
to connect emotionally with
people after a

45:32.263 --> 45:34.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
certain number, right at 150.

45:34.498 --> 45:39.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there is a limit to the
number of people
we can connect with and that we
can feel capable

45:39.770 --> 45:42.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of sacrificing ourselves for if
need be.

45:42.139 --> 45:47.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What happens,
though, when
you're a member of a larger
corporation, a

45:47.912 --> 45:50.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
larger town, a larger -- a
religious group?

45:50.114 --> 45:54.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: I think the
reason those
things feel good is because they
come close

45:54.952 --> 46:00.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enough to replicating the
connections of tribe
that it's sort of familiar in
human terms.

46:00.257 --> 46:07.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're not tribes. Tribes,
really, you have
to live with the people in your
tribe for

46:07.732 --> 46:13.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it to be a tribe in the sort of
ancient sense.
Now, what happens when society
experiences

46:13.170 --> 46:16.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a collapse, like the Blitz in
London or an
earthquake or something like
that, is that

46:16.540 --> 46:21.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people are forced into communal
situations
with each other in order to
survive.

46:21.646 --> 46:25.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So you're looking
at our society
and seeing an affluence and
seeing -- but

46:25.950 --> 46:27.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
seeing a kind of a
disconnection?

46:27.752 --> 46:31.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Well, the
irony of modern
society, for all of its very
real benefits

46:31.789 --> 46:37.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- I mean, modern society is a
miracle in
a lot of ways, right? But as
affluence goes

46:37.862 --> 46:41.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up in a society, the suicide
rate tends to
go up, not down.

46:41.899 --> 46:52.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As affluence goes up in a
society, the depression
rate goes up. When a crisis
hits, then people's

46:52.043 --> 46:56.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
psychological health starts to
improve. After
9/11 in New York City -- I live
in New York

46:56.580 --> 47:02.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- and after 9/11, the suicide
rate went down
in New York, not up. It went
down. It improved.

47:02.820 --> 47:08.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Violent crime went down. Murder
went down.
There was a sense of everyone
needs each other.

47:08.059 --> 47:13.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And once you're called to serve
your community,
in some way, you sort of forget
your own problems.

47:13.798 --> 47:20.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What's your sense
of how technology
changes -- the Internet? Much
discussion about

47:20.204 --> 47:24.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the communities that can form,
small communities
that can form on the Internet.
In some ways,

47:24.809 --> 47:28.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we lose a sense of a larger
community, but
we have these niche communities.

47:28.179 --> 47:31.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: I don't talk
about the Internet
in my book.

47:31.315 --> 47:33.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

47:33.150 --> 47:38.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: But they are
communities
only in the most abstract and
unhuman sense.

47:38.756 --> 47:40.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So that's not
enough?

47:40.357 --> 47:42.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: It's not
enough.

47:42.126 --> 47:45.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, actually, I would say the
Internet is
doubly dangerous for all -- and,
again, for

47:45.763 --> 47:52.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all of its miraculous capacity,
not only does
it not provide real community
and real human

47:52.670 --> 47:57.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
connection. It gives you the
illusion that
it does, right?

47:57.742 --> 48:05.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, oh, I have got lots of
friends on Facebook,
so I'm good. You're actually not
good. And

48:05.816 --> 48:10.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not an expert in this, but
from what I
studied for my book "Tribe,"
what you need

48:11.021 --> 48:14.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is to feel people, smell them,
hear them,
feel them around you.

48:14.925 --> 48:18.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, that's the human
connection that we
evolved for, for hundreds of
thousands of

48:18.729 --> 48:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years. The Internet doesn't
provide that.

48:21.999 --> 48:25.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We talk about
things having
broken down in Washington.

48:25.236 --> 48:26.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Right.

48:26.504 --> 48:28.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And we're
watching a political
campaign. Right?

48:28.038 --> 48:28.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Right.

48:29.006 --> 48:30.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Very much us
against them.

48:30.775 --> 48:32.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Right.

48:32.643 --> 48:37.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Does the notion
of tribes allow
us to have a cohesion that we
also think we

48:37.481 --> 48:38.449 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
need as a country?

48:38.482 --> 48:40.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yes, it's a
great question.

48:40.918 --> 48:45.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what you're seeing in
this political
season are political camps
deciding that they

48:45.422 --> 48:52.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are their own tribe and it's us
against them.
And I think the trick -- and
this country

48:52.363 --> 48:58.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is in a very, very tricky place
socially,
economically, politically -- I
think the trick,

48:58.636 --> 49:03.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you want to be a functioning
country, a
nation, a viable nation, you
have to define

49:04.008 --> 49:09.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tribe to include the entire
country, even
people you disagree with.

49:09.180 --> 49:12.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Disagreement is great, debate is
great, conflict
is great. It's how we all get
better.

49:12.716 --> 49:14.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

49:14.451 --> 49:18.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: What you can't
do is have
contempt for your fellow
citizens. That is

49:18.589 --> 49:20.424 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
destructive.

49:20.457 --> 49:24.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No soldier in a trench in a
platoon in combat
would have contempt for their
trench mate.

49:24.595 --> 49:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They might not like them. They
disagree with
them, but you don't have
contempt for someone

49:29.400 --> 49:34.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that your life depends on. And
that's what
we're falling into in the
political dialogue

49:34.071 --> 49:38.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this country. And in my
opinion, that is
more dangerous to this country
than ISIS is,

49:38.542 --> 49:41.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean literally like more of a
threat to
our nation.

49:41.078 --> 49:44.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But as the tribe
increases,
the hard -- cohesion gets
harder, right?

49:44.348 --> 49:45.983 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Absolutely.

49:46.016 --> 49:48.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, no one is saying this is
going to
be easy, but you do have -- to
understand

49:48.752 --> 49:53.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the task, you have to understand
your origins.
You have to understand why
humans are the

49:53.457 --> 49:56.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way we are and what the cost of
modern society
has been.

49:56.894 --> 50:00.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once you understand -- and
that's what my
book tries to explain. Once you
understand

50:00.531 --> 50:07.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, it's going to be much
easier to devise,
to jerry-rig a new solution to a
new problem.

50:07.471 --> 50:13.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, did all this
make you think
which tribes you belong to or
your own tribe?

50:13.377 --> 50:18.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: I mean, sadly,
I grew up
in the -- in the loneliest place
in the world,

50:18.349 --> 50:20.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an American suburb.

50:20.150 --> 50:24.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, I wish I had a tribe. We
don't. We just
don't. That's the problem.
That's why our

50:24.321 --> 50:29.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
depression rate, our suicide
rate, all that
stuff is through the roof.
That's the tragedy

50:29.460 --> 50:30.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of modern society.

50:30.661 --> 50:33.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Short of a Blitz
or short of
a 9/11...

50:33.664 --> 50:35.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Right, the
apocalypse, right.

50:35.633 --> 50:39.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, what do
people do in their
daily life to find that?

50:39.036 --> 50:44.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Well, I think
if you try
to -- if you imagine your life
in terms of

50:44.108 --> 50:49.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the community you live in, and
you try to
connect personally to the people
in your community,

50:49.647 --> 50:54.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even though you drive 40 miles
away to go
to work, I think that's
enormously beneficial

50:54.351 --> 50:55.886 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and therapeutic.

50:55.920 --> 50:59.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, the
book is "Tribe:
On Homecoming and Belonging."

50:59.390 --> 51:00.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sebastian Junger, thank you very
much.

51:00.724 --> 51:02.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Thank you very
much.

51:02.459 --> 51:07.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can watch
many more

Also online, a renaissance in
American cities
has helped move the American
dream from suburbia,

51:21.545 --> 51:26.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which we just heard about, to
the urban center.
That's said by one of our Making
Sense columnists.

51:26.350 --> 51:29.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Take a closer look at what's
driving the boom.

51:29.219 --> 51:33.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web

51:39.630 --> 51:44.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vote is already affecting global
alliances
and relationships.

51:44.668 --> 51:46.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening. For all of us at the
"PBS NewsHour,"

thank you, and good night.

52:04.855 --> 52:09.326 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.
