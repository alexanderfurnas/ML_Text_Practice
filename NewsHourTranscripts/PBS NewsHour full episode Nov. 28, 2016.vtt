Then, as Cubans mourn the death of communist

00:22.189 --> 00:27.261 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
between U.S. and Cuba could change under a
Trump presidency.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.429 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%

are aware of, but many of these do catch on

fire.

Buckle up.

where election officials approved a recount.

01:17.911 --> 01:24.284 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In less than a week, Green Party nominee Jill

01:24.384 --> 01:30.524 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in Wisconsin, in Pennsylvania, where Stein
filed paperwork today, and in Michigan, which

JILL STEIN, Green Party Presidential Candidate:
I don't think that's likely, and this is not

01:46.540 --> 01:49.643 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
being done to benefit one candidate at the
expense of the other.

01:49.743 --> 01:53.714 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN YANG: The president-elect made his own
election claim, tweeting that millions of

01:53.814 --> 01:57.317 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
people voted illegally, but offered no evidence.

01:57.417 --> 02:00.354 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Today, the focus was on the transition.

feel betrayed to think that Governor Romney,

02:19.406 --> 02:25.679 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
who went out of his way to question the character
and the intellect and the integrity of Donald

02:25.779 --> 02:30.684 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Trump, now our president-elect, would be given
the most prominent Cabinet post of all, secretary

02:30.784 --> 02:32.119 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of state.

In the day's other news: Russia's Defense
Ministry estimates that the Syrian regime

02:39.559 --> 02:46.867 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
forces now control about 40 percent of rebel-held

a memorial for the man who ruled their countryfor nearly half-a-century.

03:19.933 --> 03:25.505 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We will have more on Castro's death and what
it may mean for Cuba's future later in the

03:25.605 --> 03:27.541 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
program.

03:27.641 --> 03:32.946 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Back in this country, a knife-wielding attacker
wounded at least 11 people at Ohio State University

in Columbus.

03:34.548 --> 03:37.918 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Authorities said the man was a student there
and of Somali descent.

03:38.018 --> 03:43.356 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He rammed his car into a crowd, and then stabbed
people with a butcher knife, before being

03:43.457 --> 03:45.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
shot dead by police.

03:45.659 --> 03:50.530 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Dozens of officers rushed to the scene, while

03:50.630 --> 03:52.265 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
on lockdown for several hours.

03:52.365 --> 03:54.167 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

03:54.267 --> 03:55.402 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MICHAEL DRAKE, President, Ohio State University:
We don't know anything that would link this

03:55.502 --> 03:56.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to any community.

03:56.970 --> 03:59.039 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We certainly don't any evidence that would
say that is the case.

03:59.139 --> 04:04.778 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And what we want to do is really unify together,
support each other, do our best to support

04:04.878 --> 04:08.748 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
those who were injured in their recovery,
and then allow the investigation to take place.

04:08.849 --> 04:13.753 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN YANG: Police are now investigating the
suspect's motive, including whether it was

04:13.854 --> 04:15.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an act of terrorism.

04:15.755 --> 04:19.759 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The suspect in the Charleston church shooting
will be allowed to represent himself at his

trial.

04:21.194 --> 04:23.630 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Dylann Roof made that request, against his
lawyers' advice.

04:23.730 --> 04:27.734 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The trial judge granted it, but called Roof's
decision unwise.

04:27.834 --> 04:32.172 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The 22-year-old is accused of killing nineblack parishioners last year.

penalty.

04:38.612 --> 04:43.783 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%

the post-election market rally appeared to

04:43.884 --> 04:45.385 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ease.

04:45.485 --> 04:50.590 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 54 pointsto close just under 19098.

The Nasdaq fell 30 points, and the S&amp;P 500
slipped 11.

04:54.661 --> 04:59.900 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Still to come on the "NewsHour": a look at
president-elect Trump's business interests

04:60.000 --> 05:06.339 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
across the globe; our Politics Monday team
on the pending election recount; France moves

05:06.439 --> 05:12.746 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to the right in its own presidential contest;
and much more.

05:12.846 --> 05:26.526 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Next, to a closer look at president-elect
Trump's business interests and potential conflicts

05:26.626 --> 05:29.029 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
that may arise when he takes office.

05:29.129 --> 05:30.630 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
William Brangham has more -- William.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.766 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Thanks, John.

05:32.866 --> 05:38.572 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Indeed, many analysts believe we are in unprecedented
territory here, where a man with active financial

05:38.672 --> 05:43.410 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
dealings in at least 20 different countries
is about to become president of the United

05:43.510 --> 05:45.278 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

05:45.378 --> 05:48.114 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The New York Times just did a deep dive into
Donald Trump's global businesses and how it

05:48.215 --> 05:50.450 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
could intersect with his presidency.

05:50.550 --> 05:54.221 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Eric Lipton is one of the reporters on thatstory, and he joins me now.

05:54.321 --> 05:56.456 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Eric Lipton, thank you very much for being
here.

05:56.556 --> 06:00.193 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
I mentioned this term unprecedented.

06:00.293 --> 06:04.264 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Is that a fair characterization, in your mind,
where we have a businessman who is so well

06:04.364 --> 06:07.434 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
connected in so many nations moving into the
White House?

06:07.534 --> 06:09.436 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
ERIC LIPTON, The New York Times: I think so.

06:09.536 --> 06:12.973 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
I have spoken with quite a number of presidential
historians who say that they see nothing like

06:13.073 --> 06:14.908 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
this in American history.

06:15.008 --> 06:19.179 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And it's not just the assets he owns, because
the list of properties that he owns 100 percent

06:19.279 --> 06:23.850 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
is not that huge, but it's the relationships
that he has with businesses globally through

06:23.950 --> 06:28.622 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
branding arrangements in which he is paid
a fee or a commission for those deals.

06:28.722 --> 06:33.093 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And so he still has a financial relationship
and business partners in many countries, particular

06:33.193 --> 06:35.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the developing world.

06:35.228 --> 06:39.833 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
And the concern, I think, is more in the developing
world, where you have a history of oftentimes

06:39.933 --> 06:43.670 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
corners being cut to powerful people with
economic interests.

06:43.770 --> 06:46.973 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That's where the real problem is, less so
in like Western Europe, for example.

06:47.073 --> 06:50.877 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Well, let's talk about -- before
we get into the details of some of the countries

06:50.977 --> 06:56.383 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
specifically, broadly speaking, what do you
see as the main conflicts of interests here?

06:56.483 --> 06:57.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's the problem?

06:57.584 --> 07:01.421 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
ERIC LIPTON: To me, there's two primary things.

07:01.521 --> 07:05.158 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
One is sort of a broad thing, which is that
the United States for decades has played a

07:05.258 --> 07:12.532 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
leading role globally to try to encourage
nations to separate their political from economic

07:12.632 --> 07:17.871 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
power, so that there is greater transparency,
that everyone has an equal shots at contracts,

07:17.971 --> 07:21.641 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and that there aren't payments for permits
or contracts.

07:21.741 --> 07:25.945 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It's been something that both Democrats and
Republicans have really rallied and pressured

07:26.046 --> 07:27.180 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
other foreign governments.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.149 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
There is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

07:29.249 --> 07:32.118 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
There's been all kinds of prosecutions of
companies that have been involved in any type

07:32.218 --> 07:34.120 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of a payment to get a contract.

07:34.220 --> 07:37.691 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And the United States has been a preacher
on this.

07:37.791 --> 07:42.095 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And the fact now that you have a president
who is mixing the financial matters with the

07:42.195 --> 07:46.599 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
political matters and that his business interests
are going to overlap with U.S. foreign policy

07:46.700 --> 07:52.005 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
really undermines that message that the United
States has worked so hard across bipartisanly.

07:52.105 --> 07:59.412 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The second thing is that no matter how ethical
the Trump family is and President Trump himself,

07:59.512 --> 08:05.018 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
there is going to be intense pressure on officials
in these foreign places to do things for him

08:05.118 --> 08:10.757 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
even if he doesn't ask for it in a way to
try to impress President Trump or his administration

08:10.857 --> 08:12.859 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
or the White House to get some type of special
treatment.

08:12.959 --> 08:18.465 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They may not succeed in that, but there is
an incentive for them to accelerate a permit,

08:18.565 --> 08:23.436 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to grant access to a piece of land that he
really wants that's going to help his company,

08:23.536 --> 08:27.440 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to buy memberships at a golf club, to do various
things.

08:27.540 --> 08:31.644 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Now, he says, well, how can you blame me if
people are doing things I don't ask them for?

08:31.745 --> 08:35.782 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But he and his family potentially are going
to be enriched by these favors that will be

08:35.882 --> 08:38.251 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
granted to them, even if they don't request
it.

08:38.351 --> 08:42.322 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And so even if they're completely moral, given
that there's these relationships, it seems

08:42.422 --> 08:44.224 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
like it could present a problem.

08:44.324 --> 08:48.061 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You document so many different
interesting examples of where these possible

08:48.161 --> 08:49.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
conflicts could arise.

08:49.562 --> 08:52.232 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Let's talk about one of them, specifically
the Philippines.

08:52.332 --> 08:55.235 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In your piece, you introduce us to man named
Jose E.B.

08:55.335 --> 08:56.503 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Antonio.

08:56.603 --> 08:58.671 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Who is he and why is he important in this
story?

08:58.772 --> 09:02.776 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ERIC LIPTON: So, he is essentially the brand
representative for the Trump family in the

09:02.876 --> 09:04.644 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Philippines.

09:04.744 --> 09:07.547 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Often, when they have major projects in certain
countries, they have essentially a person

09:07.647 --> 09:10.750 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
who helps represent their whole business enterprise
there.

09:10.850 --> 09:16.523 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So he is in charge of building a major new
skyscraper in -- and outside Manila.

09:16.623 --> 09:21.861 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So he is -- but the problem for Donald Trump
and for these questions about potential conflicts

09:21.961 --> 09:27.066 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
is that he was recently appointed by the president
of the Philippines to simultaneously serve

09:27.167 --> 09:29.969 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
as the Philippines' envoy to the United States.

09:30.069 --> 09:34.741 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So here you have a guy who is the partner,
business partner of Donald Trump, and the

09:34.841 --> 09:39.245 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
government official that is helping represent
the government of the Philippines in its relationship

09:39.345 --> 09:41.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with the United States.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.616 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And the Philippines' relationship with the
United States is a very complicated one right

09:43.716 --> 09:45.552 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

09:45.652 --> 09:50.256 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
You have got a president who's ordered essentially
the extrajudicial killing of drug dealers

09:50.356 --> 09:52.358 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
in that country to try to crack down on crime.

09:52.459 --> 09:56.229 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And, again, you certainly want drug dealers
to be arrested, taken of the streets, but

09:56.329 --> 09:58.798 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
you don't and go kill them before they have
a trial.

09:58.898 --> 10:03.570 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
The State Department has been incredibly critical
of what's been happening in the Philippines

10:03.670 --> 10:08.508 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
with respect to these people simply[ being
shot down and killed on the streets.

10:08.608 --> 10:13.112 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
And what's going to happen when you have President
Trump, where his business partner is an official

10:13.213 --> 10:15.582 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
in the government of the Philippines?

10:15.682 --> 10:20.220 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Is Trump still going to be as willing to potentially
alienate his business partner and complicate

10:20.320 --> 10:23.490 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
his business deals in the Philippines and
challenge the government of the Philippines?

10:23.590 --> 10:25.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's an open question.

10:25.191 --> 10:27.560 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But at least in the back of his head, youwonder, will that be a factor?

10:27.660 --> 10:31.731 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Will that influence foreign policy becausehe's a business associate there?

10:31.831 --> 10:34.400 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It seems like, how's that not going to be
a factor?

10:34.501 --> 10:37.670 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, Eric Lipton of
The New York Times, really incredible piece

10:37.770 --> 10:39.038 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of reporting.

10:39.138 --> 10:40.607 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And there's many more examples in the story
that you ran.

10:40.707 --> 10:42.542 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They can find that on The New York Times Web
site.

10:42.642 --> 10:46.012 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Thank you so much for the reporting and thanks
for being here.

10:46.112 --> 10:53.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ERIC LIPTON: Thank you.

10:53.152 --> 10:58.758 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
JOHN YANG: Time now for Politics Monday.

10:58.858 --> 11:03.229 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Here to discuss the latest developments, Amy
Walter of The Cook Political Report and Tamara

11:03.329 --> 11:05.532 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Keith of NPR.

11:05.632 --> 11:06.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

11:07.066 --> 11:09.636 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
For two weeks, no one questioned the outcome
of this election.

11:09.736 --> 11:14.007 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Now, all of a sudden, we have got recounts
Jill Stein wants, even though she says she

11:14.107 --> 11:18.278 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
doesn't think it will change the outcome,
and now president-elect Trump is saying that

11:18.378 --> 11:23.650 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
there were millions of illegitimate votes,
even though he doesn't offer us any evidence.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tam, what's going on?

11:25.351 --> 11:27.720 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public Radio: And he'snot disputing that he won.

11:27.820 --> 11:33.059 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He's just saying, maybe I would have won the
popular vote, too.

11:33.159 --> 11:37.096 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So I was on a call this morning with the Trump
transition team.

11:37.196 --> 11:43.836 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I asked them for evidence, like actual evidence,of millions of illegal votes.

11:43.937 --> 11:47.273 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Or also he was claiming election fraud in
three states.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.208 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Where is the evidence in those states?

11:49.309 --> 11:57.650 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
What they presented was a report, study from
2014 that has been thoroughly debunked.

11:57.750 --> 12:03.823 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And they also presented a Pew Research Study
that was about voter rolls and housekeeping

12:03.923 --> 12:05.258 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
that could be done in voter rolls.

12:05.358 --> 12:09.596 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Neither of those things point to widespread
voter fraud in 2016.

12:09.696 --> 12:17.170 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So his transition team has been unable to
offer any evidence of what is clearly nonexistent

12:17.270 --> 12:19.005 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
voter fraud that they're talking about.

12:19.105 --> 12:23.276 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And Jill Stein, for that matter, hasn't been
able to offer any evidence of voter fraud.

12:23.376 --> 12:27.981 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
It's more like, this happened, and this happened,
and this happened, so we should look into

12:28.081 --> 12:29.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it, is all she's saying.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.783 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political Report: Right.

12:30.883 --> 12:33.553 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And that goes to, I think, heart of matter
here, which is, you have two people.

12:33.653 --> 12:35.521 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
One is the president of the United States.

12:35.622 --> 12:40.627 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
The other is a Green Party candidate who obviously
didn't win many votes, both suggesting that

12:40.727 --> 12:47.800 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the voting system itself is illegitimate or
rigged without any proof of this.

12:47.900 --> 12:52.138 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Jill Stein's case is that maybe it's been
hacked by foreign influencers, Russia, for

12:52.238 --> 12:53.139 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
example.

12:53.239 --> 12:55.041 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
That is a big charge to make.

12:55.141 --> 13:01.514 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And when you undermine our voting process,
you are undermining the cornerstone of our

13:01.614 --> 13:02.515 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
democracy.

13:02.615 --> 13:03.983 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

13:04.083 --> 13:06.185 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
People trust that their votes are going to
be counted correctly.

13:06.285 --> 13:10.323 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And then you also delegitimize winners of
every election, whether you're voting for

13:10.423 --> 13:12.125 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
president or city council or whatever it is.

13:12.225 --> 13:16.029 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Well, how do I know John Yang really won,
because the system could have been rigged?

13:16.129 --> 13:20.466 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN YANG: But Jill Stein and her campaign
for presidency raised $3.5 million.

13:20.566 --> 13:22.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

13:22.168 --> 13:26.506 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN YANG: In a week, she has raised about$6.5 million for this recount.

13:26.606 --> 13:27.507 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
AMY WALTER: Yes.

13:27.607 --> 13:28.508 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

13:28.608 --> 13:29.842 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
JOHN YANG: What does that say?

13:29.942 --> 13:30.710 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You talk about making the -- questioning the
legitimacy.

13:30.810 --> 13:31.778 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
What does say that about...

13:31.878 --> 13:32.779 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

13:32.879 --> 13:34.681 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
AMY WALTER: That controversy sells.

13:34.781 --> 13:39.519 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
There is a big segment of the electorate that
believes and has believed for some time that

13:39.619 --> 13:43.556 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
the system itself should be put into the question.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.926 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Remember, after the 2000 election and the
hanging chads and the butterfly ballots, Congress

13:47.026 --> 13:48.861 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
actually dealt with this.

13:48.961 --> 13:52.065 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
There was real concern that there were problem
with these machines that were old and broken.

13:52.165 --> 13:57.937 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And Congress said -- they passed a bill called
the Help America Vote Act, donated money -- or

13:58.037 --> 14:03.543 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
actually gave federal funds to the statesto update their machines.

14:03.643 --> 14:07.547 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But it doesn't mean that people feel better
about the machines just because Congress now

14:07.647 --> 14:11.551 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
has appropriated more money to help make them
more up to date.

14:11.651 --> 14:16.789 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN YANG: Another what's going on moment
to me was the -- over the weekend, Kellyanne

14:16.889 --> 14:23.663 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Conway goes on Twitter, goes on national television
to essentially campaign against her boss,

14:23.763 --> 14:27.300 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
the president-elect, picking Donald Trump.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.901 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
She can make this advice private.

14:29.001 --> 14:30.369 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

14:30.470 --> 14:31.104 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, picking Mitt Romney to
be secretary of state.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: I'm sorry.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Picking Mitt Romney.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.107 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm sorry.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.942 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Which hasn't yet happened.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.810 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But Mitt Romney does have another meeting
scheduled at Trump Tower with Donald Trump.

14:37.910 --> 14:39.812 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
He's one of several people in the mix.

14:39.912 --> 14:46.853 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Now, Mitt Romney was a very outspoken critic
of Donald Trump in the primary process and

14:46.953 --> 14:51.190 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
said some very tough things about Donald Trump,
many of which were true.

14:51.290 --> 14:57.130 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But Kellyanne Conway expresses a viewpoint
that I think many Trump loyalists have, that,

14:57.230 --> 15:00.533 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
why would you bring in this guy who insulted
you?

15:00.633 --> 15:08.341 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But it is odd to have someone who speaks for
Donald Trump seemingly on television both

15:08.441 --> 15:11.911 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
speaking for him and speaking to him?

15:12.011 --> 15:15.982 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But leading up to the election, KellyanneConway did some of this as well.

15:16.082 --> 15:19.719 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
She, at times, was tweeting things that seemed
to be like a subtweet of something that her

15:19.819 --> 15:24.791 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
boss was saying and at others times seemed
to be directly communicating through him through

15:24.891 --> 15:31.931 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
television, because he is an avid viewer of
television, cable news and the Sunday shows.

15:32.031 --> 15:40.139 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But the thing that is also interesting is
that then this morning there was a leak from

15:40.239 --> 15:44.544 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
somebody else in the campaign saying, well,
Donald Trump was very upset about what Kellyanne

15:44.644 --> 15:46.479 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Conway said.

15:46.579 --> 15:50.449 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We don't know which of -- we don't know whether
Kellyanne Conway was coordinating with Donald

15:50.550 --> 15:56.289 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Trump or whether he really was upset or whether
all of these leaks and statements are part

15:56.389 --> 16:01.861 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of, you know, an elaborate effort to make
sure that Mitt Romney isn't secretary of state.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.896 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
AMY WALTER: And this is the bigger challenge
that we have had.

16:03.996 --> 16:07.700 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And we have talked about this before, which
is, we have a president-elect who's yet to

16:07.800 --> 16:11.370 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
hold a press conference, hasn't held one since
July and certainly has not held one since

16:11.470 --> 16:12.905 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
winning.

16:13.005 --> 16:14.707 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We don't have anything to talk about thenin terms of his policies.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.376 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We haven't heard about his legislative agenda
he wants to put forward.

16:17.476 --> 16:22.481 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So all we have in front of us is this sort
of "Apprentice"-style game about who's going

16:22.582 --> 16:23.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be in his Cabinet.

16:24.016 --> 16:25.651 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Some of them are going to make a big difference.

16:25.751 --> 16:28.354 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Many of them, we're never going to talk about
ever again.

16:28.454 --> 16:32.792 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
His policies are the thing that we should
be spending the most time talking about, and

16:32.892 --> 16:37.096 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
yet it seems as if we're not going to get
any indication of that until he's sworn in

16:37.196 --> 16:38.731 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as president.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.834 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And even then, it's unclear if we are goingto see this same behavior occur.

16:41.934 --> 16:45.371 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Well, he thinks this, but then somebody goes
on TV and says that, and somebody else is

16:45.471 --> 16:47.306 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
countering behind the scenes over here.

16:47.406 --> 16:50.343 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN YANG: Right, whether we going to have
Cabinet officers going on television to lobby

16:50.443 --> 16:51.344 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

16:51.444 --> 16:52.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.213 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
JOHN YANG: Well, what do we know?

16:54.313 --> 16:57.783 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
From the names he's picked so far, what does
that suggest or what can you conclude about

16:57.884 --> 16:59.585 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
how he's going to govern as president?

16:59.685 --> 17:03.489 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
AMY WALTER: Well, I want to be careful to
read too much into it, because, again, the

17:03.589 --> 17:07.927 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Cabinet picks often are not as big of a deal
later on as they are right now, when we don't

17:08.027 --> 17:09.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have much to talk about.

17:09.962 --> 17:15.568 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But he has at least four people, Jeff Sessions,
Reince Priebus, Michael Flynn, and Ben Carson,

17:15.668 --> 17:18.704 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
who are loyalists, who were with him on thecampaign trail every single day.

17:18.804 --> 17:21.674 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Those are the kinds of people that he surroundedhimself with immediately.

17:21.774 --> 17:26.712 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The only person would fall into the not really
always on the team, maybe sort of team of

17:26.812 --> 17:33.953 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
rival type would be Nikki Haley, who, of course,
would be -- is going to be the U.N. secretary.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.821 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
It's interesting with Mitt Romney as well.

17:35.922 --> 17:38.791 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
These are the people that are outfacing, right,
the people that we're showing to the rest

17:38.891 --> 17:44.830 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of the world, Haley, Mitt Romney, vs. the
people that are closest to him, whether as

17:44.931 --> 17:47.433 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
his chief of staff or the attorney general.

17:47.533 --> 17:49.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

17:49.402 --> 17:52.738 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And Sessions, he's a hard-liner or immigration
in particular, helped Donald Trump develop

17:52.838 --> 17:58.744 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
his immigration policy, which is definitely
not in line with what the establishment Republicans

17:58.844 --> 18:01.580 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
thought would be the Gang of 8 immigration
reform.

18:01.681 --> 18:04.383 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
This is definitely a very hard line.

18:04.483 --> 18:10.856 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, there is a mix of hard-liners and slightly
more establishment people, like a Betsy DeVos

18:10.957 --> 18:11.857 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for education.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.059 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: For education.

18:13.159 --> 18:14.260 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN YANG: And we will get more names this
week.

18:14.360 --> 18:18.097 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Amy Walter, Tamara Keith, thanks for joining
us.

18:18.197 --> 18:26.205 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

18:26.305 --> 18:31.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Stay with us.

18:31.510 --> 18:37.383 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the future of
Cuban-American relations after Fidel Castro;

18:37.483 --> 18:40.820 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and the cost of cleaning up abandoned coal
mines.

18:40.920 --> 18:46.192 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But first: France's center-right party has
chosen social conservative Francois Fillon

18:46.292 --> 18:49.528 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
as its presidential candidate in next spring's
elections

18:49.628 --> 18:55.034 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Then, he could face Marine Le Pen, leaderof the far-right National Front.

18:55.134 --> 18:59.705 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The deeply unpopular current president, Francois
Hollande of the Socialist Party, has not yet

18:59.805 --> 19:02.341 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
said whether he will seek reelection.

19:02.441 --> 19:07.813 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Le Pen's National Front hopes to benefit from
the so-called Trump effect, as special correspondent

19:07.913 --> 19:13.486 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Malcolm Brabant discovered when he discovered
one of its strongholds in Northern France.

19:13.586 --> 19:20.559 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Despite being labeled a medieval
conservative, Francois Fillon won the Republican

19:20.659 --> 19:25.364 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
nomination in France's first ever U.S.-styleprimary by more than 2-1.

19:25.464 --> 19:28.834 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FRANCOIS FILLON, French Presidential Candidate
(through translator): Victory is mine.

19:28.934 --> 19:31.570 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
It's a substantial victory built on convictions.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.639 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
France wants the truth, and it wants action.

19:33.739 --> 19:38.577 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MALCOLM BRABANT: According to analyst Alexandra
de Hoop Scheffer, Fillon is a fiscal conservative

19:38.677 --> 19:40.446 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
with a record of consistency.

19:40.546 --> 19:42.681 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ALEXANDRA DE HOOP SCHEFFER, The German Marshall
Fund: He has strong positions in terms of

19:42.782 --> 19:45.918 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
reducing French public spending.

19:46.018 --> 19:52.191 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He wants to suppress around 500,000 public
sector jobs.

19:52.291 --> 19:56.128 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He has always stuck to the same positions
on many issues.

19:56.228 --> 19:57.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's pro-Russian.

19:57.229 --> 19:58.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He says it very clearly.

19:59.065 --> 20:02.768 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Most French commentators
expect the Socialist presidential candidate

20:02.868 --> 20:05.838 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
to be eliminated early in next year's election.

20:05.938 --> 20:12.178 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
At this bastion of the National Front, Henin-Beaumont,
they now know who their main opponent is.

20:12.278 --> 20:17.083 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Steeve Briois is the town's mayor and the
second most important person in the party.

20:17.183 --> 20:21.587 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
STEEVE BRIOIS, Mayor of Henin-Beaumont (through
translator): There's a global phenomenon today,

20:21.687 --> 20:22.655 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an awakening.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.990 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
The people are rebelling against the elite.

20:25.091 --> 20:27.293 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
So it's a good thing that Mr. Trump was elected.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.462 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It's a good thing that Brexit happened in
Britain.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.630 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It bodes well for us for France.

20:31.730 --> 20:35.734 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This is France's Rust Belt,
northeast of Paris.

20:35.835 --> 20:40.906 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Slag heaps and heavy machinery preserved in
industrial museums are all that remain of

20:41.006 --> 20:43.409 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
coal mines shut down two decades ago.

20:43.509 --> 20:45.344 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
There's high unemployment.

20:45.444 --> 20:50.049 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The working class here have followed a familiar
political route of abandoning socialists like

20:50.149 --> 20:52.351 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
President Francois Hollande for right-wing
populists.

20:52.451 --> 20:55.187 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
MARINE TONDELIER, Green Party: The Front National
is like a vulture party.

20:55.287 --> 21:00.659 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That is simply that shows something that is
decreasing, poor, complicated, and it tries

21:00.759 --> 21:04.797 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to seize it, and it's exactly what they did
here.

21:04.897 --> 21:09.668 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
EUGENE BINAISSE, Former Mayor (through translator):
A wall of silence has descended on the town.

21:09.768 --> 21:13.839 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We think we're being observed by the National
Front, and anything you say can come back

21:13.939 --> 21:15.741 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and bite you.

21:15.841 --> 21:19.712 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The National Front was founded
by Jean-Marie Le Pen, who famously described

21:19.812 --> 21:24.250 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
the Holocaust as a detail of history.

21:24.350 --> 21:29.021 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He was expelled from the party last year by
his daughter Marine, as she sought to soften

21:29.121 --> 21:35.261 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
its image as one of the most extreme right-wing
groups in Europe.

21:35.361 --> 21:39.932 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
France has the largest Muslim population in
Western Europe, estimated at between 5 to

21:40.032 --> 21:42.001 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
10 percent of the population.

21:42.101 --> 21:47.506 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In Beziers, a National Front stronghold in
the south, the administration counted Muslim

21:47.606 --> 21:51.010 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
children, contrary to strict secularist laws.

21:51.110 --> 21:56.182 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But according to Marine Tondelier, a councillor
in Henin-Beaumont, the mayor here has not

21:56.282 --> 21:57.783 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
conformed to expectations.

21:57.883 --> 22:02.855 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MARINE TONDELIER: Here, you don't have theimmigration question so much.

22:02.955 --> 22:05.691 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Even the Front National mayor is helping the
mosque.

22:05.791 --> 22:12.798 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
When we have got the terrorist attacks in
Charlie Hebdo, they do a demonstration with

22:12.898 --> 22:15.334 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
the Muslim people to show that they were united.

22:15.434 --> 22:17.036 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
So it's not so much a problem.

22:17.136 --> 22:19.705 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It's a problem with the Front National in
the South of France.

22:19.805 --> 22:27.112 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But the Front National, it's like a chameleon
party, so they adapt to the city in which

22:27.213 --> 22:28.981 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they are.

22:29.081 --> 22:31.250 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MALCOLM BRABANT: At the moment, your critics
say that you're actually being very nice to

22:31.350 --> 22:34.920 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
immigrants here, but is this because you'retrying to show a nice face now?

22:35.020 --> 22:38.123 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And will things change if you get into power
nationally?

22:38.224 --> 22:43.562 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
STEEVE BRIOIS (through translator): Because
the state has capitulated, foreigners who

22:43.662 --> 22:46.198 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
come to France do whatever they want today.

22:46.298 --> 22:50.502 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We're now seeing them retreat into their own
communities, and that's not good for France.

22:50.603 --> 22:52.338 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It's not good for the republic.

22:52.438 --> 22:54.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That creates disorder.

22:54.206 --> 22:57.776 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That's why one must have the courage to limit
immigration to the absolute minimum.

22:57.876 --> 22:59.645 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We can't welcome anymore.

22:59.745 --> 23:04.483 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But while some may find this
rhetoric disconcerting, it doesn't trouble

23:04.583 --> 23:10.322 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Abdelatif Kouba, a French national of Algerian
origin who runs a halal butcher's in the main

23:10.422 --> 23:11.724 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
square.

23:11.824 --> 23:14.426 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ABDELATIF KOUBA, France (through translator):
Why be afraid?

23:14.526 --> 23:15.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't understand.

23:15.761 --> 23:18.130 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I think the National Front is like any other
party.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.898 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The media exaggerate everything.

23:19.999 --> 23:23.502 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But Pascal Wallart does have
a problem.

23:23.602 --> 23:27.973 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He runs the district office of "La Voix du
Nord," a newspaper that supported the resistance

23:28.073 --> 23:29.842 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
during the Second World War.

23:29.942 --> 23:34.146 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Last year, the paper published an editorial
saying that Marine Le Pen would be dangerous

23:34.246 --> 23:35.914 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for France.

23:36.015 --> 23:39.285 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The National Front administration in the town
hall cut off relations immediately.

23:39.385 --> 23:44.623 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
PASCAL WALLART, "La Voix du Nord" (through
translator): They want to control the entire

23:44.723 --> 23:45.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
communication process.

23:46.058 --> 23:49.795 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I will not use the word fascist, but we're
not far from it.

23:49.895 --> 23:53.532 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But there's a totalitarian attitude to muzzling
communication.

23:53.632 --> 23:57.169 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Here, evil has been done, and it will remain
for a long time.

23:57.269 --> 24:00.706 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Although Henin-Beaumont is
National Front territory, it was hard to find

24:00.806 --> 24:04.510 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
people at the market who were willing to support
them on camera.

24:04.610 --> 24:10.683 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MAN (through translator): I don't think we
should be more afraid of the National Front

24:10.783 --> 24:12.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than any other party.

24:12.418 --> 24:14.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No one's worse or better.

24:14.219 --> 24:16.955 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MALCOLM BRABANT: France's Socialist prime
minister, Manuel Valls, believes the world

24:17.056 --> 24:20.125 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
has changed since Donald Trump's victory.

24:20.225 --> 24:25.664 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He believes it boosts the chances of Marine
Le Pen, the National Front leader, of winning

24:25.764 --> 24:28.267 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
the presidential election in France next May.

24:28.367 --> 24:33.372 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Now, Valls believes that Trump's success and
the Brexit vote demonstrate the need of politicians

24:33.472 --> 24:37.776 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to listen to angry citizens, especially when
it comes to issues like immigration.

24:37.876 --> 24:42.715 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And he believes that the rise of populists
and the far-right has been made possible by

24:42.815 --> 24:46.785 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
politicians who are too scared to take tough
decisions.

24:46.885 --> 24:50.689 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But Francois Fillon has convinced voters in
the primaries that, as president, he will

24:50.789 --> 24:55.461 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
back up his tough talk with action by disbanding
extreme Islamic groups.

24:55.561 --> 25:01.834 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
FRANCOIS FILLON (through translator): My friends,
radical Islam is undermining our fellow Muslim

25:01.934 --> 25:02.835 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
citizens.

25:02.935 --> 25:04.636 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
It infiltrates them, takes them hostage.

25:04.737 --> 25:06.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They hate what we are.

25:06.271 --> 25:09.641 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, I tell you, I will fight them withoutrespite and without mercy.

25:09.742 --> 25:13.746 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Analyst de hoop Scheffer
believes the National Front's Marine Le Pen

25:13.846 --> 25:17.082 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
may suffer because of a French backlash against
Donald Trump.

25:17.182 --> 25:20.919 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ALEXANDRA DE HOOP SCHEFFER: I don't think
that Donald Trump's election in the U.S. will

25:21.019 --> 25:22.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
actually help her.

25:22.588 --> 25:24.556 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
I believe that it's maybe the contrary.

25:24.656 --> 25:26.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It might undermine her.

25:26.525 --> 25:33.432 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And the fact that a significant part of the
French population actually went out and vote

25:33.532 --> 25:39.171 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in the center-right primary was, to me, a
very strong signal in terms of the French

25:39.271 --> 25:43.409 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
not wanting to see Marine Le Pen run France
in 2017.

25:43.509 --> 25:48.080 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Historically, the far right
has been squeezed out by the center-right

25:48.180 --> 25:51.417 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
and left combining and voting tactically.

25:51.517 --> 25:57.790 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Some analysts believe Francois Fillon's brand
of conservatism may repel Socialists.

25:57.890 --> 26:05.330 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
At the town hall in Henin-Beaumont, they hope
this will create an opening for the National

26:05.431 --> 26:06.632 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Front.

26:06.732 --> 26:11.136 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Malcolm Brabant
in France.

26:11.236 --> 26:23.515 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN YANG: The last two years have seen athaw in U.S.-Cuba relations.

26:23.615 --> 26:29.087 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But could the death of Fidel Castro and the
election of Donald Trump jeopardize the warming

26:29.188 --> 26:31.557 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
trend that President Obama started?

26:31.657 --> 26:33.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's Jeffrey Brown.

26:33.792 --> 26:41.133 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: In Havana, a 21-gun salute
marked the official start of a week of mourning

26:41.233 --> 26:45.604 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
for Cuba's revolutionary leader.

26:45.704 --> 26:52.010 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
University students took to the streets, chanting
his name, and long lines snaked around Havana's

26:52.110 --> 26:57.382 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Plaza of the Revolution, as Cubans waited
their turn to pay tribute to the man who brought

26:57.483 --> 27:00.819 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a communist-run state within 100 miles of
the U.S.

27:00.919 --> 27:05.524 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LUIS ALVAREZ, Cuba (through translator): Fidel
has been the biggest thing in my life, for

27:05.624 --> 27:07.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
me and for all Cubans.

27:07.693 --> 27:12.764 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The new generations have to learn to be like
him, because he gave everything to us, everything.

27:12.865 --> 27:15.801 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: Damien Cave is there reporting
for The New York Times.

27:15.901 --> 27:20.339 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DAMIEN CAVE, The New York Times: It's a mix
of sadness, and then also a relief, to some

27:20.439 --> 27:22.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
degree, for many.

27:22.241 --> 27:25.143 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It almost feels like the whole city or the
whole country has just exhaled enormously,

27:25.244 --> 27:29.448 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and is both trying to kind of make sense of
the past, and also figure out a way to move

27:29.548 --> 27:31.016 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forward.

27:31.116 --> 27:33.385 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
One chapter is closed and another chapteris open, someone said to me.

27:33.485 --> 27:37.389 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It's not the full tale, but this definitely
feels like a turning point, at least symbolically.

27:37.489 --> 27:42.594 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: In Miami's Little Havana neighborhood,
a very different scene, one of jubilation,

27:42.694 --> 27:48.100 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
as the children and grandchildren of those
who fled Castro's rule say his death marks

27:48.200 --> 27:49.635 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a new beginning.

27:49.735 --> 27:51.904 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MAN: I don't celebrate death, but I celebrate
the death of a tyrant.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Now is the time.

27:53.539 --> 27:56.475 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And it's definitely in the hands of the young
people to take it over.

27:56.575 --> 28:00.812 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: Whatever comes next for Cuba
and the U.S., there was one new link formed

28:00.913 --> 28:06.318 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
today: The first commercial flight from Miami
landed in Havana.

28:06.418 --> 28:11.089 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And now to that question of future U.S.-Cuba
relations, we're joined first by Senator Amy

28:11.189 --> 28:13.592 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Klobuchar, Democrat from Minnesota.

28:13.692 --> 28:15.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you, Senator.

28:15.761 --> 28:21.466 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Is it time now to move ahead with the re-engagement
that President Obama began or a time to take

28:21.567 --> 28:23.635 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
a pause with the death of Fidel Castro?

28:23.735 --> 28:25.137 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

28:25.237 --> 28:27.272 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), MINNESOTA: Well, I think
it's time to move ahead.

28:27.372 --> 28:30.509 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
This has been 50-some years of a failed policy.

28:30.609 --> 28:35.547 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And both the Cuban people and the American
people are really ahead of many of the people

28:35.647 --> 28:37.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in their own government.

28:37.482 --> 28:41.553 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Congress has sat on this for years, and I
think it's time to lift the embargo.

28:41.653 --> 28:47.626 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The death of Fidel Castro, of course, is not
as significant when you first look at it,

28:47.726 --> 28:50.596 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
because Raul Castro, his brother, has been
in power for years.

28:50.696 --> 28:57.102 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But, in fact, he's been a looming figure even
during his illness that I think has made a

28:57.202 --> 29:02.941 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
difference in holding us back in trying to
open up more negotiations and move ahead with

29:03.041 --> 29:05.344 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
opening up relations between our two countries.

29:05.444 --> 29:08.847 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: Donald Trump, of course, has
threatened to reimpose some of the sanctions

29:08.947 --> 29:10.816 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that President Obama lifted.

29:10.916 --> 29:15.854 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Isn't it likely that he will be under pressure
to keep some of those campaign promises now?

29:15.954 --> 29:17.723 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

29:17.823 --> 29:20.792 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
AMY KLOBUCHAR: Well, I hope that at least
this death of Fidel Castro causes him to pause

29:20.892 --> 29:26.932 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and take some time to look at this, because
you have so many Americans now wanting to

29:27.032 --> 29:28.567 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
visit there, visiting there.

29:28.667 --> 29:32.604 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
You have ag interests down there.

29:32.704 --> 29:34.640 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
And you have the Cuban people.

29:34.740 --> 29:40.178 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Everywhere I went on my visits with the president
and with Secretary Kerry, there was artwork,

29:40.278 --> 29:43.515 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and it would have the number and date December
17.

29:43.615 --> 29:44.516 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I thought, what's that?

29:44.616 --> 29:46.685 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Is that some Castro birthday?

29:46.785 --> 29:53.325 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It was actually the date President Obama and
Raul Castro started to open diplomatic relations,

29:53.425 --> 29:58.563 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and that is so significant to the Cuban people,
because they are, many of them, entrepreneurs,

29:58.664 --> 30:00.732 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
many of them very friendly to America.

30:00.832 --> 30:03.135 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I think this is an opportunity for the
Cubans.

30:03.235 --> 30:07.305 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It's the only way we are going to change their
democratic and human rights situation, and

30:07.406 --> 30:12.911 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
certainly an opportunity for Americans, 11
million people 90 miles off our shore, forecast

30:13.011 --> 30:15.614 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that five million Americans would visit every
year.

30:15.714 --> 30:20.919 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And, of course, we would then be able to export
products as well if we lifted our -- the embargo

30:21.019 --> 30:22.854 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
with our bipartisan bill.

30:22.954 --> 30:28.493 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: But I wonder also, in countering
the critics, can you point to specific changes,

30:28.593 --> 30:33.732 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
political changes, in Cuba to say that this
re-engagement has at least started to work,

30:33.832 --> 30:35.033 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that we should continue with it?

30:35.133 --> 30:36.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What would you say?

30:36.134 --> 30:37.836 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

30:37.936 --> 30:40.038 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
AMY KLOBUCHAR: Well, I think that there is
a lot more interest between our countries.

30:40.138 --> 30:45.310 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
There are still people that have been held
for human rights that shouldn't be held for

30:45.410 --> 30:46.845 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
just speaking their mind.

30:46.945 --> 30:49.648 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Of course, there were some releases immediately.

30:49.748 --> 30:54.586 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Alan Gross and others were released, but there
are still people that are being imprisoned.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.822 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
So, I don't want to be a Pollyanna about this.

30:56.922 --> 31:01.293 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I just think what we have been doing hasn't
been working.

31:01.393 --> 31:06.565 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And when we are this close to the country
and there is so much cross-interest between

31:06.665 --> 31:11.536 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the two countries, you have got the Catholic
Church playing a major role, the pope a force

31:11.636 --> 31:17.375 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
behind this and wanting to lift the embargo,
I think all these things are on our side.

31:17.476 --> 31:21.546 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And that's why President Obama has been leading
the way, because, otherwise, the people will

31:21.646 --> 31:22.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
get in front of us here.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.649 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And I think it's time to change this policy.

31:24.750 --> 31:29.020 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: And just very briefly, how
do you see the legacy of Fidel Castro now?

31:29.121 --> 31:30.922 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

31:31.022 --> 31:37.662 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
AMY KLOBUCHAR: Well, obviously, it is a legacy
of very difficult situations for many people

31:37.763 --> 31:38.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in his own country.

31:38.964 --> 31:42.033 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
There are still a lot of people living in
poverty.

31:42.134 --> 31:46.972 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They have major issues with not having enough
food.

31:47.072 --> 31:51.877 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That's why we're able to send some food down
there under a humanitarian exemption.

31:51.977 --> 31:57.349 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And he's killed people, basically, in order
to support the dictatorship that he ran for

31:57.449 --> 31:58.416 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
so long.

31:58.517 --> 32:01.753 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
So, I don't see that has a positive legacy.

32:01.853 --> 32:06.391 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But what I do see is Cuban people that arejust -- want to see change.

32:06.491 --> 32:08.126 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
They are vibrant.

32:08.226 --> 32:12.397 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They are trying to fix up old cars, so they
can start their tourism businesses.

32:12.497 --> 32:17.202 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
There's hundreds of thousands of small companies
that have already started under some exceptions

32:17.302 --> 32:19.471 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
that Raul Castro has put into place.

32:19.571 --> 32:25.076 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, I see a country that is on the cusp of
change, and we should be helping that change,

32:25.177 --> 32:28.380 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
instead of continuing an old policy that hasn't
worked.

32:28.480 --> 32:31.249 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota,
thank you very much.

32:31.349 --> 32:32.250 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

32:32.350 --> 32:33.251 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
AMY KLOBUCHAR: Thank you.

32:33.351 --> 32:35.086 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
It's great to be on, Jeff.

32:35.187 --> 32:37.889 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: And now a very different view
from Ana Quintana, a policy analyst at the

32:37.989 --> 32:41.927 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Heritage Foundation, and herself a first-generation
Cuban American.

32:42.027 --> 32:43.261 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome to you.

32:43.361 --> 32:44.663 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ANA QUINTANA, Heritage Foundation: Thanks
for having me.

32:44.763 --> 32:46.064 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: Your description of the legacy
of Fidel Castro?

32:46.164 --> 32:48.700 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
ANA QUINTANA: Well, mine isn't quite as positive.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.702 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
I believe it's one of tyranny.

32:50.802 --> 32:53.271 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It's one of tens of thousands of people being
murdered.

32:53.371 --> 32:56.241 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And, I mean, it's two million people who have
been displaced and lost their country.

32:56.341 --> 33:00.912 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, you have opposed President
Obama's engagement from the beginning.

33:01.012 --> 33:03.849 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
What should happen now, now that Fidel Castro
is dead?

33:03.949 --> 33:07.552 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ANA QUINTANA: Well, now I think it's time
to reassess these past two years and recognize

33:07.652 --> 33:09.721 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
that this policy has been a failure, right?

33:09.821 --> 33:13.892 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And it's notwithstanding the death of Fidel
Castro, but this year alone, there have been

33:13.992 --> 33:17.028 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
over 10,000 politically motivated arrests.

33:17.128 --> 33:21.233 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Persecution against the religious community
on the island has increased significantly.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.468 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Churches by the hundreds are being bulldozed.

33:23.568 --> 33:25.770 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And that's something that is not being focused
on.

33:25.871 --> 33:30.008 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, I think, moving forward, president-elect
Trump has a significant opportunity to kind

33:30.108 --> 33:36.248 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of revert back these unilateral concessions,
these unilateral executive actions that President

33:36.348 --> 33:40.652 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Obama implemented and really put the ball
back in the United States' court and say,

33:40.752 --> 33:42.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you know what, Cuba?

33:42.687 --> 33:45.056 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You should free all your political prisoners,
and before we continue normalizing relations.

33:45.156 --> 33:47.626 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, how far do you push this?

33:47.726 --> 33:52.130 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
For example, should president-elect Trump
-- well, there is a recently opened embassy.

33:52.230 --> 33:53.131 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

33:53.231 --> 33:54.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANA QUINTANA: Yes.

33:54.299 --> 33:55.166 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: Should that be closed again?

33:55.267 --> 33:57.035 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
ANA QUINTANA: Well, not specifically.

33:57.135 --> 34:00.639 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But I think, moving forward, so, President
Obama has implemented about 52 to 53 executive

34:00.739 --> 34:06.845 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
actions, many of them allowing for financing
for the regime, or allowing for business opportunities

34:06.945 --> 34:09.748 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
for the regime for military and state-owned
enterprises.

34:09.848 --> 34:11.683 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
I think that's where we should start.

34:11.783 --> 34:16.521 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I think we should put a cap back on remittances
for Cuban military and intelligence officials.

34:16.621 --> 34:22.093 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
These are the same security officials that
are using this money to arrest and conduct

34:22.193 --> 34:24.229 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
significant repression against the dissidents
on the island.

34:24.329 --> 34:27.098 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, but to the extent that
things are already happening, there's already

34:27.198 --> 34:29.634 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the case of Starwood Hotels, own by Marriott,
right?

34:29.734 --> 34:31.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANA QUINTANA: Sure.

34:31.670 --> 34:34.706 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: Has taken a deal with the Cuban
government to take over a government-run hotel.

34:34.806 --> 34:36.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANA QUINTANA: Sure.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.443 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: Should that be rescinded, that
kind of thing that has already started?

34:38.543 --> 34:40.412 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Should we roll back those kind of things?

34:40.512 --> 34:43.114 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ANA QUINTANA: Yes, well, that's something
that is owned and operated by the Cuban military.

34:43.214 --> 34:48.320 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
So, any company that wants to engage in financial
commercial exchanges with the military is

34:48.420 --> 34:50.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
taking a very big risk.

34:50.322 --> 34:55.160 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But I think the purpose of President Obama's
Cuban policy wasn't to enrich the Cuban military

34:55.260 --> 34:57.662 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
or the security apparatuses of the country.

34:57.762 --> 35:03.001 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It was to improve the economic conditions
and the political conditions for the Cuban

35:03.101 --> 35:04.035 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

35:04.135 --> 35:05.971 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
That's exactly what the senator just said.

35:06.071 --> 35:09.341 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But two years later, we're recognizing the
only people who's benefiting is the dictatorship.

35:09.441 --> 35:12.277 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
There is no such thing as dictator-down economics.

35:12.377 --> 35:14.112 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
The people are not benefiting.

35:14.212 --> 35:17.983 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right, but the senator also
said that this all happened after many, many

35:18.083 --> 35:21.086 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
years of nothing, of a policy that wasn't
working.

35:21.186 --> 35:22.754 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
That was the argument for re-engagement.

35:22.854 --> 35:23.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANA QUINTANA: Yes.

35:23.855 --> 35:25.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Well, I think that's false.

35:25.357 --> 35:27.759 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The policy -- we can't say the policy didn't
work.

35:27.859 --> 35:30.095 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
The policy wasn't meant for regime change.

35:30.195 --> 35:36.234 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The policy was meant to protect the American
citizens that are now -- they are now owed

35:36.334 --> 35:41.506 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
upwards of $8 billion in uncompensated assets,
in money that was seized of theirs by the

35:41.606 --> 35:42.574 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
regime.

35:42.674 --> 35:44.275 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And that's why the policy was put in place.

35:44.376 --> 35:47.312 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And moving forward, that's something that
should be kept in line.

35:47.412 --> 35:51.216 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I mean, these Americans have not been repaid
the money that was taken away from them.

35:51.316 --> 35:55.086 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: Just very briefly, in our last
minute here, the impact of U.S. businesses

35:55.186 --> 35:59.090 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that do want to go over there, right, that
are already there or that are -- they're itching

35:59.190 --> 36:00.959 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to get in?

36:01.059 --> 36:03.962 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ANA QUINTANA: Well, I think what's happening
is, we are replicating -- the United States

36:04.062 --> 36:09.300 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
government is allowing for American businesses
to dictate its foreign policy towards Cuba.

36:09.401 --> 36:14.539 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So we're replicating the situation that was
existing before Castro, right, where U.S.

36:14.639 --> 36:19.511 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
businesses had a great relationship with the
dictator Batista, and he -- and this is what's

36:19.611 --> 36:21.880 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
dominating U.S.-Cuba relations.

36:21.980 --> 36:25.183 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And the people who are suffering in this,
it's the 11 million Cuban people who are still

36:25.283 --> 36:28.053 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
on the island and Cuba's democratic dissidents.

36:28.153 --> 36:36.628 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JEFFREY BROWN: Ana Quintana, thank you very
much.

36:36.728 --> 36:40.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANA QUINTANA: Thank you.

36:40.999 --> 36:47.038 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN YANG: And now to coal and the challengesof cleaning up old mines.

36:47.138 --> 36:51.576 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
With some coal companies in bankruptcy, the
money need to pay for cleanup is not always

36:51.676 --> 36:53.445 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
available.

36:53.545 --> 36:58.416 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Public media's Inside Energy and The Allegheny
Front teamed up to report from two of the

36:58.516 --> 37:00.618 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
country's largest coal-producing states.

37:00.718 --> 37:04.122 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
Leigh Paterson takes us first to Western Pennsylvania.

37:04.222 --> 37:09.961 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LEIGH PATERSON: It is a nice day for a walk
in the woods.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.130 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But this is not a hiking trail.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.966 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
ERIC CAVAZZA, Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection: This site is known as the Fredericktown

37:15.066 --> 37:16.367 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
refuse pile.

37:16.468 --> 37:18.570 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Some people call it the Black Dog Hollow refuse
pile as well.

37:18.670 --> 37:22.474 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LEIGH PATERSON: A coal refuse pile made upof rocks and low-quality coal.

37:22.574 --> 37:27.011 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ERIC CAVAZZA: And then the reject material
was just trammed and then conveyored up on

37:27.112 --> 37:29.547 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the hill and dumped on this giant pile and
left.

37:29.647 --> 37:32.250 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
LEIGH PATERSON: That was over 70 years ago.

37:32.350 --> 37:36.054 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The coal mine nearby changed hands as companies
went bankrupt.

37:36.154 --> 37:38.223 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Now the pile is a hazard.

37:38.323 --> 37:42.494 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
There are hundreds of sites like this one
in Pennsylvania, and there are tens of thousands

37:42.594 --> 37:45.463 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of abandoned mine sites scattered across the
country.

37:45.563 --> 37:47.265 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
ERIC CAVAZZA: They can catch on fire.

37:47.365 --> 37:53.071 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
This particular pile isn't burning that we
are aware of, but many of these do catch on

37:53.171 --> 37:54.672 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fire.

37:54.772 --> 37:58.009 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LEIGH PATERSON: Like one in Eynon, Pennsylvania,that was put out in 2015.

37:58.109 --> 38:03.448 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Cavazza once fell into a burning pile himself
while investigating a fire years ago.

38:03.548 --> 38:05.483 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ERIC CAVAZZA: It was very scary.

38:05.583 --> 38:10.288 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It was like walking onto a trap door and having
somebody pull the string, because you just

38:10.388 --> 38:12.624 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
dropped.

38:12.724 --> 38:15.894 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
And I was in over my head in a hole.

38:15.994 --> 38:17.829 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
And there was smoke all around me.

38:17.929 --> 38:22.267 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LEIGH PATERSON: Not all problems with abandoned
mine sites are straight out of an action movie,

38:22.367 --> 38:23.835 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
but they're still significant.

38:23.935 --> 38:28.339 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
When it rains, these coal refuse piles candischarge some nasty stuff.

38:28.439 --> 38:33.478 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
This so-called acid mine drainage can contaminate
streams and sometimes even impact the local

38:33.578 --> 38:35.280 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
water supply.

38:35.380 --> 38:39.184 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Homeowners, like the ones who live around
this pile, deal with pipes and sewers that

38:39.284 --> 38:40.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
get clogged with runoff.

38:40.752 --> 38:43.521 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ERIC CAVAZZA: So it's a big maintenance issue
for the township.

38:43.621 --> 38:47.458 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LEIGH PATERSON: Cavazza, as the head of the
bureau that deals directly with abandoned

38:47.559 --> 38:51.429 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
mine remediation, wants these piles cleaned
up.

38:51.529 --> 38:54.899 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But it's expensive, and money to do the cleanup
is tight.

38:54.999 --> 38:59.337 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
A lot of it comes from something called the
Abandoned Mine Land fund, or AML.

38:59.437 --> 39:04.475 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ERIC CAVAZZA: The fund is generated by the
active mining industry, and the country is

39:04.576 --> 39:08.680 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
beginning to move away from coal as a primary
source of electricity generation.

39:08.780 --> 39:13.451 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LEIGH PATERSON: And with coal production at
its lowest level in 30 years, there's simply

39:13.551 --> 39:15.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
less money coming in.

39:15.253 --> 39:22.193 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In Pennsylvania alone, AML funding has droppedby over 25 percent since 2013.

39:22.293 --> 39:25.230 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In Wyoming, the worry is about future cleanup
costs.

39:25.330 --> 39:27.298 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
How thick is that seam right there?

39:27.398 --> 39:29.267 align:left position:50%,start line:93.33% size:50%
BLAKE JONES, Technical Services Manager: Thirty-five-feet-thick.

39:29.367 --> 39:33.738 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LEIGH PATERSON: These pits are huge, and are
generally filled in as mining operations progress.

39:33.838 --> 39:38.109 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
BLAKE JONES: The area that you see mining
right now will look like this in approximately

39:38.209 --> 39:39.978 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two years.

39:40.078 --> 39:43.748 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LEIGH PATERSON: This green, grassy area right
next to the mine was a mine itself just a

39:43.848 --> 39:45.650 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
few years ago.

39:45.750 --> 39:50.321 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It has since been filled in and reseeded as
part of the complicated, lengthy cleanup process

39:50.421 --> 39:52.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
known as reclamation.

39:52.323 --> 39:54.492 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
RICK CURTSINGER, Spokesman, Cloud Peak Energy:
For part of the leasing process, before any

39:54.592 --> 39:58.630 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
mining begins, mines are required to have
a reclamation plan.

39:58.730 --> 40:01.532 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LEIGH PATERSON: And something called reclamation
bonding.

40:01.633 --> 40:07.972 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
RICK CURTSINGER: That's a guarantee, an insurance
that we will accomplish the reclamation that's

40:08.072 --> 40:09.741 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
outlined as part of that lease.

40:09.841 --> 40:14.879 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LEIGH PATERSON: So, basically, a payment to
make sure future mine cleanup gets done.

40:14.979 --> 40:20.885 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Regulations in some states allow coal producers
to self-bond, which means companies promise

40:20.985 --> 40:24.455 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to pay for cleanup based on their financial
strength.

40:24.555 --> 40:29.260 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The problem comes when those companies become
financially shaky and those cleanup money

40:29.360 --> 40:31.095 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
gets tied up in bankruptcy court.

40:31.195 --> 40:39.470 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In Wyoming, over the course of this year,
we're talking about over a billion dollars.

40:39.570 --> 40:44.242 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Pat Sweeney (ph) has been working on Western
land issues for decades and even lobbied for

40:44.342 --> 40:48.513 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the 1977 federal law that regulates coal mine
cleanup.

40:48.613 --> 40:50.481 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
He puts this problem into perspective.

40:50.581 --> 40:55.720 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
PAT SWEENEY, Activist: Remember, the circumstances
were so different then, too, because you had

40:55.820 --> 41:02.760 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
viable companies that, at the time, no one
ever thought there might be companies going

41:02.860 --> 41:04.495 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bankrupt.

41:04.595 --> 41:08.733 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
No one thought, in some respects, that there
would be a change in energy policy.

41:08.833 --> 41:13.504 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LEIGH PATERSON: Cloud Peak Energy, the coal
company that took us on the reclamation tour,

41:13.604 --> 41:19.944 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
is not one of the companies in bankruptcy,
and is moving away from the practice of self-bonding.

41:20.044 --> 41:24.682 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But with some of the largest coal companies
in the country working out reclamation details

41:24.782 --> 41:28.619 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
during and after bankruptcy, the future of
cleanup is unclear.

41:28.720 --> 41:33.758 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LEIGH PATERSON: For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Leigh Paterson.

41:33.858 --> 41:46.204 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN YANG: We will be back with an excerpt
of a 1985 interview with Fidel Castro by our

41:46.304 --> 41:47.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
own Robert MacNeil.

41:47.739 --> 41:51.843 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But, first, take a moment to hear from your
local PBS station.

41:51.943 --> 41:57.348 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It's a chance to offer your support, which
helps keep programs like ours on the air.

41:57.448 --> 41:59.217 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

41:59.317 --> 42:10.595 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN YANG: Finally tonight: an excerpt from
an interview done by our own Robert MacNeil

42:10.695 --> 42:14.766 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
with the late Fidel Castro.

42:14.866 --> 42:18.035 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Conducted in 1985, MacNeil asks Castro to
describe how the Cuban Missile Crisis began.

42:18.136 --> 42:24.675 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Castro said that after the Bay of Pigs invasion
in 1961, Cuba and the Soviet Union feared

42:24.776 --> 42:27.545 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
additional U.S. invasions into Cuba.

42:27.645 --> 42:35.319 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
FIDEL CASTRO, Cuban President (through translator):
The Soviets had that concern, and we naturally

42:35.420 --> 42:37.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
had the same concern.

42:38.055 --> 42:43.060 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
ROBERT MACNEIL: This is after the Bay of Pigs?

42:43.161 --> 42:50.668 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FIDEL CASTRO (through translator): Yes, after
the Bay of Pigs.

42:50.768 --> 42:54.405 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They asked us what measures we thought couldoffer Cuba some guarantees.

42:54.505 --> 43:04.582 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
The most sure one was the fact that an aggression
against Cuba mean an aggression against the

43:04.682 --> 43:06.150 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Soviet Union.

43:06.250 --> 43:10.021 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
That was the thesis that we put forth.

43:10.121 --> 43:15.793 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
The concrete idea of the missiles was theirs.

43:15.893 --> 43:28.473 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I explained it, and we accepted it, but without
any hesitation, because we were being harassed.

43:28.573 --> 43:34.412 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
An invasion had just taken place.

43:34.512 --> 43:36.981 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
The pirate attacks were continuing constantly.

43:37.081 --> 43:42.086 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Constant mention was being made of an invasion
against Cuba.

43:42.186 --> 44:00.705 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ROBERT MACNEIL: When the crisis was at its
very height, did you personally think, did

44:00.805 --> 44:07.178 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
you believe that nuclear war was a possibility
on one of those days?

44:07.278 --> 44:10.181 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
FIDEL CASTRO (through translator): Yes.

44:10.281 --> 44:13.918 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Yes, I believed that as a possibility.

44:14.018 --> 44:33.004 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ROBERT MACNEIL: What did you feel about yourrole in having brought it to

44:33.104 --> 44:34.205 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
that point?

44:34.305 --> 44:35.606 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FIDEL CASTRO (through translator): It wasn't
me.

44:35.706 --> 44:45.816 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It was the United States, the one that led
us to that point.

44:45.917 --> 44:56.227 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It was the United States that initiated the
blockade, that initiated, organized the invasion,

44:56.327 --> 45:19.717 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the sabotage, the pirate attacks, the mercenary
regiment, and those that spoke of an invasion

45:19.817 --> 45:24.021 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
against Cuba.

45:24.121 --> 45:26.023 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It was the United States.

45:26.123 --> 45:27.124 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It wasn't us.

45:27.224 --> 45:29.794 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And I believe that we answered correctly.

45:29.894 --> 45:31.662 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
I have no doubt whatsoever.

45:31.762 --> 45:37.368 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ROBERT MACNEIL: After Khrushchev decided to
withdraw the missiles, which you protested,

45:37.468 --> 45:45.476 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
what did he say to you, did Nikita Khrushchev?

45:45.576 --> 46:03.260 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Did he say to you, we have made a big mistake,we shouldn't have done this?

46:03.361 --> 46:05.096 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
What did he say?

46:05.196 --> 46:09.800 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
FIDEL CASTRO (through translator): Look, we
wouldn't have opposed seeking a solution.

46:09.900 --> 46:22.546 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
When the war came very close, then the leaders
of these two big powers became more aware

46:22.647 --> 46:25.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about the danger.

46:25.349 --> 46:26.250 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They worked.

46:26.350 --> 46:29.920 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
They were able to achieve detente.

46:30.021 --> 46:39.730 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
But, at that time, we were not in conformity.

46:39.830 --> 46:41.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We were not pleased.

46:41.632 --> 46:45.970 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Now, then, after 15 years elapsed, it was
proven that they were right, that a war, a

46:46.070 --> 46:55.012 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
nuclear war, was avoided andthat Cuba wasn't invaded.

46:55.112 --> 47:00.084 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN YANG: Online, "PBS NewsHour" special
correspondent Spencer Michels recounts the

47:00.184 --> 52:13.697 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
day in 1959 when Fidel Castro spoke to his
class at Princeton.

52:13.797 --> 52:17.634 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Fresh off the success of his revolution, Castropromised he'd hold elections.

52:17.735 --> 52:19.870 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But, of course, they never came.

52:19.970 --> 52:26.110 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Read more about his speech on our Web site
at PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:26.210 --> 52:31.148 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And again to our honor roll of American service
personnel killed in the Middle East conflicts.

52:31.248 --> 52:35.052 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We add them as their deaths are made official
and photographs become available.

52:35.152 --> 53:15.659 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Here, in silence, are three more.

53:15.759 --> 53:17.494 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
And that's the "NewsHour" for tonight.

53:17.594 --> 53:21.932 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
On Tuesday: a look at charter schools and
the controversy surrounding their expansion

53:22.032 --> 53:24.201 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
within African-American communities.

53:24.301 --> 53:25.369 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm John Yang.

53:25.469 --> 53:28.172 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Join us online and again here tomorrow evening.

53:28.272 --> 53:32.272 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
For all of us at the "PBS NewsHour," thanks,
and good night.
