03:05.085 --> 03:06.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN HE ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE

FACE OF TYPICAL F.B.I. PROCEDURE

03:17.264 --> 03:18.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

03:20.200 --> 03:21.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON'T EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE

EXISTENCE OF AN INVESTIGATION.

03:22.536 --> 03:23.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

DON'T COMMENT ON IT.

03:26.640 --> 03:27.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND, YOU KNOW, THE CLINTON FOLKS

03:27.874 --> 03:29.643 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRAISED HIM FOR COMING OUT AND

03:29.643 --> 03:30.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANNOUNCING THAT HE WASN'T

PRESSING CHARGES.

03:32.112 --> 03:34.347 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IN SO DOING, HE BASICALLY

03:34.347 --> 03:35.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SET THE STAGE FOR THIS TYPE OF

03:35.949 --> 03:37.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCENARIO WHERE IF NEW

03:37.217 --> 03:39.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFORMATION DID ARISE, THAT HE

03:39.453 --> 03:40.854 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD FEEL OBLIGATED TO PRESENT

03:40.854 --> 03:42.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT AT LEAST TO CONGRESS WHO, OF

03:42.856 --> 03:43.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COURSE, QUICKLY TURNED AROUND

03:43.957 --> 03:45.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND LEAKED IT TO THE PUBLIC,

03:45.592 --> 03:47.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THE IDEA BEING THAT IF HE

03:47.060 --> 03:48.095 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIDN'T DO IT BEFORE THE

03:48.095 --> 03:49.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTION, HE WOULD COME UNDER

03:49.496 --> 03:51.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRITICISM FOR POTENTIALLY

03:51.531 --> 03:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REVEALING NEW INFORMATION AFTER

03:53.033 --> 03:53.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ELECTION.

03:53.700 --> 03:54.768 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF "DAMNED

03:54.768 --> 03:55.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF YOU DO, DAMNED IF YOU DON'T"

03:55.969 --> 03:57.204 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THIS CASE.

03:57.204 --> 03:58.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: I WANT TO FOCUS ON

03:58.338 --> 03:59.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WORD "OBLIGATION" BECAUSE

03:59.639 --> 04:01.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S THE WORD THAT HE USED IN

04:01.007 --> 04:03.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AN INTERNAL MEMO TO THE F.B.I.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.245 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE SAID, "GIVEN THAT WE DON'T

04:09.249 --> 04:10.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A MISLEADING IMPRESSION."

04:10.984 --> 04:13.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE SAID IT WAS HIS OBLIGATION TO

04:13.887 --> 04:14.688 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
E-MAILS.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TWO QUESTIONS: ONE, WAS IT,

04:16.556 --> 04:17.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDEED, AN OBLIGATION?

04:17.991 --> 04:20.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND, TWO, DIDN'T HE CREATE A

04:20.060 --> 04:21.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MISLEADING IMPRESSION?

04:21.795 --> 04:23.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, CERTAINLY THERE WAS NO

04:23.096 --> 04:24.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORMAL OBLIGATION.

04:24.331 --> 04:25.499 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE DID IN JULY, WHEN HE WAS

04:25.499 --> 04:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASKED ABOUT THIS BY CONGRESS,

04:26.833 --> 04:27.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN HE TESTIFIED BEFORE

04:27.834 --> 04:29.069 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONGRESS, HE WAS ASKED

04:29.069 --> 04:31.404 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPECIFICALLY WOULD HE REOPEN THE

04:31.404 --> 04:32.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INVESTIGATION OR LOOK INTO

04:32.806 --> 04:34.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IF IT

04:34.107 --> 04:36.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAME FORWARD AFTER THEY DECIDED

04:36.543 --> 04:37.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT TO PRESS CHARGES?

04:37.677 --> 04:38.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE SAID THAT HE WOULD LOOK INTO

04:38.945 --> 04:39.446 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.680 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, HERE WE ARE.

04:40.680 --> 04:41.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS TO WHETHER IT CREATES A

04:41.581 --> 04:43.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MISLEADING IMPRESSION, CERTAINLY

04:43.116 --> 04:44.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S THE ARGUMENT AMONG THE

04:44.050 --> 04:45.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON FOLKS AND WITHOUT

04:45.385 --> 04:47.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:50.323 --> 04:51.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DESCRIBED HIS ACTIONS AS

04:51.625 --> 04:53.360 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INAPPROPRIATE BECAUSE THESE ARE

LEAST ON A CURSORY BASIS

05:07.073 --> 05:08.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DETERMINED THAT THEY COULD BE

05:08.475 --> 05:09.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERTINENT.

05:09.176 --> 05:10.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY FLAGGED IT UP THE FOOD

05:10.110 --> 05:12.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHAIN, AND DIRECTOR COMEY SAID

05:12.512 --> 05:15.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HE WANTED TO SEEK ACCESS TO

05:15.115 --> 05:15.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE.

05:15.682 --> 05:16.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT MEANS GETS A SUBPOENA

05:16.950 --> 05:18.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THESE... THIS CASE, THIS

05:28.595 --> 05:30.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PREVIOUSLY ABOUT THE E-MAILS,

05:30.063 --> 05:31.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY KIND OF HAD A WAIT-AND-SEE

05:31.531 --> 05:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO SEE IF THIS SMOKE TURNED INTO

05:33.300 --> 05:34.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A FULL FLAME.

05:34.134 --> 05:36.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY CAME RIGHT BACK AT THIS

05:36.836 --> 05:37.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMMEDIATELY IN A WAY WE HADN'T

05:37.971 --> 05:39.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEN IN... THROUGHOUT THE

05:39.739 --> 05:40.907 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAMPAIGN, REALLY.

05:40.907 --> 05:42.742 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT WAS?

05:42.742 --> 05:44.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WHAT MY SOURCES AROUND THE

05:44.444 --> 05:45.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAMPAIGN TELL ME THAT THEY ARE

05:45.612 --> 05:47.881 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORRIED ABOUT IS GIVE MOMENTUM

05:47.881 --> 05:49.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO DONALD TRUMP AND ALLOW HIM

05:49.716 --> 05:51.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO LEAN HEAVILY ON HIS VOTERS TO

05:51.151 --> 05:52.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRY TO GET THEM OUT TO VOTE WITH

05:52.919 --> 05:54.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IDEA THAT THE SYSTEM WAS

05:54.321 --> 05:55.589 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGGED OR THAT HILLARY CLINTON

05:55.589 --> 05:58.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS CORRUPT, AND THEY'RE

05:58.091 --> 05:59.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCERNED THAT THIS GIVES HIM

05:59.593 --> 06:01.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE AMMUNITION TO DO SO WITHOUT

WHAT THESE E-MAILS SAY, THAT

06:05.332 --> 06:07.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY BELIEVE WILL EXONERATE HER

06:07.467 --> 06:09.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HUMA ABEDIN IN THIS CASE.

06:09.903 --> 06:10.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

06:10.837 --> 06:12.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOES ANY OF THIS GET RESOLVED

06:12.339 --> 06:13.907 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEFORE NOVEMBER 8?

06:13.907 --> 06:14.908 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> DIRECTOR COMEY HAS CERTAINLY

06:14.908 --> 06:16.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CREATED A SITUATION WHERE IS

06:16.476 --> 06:17.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDER PRESSURE NOW.

06:17.777 --> 06:19.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE'S SORT OF CREATED PRESSURE ON

HIMSELF TO RELEASE ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION.

06:22.282 --> 06:23.250 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS

06:23.250 --> 06:24.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESSURING HIM.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS ARE PRESSURING HIM.

06:25.785 --> 06:27.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, I THINK WE HAVEN'T HEARD THE

06:27.087 --> 06:28.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAST FROM HIM BEFORE THE

06:28.688 --> 06:29.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

20:49.415 --> 20:50.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IF THERE ARE THESE KINDS OF

20:58.090 --> 21:00.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM THAT

WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT AND

21:01.160 --> 21:02.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY DO NEED

21:06.298 --> 21:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS HACKING AN ISSUE?

21:07.733 --> 21:08.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HACKING OF A VOTING MACHINE?

21:08.968 --> 21:10.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

21:10.035 --> 21:11.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT

21:11.170 --> 21:12.771 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE NEED TO BE CONCERNED

21:12.771 --> 21:13.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT.

21:13.405 --> 21:16.709 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WERE REPORTS OF HACKERS

21:16.709 --> 21:19.178 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

20 STATES EARLIER, AND THAT'S

21:22.915 --> 21:25.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MADE PEOPLE REALLY WORRIED.

21:25.518 --> 21:27.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WE ARE ABLE TO DETECT THOSE.

21:27.453 --> 21:28.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WAS NO TAMPERING.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.156 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, VOTER

21:30.156 --> 21:31.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REGISTRATION DATABASES ARE

21:31.290 --> 21:33.425 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET.

21:33.425 --> 21:35.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTING MACHINES SHOULD NEVER BE,

21:35.361 --> 21:37.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH MEANS THAT NO ONE SITTING

21:37.229 --> 21:38.497 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN A BASEMENT IN MOSCOW OR

21:38.497 --> 21:40.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYONE ELSE SHOULD BE ABLE TO

ACCESS YOUR VOTING MACHINE.

21:41.367 --> 21:42.701 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT

21:42.701 --> 21:44.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECURITY EXPERTS THINK IS A

21:44.036 --> 21:46.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
