JUDY WOODRUFF: Good
evening. I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.807 --> 00:08.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:08.876 --> 00:12.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight, we continue our
on-the-ground reporting from

00:12.479 --> 00:16.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
France on the fallout
from last week's terror.

00:16.416 --> 00:19.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: I'm Hari
Sreenivasan in Paris with the
latest on the investigation

00:19.553 --> 00:23.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
into the attacks and the
ongoing campaign against ISIS.

00:23.724 --> 00:28.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead this
Tuesday, we talk to presidential
candidates Ben Carson and

00:28.996 --> 00:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bernie Sanders about whether, in
the wake of the Paris attacks,
the U.S. should withdraw

00:33.400 --> 00:36.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
its welcome mat for
Syrian refugees.

00:36.637 --> 00:42.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And teaching kids
to kill. We get a rare look
inside an ISIS training

00:42.342 --> 00:46.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
camp for children
in Afghanistan.

00:46.179 --> 00:52.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NAJIBULLAH QURAISHI, Journalist:
It was really, really shocking
to see these young children.

00:52.352 --> 00:59.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were learning how to kill
and what is jihad and how to use
the weapons.

00:59.026 --> 01:05.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:05.666 --> 01:09.970 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:09.970 --> 01:19.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The manhunt
widened in France today for
suspects in the Paris attacks
that

01:19.713 --> 01:25.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
killed 129 people. And as the
investigation intensified, so
did military action by France

01:25.819 --> 01:28.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and now Russia as well.

01:28.555 --> 01:30.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hari Sreenivasan is
in Paris tonight.

01:30.891 --> 01:34.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thanks, Judy.

01:34.494 --> 01:39.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The search did widen for
suspects today, as did the
retaliation against the Islamic
State.

01:39.833 --> 01:43.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a country in mourning in
some ways, but it's also trying
to strike a balance between

01:43.770 --> 01:50.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
freedom and security
of movement.

01:50.544 --> 01:54.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
French police conducted dozens
more raids overnight, and they
announced a possible second

01:54.748 --> 01:59.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fugitive in Friday night's
attacks may be on the loose.
That's in addition to
26-year-old

01:59.319 --> 02:03.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Salah Abdeslam, who is already
being hunted. Equally elusive is
what drove those in the

02:03.991 --> 02:06.326 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
plot.

02:06.326 --> 02:09.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One neighbor of a dead attacker,
28-year-old Sami Amimour, said
he'd been a bus driver,

02:09.863 --> 02:12.599 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but had lost his job.

02:12.599 --> 02:17.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We
never thought he would do that,
never, ever. It's because

02:17.204 --> 02:20.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the people around him. But
then he got fired from his job.
And because of that, he

02:20.841 --> 02:25.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
started to attend mosques more
and more often. I heard he was
under police surveillance.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.881 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He couldn't leave the
neighborhood. He had to check
off every day. And then he went
to

02:27.881 --> 02:29.850 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Syria.

02:29.850 --> 02:34.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANCOIS HOLLANDE, French
President: (through translator):
These fanatics attack the living

02:34.488 --> 02:39.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the dead, all who have
humanity today and tomorrow and
those of yesterday.

02:39.359 --> 02:43.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: President
Francois Hollande has called for
stepped up security measures,

02:43.163 --> 02:47.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but today he again declared
France's determination to remain
an open society.

02:47.834 --> 02:51.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANCOIS HOLLANDE (through
translator): They wanted to
weaken the French passion to
welcome

02:51.605 --> 02:57.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the world to its doorstep,
diminish the pride that we have
as a country that exchanges with

02:57.277 --> 03:02.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all cultures. They have already
lost that fight, as, today,
France, by standing up firm,

03:02.115 --> 03:04.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
determined against terror.

03:04.785 --> 03:10.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This as French
planes also hit the Islamic
State's makeshift capital

03:10.290 --> 03:15.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Raqqa in Syria with more
bombing runs. And in Brussels,
the French defense minister

03:15.595 --> 03:21.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
invoked a never-before-used
mutual defense provision in the
European Union charter. All

03:21.401 --> 03:25.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
27 other E.U. countries
responded favorably, meaning
they would provide all aid and
assistance

03:25.138 --> 03:27.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
within their power.

03:27.507 --> 03:30.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEAN-YVES LE DRIAN, French
Defense Minister (through
translator): It's the very first

03:30.277 --> 03:34.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time it's been used. I feel that
that's an important point to
make. Now, what's this

03:34.514 --> 03:38.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually going to mean in
practice? Well, either taking
part in France's operations

03:38.485 --> 03:43.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Syria or Iraq, or by easing
the load or providing support
for France in other operations,

03:43.090 --> 03:45.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
so, lightening our load
elsewhere. What I have said to
my colleagues is that France

03:45.559 --> 03:48.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can't do everything.

03:48.028 --> 03:51.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: While
Parisians are nearly unanimous
in their grief and support for
victims

03:51.731 --> 03:56.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the attack, they are less
so to France's response.

03:56.803 --> 04:01.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Parisians have heard of the air
raids in Syria by France over
the last 24 hours. Some, like

04:01.908 --> 04:05.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
23-year-old Yassine Doublali,
see it as necessary.

04:05.011 --> 04:09.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
YASSINE DOUBLALI, France
(through translator): We just
don't have a choice anymore.
We're

04:09.683 --> 04:13.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there. We are facing events we
have never faced before. Men are
blowing themselves up,

04:13.787 --> 04:16.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
using heavy weapons, those used
in a war, so we have to respond
with heavy means as

04:16.423 --> 04:18.658 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
well.

04:18.658 --> 04:23.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
Sixty--year-old Agnes
Hontebeyrie thinks it doesn't go
far enough.

04:23.897 --> 04:30.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AGNES HONTEBEYRIE, France
(through translator): Only a war
on foot, on the ground, send
troops

04:30.036 --> 04:35.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there. That's the only way now
to end this horrific conflict.
My feeling just, like before

04:35.342 --> 04:39.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
World War II, when Churchill
said you wanted peace, you got
war, that's exactly what this

04:39.146 --> 04:41.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
makes me think of.

04:41.515 --> 04:44.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Francois Folch
thinks the bombing will not be
effective unless it is

04:44.784 --> 04:47.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
part of a coalition approach.

04:47.454 --> 04:58.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANCOIS FOLCH, France: I don't
think this Islamic State is a
real danger. I don't think

04:58.932 --> 05:09.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so. There's one condition.
Everyone has to get together,
Obama, Putin, Cameron, Merkel.

05:09.709 --> 05:12.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And if we are together,
it's nothing.

05:12.546 --> 05:16.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Diane Baiga
says the air raids won't fix the
problems.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIANE BAIGA, France (through
translator): I think that we
won't solve what's happening

05:19.386 --> 05:21.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in France by bombings.

05:21.821 --> 05:25.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: She says
tighter border controls and
stopping arms sales to conflict

05:25.559 --> 05:29.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regions would be more effective
in preventing this, but,
otherwise, she doesn't think her

05:29.429 --> 05:32.966 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
son is any safer
today than Friday.

05:32.966 --> 05:37.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DIANE BAIGA (through
translator): I don't see how
they could protect me, and
protect

05:37.404 --> 05:42.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my son, adding soldiers in the
streets? Me? That scares me,
because, today, I don't see

05:42.609 --> 05:46.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what kind of answer
they can provide.

05:46.079 --> 05:52.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Russia also
hammered targets in Syria
purportedly tied to ISIL with
renewed

05:52.319 --> 05:57.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fury today, using fighter
aircraft and cruise missiles
launched from bombers and
submarines,

05:57.891 --> 06:02.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this after Russian investigators
concluded a Russian passenger
plane flying over Egypt

06:02.562 --> 06:09.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
late last month was bombed,
killing 224 aboard. Almost all
were Russians.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
National television showed the
chief of Russia's federal
security service briefing a
grim-faced

06:12.439 --> 06:15.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
President Vladimir Putin.

06:15.141 --> 06:19.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXANDER BORTNIKOV, Director,
Federal Security Service
(through translator): Vladimir
Vladimirovich,

06:19.012 --> 06:23.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
according to analysis by our
specialists, a homemade bomb
containing up to one kilogram

06:23.316 --> 06:27.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of TNT detonated during the
flight, causing the plane to
break up in midair. We can
unequivocally

06:27.354 --> 06:30.223 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
say it was a terrorist attack.

06:30.223 --> 06:34.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Putin set a
$50 million reward for
information that leads to the
arrest

06:34.527 --> 06:39.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the attackers. And he pledged
those responsible would be
found.

06:39.032 --> 06:42.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through translator):
We will search for them
everywhere

06:42.902 --> 06:47.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wherever they are hiding. We
will find them in any spot on
the planet and punish them.

06:47.574 --> 06:51.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Later, Putin
sat with his defense minister
for an elaborate briefing

06:51.544 --> 06:56.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at a military command center
with generals updating him on
the progress of airstrikes.

06:56.182 --> 07:01.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, he ordered his military to
begin operations in concert with
the French.

07:01.288 --> 07:07.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN (through
translator): Very soon, a French
navy group headed by an aircraft

07:07.694 --> 07:12.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
carrier will arrive in your area
of operation. You need to
establish a direct contact with

07:12.599 --> 07:16.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the French and work with them as
with allies. It is necessary to
work out a joint action

07:16.703 --> 07:20.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
plan with them, both
at sea and in the air.

07:20.073 --> 07:24.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In Washington,
Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook
said the U.S. will not

07:24.878 --> 07:29.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be coordinating with Russia on
its air campaign because of
Russia's continued support for

07:29.015 --> 07:31.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Syrian regime
of Bashar al-Assad.

07:31.718 --> 07:35.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER COOK, Pentagon Press
Secretary: If the Russians would
like to focus their efforts

07:35.622 --> 07:42.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on ISIL, which is the thrust of
our efforts in terms of the
coalition, we'd welcome that.

07:42.028 --> 07:48.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's been no additional talk
of further cooperation or
coordination with the Russians

07:48.501 --> 07:53.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at this point. Their policies of
supporting the Assad regime
continue, in our view, to

07:53.707 --> 07:55.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be counterproductive.

07:55.809 --> 08:00.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Back in Paris,
Secretary of State Kerry did
promise increased coordination

08:00.380 --> 08:04.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the French on attacking
ISIL, which he called by its
Arabic acronym, Da'esh

08:04.250 --> 08:09.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: We have to step up our
efforts to hit them at the

08:09.022 --> 08:13.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
core, where they're planning
these things, and also obviously
to do more on borders and

08:13.927 --> 08:17.497 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
in terms of the
movement of people.

08:17.497 --> 08:23.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the level of cooperation
could not be higher. We have
agreed even to exchange more

08:23.837 --> 08:30.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
information. And I'm convinced
that over the course of the next
weeks, Da'esh will feel

08:30.110 --> 08:32.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even greater pressure. They are
feeling it today, they felt it
yesterday, they felt it

08:32.445 --> 08:34.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the past weeks.

08:34.981 --> 08:39.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But Europe is
also feeling pressure. A soccer
match in Germany was canceled

08:39.786 --> 08:44.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today after police reported a
possible plot to bomb the
stadium in Hannover. Later,
officials

08:44.124 --> 08:49.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said they found no explosives
and made no arrests.

08:49.095 --> 08:55.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Picking up on
what you were describing is
going on now in France, we
understand

08:55.368 --> 08:59.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there's just been, just in the
last few minutes, been police
activity there at the Place de

08:59.205 --> 09:01.674 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
la Republique.

09:01.674 --> 09:05.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes, Judy, if
I looked a little distracted a
few minutes ago, it's

09:05.745 --> 09:08.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because there was a flurry of
police activity off in the
corner.

09:08.381 --> 09:12.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they just arrested three
males in a car that had Belgian
plates. It was guys with

09:12.051 --> 09:17.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
balaclavas that were part of the
French special police. And we
don't actually know if those

09:17.657 --> 09:22.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
particular individuals were
guilty of anything other than, I
don't know, speeding.

09:22.028 --> 09:26.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, technically speaking, the
special police don't come out
just for any old reason. And

09:26.599 --> 09:30.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now you wouldn't even know that
there were any police activity
there at all.

09:30.770 --> 09:35.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And again this is just kind of
the climate and how tense
everyone is around here. In

09:35.942 --> 09:40.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the past two days, now everyone
looks around the corner when
they hear police cars whizzing

09:40.947 --> 09:44.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by. I'm sure this is a big city.
Police cars whiz by all the time
with their sirens on,

09:44.484 --> 09:47.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but now it takes kind of a
different meaning for people.

09:47.654 --> 09:54.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was having dinner the other
night and something hit an
awning on top of the
restaurant's -- and

09:54.160 --> 09:59.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
literally a woman just fell flat
on the floor because she was
still so nervous. She didn't

09:59.232 --> 10:03.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know what was happening. She
didn't know whether it was a
shot somewhere, and you saw
other

10:03.536 --> 10:05.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
people in the restaurant
immediately knew what she was
going through and went over to

10:05.638 --> 10:07.640 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
comfort her.

10:07.640 --> 10:10.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there is just a certain
tension in the air that I can't
describe.

10:10.743 --> 10:14.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, Hari, we
understand the French Parliament
is convening tomorrow. What's

10:14.814 --> 10:17.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that about? What's
on the agenda?

10:17.784 --> 10:23.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, Francois
Hollande wants the Parliament to
extend the state of emergency

10:23.556 --> 10:26.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for an extra three months. He
declared it Friday right after
the attacks. And this is

10:26.759 --> 10:30.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
perhaps one of the first
political tests. Right?

10:30.630 --> 10:36.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Imagine right after 9/11 if all
of Congress met and they started
to have a debate on extending

10:36.202 --> 10:41.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or changing the Constitution,
perhaps, or extending emergency
powers. Would there be

10:41.107 --> 10:45.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a tremendous amount of debate at
that point or is that the point
where members of Congress

10:45.278 --> 10:48.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or in this case members of
Parliament will show a unified
face?

10:48.982 --> 10:54.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is a country, like --
that values its liberties, that
values the democracy,

10:54.087 --> 10:58.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and this is also right now a
country that wakes up and in the
morning they pick up a

10:58.191 --> 11:01.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
paper and they read there were
168 raids the night before,
there were 120 other raids the

11:01.895 --> 11:05.665 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
other night.

11:05.665 --> 11:10.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At what point do people start
asking the government more
difficult questions about
accountability

11:10.403 --> 11:12.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and exactly who's being arrested
and why are they being rounded
that, what's the evidence

11:12.705 --> 11:15.475 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that you have?

11:15.475 --> 11:18.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think it's an interesting
political test. They might not
vote on it tomorrow, but
Hollande

11:18.845 --> 11:21.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wants this extension by
the end of the week.

11:21.614 --> 11:27.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Hari, here in
the U.S., these attacks have
sparked, as you know, a

11:27.353 --> 11:31.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
big political conversation about
what to do about refugees.
What's the discussion like

11:31.324 --> 11:33.993 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there?

11:33.993 --> 11:38.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It's
interesting. The more
information comes out, the more
the average

11:38.831 --> 11:42.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
public at least we meet on the
street is able to discern the
information.

11:42.335 --> 11:45.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the individuals that we
had in our story tonight, he
said something that was

11:45.905 --> 11:49.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interesting. He said, you know,
the enemy is invisible. They
could be the Frenchmen

11:49.509 --> 11:51.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that are next to us.

11:51.911 --> 11:55.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that was informed by the
fact that he knew in the last
couple of days that some

11:55.915 --> 11:59.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of these attackers were
French-born, they spoke French,
they were Frenchmen for all

11:59.786 --> 12:05.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
practical purposes. But, in the
first few hours, the piece of
information that everyone

12:05.959 --> 12:11.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
grabbed on to was the fact that
one of these individuals had a
Syrian passport, a passport

12:11.264 --> 12:14.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that had been checked in from
Greece, that this was a strong
connection to the migrant

12:14.601 --> 12:18.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
crisis, that this was --
that was the problem.

12:18.037 --> 12:23.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now just even a few days
later, you see people start to
slice and dice a little bit

12:23.009 --> 12:27.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more and say, OK, perhaps the
migrant crisis is a different
conversation, maybe there are

12:27.814 --> 12:32.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
overlaps here, but let's not
just start to lump everything
into the same category.

12:32.018 --> 12:33.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that I think just happens.
The more informed they are, the
better decisions they are able

12:33.853 --> 12:36.055 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to make.

12:36.055 --> 12:40.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hari Sreenivasan
reporting for us again from
Paris, we thank you.

12:40.493 --> 12:46.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the day's other
news: The United Nations refugee
agency warned against closing

12:46.332 --> 12:50.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
borders to migrants in the wake
of the Paris attacks. That comes
amid calls in parts of

12:50.436 --> 12:53.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Europe to halt resettlement
of thousands of people.

12:53.773 --> 12:57.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A U.N. spokeswoman in Geneva
said the migrants shouldn't be
punished.

12:57.777 --> 13:01.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MELISSA FLEMING, Spokesman, U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees:
We are also deeply disturbed

13:01.080 --> 13:07.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by language that demonizes
refugees as a group. This is
dangerous and it will contribute
to

13:07.954 --> 13:15.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
xenophobia and fear. The
security problems Europe faces
are highly complex. And
refugees,

13:15.361 --> 13:19.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we believe, shouldn't turn into
scapegoats. And they must not
become secondary victims

13:19.832 --> 13:22.669 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of these most tragic events.

13:22.669 --> 13:28.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: The British
government said today it will
not impose new curbs on refugee
admissions.

13:28.207 --> 13:33.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Canada's newly
elected prime minister, Justin
Trudeau, insisted today that

13:33.880 --> 13:40.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he will stick with a plan to
take inn 25,000 Syrian refugees
by January 1. That's despite

13:40.920 --> 13:47.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
growing criticism in his country
since the Paris attacks that the
number is too large.

13:47.126 --> 13:51.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trudeau has also said he will
keep a promise to withdraw
Canadian warplanes from the
campaign

13:51.130 --> 13:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
against Islamic State forces.

13:54.100 --> 13:59.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We will turn to the U.S.
political reaction to Paris
after the news summary.

13:59.005 --> 14:04.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: In Kosovo,
opposition lawmakers used
drastic action to protest
treaties with

14:04.711 --> 14:09.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Serbia and Montenegro. Albin
Kurti, leader of the opposition,
fired off pepper spray

14:09.649 --> 14:13.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at government ministers,
forcing them to flee.

14:13.920 --> 14:20.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Outside, police used tear gas to
stop rock-throwing protesters
from breaking in. The treaties

14:20.293 --> 14:23.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the center of the dispute
grant greater rights to ethnic
Serbs and resolve a border

14:23.763 --> 14:25.798 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
dispute.

14:25.798 --> 14:30.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tensions between
China and its neighbors
overshadowed the start of an

14:30.369 --> 14:36.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Asian-Pacific summit in the
Philippines today. China exerts
claims to nearly all of the
South

14:36.242 --> 14:40.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
China Sea, and has built
artificial islands, over the
protests of five Asian nations
and

14:40.847 --> 14:43.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the United States.

14:43.616 --> 14:48.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After arriving in Manila,
President Obama reinforced the
U.S. position, touring a former

14:48.321 --> 14:52.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
American warship that's now
in the Philippine navy.

14:52.158 --> 14:55.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: The United States
has been committed to the

14:55.161 --> 15:01.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
security of this region for more
than 70 years. We have a treaty
obligation, an ironclad
commitment

15:01.968 --> 15:08.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the defense of our ally the
Philippines, who can count on
the United States. My visit

15:08.641 --> 15:12.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here underscores our shared
commitment to the security of
the waters of this region

15:12.278 --> 15:15.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and to the freedom
of navigation.

15:15.314 --> 15:18.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president
also announced that the U.S.
will transfer two additional

15:18.451 --> 15:21.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
warships to the Philippines.

GWEN IFILL: Back in this
country, winter arrived early in
Colorado today, as part of a
major

15:26.526 --> 15:31.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
storm system that's pushing
east. Blizzard conditions made
for treacherous travel around

15:31.998 --> 15:37.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Denver, and closed much of the
state's main east-west highway.
More than a foot of snow

15:37.170 --> 15:41.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
was expected in parts of
Colorado and Kansas. The storm
system also canceled more than a

15:41.941 --> 15:45.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hundred flights at Denver
International Airport.

15:45.845 --> 15:52.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Salt Lake City,
Utah, has elected its first
openly gay mayor. Former
Democratic

15:52.251 --> 15:59.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

beat out two-term incumbent
Mayor Ralph Becker in official
results

15:59.058 --> 16:04.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
announced today. Salt Lake City
is home to the Mormon Church,
which recently banned baptisms

16:04.263 --> 16:10.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for children of gay couples, and
disavowed same-sex
relationships.

16:10.236 --> 16:14.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Wall Street, stocks
struggled to make headway in the
face of mixed results from

16:14.974 --> 16:21.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
big retailers. The Dow Jones
industrial average added just
six points to close at 17489.
The

16:21.347 --> 16:26.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

the S&amp;P 500 lost two points.

16:46.272 --> 16:59.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We return now to the
fight against the Islamic State
group in Syria.

16:59.185 --> 17:04.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As we reported, Russian
President Vladimir Putin ordered
Russian military forces to
cooperate

17:04.457 --> 17:09.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the French military, as
both countries bombed targets in
Syria today. But what are

17:09.829 --> 17:13.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the prospects of cooperating
with Russia to end the Syrian
conflict?

17:13.099 --> 17:16.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We get two views.

17:16.068 --> 17:21.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Evelyn Farkas was deputy
assistant secretary of defense
for Russia and Eurasia from 2012

17:21.674 --> 17:25.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to earlier this year. And Vali

17:29.015 --> 17:33.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Vali Nasr, let's talk about
timing. Why the stepped-up
action by Russia now?

17:33.853 --> 17:36.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VALI NASR, School of Advanced
International Studies, Johns
Hopkins University: Well, they

17:36.522 --> 17:41.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had the attack on their plane in
Sinai and the attack in Paris.
It actually gives them

17:41.694 --> 17:46.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an opportunity to argue that
ISIS should be the top priority
for the international community

17:46.699 --> 17:48.601 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Syria.

17:48.601 --> 17:53.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Putin has been arguing this all
along. He doesn't have many
people actually taking this

17:53.639 --> 17:58.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at face value. Now he sees an
opportunity, given what's
happened in Paris, to align
European

17:58.878 --> 18:03.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
positions with himself. So
he's stepping up pressure.

18:03.249 --> 18:08.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But Putin didn't
acknowledge until today that
there was even terrorism

18:08.321 --> 18:12.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the shoot-down or whatever
happened to the Metrojet plane
over the Sinai. Is he to

18:12.358 --> 18:14.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be trusted on this?

18:14.427 --> 18:19.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VALI NASR: Well, what we can see
is that Paris has been a
game-changer.

18:19.799 --> 18:25.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has shifted the focus in
Europe and potentially the
United States on ISIS. This
actually gives

18:25.604 --> 18:30.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia an opportunity to align
its Syria policy with that of
the West, so let's say to find

18:30.743 --> 18:33.045 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a common ground.

18:33.045 --> 18:37.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it makes sense for him, ahead
of meeting with President
Hollande, to say, we're both

18:37.316 --> 18:41.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
facing the same problem. This
happened to me in Sinai. This
has happened to you in Paris.

18:41.687 --> 18:44.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let's coordinate and
cooperate on this.

18:44.690 --> 18:49.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, Evelyn Farkas,
we have common interests,
theoretically, and, therefore,

18:49.628 --> 18:52.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strange bedfellows can get
together. Is this a brand-new
day when it comes to the
U.S.-Russia-France

18:52.331 --> 18:54.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
relationship?

18:54.233 --> 18:59.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EVELYN FARKAS, Former Defense
Department Official: Sadly,
Gwen, I don't think so.

18:59.238 --> 19:03.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it is an opportunity for
the Russians to acknowledge that
we have a shared foe,

19:03.642 --> 19:08.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if we will, in ISIS, Da'esh,
ISIL, whatever you want to call
it. The Russians have been

19:08.748 --> 19:11.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying that rhetorically for
quite some time. In fact, they
have been talking about
combating

19:11.083 --> 19:14.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
terrorism with us for years now.

19:14.320 --> 19:18.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think the proof will
really be in what they hit and
not just tonight, but moving

19:18.057 --> 19:21.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
into the weeks and the
next couple of days.

19:21.927 --> 19:25.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: What should be the
United States be doing with
this, what feels not quite like

19:25.498 --> 19:28.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an olive branch but at least
a reach-out from Russia?

19:28.768 --> 19:32.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EVELYN FARKAS: I think we should
try. We should always try to
cooperate with Russia, but I'm

19:32.638 --> 19:37.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
skeptical, because essentially
our objectives in Syria and
actually beyond Syria are not

19:37.009 --> 19:39.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
aligned with Russia's

19:39.278 --> 19:43.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And until they're aligned, until
one side or other or both sides
can compromise, I think

19:43.916 --> 19:47.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there will be limits to any kind
of cooperation we can have with
Russia.

19:47.953 --> 19:51.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In fact, Vali Nasr,
Vladimir Putin has accused the
U.S. in the past of playing

19:51.323 --> 19:54.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a double game when it comes to
the Middle East. What's changed?

19:54.960 --> 19:59.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VALI NASR: Well, nothing has
changed, in the sense that our
position, as Evelyn says, is

19:59.832 --> 20:03.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very different from Russia's,
not only in the Middle East, but
beyond.

20:03.702 --> 20:08.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there is a lot of pressure
now on European governments and
also on the U.S. government

20:08.841 --> 20:13.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to find a way to address the
ISIS problem. We're seeing the
receding of the importance

20:13.746 --> 20:18.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Assad in resolution of the --
the immediate resolution of the
Syria crisis and addressing

20:18.551 --> 20:23.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S. and Europe's security
problems compared to ISIS.

20:23.756 --> 20:28.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in the military arena, we
have one set of problems
actually working with the
Russians,

20:28.627 --> 20:32.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in that we don't know what
they're hitting, what they will
do. But then there is the
diplomatic

20:32.531 --> 20:38.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
front in Vienna. And I think
Putin is counting on the fact
that the Europeans now feel
pressure

20:38.003 --> 20:41.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that this war has to end more
quickly or we should get to a
cease-fire.

20:41.974 --> 20:45.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is not going to happen by
insisting on Assad going. It
will happen by creating some

20:45.277 --> 20:47.680 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
common ground around ISIS.

20:47.680 --> 20:52.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Have we reached a
point where any road to peace or
at least road to cooperation

20:52.084 --> 20:54.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has to run through Moscow?

20:54.220 --> 20:56.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VALI NASR: Well, I think that's
what they want. They want to
position themselves in

20:56.956 --> 21:00.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
there. They're in Syria.

21:00.926 --> 21:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They can provide underground
military operations, which the
U.S. and the Europeans don't
want

21:06.866 --> 21:14.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do right now, but also
getting a common language on
ISIS helps the Russians to
isolate

21:14.874 --> 21:21.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Turks and Saudi Arabia, which
still are insisting that the
problem is Assad, not ISIS.

21:21.480 --> 21:26.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of this is basically
positioning. And not much may
happen in the actual fighting,

21:26.418 --> 21:31.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but I think Putin finds a lot
more room to argue that I told
you so two years ago, this

21:31.924 --> 21:35.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is about terrorism, you wouldn't
believe me, it's not about
Assad, and if you want this

21:35.227 --> 21:38.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
thing to go away, we
should all focus on ISIS.

21:38.497 --> 21:43.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Evelyn Farkas, do
you agree that we have now moved
past the argument about

21:43.335 --> 21:49.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Assad and that, even though the
U.S. and France are on one side
and that Russia is on the

21:49.241 --> 21:52.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other side, that there has
to be some other pathway?

21:52.845 --> 21:57.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EVELYN FARKAS: I mean, I don't
think that we're aligned with
Russia yet. We really have

21:57.016 --> 21:59.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a disagreement, a fundamental
disagreement on Assad.

21:59.919 --> 22:06.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So until that bridge is -- until
that gap is bridged, which will
happen through diplomacy,

22:06.091 --> 22:12.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we won't see real change. We can
bomb ISIL, Da'esh, et cetera.
The Russians can bomb them.

22:12.998 --> 22:18.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it's still not going to
change the ultimate outcome.

22:18.237 --> 22:23.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the other thing is that,
right now, Russia wants a
resolution, because, right now,
they're

22:23.042 --> 22:25.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
probably at the peak of their
military engagement. I don't
know, quite frankly, how much
longer

22:25.444 --> 22:27.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they can sustain this.

22:27.813 --> 22:32.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It wasn't long ago
that we were talking about a
proxy war in Syria with the

22:32.351 --> 22:36.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. on one side, Russia on the
other, and the potential, I
don't know, for us shooting

22:36.121 --> 22:39.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
each other out of the sky and
the whole thing escalating. Has
that now gone away if we sit

22:39.325 --> 22:41.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
down at the same table?

22:41.827 --> 22:45.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALI NASR: No, I mean, on the
military arena, there are
certain things have to happen
about

22:45.464 --> 22:49.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deconflicting and then getting
our at least targets aligned.

22:49.935 --> 22:55.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's in Vienna that we
might see the greatest amount of
movement. Namely, if the

22:55.374 --> 23:00.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Europeans and the Americans come
with an attitude of let us try
to find a compromise around

23:00.980 --> 23:07.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when will Assad go, how can we
bring a certain number of the
opposition forces into alignment

23:07.219 --> 23:12.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the Syrian government to
create a united front to fight
ISIS, there might be movement

23:12.124 --> 23:13.626 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

23:13.626 --> 23:18.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think what Russia would like
is to move the U.S. and European
positions closer to

23:18.964 --> 23:23.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
themselves and break them off
from Turkey and Saudi Arabia,
which are still, if you

23:23.802 --> 23:27.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want to call it, are holding to
the line that this is about
Assad, Assad must go before

23:27.573 --> 23:29.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we do anything else.

23:29.708 --> 23:32.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But at what price?
This is not the only agreement
that the U.S. and Russia

23:32.177 --> 23:33.112 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
have.

23:33.112 --> 23:34.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EVELYN FARKAS: Well, that's
what I was going to say.

23:34.980 --> 23:40.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think he's also trying to very
cleverly create a divide between
us and our European

23:40.185 --> 23:44.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
allies. And that gets to a whole
context that's not even being
addressed here, which is what's

23:44.023 --> 23:47.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
happening in Europe, and
Ukraine-Russia, relations, et
cetera.

23:47.926 --> 23:53.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think that he has cleverly
-- he used the word treat them
as allies to his military

23:53.032 --> 23:57.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
folks when he was instructing
them about engaging with the
French navy. Treat them as
allies.

23:57.002 --> 24:00.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, the French actually have
allies. They have -- they're
part of a 28-member alliance

24:00.906 --> 24:05.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
called NATO. They're part of the
E.U. Russia is not their ally.

24:05.210 --> 24:11.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that's a little bit of
an exuberant sort of
exaggeration to call the French
the

24:11.016 --> 24:14.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian allies. But I think this
is Putin being very clever and
he's trying to create

24:14.853 --> 24:17.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some distance and pull off
the French towards himself.

24:17.990 --> 24:21.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And yet, next week,
we're going to see Francois
Hollande, who you say is not

24:21.327 --> 24:26.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an ally of Vladimir Putin and of
Russia, going to Moscow to meet,
also coming to the U.S.

24:26.465 --> 24:30.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to meet with President Obama,
trying to straddle that
difference.

24:30.803 --> 24:35.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALI NASR: Well, I think there
is to be military and
intelligence cooperation
discussions.

24:35.107 --> 24:39.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But beyond that, I think the key
question is Europe -- is this,
is that you can't really

24:39.445 --> 24:43.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fight ISIS until you end this
war, so how are you going to end
this war? And I think

24:43.682 --> 24:47.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the proposal Putin is giving
everybody is that you're not
going to fight -- you're not

24:47.920 --> 24:51.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to get rid of Assad
anymore, because I'm protecting
him sitting here. And the only

24:51.590 --> 24:55.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way this war is going to end is
if we arrive at a compromise.

24:55.728 --> 25:00.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think he's going to try to
persuade President Hollande to
agree to a formula, that then

25:00.632 --> 25:04.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Hollande when he meets
with President Obama will try to
sell it to Washington. And

25:04.703 --> 25:06.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if they're successful, then that
becomes the position in Vienna
around which there might

25:06.672 --> 25:08.407 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be a compromise.

25:08.407 --> 25:10.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Does that sound
reassuring to -- reassuring to
you?

25:10.876 --> 25:13.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EVELYN FARKAS: That sounds not
reassuring, not reassuring, but
it sounds reasonable.

25:13.779 --> 25:17.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It sounds like the course that
he would take. And I can't say
whether we would compromise

25:17.116 --> 25:17.383 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or not.

25:17.383 --> 25:18.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

25:18.751 --> 25:21.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But is that worth
the paper it's written on, is
the question.

25:21.587 --> 25:24.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EVELYN FARKAS: Well, in terms of
the Russians, I think you have
to be really careful.

25:24.890 --> 25:29.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as I said, you have to
watch what they're hitting, what
they're not hitting and really

25:29.695 --> 25:32.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
test them, because, for a long
time, they have been talking
about cooperating with us,

25:32.765 --> 25:35.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but we have never really
seen it in action.

GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate: And once
we have a rational program and
we

26:31.223 --> 26:38.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can determine who it is that's
coming, then it's another story.
But at this point in time,

26:38.497 --> 26:42.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in light of what we're seeing in
the world, it's reasonable to
stop.

26:42.434 --> 26:45.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Last night at a
rally in Tennessee, it was
Donald Trump.

26:45.604 --> 26:48.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: What I like is, build
a safe zone in Syria.

26:48.841 --> 26:53.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Build a big, beautiful safe
zone, and you have whatever it
is, so people can live and

26:53.378 --> 26:55.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they will be happier.

26:55.614 --> 27:00.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The U.S. has
let in around 2,500 refugees
from Syria in the past four

27:00.886 --> 27:07.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years. In September, President
Obama unveiled a plan to welcome
10,000 more by next fall.

27:07.125 --> 27:11.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's just a fraction of the
migrants fleeing the region, and
officials say they face the

27:11.864 --> 27:16.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
toughest vetting of any
immigrants to the U.S.

27:16.268 --> 27:21.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Typically, that can mean two
years of processing or more. But
governors do not trust the
process,

27:21.607 --> 27:25.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and in the wake of the Paris
attacks, more than two dozen say
they now oppose Syrian

27:25.611 --> 27:29.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
refugees moving to their states.

27:29.781 --> 27:34.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, governors technically
can't stop the federal
government from resettling
refugees

27:34.219 --> 27:39.191 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
within their borders. That means
all eyes are on Congress.

27:39.191 --> 27:43.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell today said he is
considering possible action.

27:43.262 --> 27:46.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader: What you're
hearing from all the governors

27:46.498 --> 27:53.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around the country, saying
they're not interested in taking
refugees from Syria for the
foreseeable

27:53.739 --> 28:01.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
future, the -- at the very
least, it strikes me that we
need a pause or a moratorium.

28:01.813 --> 28:06.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Paul Ryan, the
new speaker of the House, pushed
his Republican Conference

28:06.051 --> 28:09.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to come up with a
plan, and soon.

28:09.154 --> 28:11.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House: We have assembled
a task force starting Saturday

28:11.290 --> 28:14.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to consider legislation
as quickly as possible.

28:14.760 --> 28:18.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As Republicans
mustered to block refugees,
Attorney General Loretta Lynch

28:18.730 --> 28:22.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
defended the current system
today before a House panel.

28:22.301 --> 28:25.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LORETTA LYNCH, U.S. Attorney
General: There are challenges to
that process because of

28:25.971 --> 28:30.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the situation in Syria. But I
would note, however, that we do
have the benefit of having

28:30.242 --> 28:33.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that significant and robust
screening process in place.

28:33.612 --> 28:37.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In a blog post
late today, the White House said
it continues to look

28:37.316 --> 28:41.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for ways to improve the
vetting of Syrian refugees.

28:41.386 --> 28:44.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Lisa Desjardins.

28:44.623 --> 28:49.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The next person to
occupy the White House will
likely be faced with the

28:49.027 --> 28:52.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
continuing fallout from
this week's Paris attacks.

28:52.998 --> 28:56.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we are joined by two of
the presidential candidates to
hear how they would handle
terror

28:56.268 --> 28:59.438 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
threats at home and abroad.

28:59.438 --> 29:02.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We begin with Democratic
candidate Senator Bernie Sanders
of Vermont.

29:02.074 --> 29:03.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, Senator.

29:03.642 --> 29:05.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate: Good to
be with you.

29:05.544 --> 29:08.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the wake of the
Paris attacks, you have called
for what you describe as an

29:08.880 --> 29:12.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
international effort to
eliminate the stain of ISIS from
the world.

29:12.951 --> 29:15.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How would you do that?

29:15.420 --> 29:22.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: The good
news, in the midst of all of
this tragedy, is that countries

29:22.194 --> 29:26.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all over the world, whether it
is France, whether it is Russia,
whether it is the Muslim

29:26.531 --> 29:33.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
countries in the Gulf region,
we now have a common interest.

29:33.105 --> 29:40.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is to come together to
destroy this barbaric
organization called ISIS. And
what

29:40.178 --> 29:45.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has got to happen -- and I don't
suggest this is easy, but we
have got to overcome a lot

29:45.417 --> 29:50.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the internal squabbling and
disagreements which now exist.

29:50.155 --> 29:56.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
God knows the United States,
correctly, has strong
differences of opinion with
Russia.

29:56.161 --> 30:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iran and Saudi Arabia have very,
very strong differences of
opinion. But what leadership

30:02.100 --> 30:07.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
is about now is bringing
together all of these countries,
including the countries in the

30:07.839 --> 30:12.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gulf region who have the most to
lose, and to say, you know what,
we're going to work

30:12.577 --> 30:18.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on a coordinated military
strategy and a political
strategy to destroy ISIS.

30:18.483 --> 30:22.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what I have been saying
for a long time. And I believe
it is even truer today.

30:22.821 --> 30:27.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In your opinion, has
the Obama administration done
enough to create a workable

30:27.325 --> 30:28.994 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
strategy?

30:28.994 --> 30:32.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: This is
tough stuff, and I know it's
very easy to criticize the

30:32.030 --> 30:33.899 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

30:33.899 --> 30:39.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think he has tried as hard
as he can. I think John Kerry
has been very effective

30:39.938 --> 30:45.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in trying to bring these
countries together. He got Saudi
Arabia and Iran to sit down in

30:45.043 --> 30:49.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a room. That is no small thing.
To get Turkey and the Kurds to
begin working together, no

30:49.081 --> 30:52.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
small thing, but that is
what has -- has to happen.

30:52.584 --> 30:57.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think we have got to do
more. I think the Obama
administration has made a very
good

30:57.055 --> 31:01.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
step forward, but we have got to
do more. I think we're seeing
some results in the G20

31:01.693 --> 31:05.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conferences that are taking
place and have taken place.

31:05.297 --> 31:10.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the bottom line is, we have
got to be in this together.
Russia lost over 200 people

31:10.969 --> 31:16.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a flight. God knows we saw
what happened in Paris. We know
what's happened in the U.K.

31:16.475 --> 31:20.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are in this together. And
when we work together, not the
slightest doubt in my mind

31:20.746 --> 31:23.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that ISIS will be destroyed.

31:23.115 --> 31:27.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The other thing
that's happened since the Paris
attacks is what appears to

31:27.085 --> 31:33.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be a pretty strong, in this
country especially, anti-refugee
backlash, many, many governors

31:33.225 --> 31:35.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
saying, no, not in my state.

31:35.927 --> 31:36.928 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's your response to that?

31:36.928 --> 31:40.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: I disagree.

31:40.465 --> 31:48.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Look, when we talk about
terrorism, what it's really
about is the terrorists trying
to instill

31:48.173 --> 31:52.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fear and terror in ourselves.
And I'm hearing some people
talking, well, maybe we will
close

31:52.978 --> 31:58.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down mosques, maybe we won't let
Muslims into this country, maybe
we will turn our back

31:58.717 --> 32:03.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on hundreds of thousands of
people who have been
destroyed,whose lives have been
destroyed

32:03.088 --> 32:06.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by terrorism, who have had to
flee Syria, have to flee
Afghanistan.

32:06.858 --> 32:13.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, it goes without saying that
we need to have a very, very
strong screening process

32:13.632 --> 32:17.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make sure that those people
who come into this country
deserve to be in this country,

32:17.536 --> 32:21.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that they are not terrorists.
I think that we can do that.

32:21.206 --> 32:27.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I will tell you something
else, that if we turn our backs
on those people, you know,

32:27.445 --> 32:34.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think in -- almost, in a way,
we will be -- we will be under
-- we will be destroying

32:34.452 --> 32:36.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what this country is
supposed to be about.

32:36.788 --> 32:39.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Throughout our history, we have
welcomed people who were in
trouble.

32:39.558 --> 32:41.092 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

32:41.092 --> 32:45.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: So,
screening, yes, but turning our
backs on people whose lives have

32:45.330 --> 32:49.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been so affected by the war in
Syria and Afghanistan, I don't
think that's appropriate.

32:49.634 --> 32:53.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In your statement,
you described this as
Islamophobia and racism. Strong
words.

32:53.438 --> 32:54.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Right.

32:54.673 --> 32:56.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Do you want to name
names about who is guilty of
that?

32:56.408 --> 32:58.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Oh,
sure. It's no great secret.

32:58.944 --> 33:03.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A few months ago, Donald Trump
said about people from Mexico
that they are criminals

33:03.481 --> 33:08.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they're rapists. Well,
that's -- you know, and now
we're talking Trump and others
are

33:08.019 --> 33:12.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
talking about, well, maybe
we will close down mosques.

33:12.224 --> 33:17.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Last I heard, we had a
Constitution in this country
which gave all of our people the
right

33:17.562 --> 33:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of religious freedom, you know?
And then I'm hearing other
people saying, well, you know,

33:21.833 --> 33:26.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we may have to undermine the
Constitution in terms of civil
liberties.

33:26.771 --> 33:31.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When we do all of those things,
then, in fact, the terrorists
win without having to explode

33:31.943 --> 33:36.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a bomb in America. We're
undermining what we stand for as
a country.

33:36.047 --> 33:40.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I understand that people are
frightened. What we saw in Paris
was disgusting, was horrible,

33:40.952 --> 33:46.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was barbaric. But we are a
strong enough nation to say
we're not going to lose who we
are

33:46.992 --> 33:51.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as a people, that we're going to
protect our Constitution, we're
going to protect religious

33:51.529 --> 33:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
freedom, and we're not going to
turn our backs on women and
children who have been thrown

33:55.700 --> 33:58.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out of their own countries with
the shirts on their backs.

33:58.470 --> 34:02.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, we're going to open our
doors, but we are going to
screen. That's my view.

34:02.307 --> 34:07.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Just today, the
speaker of the House, Paul Ryan,
Jeb Bush, and even Chuck

34:07.579 --> 34:11.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Schumer have all said that
perhaps we should consider a
pause in accepting refugees into

34:11.950 --> 34:13.885 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this country.

34:13.885 --> 34:19.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I
think we have to have a very,
very effective screening
mechanism.

34:19.624 --> 34:25.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't know what people
mean by a pause. If a pause
means that we want to take a
look

34:25.530 --> 34:31.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at how we're doing screening, to
make sure that we're doing it
effectively, that's -- that's

34:31.670 --> 34:38.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one thing. But if a pause really
is a subtext of saying, well,
we're going to turn our backs

34:38.109 --> 34:41.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on refugees who are in desperate
need of help -- and, by the way,
when I talk about the

34:41.913 --> 34:45.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
refugee crisis, it's not
just the United States.

34:45.517 --> 34:49.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has got to be Europe. It has
got to be Saudi Arabia and
countries in the Gulf region.

34:49.955 --> 34:54.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has to be the entire world
coming together and saying
hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds

34:54.993 --> 34:58.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of thousands of men, women and
children, many children, are --
need help.

34:58.530 --> 35:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, finally -- and,
finally, I have to ask you.

35:01.700 --> 35:07.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Hillary Clinton received
the endorsement of the Service
Employees Union, two-million

35:07.405 --> 35:10.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strong. There had been some
split within that union about
some who wanted to support you

35:10.342 --> 35:12.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and some who wanted
to support her.

35:12.310 --> 35:14.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What's your reaction to
that endorsement today?

35:14.612 --> 35:17.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Well,
obviously, I would have liked to
have had that endorsement.

35:17.949 --> 35:23.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what you are going to see
all over this country is
leadership sometimes doing
things

35:23.788 --> 35:29.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that I think the rank-and-file
don't support. I think, in New
York City, 1199, one of the

35:29.327 --> 35:33.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
large locals, is not supporting.
I think we have support within
the SEIU.

35:33.298 --> 35:38.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have won the support of the
largest nurses union, one of the
largest postal workers union.

35:38.737 --> 35:43.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to get more union
support. But I have absolute
confidence that, given the

35:43.174 --> 35:49.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fact that I have one of the
highest voting -- pro-union rate
-- voting records in the

35:49.314 --> 35:55.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congress, that I have been on a
lot of picket lines, that I'm
fighting for $15 an hour,

35:55.387 --> 36:03.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think my record will in fact
convince millions of workers in
unions and out of unions that,

36:03.061 --> 36:06.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if we want to stand up for the
working class of this country, I
am the candidate.

36:06.798 --> 36:09.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Senator Bernie
Sanders of Vermont, Democratic
candidate for president, thank

36:09.267 --> 36:10.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you for joining us.

36:10.268 --> 36:12.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Thank you.

36:12.704 --> 36:17.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This evening, the
speaker of the House, Paul Ryan,
announced that he plans

36:17.008 --> 36:23.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to bring legislation to the
floor on Thursday to create a
pause in the U.S. refugee
program.

36:23.715 --> 36:27.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And in the Republican
presidential race, just moments
ago, Louisiana Governor Bobby
Jindal

36:27.919 --> 36:32.424 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
said that he is
suspending his campaign.

36:32.424 --> 36:37.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joining us now from San Diego is
one of the current front-runners
in that race, Ben Carson.

36:37.395 --> 36:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for the record, I knew Dr.
Carson before he was a
candidate, when he was -- one of

36:41.800 --> 36:44.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
my children -- was the doctor
for one of my children.

36:44.636 --> 36:47.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Dr. Carson, thank
you for joining us.

36:47.939 --> 36:51.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let me start with the
refugee question.

36:51.776 --> 36:58.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The administration says that its
process for vetting refugees is
the very toughest on refugees

36:58.716 --> 37:03.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who come in from Syria, that
they receive additional scrutiny
more than any others who

37:03.021 --> 37:06.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
come into this country.
Why isn't that enough?

37:06.958 --> 37:10.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN CARSON (R), Presidential
Candidate: Well, first of all,
you know, I think we should

37:10.962 --> 37:16.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be compassionate, as we always
have been, and recognize that
there are a lot of people

37:16.601 --> 37:21.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who have been displaced. Half of
the country of Syria has been
displaced.

37:21.539 --> 37:27.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we should be looking for
ways to protect and provide safe
zones for them, and utilizing

37:27.879 --> 37:32.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our professional resources
to help them over there.

37:32.784 --> 37:38.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we also have to use a little
bit of common sense and
recognize that, if we bring
large

37:38.523 --> 37:44.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
numbers of such people into our
country -- and they're coming
from an area where a lot of

37:44.696 --> 37:51.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the radical Islamic jihadists
exist. Those people would be
very foolish not to infiltrate

37:51.903 --> 37:55.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that number with some
of their own people.

37:55.206 --> 37:59.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can't believe that they would
just leave them alone and not
try to do that. And we

37:59.544 --> 38:03.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have to recognize that it
doesn't take that many people.
When you look at what happened

38:03.314 --> 38:07.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in France on Friday, it didn't
take 10,000 people to do that.
It didn't even take 1,000

38:07.785 --> 38:10.588 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or 100.

38:10.588 --> 38:14.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we have to be very careful,
and we have to protect the
American people. And we have

38:14.993 --> 38:20.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to have vetting procedures that
we can all agree on, not that
just one group says, yes,

38:20.632 --> 38:23.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this is the best vetting
procedure that there is.

38:23.768 --> 38:27.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But we know it's
a humanitarian crisis. We know
that European countries are

38:27.906 --> 38:30.441 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
being strained.

38:30.441 --> 38:35.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have said yourself your
heart hurts for these refugee
families, for the children.

38:35.213 --> 38:39.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, in essence, you would turn
them away, for the time being at
least?

38:39.584 --> 38:44.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN CARSON: MD+IT MD-IT Well,
my heart would also hurt if we
allowed people in here

38:44.455 --> 38:50.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
who destroy the lives of
hundreds or maybe thousands of
Americans.

38:50.795 --> 38:57.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have a responsibility to our
people first. And when you get
on an airplane, they always

38:57.135 --> 39:00.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say, in case of an emergency,
air masks will drop down, put
yours on first, and then
administer

39:00.605 --> 39:04.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
oxygen to your neighbor.

39:04.209 --> 39:11.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dr. Carson, we
just heard -- before we talked
to you, Gwen talked to Senator
Sanders.

39:11.349 --> 39:17.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We also know that Governor Bush
said today that he wouldn't ban
Syrian refugees from

39:17.422 --> 39:23.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coming in. He called accepting
refugees a noble tradition in
this country.

39:23.294 --> 39:27.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN CARSON: MD+IT MD-IT And,
like I said, we have to have a
vetting procedure

39:27.999 --> 39:32.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that we can all agree
on that is safe.

39:32.737 --> 39:38.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't think that that's an
unreasonable request. Just
because one person says, yes,

39:38.409 --> 39:42.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
this is the best vetting
procedure there is in the world,
that's not good enough. We need

39:42.847 --> 39:45.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to have something that
we can all agree on.

39:45.717 --> 39:52.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the average person
who recognizes that you're
bringing people from an area of

39:52.724 --> 39:59.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the world where there are very
dangerous terrorists would
likely infiltrate the group of
people

39:59.697 --> 40:03.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that you were bringing over here
with some of their own. If
somebody can tell me why

40:03.735 --> 40:07.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's irrational
reasoning, I'm all ears.

40:07.505 --> 40:11.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Governor
Bush went on to say that the
problem needs to be solved

40:11.409 --> 40:15.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Syria. And he and others have
talked about putting a coalition
together, strengthening

40:15.747 --> 40:18.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that coalition to go
after ISIS there.

40:18.883 --> 40:25.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN CARSON: MD+IT MD-IT Well,
there is no question that we
need to fight them

40:25.456 --> 40:29.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over there, so that they can
direct their attention to that
area of the world, and less

40:29.994 --> 40:33.731 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
attention to our
area of the world.

40:33.731 --> 40:38.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We fight them over there, or we
fight them over here. So, yes,
we must be extremely serious.

40:38.136 --> 40:44.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We must look at what has worked
in the past and expand on that.

40:44.242 --> 40:50.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, even last week, you
know, with Sinjar, look at what
happened there. The Kurds were

40:50.081 --> 40:55.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
able to cut off the supply
routes, and then our special ops
people were able to work with

40:55.853 --> 41:00.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Kurds and soften targets, so
that when we came in with our
air support, it wasn't

41:00.391 --> 41:03.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all that difficult.

41:03.928 --> 41:09.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's a model that should
be repeated and expanded upon.
And we should set our sights

41:09.834 --> 41:15.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Mosul and some of the other
places as well and begin to take
back some of that caliphate

41:15.473 --> 41:24.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they have managed to build,
and also to strangle them in
terms of finances, in

41:24.882 --> 41:29.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terms of resources from oil,
everything. We should go all out
for this. We shouldn't just

41:29.620 --> 41:31.622 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do pinpricks.

41:31.622 --> 41:35.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, when it
comes to ISIS and other foreign
policy questions, I'm sure

41:35.593 --> 41:41.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know one of your foreign
policy national security
advisers, Duane Clarridge, is
quoted

41:41.065 --> 41:45.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today in The New York Times as
saying -- and I'm quoting --
"Nobody," he said, "has been

41:45.937 --> 41:50.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
able to sit down with you and
have you get one iota of
intelligent information about

41:50.808 --> 41:52.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Middle East."

41:52.910 --> 41:56.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He was asked about some
questions you have been asked by
the press recently where you

41:56.848 --> 42:00.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have appeared to struggle with
questions about national
security.

42:00.785 --> 42:03.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN CARSON: MD+IT MD-IT Well,
you know, I think that's a
narrative that people want

42:03.721 --> 42:06.324 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to paint.

42:06.324 --> 42:11.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, for instance, you
know, this Sunday, when Chris
Wallace kept saying, who would

42:11.262 --> 42:16.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you call first, who would you
call first, I wasn't interested
in answering that question,

42:16.701 --> 42:22.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because I have learned that, if
I say I would call Egypt first,
or I would call Israel first,

42:22.707 --> 42:27.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or I would call Jordan first, or
whoever I said I would call
first, then the next thing

42:27.111 --> 42:30.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would be, well, but why would
you not call this one first?

42:30.815 --> 42:35.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know how that works. And
that's just silly. What I was
talking about is, we have

42:35.286 --> 42:41.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to have a broad plan, a
coalition that brings in all of
our friends and all of the
people

42:41.426 --> 42:44.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who have interests in that
region throughout the...

42:44.195 --> 42:45.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But what
about your own -- go ahead.

42:45.797 --> 42:46.764 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
BEN CARSON:
MD+IT MD-IT Go ahead.

42:46.764 --> 42:47.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And then
I want to -- go ahead.

42:47.999 --> 42:50.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEN CARSON: MD+IT MD-IT Yes.

42:50.835 --> 42:57.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you know, what I sort of
object to is these sound bite
answers that people can then

42:57.208 --> 43:01.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pull apart and say, see, I told
you he doesn't know anything,
when, in fact, you really need

43:01.712 --> 43:05.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a much more comprehensive answer
to some of these questions.

43:05.082 --> 43:09.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, this is
your own adviser, Mr. Clarridge,
saying that, in his words,

43:09.787 --> 43:12.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you need weekly briefings, in
his words -- quote -- "to make
you smart."

43:12.723 --> 43:14.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
One of your other advisers...

43:14.592 --> 43:19.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN CARSON: Well, he's not --
look, he's not my adviser. He's
not my adviser.

43:19.230 --> 43:25.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is a person who has come in
on a couple of our sessions to
offer his opinions about

43:25.336 --> 43:30.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what was going on. To call
himself my adviser would be a
great stretch. And he has no
idea

43:30.408 --> 43:33.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who else I'm sitting
down and talking to.

43:33.578 --> 43:37.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Who is your
principal adviser of national
security? Because one of our
other

43:37.315 --> 43:41.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
advisers, Armstrong Williams,
has said that -- he said you're
still on a steep learning

43:41.619 --> 43:43.621 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
curve.

43:43.621 --> 43:47.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN CARSON: MD+IT MD-IT I am.
You know, I know a lot more than
I knew. A year from

43:47.625 --> 43:52.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now -- a year from now, I will
know a lot more than I know now.

43:52.330 --> 43:57.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In medicine, we have something
called continuing medical
education. You have to get those
credits

43:57.602 --> 44:02.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in order to be recertified. I
think that applies to every
aspect of our lives,
particularly

44:02.440 --> 44:04.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a rapidly changing world.

44:04.976 --> 44:08.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dr. Ben Carson,
we thank you for talking with
us.

44:08.312 --> 44:14.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BEN CARSON: MD+IT MD-IT Thank
you. My pleasure.

44:14.285 --> 44:27.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Tonight on
"Frontline": an unprecedented
look at how Islamic State
militants have spread

44:27.498 --> 44:32.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
across one country at the
center of the war on terrorism.

With remarkable access to the
militants themselves, tonight's
report, "ISIS in Afghanistan,"
shows

44:37.308 --> 44:41.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how the group is expanding its
control in the country, fighting
some members of the

44:41.679 --> 44:45.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Taliban, co-opting others, and
battling Afghan national army
forces.

44:45.950 --> 44:49.153 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the story.

44:49.153 --> 44:53.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: After months
of negotiations, Afghan
journalist Najibullah Quraishi
got

44:53.224 --> 44:58.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
permission from ISIS militants
to come visit their stronghold
in Afghanistan.

44:58.062 --> 45:02.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In his "Frontline" report,
Quraishi shows not only how ISIS
is gaining power in that

45:02.934 --> 45:09.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nation, but also how they're
indoctrinating young Afghan
children into their cause.

45:09.941 --> 45:16.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: In the ISIS-held
district of Shaigal, the group
is using many techniques to
groom

45:16.047 --> 45:19.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
young children to fight and
die for the Islamic State.

45:19.984 --> 45:25.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): This
is the latest Islamic State
video. You will see 17 or 18

45:25.790 --> 45:27.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people being killed.

45:27.525 --> 45:29.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
Where is this?

45:29.961 --> 45:32.029 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Sham.

45:32.029 --> 45:34.332 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
MAN (through
translator): In Iraq?

45:34.332 --> 45:38.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
Yes, in Iraq.

45:38.035 --> 45:42.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: The fighters tell
Najibullah they receive
propaganda videos directly from
ISIS

45:42.373 --> 45:50.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Syria and Iraq. They say they
show the videos to the village
children every day.

45:50.348 --> 45:52.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): The
village is saying they're all
infidels and special forces
soldier.

45:52.049 --> 45:54.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): What
are they going to do with them
now?

45:54.952 --> 45:57.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
They're taking them to the kill
zone for execution. They're
wiping

45:57.288 --> 46:01.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them off the face of the earth.

46:01.726 --> 46:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NAJIBULLAH QURAISHI, Journalist:
I was asking them, why they are
watching in front of these

46:08.966 --> 46:13.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
young children. They said they
should learn, they should know
from now, and it's normal

46:13.604 --> 46:16.907 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for them.

46:16.907 --> 46:25.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: The videos don't just
show attacks and atrocities.
This is an ISIS military school

46:25.950 --> 46:35.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for children somewhere
in the Middle East.

46:35.059 --> 46:52.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NAJIBULLAH QURAISHI: All these
videos, they're just telling
them how to kill people, how

46:52.476 --> 46:57.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to behead, and how to become
suicide bombers. And their main
thing is to kill infidels.

46:57.615 --> 47:05.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is their aim. And they are
clearly telling, this is in
Koran. So what does the child
believe?

47:05.289 --> 47:10.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What does he think? He thinks,
yes, I am Muslim, and he's
telling me the truth.

47:10.861 --> 47:16.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: Najibullah films the
Afghan children copying what
they have just watched.

47:16.934 --> 47:27.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Bend
your knees a little, feet apart.
Keep your arms straight.

47:27.178 --> 47:31.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Fire. God is great.

47:31.982 --> 47:39.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NAJIBULLAH QURAISHI: When I saw
these young children, I was
really, really upset, really

47:39.490 --> 47:45.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sad. I was thinking about
Afghanistan future,
Afghanistan's next generation.
What we have

47:45.429 --> 47:49.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
next?

47:49.300 --> 47:55.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These children who learn how to
kill people, how to do jihad,
how to behead, how to fire?

47:55.773 --> 47:58.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This would be Afghanistan?

47:58.275 --> 48:07.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): You
stand with the Kalashnikov like
this, OK?

48:07.084 --> 48:12.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NAJIBULLAH QURAISHI: I was
thinking maybe the war will
never end, never. And the people

48:12.890 --> 48:16.560 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will keep suffering from war.

48:16.560 --> 48:19.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Najibullah
Quraishi joins me now from
London.

48:19.663 --> 48:22.299 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Welcome.

48:22.299 --> 48:27.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a very, very powerful
piece of reporting. You really
get to see ISIS in action in a

48:27.538 --> 48:30.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way that many of us in the West
have never seen before. Why is
it, do you think, they

48:30.941 --> 48:33.043 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
let you in?

48:33.043 --> 48:39.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NAJIBULLAH QURAISHI: Well, when
I heard first about ISIS in
Afghanistan, then I started

48:39.984 --> 48:45.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
contacting the people who used
to work for me. I mean some
local journalists.

48:45.156 --> 48:52.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then we found some villages
and elders. So, through the
elders, we send a message

48:52.963 --> 48:57.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out to them, to their leader. I
mean ISIS commander in
Afghanistan. I asked them if

48:57.902 --> 49:03.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they allow me to film them about
their presence in Afghanistan.

49:03.974 --> 49:12.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, then they told to the
villages of the people I sent
over to wait. So, I was waiting

49:12.583 --> 49:20.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for almost eight -- or over
eight months, until they called
us in. And they said, come,

49:20.357 --> 49:24.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and we're ready to be filmed.

49:24.528 --> 49:29.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I was excited that I am going
to meet them or filming them
about their daily life, or

49:29.567 --> 49:34.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at least I would expose them,
what they are doing there.

49:34.071 --> 49:41.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the other side of my life
was my family, my wife, my
children. To be honest, this was

49:41.478 --> 49:47.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kind of 50/50. I was, like, 50
percent hope that I would come
back again and 50 percent

49:47.852 --> 49:50.287 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I wasn't.

49:50.287 --> 49:56.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To expose such kind of stories,
it's always dangerous. It's
always -- there is a risk.

49:56.961 --> 50:01.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we have to tell the story.
If not, then who shall tell?

50:01.565 --> 50:04.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The scenes of
the children and the education,
if you can call it that,

50:04.835 --> 50:08.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that they're getting are
really quite terrifying.

50:08.205 --> 50:12.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I was wonder if you could
just tell us a little bit more
about the men who think

50:12.409 --> 50:14.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that this is a good thing to
teach children, to teach
children so young to learn how
to

50:14.678 --> 50:16.213 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
kill.

50:16.213 --> 50:20.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NAJIBULLAH QURAISHI: I have
never seen this in my journalism
life before.

50:20.184 --> 50:25.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the beginning, I didn't know
when they mentioned me they have
a school, they are

50:25.256 --> 50:30.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
children, if I want to go and
film. I was thinking maybe there
is a proper lesson, they

50:30.594 --> 50:36.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
maybe learn some mathematics,
some grammar or some language or
something or maybe proper

50:36.901 --> 50:39.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Koran. I was thinking like this.

50:39.770 --> 50:45.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, suddenly, I come across
with jihad for 3 years old, or
4- or 5-year-old children.

50:45.276 --> 50:50.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're telling what is jihad and
how to kill. So then I was
shocked.

50:50.347 --> 50:54.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): What
is this word? Jihad. What is
jihad?

50:54.485 --> 50:59.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NAJIBULLAH QURAISHI: These guys
mainly come from Pakistan.

50:59.223 --> 51:03.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were telling me that this
is the time they should teach
the children, and they should

51:03.560 --> 51:06.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
learn from now and they
should be prepared.

51:06.263 --> 51:09.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Fire
it from a standing position,
like this.

51:09.967 --> 51:12.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NAJIBULLAH QURAISHI: For them,
they should be ready for
fighting, for everything at the

51:12.937 --> 51:17.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
age of 12 or 13 for
something like this.

51:17.741 --> 51:26.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were asking the children
about the weapons, for example,
how many bullets it takes, where

51:26.150 --> 51:31.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this pistol made from, where is
Kalashnikov made from, why we
should use this, and who

51:31.355 --> 51:35.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should we -- against with this,
and lots of different things
which the children knew from

51:35.759 --> 51:37.661 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this age.

51:37.661 --> 51:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, on the film, you can see
the second generation, which is
all the teenagers, like

51:43.000 --> 51:51.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
13 or 17. And they're ready to
blow themselves up or to do a
suicide attack.

51:51.275 --> 51:56.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I came to the conclusion about
Afghanistan's future and
Afghanistan's next generation.

51:56.647 --> 52:03.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still, we have over 90 percent
uneducated people. We don't have
security. Day by day,

52:03.187 --> 52:07.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all the terrorists come into
Afghanistan, all the farmers.

52:07.358 --> 52:13.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now in Afghanistan, we
have Haqqani Network. We have
Hezb-e-Islami or Hekmatyar.

52:13.364 --> 52:19.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have the Taliban. And now we
have this crazy group, the most
-- worst group ever

52:19.603 --> 52:24.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have seen in my life. And I
cannot see any bright future
about that country, and I don't

52:24.475 --> 52:28.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think if there is any --
any power to defeat them.

52:28.379 --> 52:31.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Given the news
of the most recent attacks that
we have seen in France

52:31.815 --> 52:35.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just recently, everyone's been
wondering about ISIS' motives.

52:35.419 --> 52:40.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you have actually now spent
a good deal of time with some of
these militants. What

52:40.624 --> 52:43.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- when you heard about the
attacks in France, did that come
as a surprise to you or not?

52:43.894 --> 52:46.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NAJIBULLAH QURAISHI:
Well, to be honest, no.

52:46.697 --> 52:51.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
No, it doesn't come as a
surprise for me, because their
aim is not -- they're not
talking

52:51.769 --> 52:57.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about one village or one
district or one country. They're
talking about the world. They're
not

52:57.341 --> 52:59.810 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like a Taliban.

52:59.810 --> 53:04.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, the Taliban says,
we are in Afghanistan, and we
are not threat for other
countries

53:04.748 --> 53:09.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or Russia or Iran or other
countries. Our aim is to capture
Afghanistan and to have

53:09.586 --> 53:12.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Sharia law here in Afghanistan.

53:12.689 --> 53:18.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they are not like this. They
say, we want to go to Europe, we
want to go to, like, other

53:18.562 --> 53:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
countries, like Uzbekistan,
Tajikistan, China, Iran,
Pakistan. And they're
threatening the

53:23.400 --> 53:27.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
world. They're not threatening
only one country or one province
or one district.

53:27.671 --> 53:29.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Najibullah
Quraishi, thank you very much
for joining us. And thank you

53:29.973 --> 53:31.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for this terrific
piece of journalism.

53:31.975 --> 53:34.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NAJIBULLAH QURAISHI: You're
welcome. Thanks a lot.

GWEN IFILL: "Frontline" airs
tonight on most PBS stations.

53:37.347 --> 53:41.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And a news update before we go.

53:41.685 --> 53:46.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the heels of the Paris
attacks, there's been another
major bombing in Nigeria. The

53:46.490 --> 53:50.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Red Cross and the government say
at least 32 people were killed
in the northeastern

53:50.928 --> 53:57.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
city of Yola. Another 80 were
wounded. Officials say it bears
the hallmark of Boko Haram. The

53:57.468 --> 54:01.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Islamist militant group has
killed thousands in the last six
years.

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online: As countries all over
the world face these active

54:06.477 --> 54:12.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
threats of terrorism, a new

Afghans feel about the Islamic

State in their own homeland, a
place where they're still
battling the Taliban. You can
