WOODRUFF: now, the Trump
administration has set a lower
refugee limit for the U.S. for

00:06.666 --> 00:08.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this fiscal year.

00:08.666 --> 00:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the coming week, the U.S.
will hit that ceiling of
accepting 50,000 new refugees.

00:14.533 --> 00:17.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The city of Utica, New
York, has long taken a
more welcoming approach.

00:17.766 --> 00:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One out of every four citizens
there is a refugee and the
evidence is they're helping

00:23.633 --> 00:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
revitalize the community.

00:24.800 --> 00:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Paul Solman has our update.

00:26.533 --> 00:28.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

00:30.966 --> 00:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN, PBS NEWSHOUR
CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):
Post-industrial Utica,
New York, upstate,

00:36.533 --> 00:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
downtrodden, and, in the heart
of downtown, where the United
Methodist Church used to

00:40.766 --> 00:43.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be, a thriving mosque.

00:43.500 --> 00:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the world beyond Utica,
the tide of refugees rises,
the fear of foreigners swells.

00:52.933 --> 00:56.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Muslim terrorists, real
and imagined, haunt us.

00:56.433 --> 01:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Donald J. Trump is
calling for a total and complete
shutdown of Muslims entering

01:03.833 --> 01:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United States until our
country's representatives
can figure out what
the hell is going on.

01:11.333 --> 01:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: President Trump's
calls for even a partial Muslim
ban were repeatedly rebuffed

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in court, but the Supreme Court
has now let some of it stand
until it considers the ban's

01:22.033 --> 01:24.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
legality this fall.

01:24.600 --> 01:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when we asked Utica
Mayor Robert Palmieri
if the city would be
willing to resettle Syrian

01:29.500 --> 01:31.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
refugees --

01:31.433 --> 01:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAYOR ROBERT PALMIERI,
UTICA, NEW YORK: I would say,
absolutely, we would be, because

01:32.833 --> 01:33.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Utica starts with you.

01:33.833 --> 01:35.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's as simple as that.

01:35.800 --> 01:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: There's the humanitarian
aspect, of course, America's
historic promise to extend

01:39.833 --> 01:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a hand to huddled masses
yearning to breathe free.

01:43.700 --> 01:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But Utica likes the economics.

01:45.800 --> 01:48.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PALMIERI: They're
willing to work and they
work extremely hard.

01:48.133 --> 01:50.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's the rebound
for our great city.

01:50.200 --> 01:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: Refugee resettlement as
an economic development tool,
a Rust Belt revival strategy

01:55.666 --> 01:58.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Utica has pioneered.

01:58.466 --> 02:02.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After decades of decline --
the city lost a third of its
population when its factories

02:02.866 --> 02:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
closed -- Utica is growing
again, back up to 62,000 people,
thanks in part to its reputation

02:10.200 --> 02:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as, quote, the town that loves
refugees, who now make up one
out of every four residents.

02:17.266 --> 02:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thousands are Muslims from
Bosnia, refugees of the
war there in the 1990s.

SAKIB DURACAK, BOSNIAN
WAR REFUGEE: Basically,
we left everything what
we have at that time

02:25.500 --> 02:27.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and start from zero again.

02:27.966 --> 02:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: Sakib Duracak,
who trained in Bosnia
as a construction
engineer, started a small

02:35.300 --> 02:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
business in Utica rehabbing
cheap, often crumbling,
houses for refugees
looking to build a new

02:40.400 --> 02:42.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

02:42.400 --> 02:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DURACAK: A huge opportunity,
because, at the time when we
came in Utica, it's a relatively

02:45.800 --> 02:47.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
very dead and poor city.

02:47.833 --> 02:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: Bosnians have
visibly spruced up Utica's
east side and beyond.

02:52.400 --> 02:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there's an even more
basic reason to welcome
refugees to a town like Utica.

02:56.266 --> 02:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELLEN KRALY, COLGATE UNIVERSITY:
To have an economy, you have
to have workers, and you

02:59.033 --> 03:01.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have to have consumers.

03:01.133 --> 03:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: Professor Ellen
Kraly teaches demography at
nearby Colgate University.

03:04.833 --> 03:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KRALY: The influx of refugees
to Utica allowed us to retain
some smaller industries that

03:12.233 --> 03:14.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
were looking for
highly motivated labor.

03:14.800 --> 03:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: And if past suffering
helps fuel motivation, Thada
Paw has plenty to spare.

THADA PAW, KAREN REFUGEE:
I work very hard because I
want to live American life.

camps in Thailand.

03:34.733 --> 03:36.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
When she was 14 --

03:36.400 --> 03:40.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAW: Burmese army, they
just shoot our refugee
camp and make it burn.

03:42.366 --> 03:44.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
My sister's best
friend, she burn alive.

03:44.600 --> 03:49.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SOLMAN: A week later,
her 17-year-old sister
committed suicide.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAW: I think she tired of life.

03:51.733 --> 03:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Whole, our life, we have to
run, run, run, run for safety.

03:55.900 --> 04:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: Paw came to Utica nine
years ago, worked as a nursing
home aide and housekeeper

04:02.333 --> 04:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
while studying English, then
as a medical interpreter.

04:04.933 --> 04:09.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Four years ago, she
joined the direct sales
firm Mary Kay Cosmetics.

04:09.666 --> 04:13.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Within months, she'd
worked her way up to the
coveted pink Cadillac.

04:13.233 --> 04:17.733 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
PAW: I travel in
Albany, Buffalo.

04:17.733 --> 04:21.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's really hard, but
now I love to live here.

04:21.600 --> 04:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: OK, so we get why
refugees for Utica, but
why Utica for refugees?

IBRAHIM ROSIC, BOSNIAN WAR
REFUGEE: Utica was close to
Syracuse, and Tom Cruise is from

04:31.033 --> 04:32.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Syracuse.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So I thought I was
going to see Tom Cruise.

04:34.633 --> 04:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: Sadly, for Bosnian

04:42.966 --> 04:44.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHELLY CALLAHN, EXECUTIVE

04:44.966 --> 04:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
federal to be spent on behalf
of each arriving refugee.

04:48.933 --> 04:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: With those dollars,
says executive director Shelly
Callahan, the refugee center

04:55.966 --> 04:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rents an apartment, furnishes
it, gets the utilities turned
on, and starts teaching the

05:02.800 --> 05:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

We're going to make
celery and kale.

05:21.800 --> 05:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: And for those who

a veritable auditorium

05:29.200 --> 05:30.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

05:30.700 --> 05:33.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But within a few months,
they're on their own.

05:33.266 --> 05:36.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

here owing their airfare back
to the federal government.

05:36.933 --> 05:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, they are expected to get
a job as soon as possible.

05:41.600 --> 05:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

05:46.400 --> 05:50.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

it's my time to pay back.

And I would say most

economic boon that motivated

Some workers face

American workers may
see a decline in their

AL SAAD: He got beat up.

08:03.333 --> 08:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I lost many friends of mine.

SOLMAN: They spent three years
in a camp on the Syrian border,

transit to the United States.

08:12.333 --> 08:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yousif al Saad went to work
at the Chobani yogurt plant
outside Utica, whose CEO, Hamdi

08:19.333 --> 08:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ulukaya, has championed
the rights of refugees and
hired hundreds of them.

08:25.733 --> 08:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were supposed to tape there,
but at the last minute, Chobani
pulled out, citing security

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
concerns, fear for the safety
of employees in the current
political environment.

08:37.066 --> 08:41.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Understandably, as right
wing media had targeted
a Chobani plant in Twin
Falls, Idaho, where

08:42.633 --> 08:44.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
some 30 percent of the
workers are refugees.

08:44.766 --> 08:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALEX JONES, INFO WARS: So,
let's look at the headlines.

08:46.933 --> 08:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: According to
conspiracy theorist Alex
Jones, citing Breitbart --

08:50.633 --> 08:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONES: TB spiked 500 percent
in Twin Falls during 2012 as
Chobani yogurt opened the plant.

08:57.633 --> 09:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Idaho refugee boys admit to
sexually assaulting 5-year-old.

09:03.533 --> 09:05.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK.

09:05.833 --> 09:09.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Twin Falls refugee rape
special report: why
are refugees moving in?

09:09.900 --> 09:11.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Oh, the Chobani plant.

09:11.933 --> 09:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: But the sexual assault
by minors is shrouded in
secrecy, and the TB case spike

09:18.233 --> 09:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was from one positive test to
six, in a nearly 12,000 square
mile area that included twin

09:24.133 --> 09:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
falls, none of the cases
contagious, none involving
Chobani employees.

09:28.666 --> 09:29.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JONES: This isn't
some game people.

09:29.900 --> 09:33.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's a total Islamic
takeover taking place.

09:33.233 --> 09:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Behind the scenes, they got
Muslims following me around.

09:36.133 --> 09:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: In April, the
company sued Jones for false
and defamatory reports.

09:40.933 --> 09:43.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JONES: And I'm ready
to take them on.

09:43.700 --> 09:45.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Christ, please help us win this.

09:45.466 --> 09:47.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Please help me be strong.

09:47.466 --> 09:49.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: The following
month, Jones issued an
apology and a retraction.

09:49.866 --> 09:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONES: On behalf of Info Wars, I
regret that we mischaracterized
Chobani, its employees

09:56.200 --> 09:58.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the people of Twin
Falls, Idaho, the way we did.

09:58.266 --> 10:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: Two final follow-ups:

has dropped from 7 percent to

10:03.900 --> 10:06.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
3 percent since Chobani
came to town in 2012.
