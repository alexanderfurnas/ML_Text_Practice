09:20.600 --> 09:25.200
THE COURT CONDUCTS AN INQUIR

09:25.200 --> 09:26.567
INTO WHETHER THEY'RE INDIGENT.

09:26.567 --> 09:27.967
ROUTINELY WHAT'S HAPPENING HER

09:27.967 --> 09:29.633
IS THAT NO SUCH INQUIRY IS

09:29.633 --> 09:30.500
UNDERTAKEN

09:30.500 --> 09:34.067
>> DID THEY TRY TO ASSES

09:34.067 --> 09:35.033
WHETHER OR NOT YOU COULD AFFOR

09:35.033 --> 09:35.767
TO PAY THE FEES?

09:35.767 --> 09:36.567
>> NO, SIR

09:36.567 --> 09:37.800
IT WAS PASS AND GO

09:37.800 --> 09:39.467
IT WAS REALLY FAST

09:39.467 --> 09:41.500
>> COLLECTING FINES IS MOR

09:41.500 --> 09:45.067
IMPORTANT THAN EVER BECAUSE MANY

09:45.067 --> 09:46.700
CITIES FACE BUDGET SHORT FALLS

09:46.700 --> 09:49.767
SO INCREASINGLY THEY TURN TO

09:49.767 --> 09:51.667
PRIVATE PROBATION COMPANIES.

09:51.667 --> 09:53.800
THAT'S WHERE JOURNAL CORRECTIO

09:53.800 --> 09:54.367
SERVICES COMES IN.

09:54.367 --> 09:56.800
>> WE WERE APPROACHED BY THE

09:56.800 --> 09:58.300
PROBATION SERVICE.

09:58.300 --> 09:59.700
THEY FOUND A NICHE

09:59.700 --> 10:01.600
>> THEY DECLINED TO SPEAK WITH

10:01.600 --> 10:04.467
US, SO WE MET WITH THE FINANCE

10:04.467 --> 10:06.233
DIRECTOR FOR MOUNTAIN BROOK, A

10:06.233 --> 10:10.367
NEIGHBORING CITY THAT ALSO HIRED

10:10.367 --> 10:12.300
JIE ADDITIONAL CORRECTIO

10:12.300 --> 10:12.733
SERVICES

10:12.733 --> 10:14.533
IT'S ONE OF OVER A THOUSAN

10:14.533 --> 10:16.567
CITIES THAT HAVE HIRED THIS TYPE

10:16.567 --> 10:18.633
OF COMPANY

10:18.633 --> 10:19.700
JUDICIAL CORRECTION SERVICES

10:19.700 --> 10:21.667
COLLECTS FINES AT NO COST TO THE

10:21.667 --> 10:22.867
CITIES IT WORKS FOR.

10:22.867 --> 10:24.733
>> THEY'RE HELPING US TO BECOM

10:24.733 --> 10:26.267
MORE EFFICIENT AND THEY'RE

10:26.267 --> 10:29.800
HELPING US TO ENSHIRE WE DON'T

10:29.800 --> 10:32.967
GET A -- ENSURE WE DON'T GET A

10:32.967 --> 10:33.300
BACKLOG.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.633
I THINK IT'S A WIN-WIN

10:35.633 --> 10:37.333
I THINK PRIVATE PROBATION HAS

10:37.333 --> 10:37.800
ROLE

10:37.800 --> 10:40.967
>> REPUBLICAN STATE SENATOR CA

10:40.967 --> 10:43.500
WARD IS THE CHAIRMAN OF TH

10:43.500 --> 10:45.467
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND HAS BEEN

10:45.467 --> 10:46.967
FOLLOWING THE GROWING TREND.

10:46.967 --> 10:49.700
HE BELIEVES THE INDUSTRY WIL

10:49.700 --> 10:50.133
CONTINUE TO GROW

10:50.133 --> 10:52.067
>> I THINK THE PRIVATIZATION I

10:52.067 --> 10:54.967
THE AREA OF COLLECTIONS, I THAIK

10:54.967 --> 10:56.233
THAT WILL CONTINUE ALL ACROS

10:56.233 --> 10:58.633
THE COUNTRY UNTIL YOU SEE

10:58.633 --> 11:00.100
CONCENTRATED EFFORT TO PUT MOR

11:00.100 --> 11:01.400
MONEY INTO THE COLLECTIO

11:01.400 --> 11:02.933
SERVICES THAT THE ESTATE RUNS.

11:02.933 --> 11:05.500
>> BY THEY ARE BY DEFINITION I

11:05.500 --> 11:06.600
BUSINESS TO MAKE MONEY

11:06.600 --> 11:08.800
EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T CHARG

11:08.800 --> 11:13.700
THE CITY ANYTHING, THEY CHARGE

11:13.700 --> 11:15.033
OFFENDERS LIKE TIMOTHY

11:15.033 --> 11:19.300
$45 A MONTH AND A STAMPUP FEE --

11:19.300 --> 11:20.600
STARTUP FEE UNTIL THE DEBT I

11:20.600 --> 11:21.133
PAID OFF

11:21.133 --> 11:23.800
>> CAN YOU TELL ME IF YOU WERE

11:23.800 --> 11:25.500
MAKING AN EFFORT TO PAY THES

11:25.500 --> 11:25.967
OFF?

11:25.967 --> 11:27.467
>> WE WERE

11:27.467 --> 11:28.000
YES, SIR

11:28.000 --> 11:31.167
EVEN THOUGH I WAS, WE WEREN'

11:31.167 --> 11:32.433
GETTING VERY FAR WITH IT

11:32.433 --> 11:34.467
I WASN'T GAINING MUCH GROUND

11:34.467 --> 11:36.467
WITH ALL THE FEES ADDING UP.

11:36.467 --> 11:38.067
>> STILL, FOUR MONTHS AFTER TH

11:38.067 --> 11:40.167
INITIAL COURT DATE, DOCUMENT

11:40.167 --> 11:42.600
SHOW THEY PAID OFF ALMOST $300

11:42.600 --> 11:45.933
OF THE $5600 THEY -- $500 THEY

11:45.933 --> 11:48.400
OWED IN COURSE COSTS

11:48.400 --> 11:51.267
BUT THEN THINGS WENT FROM BAD TO

11:51.267 --> 11:51.767
WORSE.

11:51.767 --> 11:55.267
IN JUNE OF 2011, THEIR SON COL

11:55.267 --> 11:55.400
DIED

11:55.400 --> 12:00.600
A MONTH LATER, THEIR HOUSE WAS

12:00.600 --> 12:01.400
FORECLOSED UPON.

12:01.400 --> 12:03.167
THEY WERE CONSUMED WITH GRIE

12:03.167 --> 12:06.167
AND MISSING THEIR APPOINTMENTS

12:06.167 --> 12:07.733
WITH JSF

12:07.733 --> 12:11.000
HE SAYS HE EXPLAINED THE

12:11.000 --> 12:12.200
DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES HI

12:12.200 --> 12:14.533
FAMILY WAS HURND, BUT THEY

12:14.533 --> 12:15.800
WOULDN'T WORK WITH HIM AT ALL.

12:15.800 --> 12:20.500
>> IT JUST HIT US ALL AT ONCE.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.600
BUT IT WAS EITHER PAYOR GO T

12:22.600 --> 12:23.167
JAY.

12:23.167 --> 12:26.633
>> DID THAT HELP YOU TO COME U

12:26.633 --> 12:27.600
WITH THE MONEY

12:27.600 --> 12:30.600
>> IT HELPED ME TO TRY HARDER.

12:30.600 --> 12:34.167
THE OLD THING GOES, YOU CAN'

12:34.167 --> 12:36.733
SQUEEZE BLOOD FROM A TURNIP.

12:36.733 --> 12:39.667
>> THE COUPLE MISSED AT LEAS

12:39.667 --> 12:42.100
ONE COURT DATE EACH AND WERE

12:42.100 --> 12:43.200
FINED ADDITIONAL FEES.

12:43.200 --> 12:44.733
THEN WARRANTS FOR THEIR ARREST

12:44.733 --> 12:45.700
WERE ISSUED.

12:45.700 --> 12:47.533
BY THE TIME OF THEIR ARRESTS I

12:47.533 --> 12:51.500
FEBRUARY OF 2011, THEY HAD

12:51.500 --> 12:54.433
RACKED UP $2,500 IN ADDITIONAL

12:54.433 --> 12:55.500
COURT FINES.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.033
ALL THIS BEGAN WITH THRE

12:57.033 --> 12:58.733
TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS FOR WHICH

12:58.733 --> 13:01.067
THEY WERE FOUND NOT GUILTY

13:01.067 --> 13:02.367
IF YOU HAD COME UP WITH TH

13:02.367 --> 13:04.967
MONEY YOU OWED AND SHOWN UP FO

13:04.967 --> 13:06.967
ALL OF YOUR APPOINTMENTS WIT

13:06.967 --> 13:09.500
THEM TO THE COURTS, NONE OF THIS

13:09.500 --> 13:10.467
WOULD HAVE EVER HAPPENED

13:10.467 --> 13:11.300
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:11.300 --> 13:12.633
BUT THE SITUATION I WAS IN,

13:12.633 --> 13:15.267
WAS DOING WHAT I COULD DO.

13:15.267 --> 13:18.200
HAD A DYING CHILD, NO STEADY JOB

13:18.200 --> 13:19.167
AT THAT POINT BECAUSE WE WER

13:19.167 --> 13:20.300
BACK AND FORTH TO THE HOSPITAL

13:20.300 --> 13:21.967
I WAS DOING WHAT I COULD DO.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.967
>> DAVID OF THE SOUTHERN POVERTY

13:23.967 --> 13:29.333
LAW CENTER SAYS THAT PEOPLE LIKE

13:29.333 --> 13:32.333
THEM END UP PAYING JCF OFF FOR

13:32.333 --> 13:33.267
YEARS.

13:33.267 --> 13:39.400
>> ALL THEY ARE DOING A PAYING

13:39.400 --> 13:42.300
JCF FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF STAYING

13:42.300 --> 13:43.100
OUT OF JAIL.

13:43.100 --> 13:45.033
>> WE ASKED A COLUMBIA LAW

13:45.033 --> 13:46.433
PROFESSOR TO TAKE A LOOK AT TH

13:46.433 --> 13:48.400
LAWSUIT AND TO EVALUATE TH

13:48.400 --> 13:51.300
CONSTITUTIONALITY OF PRIVATE

13:51.300 --> 13:54.567
COMPANIES LIKE JSC COLLECTIN

13:54.567 --> 13:55.200
FINES.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.167
SHE HAS NO INVOLVEMENT IN TH

13:56.167 --> 13:56.467
CASE

13:56.467 --> 13:58.300
>> PART OF WHAT DUE PROCES

13:58.300 --> 13:59.533
REQUIRES IS THAT YOU HAVE AN

13:59.533 --> 14:00.733
IMPARTIAL DECISION MAKER

14:00.733 --> 14:03.300
IF THE COMPANY THAT IS IMPOSIN

14:03.300 --> 14:06.267
THE FEES AND CONTINUING YOUR

14:06.267 --> 14:09.667
SUPERVISION HAS A FINANCIA

14:09.667 --> 14:12.300
INTEREST IN YOUR STAYING UNDER

14:12.300 --> 14:15.633
SUPERVISION, THAT CALLS THEI

14:15.633 --> 14:16.867
IMPASH YALT INTO QUESTION.

14:16.867 --> 14:18.467
>> SHE ALSO SAYS THE COURT I

14:18.467 --> 14:21.133
OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE

14:21.133 --> 14:22.367
OPTIONS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO

14:22.367 --> 14:24.133
PAYOFF A DEBT TO ASSOCIATE

14:24.133 --> 14:24.867
SOCIETY.

14:24.867 --> 14:28.767
>> IF YOU'RE NOT PAYING BECAUS

14:28.767 --> 14:30.433
YOU'RE TOO POOR TO PAY, THEY

14:30.433 --> 14:33.667
HAVE TO DO AN INVESTIGATION AN

14:33.667 --> 14:35.500
OFFER ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS

14:35.500 --> 14:36.967
IN ORDER TO WORK OFF THE FINE IN

14:36.967 --> 14:37.633
SOME OTHER WAY

14:37.633 --> 14:41.800
>> WE REACHED OUT TO JSC

14:41.800 --> 14:43.533
MULTIPLE TIMES FOR AN INTERVIEW.

14:43.533 --> 14:47.533
ON ITS WEBSITE, JSC SAYS THE

14:47.533 --> 14:49.000
LAWSUIT IS BASELESS.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.200
WE ALSO TRIED TO ASK THE MAYOR

14:51.200 --> 14:53.033
OF THE TOWN IF HE WAS SATISF

14:53.033 --> 14:56.933
SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICES, BUT

14:56.933 --> 14:59.100
CITY HALL NEVER RESPONDED TO OUR

14:59.100 --> 14:59.300
REQUEST.

14:59.300 --> 15:01.567
SO WE WENT TO A CITY CIT

15:01.567 --> 15:02.167
COUNSEL MEETING.

15:02.167 --> 15:04.233
AFTER SPEAKING TO SOME OF TH

15:04.233 --> 15:05.800
RESIDENTS HERE, THEY FEEL LIKE

15:05.800 --> 15:08.100
THEY ARE BEING THREATENED WITH A

15:08.100 --> 15:09.567
JAIL SENTENCE IF THEY DON'T PA

15:09.567 --> 15:11.800
THEIR FINES.

15:11.800 --> 15:15.967
>> I MEAN, IS IT NOT

15:15.967 --> 15:16.500
UNCONSTITUTIONAL TO JAIL

15:16.500 --> 15:18.433
SOMEBODY WHO CANNOT PAY THEI

15:18.433 --> 15:18.700
FEE?

15:18.700 --> 15:21.167
>> I DON'T KNOW.

15:21.167 --> 15:25.433
THERE AGAIN, IF THE COURT --

15:25.433 --> 15:25.900
[ INAUDIBLE

15:25.900 --> 15:27.100
JURISDICTION AND I KNOW THAT

15:27.100 --> 15:29.267
WHEN IT COMES BACK, WE'RE ONE OF

15:29.267 --> 15:31.867
THE MANY, MANY CITIES IN ALABAMA

15:31.867 --> 15:34.300
THAT USES A CONTRACT SERVICE AND

15:34.300 --> 15:35.700
THE REASON BEING BECAUSE NOT

15:35.700 --> 15:37.233
HAVING THE AMOUNT OF PERSONNEL

15:37.233 --> 15:37.667
WE HAVE.

15:37.667 --> 15:40.733
>> EVEN THE STATE SENATOR WH

15:40.733 --> 15:42.900
SUPPORTS THE PRIVATE PROBATION

15:42.900 --> 15:43.867
INDUSTRY HAS CONCERNS.

15:43.867 --> 15:45.867
>> WHAT'S CURRENTLY IN EXISTENCE

15:45.867 --> 15:47.333
IS ALMOST LIKE THE WILD WEST

15:47.333 --> 15:49.500
IF YOU'RE GOING TO CREATE

15:49.500 --> 15:52.467
SYSTEM THAT QUOTE, UNQUOTE IS

15:52.467 --> 15:53.867
DEBTORS PRISON, ALL YOU'RE DOING

15:53.867 --> 15:55.767
IS INVITING YOURSELF TO

15:55.767 --> 15:56.567
FEDERAL LAWSUIT.

15:56.567 --> 15:58.433
>> AS FOR THIS FAMILY, AFTER

15:58.433 --> 16:00.333
BEING CHARGED AN INITIAL COURT

16:00.333 --> 16:02.367
COST OF $500 FOR TRAFFIC

16:02.367 --> 16:03.533
VIOLATIONS OF WHICH THEY WER

16:03.533 --> 16:04.733
FOUND NOT GUILTY, COUR

16:04.733 --> 16:08.000
DOCUMENTS PROVIDED BY THEI

16:08.000 --> 16:10.167
LAWYERS SHOW THAT THEY'VE PAID

16:10.167 --> 16:11.700
ALMOST $1300 TO THE COURT.

16:11.700 --> 16:13.467
IT'S A NUMBER THAT DOESN'T EVE

16:13.467 --> 16:15.533
INCLUDE ALL THE ADDITIONAL

16:15.533 --> 16:18.900
MONTHLY FEES THEY PAID T

16:18.900 --> 16:23.500
JOURNAL CORRECTION SERVICES.

16:23.500 --> 16:26.067
THEY FAILED TO PROVIDE US TH

16:26.067 --> 16:26.167
DOCUMENTS.

16:26.167 --> 16:29.900
TIMOTHY SAYS HIS FAMILY STIL

16:29.900 --> 16:30.833
CORRECTION SERVICES.

16:30.833 --> 16:31.233
HOW MUCH

16:31.233 --> 16:32.233
HE'S NOT SURE.

16:32.233 --> 16:36.800
HE SAYS JCS STOPPED CONTACTING

16:36.800 --> 16:42.433
HIM AFTER THE LAWSUIT WAS FILED.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.800
SOME $30 BILLION IN THE U.S.

17:02.800 --> 17:04.800
LAST YEAR AND SUPPLIERS CA

17:04.800 --> 17:06.567
BARELY KEEP UP WITH DEMAND

17:06.567 --> 17:08.733
WALMART ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOUL

17:08.733 --> 17:11.100
SLASH PRICES OF SOME OF IT

17:11.100 --> 17:13.500
ORGANIC PRODUCTS BY 25%.

17:13.500 --> 17:18.100
THE COMPANY SAYS IT ACTED AFTE

17:18.100 --> 17:20.400
RESEARCH SHOWS THEIR CUSTOMERS

17:20.400 --> 17:23.833
WOULD PURCHASE ORGANIC PRODUCT

17:23.833 --> 17:26.233
IF IT WAS MORE AFFORDABLE.

17:26.233 --> 17:28.167
SO FIRST OF ALL, WHAT'S TH

17:28.167 --> 17:29.367
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE LARGES

17:29.367 --> 17:30.667
RETAIL IN THE COUNTRY, BUT

17:30.667 --> 17:33.467
BEYOND THAT, WHY IS THIS NEWS SO

17:33.467 --> 17:33.967
IMPORTANT?

17:33.967 --> 17:36.733
>> PEOPLE THINK THAT THIS IS

17:36.733 --> 17:38.000
GOING TO BE THE INFLECTION POINT

17:38.000 --> 17:42.333
THAT WILL MAKE ORGANIC FOODS

17:42.333 --> 17:42.733
MORE MAINSTREAM.

17:42.733 --> 17:46.067
WALMART ALREADY SELLS MORE THA

17:46.067 --> 17:48.467
1,600 DIFFERENT ITEMS.

17:48.467 --> 17:51.200
NOW THEY'RE ADDING 100 ITEMS

17:51.200 --> 17:53.500
FROM UNDER THE WILD OATS BRAND

17:53.500 --> 17:55.633
THOSE WILL NOT HAVE THE TYPICA

17:55.633 --> 17:57.533
PREMIUM YOU SEE WITH ORGANIC

17:57.533 --> 17:57.933
FOOD

17:57.933 --> 18:00.467
THERE'S THE 25% PREEM YI

18:00.467 --> 18:01.100
TYPICALLY.

18:01.100 --> 18:01.833
THAT WILL BE GONE.

18:01.833 --> 18:04.033
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THIS IS

18:04.033 --> 18:06.833
WAY TO BRING ORGANIC FOOD TO

18:06.833 --> 18:07.833
LOWER INCOME SHOPPERS.

18:07.833 --> 18:09.967
>> DOES THAT MEAN THAT OTHER

18:09.967 --> 18:11.400
RETAILERS ADJUST THEIR PRICES?

18:11.400 --> 18:14.300
>> THE IMPACT WILL ACTUALLY BE

18:14.300 --> 18:16.667
MORE ON FOOD MAKERS.

18:16.667 --> 18:18.233
THERE WON'T BE THAT MUCH

18:18.233 --> 18:20.067
PRESSURE ON WHOLE FOODS BECAUS

18:20.067 --> 18:24.500
THERE ISN'T THAT MUCH OVERLA

18:24.500 --> 18:25.600
BETWEEN WHOLE FOOD SHOPPERS AN

18:25.600 --> 18:27.267
WALMART SHOPPERS

18:27.267 --> 18:29.867
PEOPLE THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE

18:29.867 --> 18:33.367
MORE OF THE -- WILL BE USED FO

18:33.367 --> 18:34.467
CONVENTIONAL FARMING -- I MEAN

18:34.467 --> 18:37.833
FOR ORGANIC FARMING RATHER THA

18:37.833 --> 18:38.100
CONVENTIONAL

18:38.100 --> 18:41.633
SO THAT IN TURN WILL LOWER

18:41.633 --> 18:41.933
COSTS.

18:41.933 --> 18:45.933
IT WILL CREATE A CYCLE FOR

18:45.933 --> 18:46.867
ORGANIC FOODS.

18:46.867 --> 18:49.033
THAT WILL PRESSURE COMPANIES

18:49.033 --> 18:52.300
LIKE KEHL LOG AMONG OTHERS T

18:52.300 --> 18:53.500
OFFER MORE ORGANIC FOODS

18:53.500 --> 18:57.067
>> SO THIS IS REALLY MOR

18:57.067 --> 18:58.900
PRESSURE ON MANUFACTURERS TO

18:58.900 --> 19:01.033
CREATE MORE ORGANIC FOOD FOR

19:01.033 --> 19:01.700
RETAILERS THEN

19:01.700 --> 19:02.467
>> ABSOLUTELY.

19:02.467 --> 19:04.700
>> EVEN AS WE SEE THE TREN

19:04.700 --> 19:06.900
LINES GOING UP, THIS IS STILL

19:06.900 --> 19:08.500
VERY SMALL FRACTION OF THE

19:08.500 --> 19:10.033
OVERALL FOOD MARKET, RIGHT

19:10.033 --> 19:12.667
>> IT'S ROUGHLY 4% OF FOOD

19:12.667 --> 19:13.833
SPENDING IN THE UNITED STATES.

19:13.833 --> 19:16.233
BUT IT'S GROWING BY ABOUT 10

19:16.233 --> 19:16.367
PER YEAR

19:16.367 --> 19:17.967
IF YOU LOOK AT COMPANIES LIK

19:17.967 --> 19:20.000
WALMART AND TARGET, THEY GET A

19:20.000 --> 19:22.800
HUGE AMOUNT OF THEIR SALES FRO

19:22.800 --> 19:23.100
GROCERY.

19:23.100 --> 19:25.500
WALMART GETS 55% OF ITS REVENU

19:25.500 --> 19:26.833
FROM GROCERY

19:26.833 --> 19:28.467
IT HAS BEEN A STRUGGLING

19:28.467 --> 19:29.567
BUSINESS FOR THEM.

19:29.567 --> 19:32.100
SO THIS IS A WAY FOR THEM TO

19:32.100 --> 19:34.133
GIVE A BOOST TO THE RAW GROCER

19:34.133 --> 19:34.767
SALES.

19:34.767 --> 19:37.933
>> WHAT DOES THIS DO FOR THE

19:37.933 --> 19:38.733
PRODUCERS OF FOOD?

19:38.733 --> 19:41.467
RIGHT NOW, IT SEEMS THESE PRICES

19:41.467 --> 19:43.867
ARE UP BECAUSE SUPPLY IS SHORTER

19:43.867 --> 19:44.033
THAN DEMAND.

19:44.033 --> 19:46.967
>> WELL, THE -- SEVERAL GROUPS

19:46.967 --> 19:48.867
SUCH AS THE ENVIRONMENTA

19:48.867 --> 19:51.333
WORKING GROUP AND THE CENTER FOR

19:51.333 --> 19:54.033
SCIENCE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST

19:54.033 --> 19:55.967
BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE

19:55.967 --> 19:59.733
AN INCENTIVE FOR MORE FARMERS TO

19:59.733 --> 20:02.767
USE MORE LABS FOR ORGANI

20:02.767 --> 20:03.300
FARMING.

20:03.300 --> 20:05.767
OVERALL ORGANIC FOOD PRICES,

20:05.767 --> 20:08.600
BEYOND THESE 100 WILD OATS ITEMS

20:08.600 --> 20:10.433
THAT WALMART WILL BE SELLING

20:10.433 --> 20:11.433
WILL FALL.

20:11.433 --> 20:13.267
THAT WILL IN TURN PRESSURE THE

20:13.267 --> 20:14.500
PACKAGED FOOD MAKERS

20:14.500 --> 20:16.367
>> AND THIS ISN'T NECESSARIL

20:16.367 --> 20:18.233
LIKELY TO HAPPEN ANY TIME SOON

20:18.233 --> 20:21.000
EVEN IF A FARMER TURNS OVER HI

20:21.000 --> 20:23.433
LAND INTO ORGANIC CROPS, THI

20:23.433 --> 20:25.733
TAKES A COUPLE YEARS FOR THE FDA

20:25.733 --> 20:28.433
TO GIVE YOU THAT SALE, RIGHT

20:28.433 --> 20:30.933
>> YOU CAN'T JUST USE YOUR FAR

20:30.933 --> 20:32.867
DIFFERENTLY FROM ONE DAY TO TH

20:32.867 --> 20:33.500
NEXT

20:33.500 --> 20:35.833
THE REASON THIS HAS BEEN SEEN AS

20:35.833 --> 20:37.700
A PRETTY BIG DEAL IS THAT IT'S A

20:37.700 --> 20:41.200
TURNING POINT NOW IN FOO

20:41.200 --> 20:42.267
CONSUMPTION.

20:42.267 --> 20:44.733
ORGANIC FOOD HAS TYPICALLY BEE

20:44.733 --> 20:46.700
ASSOCIATED WITH MORE AFFLUEN

20:46.700 --> 20:46.833
SHOPPERS

20:46.833 --> 20:48.567
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THIS I

20:48.567 --> 20:50.100
THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS I

20:50.100 --> 20:52.300
BECOMING MAINSTREAM AND VIABLE

20:52.300 --> 20:53.667
FOR LOWER INCOME SHOPPERS.

20:53.667 --> 20:55.567
>> WHAT KIND OF PRODUCTS UNDER

20:55.567 --> 20:57.833
THIS WILD OATS BRAND WIL

20:57.833 --> 20:58.733
WALMART BE SELLING

20:58.733 --> 21:01.300
>> THE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO

21:01.300 --> 21:02.900
REMEMBER IS THAT THIS IS NOT

21:02.900 --> 21:05.033
GOING TO BE DAIRY AND PRODUCE.

21:05.033 --> 21:11.233
THEY INCLUDE THINGS LIKE TOMAT

21:11.233 --> 21:14.500
PASTE, OLIVE OIL

21:14.500 --> 21:17.700
THE OTHER 1,600 ITEMS CONSIDERED

21:17.700 --> 21:19.167
ORGANIC WHICH ARE MOSTLY PRODUCE

21:19.167 --> 21:23.033
AND DAIRY, THEY WILL KEEP THAT

21:23.033 --> 21:24.000
ORGANIC PRICE PREMIUM.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.533
>> IS THIS ALSO TRYING TO CATC

21:25.533 --> 21:27.667
UP WITH THE TREND OF YOUNGER

21:27.667 --> 21:29.267
PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE CONSCIOU

21:29.267 --> 21:33.433
ABOUT WHAT GOES IN THEIR FOOD?

21:33.433 --> 21:36.200
>> LOWER INCOME SHOPTERS ARE

21:36.200 --> 21:37.333
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE

21:37.333 --> 21:39.333
THEY WANT TO EAT FOODS THAT AR

21:39.333 --> 21:41.100
GOOD FOR THEM AND SUSTAINABL

21:41.100 --> 21:42.633
FOR THE ECONOMY.

21:42.633 --> 21:44.967
SO IT'S -- AS YOU MENTIONE

21:44.967 --> 21:46.967
BEFORE, WALMART'S OWN RESEARCH

21:46.967 --> 21:50.700
FOUND THAT 90% OF ITS SHOPPERS

21:50.700 --> 21:52.367
WOULD BE WILLING TO BUY ORGANI

21:52.367 --> 21:54.767
FOODS IF IT WERE AFFORDABLE.

21:54.767 --> 21:56.433
>> THANKS SO MUCH.

21:56.433 --> 22:00.367
>> THANK YOU
