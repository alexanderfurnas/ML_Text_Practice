WEBVTT

00:08.342 --> 00:16.884
JUDY WOODRUFF: An Iran nuclear
deal is reached. World powers
and Tehran strike a compromise

00:16.884 --> 00:20.220
to end sanctions and
limit nuclear power.

00:20.220 --> 00:21.822
Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:21.822 --> 00:24.491
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:24.491 --> 00:28.896
Also ahead this Tuesday: full
analysis of today's historic
pact. What will a new chapter

00:28.896 --> 00:31.265
in Iran's relations with
the world look like?

00:31.265 --> 00:33.066
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus:

00:33.066 --> 00:35.702
HAL WEAVER, New Horizons Project
Scientist: I like to call this
a mission of delayed

00:35.702 --> 00:37.371
gratification.

00:37.371 --> 00:42.242
JUDY WOODRUFF: Unlocking the
mysteries of the solar system's
underdog, after a three

00:42.242 --> 00:47.948
billion-mile journey and nearly
a decade, a close-up look at
Pluto.

00:47.948 --> 00:52.920
HAL WEAVER: The opportunity to
transform Pluto from a little
pixelated blob into a

00:52.920 --> 00:57.157
world with complexity and
diversity is just going to be
amazing.

00:57.157 --> 00:59.426
GWEN IFILL: Those are some of
the stories we're covering on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:59.426 --> 00:59.359
(BREAK)

01:01.261 --> 01:05.132
JUDY WOODRUFF: The world woke
up today to the news of an
agreement aimed at curbing

01:05.132 --> 01:10.804
Iran's nuclear weapons program.
It was the fruit of marathon
talks between Iran and a

01:10.804 --> 01:15.175
group of world powers, the
United States and other
permanent members of the U.N.
Security

01:15.175 --> 01:18.779
Council, plus Germany.

01:18.779 --> 01:22.683
The weary foreign ministers
gathered after 18 long days and
nights of talks in Vienna.

01:28.188 --> 01:34.261
It's a great honor for us to
announce that we have reached an
agreement on the Iranian

01:34.261 --> 01:36.863
nuclear issue.

01:36.863 --> 01:40.334
JUDY WOODRUFF: Within minutes
of that formal statement,
President Obama addressed the
nation

01:40.334 --> 01:42.469
from the White House.

01:42.469 --> 01:45.305
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: We have stopped
the spread of nuclear weapons

01:45.305 --> 01:52.379
in this region. Because of this
deal, the international
community will be able to verify

01:52.379 --> 01:57.150
that the Islamic MDNM Republic
of Iran will not develop a
nuclear weapon.

01:57.150 --> 02:02.122
JUDY WOODRUFF: The agreement
followed more than two years of
talks, including the first

02:02.122 --> 02:07.327
direct U.S. negotiations with
Iran in more than 35 years. The
president said it met

02:07.327 --> 02:10.364
his standards for a good deal.

02:10.364 --> 02:14.634
BARACK OBAMA: This deal meets
every single one of the bottom
lines that we established

02:14.634 --> 02:18.939
when we achieved a framework
earlier this spring. Every
pathway to a nuclear weapon

02:18.939 --> 02:22.242
is cut off.

02:22.242 --> 02:27.280
And the inspection and
transparency regime necessary to
verify that objective will be

02:27.280 --> 02:33.320
put in place. Because of this
deal, Iran will not produce the
highly enriched uranium

02:33.320 --> 02:36.490
and weapons-grade plutonium that
form the raw materials necessary
for a nuclear bomb.

02:44.431 --> 02:52.239
will be limited for eight years;
5,000 centrifuges will be
allowed to operate, while 14,000
others,

02:52.239 --> 02:57.010
including more advanced models,
are monitored by international
inspectors.

02:57.010 --> 03:04.418
For 15 years, Iran will be
allowed a stockpile of 660
pounds of uranium, but enriched
to

03:04.418 --> 03:11.324
a level well below
weapons-grade. Enrichment will
end at the Fordow nuclear site,
and the

03:11.324 --> 03:18.098
heavy water reactor at the Arak
site will be rebuilt for
peaceful uses. And Iran agrees

03:18.098 --> 03:23.603
not to engage in research and
development that could lead to a
nuclear weapon.

03:23.603 --> 03:29.376
Still, harking back to President
Reagan's trust but verify, Mr.
Obama said the U.S.

03:29.376 --> 03:34.147
and its five partners will not
simply trust Iran to comply.

03:34.147 --> 03:39.820
BARACK OBAMA: This deal is not
built on trust. It is built on
verification. Inspectors

03:39.820 --> 03:44.224
will have 24/7 access to
Iran's key nuclear facilities.

03:44.224 --> 03:49.796
JUDY WOODRUFF: In return, Iran
gets phased relief from
sanctions that have crippled its

03:49.796 --> 03:56.269
economy for years, but there are
provisions for a snap-back of
those sanctions if Tehran

03:56.269 --> 04:02.042
violates the agreement. Even
so, Iran's president, Hassan
Rouhani, insisted today

04:02.042 --> 04:05.712
it's not the sanctions that
got his country to bargain.

04:05.712 --> 04:09.583
HASSAN ROUHANI, Iranian
President (through translator):
It was the resistance of our

04:09.583 --> 04:13.620
people and their opposition that
brought the other side to the
negotiating table in the

04:13.620 --> 04:18.425
best way. If today some of the
P5-plus-one countries want to
announce that they deterred

04:18.425 --> 04:22.395
Iran from making an atomic bomb,
Iran has never pursed an atomic
bomb and will never

04:22.395 --> 04:24.764
pursue that.

04:24.764 --> 04:30.570
JUDY WOODRUFF: Later, state TV
reported supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei thanked

04:30.570 --> 04:35.575
Rouhani and his negotiators for
their honest and diligent
efforts.

04:35.575 --> 04:41.615
But, in Israel, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu wasted no
time in denouncing the deal.

04:41.615 --> 04:46.052
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, Israeli
Prime Minister: What a
stunning, historic mistake. The

04:46.052 --> 04:53.860
world is a much more dangerous
place today than it was
yesterday. The leading
international

04:53.860 --> 04:58.798
powers have bet our collective
future on a deal with the
foremost sponsor of
international

04:58.798 --> 05:00.667
terrorism.

05:00.667 --> 05:05.772
JUDY WOODRUFF: Netanyahu
relayed his concerns directly to
the president in a phone call.

05:05.772 --> 05:10.477
He'd lobbied hard against the
deal, even addressing Congress
last March, at the invitation

05:10.477 --> 05:13.146
of House Speaker John Boehner.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.982
REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH),
Speaker of the House: The deal
that we have out there, in my
view,

05:15.982 --> 05:19.286
from what I know of it
thus far, is unacceptable.

05:19.286 --> 05:23.156
JUDY WOODRUFF: Boehner today
left little doubt as to where he
and most House Republicans

05:23.156 --> 05:25.492
stand on the pact.

05:25.492 --> 05:29.930
REP. JOHN BOEHNER: It's going
to hand a dangerous regime
billions of dollars in sanctions

05:29.930 --> 05:35.068
relief, while paving the way for
a nuclear Iran. If, in fact,
it's as bad a deal as

05:35.068 --> 05:38.738
I think it is at this moment, we
will do everything we can to
stop it.

05:38.738 --> 05:42.275
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senate
Republicans were likewise
skeptical, including Foreign
Relations Chair

05:42.275 --> 05:44.377
Bob Corker.

05:44.377 --> 05:50.317
SEN. BOB CORKER (R), Tennessee:
I have to say that, when we
passed over with the interim

05:50.317 --> 05:58.458
agreement from dismantling their
program to moving towards
agreeing that there would be

05:58.458 --> 06:02.562
enrichment, and then over time
moving to what I would call
managed proliferation, we really

06:02.562 --> 06:05.398
crossed the Rubicon.

06:05.398 --> 06:09.970
JUDY WOODRUFF: Leading
Democrats promised to examine
the agreement closely, as
Congress

06:09.970 --> 06:14.074
now has 60 days to vote up or
down. And the president fired
off a warning shot this

06:14.074 --> 06:15.976
morning.

06:15.976 --> 06:20.247
BARACK OBAMA: I am confident
that this deal will meet the
national security interest of

06:20.247 --> 06:25.752
the United States and our
allies, so I will veto any
legislation that prevents the
successful

06:25.752 --> 06:28.722
implementation of this deal.

06:28.722 --> 06:33.627
JUDY WOODRUFF: The matter was
immediate grist for the
presidential campaign.
Republican

06:33.627 --> 06:39.499
Senator Marco Rubio, the Foreign
Relations Committee member,
blasted the deal in a statement,

06:39.499 --> 06:44.170
saying: "I expect that a
significant majority in Congress
will share my skepticism of this

06:44.170 --> 06:47.574
agreement and vote it down."

06:47.574 --> 06:52.012
Another leading Republican
contender, Jeb Bush, ended his
denunciation saying: "This

06:52.012 --> 06:56.316
isn't diplomacy. It
is appeasement."

06:56.316 --> 07:00.654
The Democratic front-runner,
former Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton, was on Capitol
Hill

07:00.654 --> 07:03.023
today, meeting with Democrats.

07:03.023 --> 07:06.059
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: I think
we have to look at this
seriously,

07:06.059 --> 07:11.498
evaluate it carefully, but I
believe, based on what I know
now, this is an important step.

07:17.003 --> 07:20.974
the deal in the
Security Council.

07:20.974 --> 07:26.846
Later, there were small
demonstrations in Tehran
cheering the expected end to
sanctions.

07:26.846 --> 07:31.551
People held flags and chanted
thanks to Iran's president. We
will hear from President

07:31.551 --> 07:34.721
Obama's national security
adviser and several former U.S.
officials after the news
summary.

07:41.594 --> 07:47.067
were disappointed. Instead,
worries about corporate profits
kept gains in check. The

07:47.067 --> 07:53.106
Dow Jones industrial average
added 76 points to close above
18050. The Nasdaq rose 33

07:53.106 --> 07:56.743
points and the S&P
500 added nine.

07:56.743 --> 08:02.048
JUDY WOODRUFF: Greek Prime
Minister Alexis Tsipras sought
to rally his Syriza Party today

08:02.048 --> 08:07.620
to back a new austerity bill.
The Greek Parliament has 24
hours to pass tax increases

08:07.620 --> 08:12.092
and pension reforms, as the
price of a new international
bailout.

08:12.092 --> 08:16.262
But, as Paul Mason of
Independent Television News
reports, Syriza lawmakers and
voters

08:16.262 --> 08:19.065
aren't so sure.

08:19.065 --> 08:24.804
PAUL MASON: If you want a
vision of Greece's troubled
future, start here. This
container

08:24.804 --> 08:30.944
port was sold five years ago to
the Chinese for five billion
euros. Now the whole
waterfront's

08:30.944 --> 08:35.982
for sale after the far-left
party, Syriza, agreed to rush
through privatization worth

08:35.982 --> 08:42.021
50 billion. The problem, the
Syriza-supporting dockers who
work here. This man is their

08:42.021 --> 08:44.157
leader.

08:44.157 --> 08:48.161
And he wants the government to
reject the deal it just signed.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.830
If you could say one thing to
Alexis Tsipras, what would it
be?

08:50.830 --> 08:55.835
GIORGOS GOGOS, Union Leader: So
far, he has gained the trust of
Greek people, so,

08:55.835 --> 09:00.707
he has to continue with this and
to listen to the people to go
further and to reject

09:00.707 --> 09:04.944
this agreement, which is
not an honest agreement.

09:04.944 --> 09:11.284
PAUL MASON: As Syriza's leaders
arrived, tight-lipped for a
party meeting, their right-wing

09:11.284 --> 09:17.590
coalition partner
wasn't tight-lipped.

09:17.590 --> 09:27.033
He called what's happening a
coup, blackmail. And as the
vote nears in the Parliament,

09:27.033 --> 09:31.471
it's pressure like this that
spurred up to 30 M.P.s from the
ruling party to rebel, including

09:31.471 --> 09:35.375
the M.P. for the area where
the privatized port is.

09:35.375 --> 09:41.080
STATHIS LEOUTSAKOS, Greek
Parliament Member (through
translator): Syriza can only
stay

09:41.080 --> 09:45.151
united if it sticks to the
program it stood on at the
election. And that's what it
needs

09:45.151 --> 09:48.855
to do. There's no growth and no
solution for Greece within the
Eurozone. And if we

09:48.855 --> 09:53.259
go on like this,
Eurozone is over.

09:53.259 --> 09:59.365
PAUL MASON: Athens tonight
subdued and waiting for an
answer. Can the most far-left
party

09:59.365 --> 10:04.471
ever elected in modern Europe
summon the nerve to do austerity
on this scale?

10:04.471 --> 10:09.175
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tsipras and his
party were voted into power in
January promising to end

10:09.175 --> 10:13.112
years of spending cuts and
other austerity measures.

10:13.112 --> 10:17.717
GWEN IFILL: This was the day
for closing arguments in the
trial of James Holmes, almost

10:17.717 --> 10:23.723
three years after he opened fire
in a Colorado movie theater.
Prosecutors argued Holmes

10:23.723 --> 10:29.729
was sane and intent on mass
murder when he killed 12 people
and wounded dozens more.

10:29.729 --> 10:33.700
Defense attorneys say Holmes
should be found not guilty by
reason of insanity. The trial

10:33.700 --> 10:36.836
has lasted 11 weeks.

10:36.836 --> 10:41.307
JUDY WOODRUFF: Relatives of a
New York City man who died in
police custody vowed today

10:41.307 --> 10:47.981
their fight is not over. Eric
Garner's family reached a $5.9
million settlement on Monday.

10:47.981 --> 10:52.285
He died last summer, when a
white officer put him in a
chokehold. Garner's mother

10:52.285 --> 10:55.989
called again today for federal
civil rights charges.

10:55.989 --> 11:00.159
GWEN CARR, Mother of Eric
Garner: This settlement that we
get, people -- we're walking up
and

11:00.159 --> 11:05.298
down the street, they're saying
congratulations. Don't
congratulate us. This is not a
victory.

11:05.298 --> 11:10.069
The victory will come when we
get justice. Then we want to
have a victory party.

11:10.069 --> 11:14.741
JUDY WOODRUFF: A state grand
jury has declined to indict the
police officer.

11:14.741 --> 11:19.078
GWEN IFILL: A Boston police
captain's son was ordered held
without bond today in an

11:19.078 --> 11:24.918
alleged bomb plot. The FBI says
Alexander Ciccolo planned to set
off pressure cooker

11:24.918 --> 11:30.089
bombs at a university. His
father alerted authorities that
Ciccolo had a history of

11:30.089 --> 11:34.093
mental illness and wanted to
join the Islamic State group.
He was arrested in a sting

11:34.093 --> 11:36.629
on the Fourth of July.

11:36.629 --> 11:41.267
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
called today for reforms in
prison sentencing aimed at

11:41.267 --> 11:46.673
eliminating racial disparities
and cutting costs. He spoke at
the NAACP National Convention

11:46.673 --> 11:51.477
in Philadelphia and criticized
mandatory minimum sentences.

11:51.477 --> 11:57.050
BARACK OBAMA: We have also
locked up more and more
nonviolent drug offenders than
ever

11:57.050 --> 12:04.324
before for longer than ever
before. And that is the real
reason our prison population

12:04.324 --> 12:14.267
is so high. In far too many
cases, the punishment simply
doesn't fit the crime.

12:14.267 --> 12:17.470
JUDY WOODRUFF: To underscore
his point, the president
yesterday commuted the sentences

12:17.470 --> 12:20.340
of 46 drug offenders.

12:20.340 --> 12:26.145
GWEN IFILL: A new discovery lit
up the world of physics today.
For the first time, scientists

12:26.145 --> 12:31.784
detected a subatomic particle
called the pentaquark. Its
existence was first predicted in
the

12:31.784 --> 12:37.290
1960s, but it took the world's
largest atom smasher outside
Geneva to confirm that it's

12:37.290 --> 12:42.362
really there. Researchers say
the discovery will help explain
the fundamentals of matter.

12:42.362 --> 12:48.534
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the last of
Boston's record winter snowfall
finally melted today.

12:48.534 --> 12:53.406
At one point, the snow was
heaped in a massive pile along
part of the city's waterfront.

12:53.406 --> 12:57.510
Now all that's left are puddles
and tons of garbage that got
swept up by snowplows.

13:01.447 --> 13:06.986
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
after 20 months of negotiations,
digging into the landmark

13:06.986 --> 13:12.492
deal over Iran's nuclear
program; an interview with
Republican presidential
candidate Louisiana

13:12.492 --> 13:18.464
Governor Bobby Jindal; and
unlocking the mysteries of
Pluto.

13:18.464 --> 13:30.943
GWEN IFILL: We return to the
news that dominated today, the
nuclear deal with Iran.

13:30.943 --> 13:34.547
A short while ago, I spoke with
Susan Rice, the president's
national security adviser.

13:38.418 --> 13:42.121
One of our leading allies,
Benjamin Netanyahu, prime
minister of Israel, today called
this

13:42.121 --> 13:46.159
deal an historic mistake.
Why is he wrong?

13:46.159 --> 13:49.595
SUSAN RICE, U.S. National
Security Adviser: Well, he's
wrong, Gwen, because this is

13:49.595 --> 13:55.368
actually a very strong deal
that, when implemented, will cut
off all of Iran's potential
pathways

13:55.368 --> 13:59.138
to a nuclear weapon in a
fully verifiable fashion.

13:59.138 --> 14:07.280
We will have very intrusive 24/7
presence at all elements of
Iran's nuclear supply chain

14:07.280 --> 14:12.151
and all of its declared
facilities. We will have the
ability to inspect facilities
about

14:12.151 --> 14:18.925
which there are suspicions. We
will reduce Iran's stockpile of
enriched uranium by 98

14:18.925 --> 14:21.494
percent.

14:21.494 --> 14:27.300
Two-thirds of its centrifuges
will be dismantled and removed
and stored under international

14:27.300 --> 14:33.940
observation. This will be the
most comprehensive and effective
nuclear transparency regime

14:33.940 --> 14:36.676
ever implemented.

14:36.676 --> 14:41.814
So, in fact, that is not the
case. And I think it's worth
recalling that Prime Minister

14:41.814 --> 14:48.287
Netanyahu was equally critical
of the interim agreement that we
announced in November of

14:48.287 --> 14:52.058
2013. He called that also a
historic mistake and he said the
sanctions regime would crumble

14:52.058 --> 14:54.360
down.

14:54.360 --> 14:58.564
Now he and many others are
arguing that we shouldn't take
the comprehensive deal that

14:58.564 --> 15:03.369
we just negotiated. We should
stick with the interim agreement
that he criticized almost

15:03.369 --> 15:08.207
two years ago. So, I think, as
time passes, if this is
effectively implemented -- and

15:08.207 --> 15:14.580
we believe it will be -- then he
will in due course see its
benefits, as we do.

15:14.580 --> 15:19.852
But the important thing to
understand, Gwen, is that Iran
will not receive any sanctions

15:19.852 --> 15:28.227
relief under this comprehensive
deal until it has taken all the
necessary steps to meet

15:28.227 --> 15:33.766
its nuclear requirements. So,
until it has dismantled the
centrifuges that it is required

15:33.766 --> 15:40.006
to dismantle at Natanz and
Fordow, until it's shipped out
its stockpile of enriched
uranium,

15:40.006 --> 15:45.378
until it's dismantled the core
of its plutonium reactor, there
will be no sanctions relief.

15:52.218 --> 15:56.522
GWEN IFILL: But, Ambassador
Rice, if, for some reason, Iran
doesn't keep its promises,

15:56.522 --> 16:01.427
if it doesn't grant access to
these suspicious sites, it goes
-- this whole thing goes back

16:01.427 --> 16:04.263
to a joint commission on which
Iran serves as a member. Isn't
that a huge loophole?

16:08.467 --> 16:13.906
First of all, the joint
commission is not the last word.
The last word is the United

16:13.906 --> 16:21.347
Nations Security Council. And
we have constructed this deal in
a unique and very effective
fashion

16:21.347 --> 16:26.485
where, if one permanent member
of the Security Council, if the
United States of America finds

16:26.485 --> 16:31.657
that Iran is in material breach
of its obligations under this
agreement, we can go directly to

16:31.657 --> 16:38.030
the Security Council, and White
House a -- White House a
time-bound period, snap back
unilaterally

16:38.030 --> 16:42.935
all of the sanctions under the
U.N. auspices that we have
today.

16:42.935 --> 16:48.174
And, of course, we can snap back
our national sanctions, and the
E.U. can do the same. So,

16:48.174 --> 16:52.612
we can't be stopped by China, by
Russia, by Iran if in fact there
is a material breech.

16:52.612 --> 16:56.349
GWEN IFILL: Well, let's talk
about the sanctions. Even by
lifting them for a short period

16:56.349 --> 17:00.987
of time, you are starting the
flow of money to Iran which
could go to support some of

17:00.987 --> 17:05.892
our enemies, including people
who are trying to take out
Syrian President Assad. How

17:05.892 --> 17:08.261
do you justify that?

17:08.261 --> 17:12.498
SUSAN RICE: Well, let's recall
why we have the sanctions in the
first place.

17:12.498 --> 17:18.004
I was the ambassador at the
United Nations when we
implemented and negotiated the
toughest

17:18.004 --> 17:22.508
and last of these sanctions
resolutions. The whole purpose
of the sanctions regime and

17:22.508 --> 17:27.380
the reason why we got the entire
international community, not
just to support them, but to

17:27.380 --> 17:32.485
implement them faithfully, was
because the aim was to use the
sanctions pressure to bring

17:32.485 --> 17:35.655
Iran to the negotiating table,
so that we could prevent Iran
from acquiring a nuclear

17:35.655 --> 17:37.690
weapon.

17:37.690 --> 17:41.060
This was never about human
rights. It wasn't about
terrorism. It wasn't about
Iran's

17:41.060 --> 17:46.065
destabilizing activities in the
region, all of which we remain
deeply concerned about.

17:46.065 --> 17:50.836
But it was about preventing
Iran from getting a nuclear
weapon at the negotiating table.

17:50.836 --> 17:57.143
We have succeeded, if this deal
is implemented, in doing that.
And the deal always was that,

17:57.143 --> 18:02.848
if and when Iran met its nuclear
obligations and the world could
be satisfied that it wasn't

18:02.848 --> 18:06.552
able to develop a nuclear
weapon, then the sanctions would
be lifted.

18:06.552 --> 18:12.124
And so the sanctions under this
scheme would be lifted, but only
after Iran's taken all

18:12.124 --> 18:16.562
the steps and we have verified
that it's taken all the steps
that it's committed to take.

18:16.562 --> 18:22.435
And then, even after the
sanctions are suspended, we will
have the ability if over -- at
any

18:22.435 --> 18:30.409
point over a 15-year period Iran
violates its obligations, to
snap these sanctions back

18:30.409 --> 18:36.048
into place swiftly and
effectively, without Iran or
Russia or China getting in our
way.

18:36.048 --> 18:38.484
GWEN IFILL: Was there any
discussion at any point about
releasing U.S. hostages as

18:38.484 --> 18:40.686
part of this deal?

18:40.686 --> 18:44.557
SUSAN RICE: Not as part of this
deal, but we have been in
discussions with the Iranians

18:44.557 --> 18:50.229
about the Americans that are
being imprisoned in Iran. This
is a source of very, very

18:50.229 --> 18:54.467
grave concern for all of us, and
in particular President Obama.

18:54.467 --> 18:58.804
Those talks continue. And we're
not going to rest until they are
released. But we

18:58.804 --> 19:03.175
never wanted to link them to the
nuclear deal, because,
obviously, up until the last
minute,

19:03.175 --> 19:06.679
there was every possibility that
there wouldn't be a nuclear
deal.

19:06.679 --> 19:11.317
So we're committed to getting
our Americans home safely in any
event, and we will continue

19:11.317 --> 19:14.320
to work to do everything we can.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.822
GWEN IFILL: And, finally,
Ambassador Rice, is the
president's veto threat open to
discussion

19:16.822 --> 19:18.457
or negotiation?

19:18.457 --> 19:20.993
SUSAN RICE: It didn't
sound like it, did it?

19:20.993 --> 19:23.095
GWEN IFILL: OK.

19:23.095 --> 19:27.199
SUSAN RICE: No, Gwen,
seriously, and -- no, because we
have negotiated a deal that is

19:27.199 --> 19:31.837
good for the United States, it's
good for Israel, it's good for
world peace and security.

19:31.837 --> 19:36.409
And if the United States
were the country,

19:36.409 --> 19:41.547
the sole country out of the
international community to blow
up a deal that we have
negotiated

19:41.547 --> 19:46.652
that we believe satisfies all of
our requirements, then what will
happen? Well, in the first

19:46.652 --> 19:50.823
instance, the sanctions regime
that we have worked so hard to
maintain will fall apart,

19:50.823 --> 19:54.560
because the rest of the world
will say, what is the point?

19:54.560 --> 20:00.533
Countries like Japan and India
that have paid an economic price
to implement these sanctions

20:00.533 --> 20:05.504
would no longer feel the
obligation to do so. Iran would
say, look, we signed up for

20:05.504 --> 20:09.875
the deal, we're ready to do our
part, but now, since there's no
prospect of sanctions

20:09.875 --> 20:13.479
relief, we're going to pursue
our nuclear program
unconstrained.

20:13.479 --> 20:21.387
That would be a lose-lose
situation. So it would be very
unfortunate if the United

20:21.387 --> 20:28.227
States were the one to abrogate
and therefore blow up a very
good deal. And so, when the

20:28.227 --> 20:33.065
president said he would veto
efforts to undermine this deal,
he meant it.

20:33.065 --> 20:36.135
GWEN IFILL: National Security
Adviser Susan Rice, thank you
for joining us.

20:36.135 --> 20:39.305
SUSAN RICE: Thank you
for having me, Gwen.

20:39.305 --> 20:42.975
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, how
effective is this deal at
preventing Iran from obtaining a
nuclear

20:42.975 --> 20:44.743
weapon?

20:44.743 --> 20:49.448
We hear from four people with
extensive U.S. foreign policy
experience.

20:49.448 --> 20:53.953
Sandy Berger was national
security adviser to President
Bill Clinton. Retired General

20:53.953 --> 21:00.059
Michael Hayden was director of
the CIA during the George W.
Bush administration. Dennis

21:00.059 --> 21:05.197
Ross served in Republican and
Democratic administrations as a
Middle East peace envoy. And
Jim Woolsey

21:05.197 --> 21:08.734
was director of the CIA during
the Clinton administration.

21:08.734 --> 21:12.138
And we welcome you
all to the program.

21:12.138 --> 21:15.774
Let me just start by asking you
all, what do you make of this
deal? Does this prevent

21:15.774 --> 21:18.010
Iran from getting
a nuclear weapon?

21:18.010 --> 21:20.079
Jim Woolsey, to you first.

21:20.079 --> 21:23.816
JAMES WOOLSEY, Former CIA
Director: I don't believe it
does. I think there is no
elastic,

21:23.816 --> 21:29.622
essentially, in the snap-back
sanctions. They will -- they
really depend upon Russian and

21:29.622 --> 21:32.925
Chinese cooperation.

21:32.925 --> 21:35.194
And I think that...

21:35.194 --> 21:37.329
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you mean
they depend on Russian and
Chinese cooperation?

21:37.329 --> 21:44.470
JAMES WOOLSEY: In order to take
action based upon something that
we perceive the Iranians

21:44.470 --> 21:49.942
have done, unless the Iranians
agree and say, oh, yes, we did
that, you have a situation

21:49.942 --> 21:55.948
where we have to try to force
discipline on the system, and
we're not going to have Russian

21:55.948 --> 21:59.018
and Chinese support, mostly,
in order to do that.

21:59.018 --> 22:00.052
JUDY WOODRUFF: How strong is
that agreement, Sandy Berger,
and do you see that weakness?

22:03.155 --> 22:04.723
agreement.

22:04.723 --> 22:11.564
I think it prevents Iran from
developing a nuclear weapon for
at least 10, probably 15

22:11.564 --> 22:18.804
years. I don't think it depends
on trust. I think it's
verifiable. If they cheat,

22:18.804 --> 22:23.976
we can go to the U.N. I think
Jim is wrong about the way of
reimposing the sanctions.

22:23.976 --> 22:30.449
The way the agreement is
written, Russia, China and Iran
cannot stop us from reimposing

22:30.449 --> 22:33.452
the sanctions.

22:33.452 --> 22:39.391
If the -- if us and -- if we or
our allies believe Iran is
cheating, and we go to the

22:39.391 --> 22:46.565
U.N., we cannot be blocked by
Russia, China and Iran alone or
in combination. That's

22:46.565 --> 22:51.570
a pretty strong provision. And
I think it's essential to the
fabric of this agreement.

22:51.570 --> 22:56.709
We're not relying upon anything
other than our own judgment as
to whether or not they're

22:56.709 --> 22:58.177
cheating on this agreement.

22:58.177 --> 23:00.779
JUDY WOODRUFF: General
Hayden, how do you see this?

23:00.779 --> 23:01.413
GEN. MICHAEL HAYDEN (RET.),
Former CIA Director: Well,
actually a combination of the
two

23:01.413 --> 23:04.850
views you just heard.

23:04.850 --> 23:09.922
I think it does do some really
good things for a period of
about a decade, but it does

23:09.922 --> 23:15.728
legitimate an
industrial-strength Iranian
nuclear program. As we get to
the sunset

23:15.728 --> 23:20.399
years, even assuming success
across the board for the
agreement, as we get to the
sunset

23:20.399 --> 23:25.437
years, Iran is very
well-positioned to break out if
they choose to do so.

23:25.437 --> 23:29.642
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dennis Ross, why
isn't that a concern, that it
does wind Iran down for

23:29.642 --> 23:33.045
a period of years, but when that
period is over, Iran can build
back up again?

23:33.045 --> 23:33.712
DENNIS ROSS, Former U.S. Envoy
to Middle East: Well, I think
it is a period. I think

23:33.712 --> 23:37.016
it is a source of concern.

23:37.016 --> 23:43.322
I think the key here is, for 15
years, you really are basically
deferring what they can

23:43.322 --> 23:48.694
do when it comes to a nuclear
weapon. But come year 15, they
are a threshold nuclear

23:48.694 --> 23:53.732
state. And unless we establish
a very clear deterrent, so that
they understand if they

23:53.732 --> 23:57.970
move from threshold to weapons
status, that the price is going
to be unbearable, meaning

23:57.970 --> 24:00.639
not just sanctions, but the use
of force, that's the only way to
ensure that they don't

24:00.639 --> 24:02.441
become a nuclear weapons state.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.543
JUDY WOODRUFF: And do you think
that deterrent is clear and
strong?

24:04.543 --> 24:06.645
GEN. MICHAEL HAYDEN:
Not right now.

24:06.645 --> 24:09.982
I think we have to make -- I
think language has to be much
more blunt. I think we have

24:09.982 --> 24:14.219
to be clear it's not just all
options are on the table, but we
will not permit Iran

24:14.219 --> 24:17.089
to become a nuclear weapons
state and we will take whatever
steps are necessary, including

24:17.089 --> 24:18.857
the use of force,
to ensure that.

24:18.857 --> 24:19.758
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sandy Berger,
you're shaking your head.

24:19.758 --> 24:21.560
SANDY BERGER: Yes.
No, I agree.

24:21.560 --> 24:29.001
The president has said we will
not permit Iran to develop a
nuclear weapon. That is

24:29.001 --> 24:33.405
a commitment of the United
States. It doesn't expire.
It's not vitiated by this
agreement.

24:33.405 --> 24:37.976
He should reiterate that and
make it very, very clear.

24:37.976 --> 24:45.884
But the agreement itself
restricts Iran for 15 years.
But the verification provisions

24:45.884 --> 24:51.790
go on much longer. So we will
have transparency under this
system for a very long time.
And

24:51.790 --> 24:56.595
if the president reiterates that
view that we're not going to
prevent Iran from developing

24:56.595 --> 24:59.531
a nuclear weapon, we will have a
lot of access to what they're
doing.

24:59.531 --> 25:02.668
JUDY WOODRUFF: why doesn't that
give you confidence, Jim
Woolsey?

25:02.668 --> 25:07.873
JAMES WOOLSEY: Well, in the
first place, Russia and China
are members of the Security

25:07.873 --> 25:10.075
Council, and one can do little
under this agreement without
having the Security Council's

25:10.075 --> 25:13.679
support.

25:13.679 --> 25:20.519
And I think that the real
problem is that, by paying tens
upon tens of billions of dollars

25:20.519 --> 25:26.125
to Iran in the near term, which
we will do as a result of the
sanctions being lifted,

25:26.125 --> 25:31.463
we're creating a situation in
which Iran is the leading
terrorist country in the world,

25:31.463 --> 25:38.036
has a lot more resources
available to it to buy what they
want via Hamas and the other

25:38.036 --> 25:40.339
terrorist organizations
they front.

25:40.339 --> 25:43.742
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Gwen asked
National Security Adviser Susan
Rice about that.

25:43.742 --> 25:45.344
Michael Hayden, is
that a concern to you?

25:45.344 --> 25:47.880
GEN. MICHAEL HAYDEN: It's
absolutely a concern.

25:47.880 --> 25:52.050
So, assuming a good agreement,
let's say it works for that
10-year period, we have got

25:52.050 --> 25:57.022
the sunset problem. But also,
Judy, look at what we have just
done. We have legitimated

25:57.022 --> 26:01.226
a program until this morning
that was illegal, that was in
violation of U.N. Security
Council

26:01.226 --> 26:03.762
resolutions.

26:03.762 --> 26:08.734
We have brought Iran back into
the family of nations. It's now
no longer a renegade

26:08.734 --> 26:14.773
state. The sanctions end, they
become rich, and none of those
other activities about which

26:14.773 --> 26:17.376
we are very concerned Iran has
been conducting, none of those
have stopped.

26:17.376 --> 26:18.377
JAMES WOOLSEY: Exactly.

26:18.377 --> 26:20.679
SANDY BERGER: Well, I
would say two things.

26:20.679 --> 26:24.783
First of all, Iran is a nuclear
threshold state. They have been
a nuclear threshold

26:24.783 --> 26:28.654
state since they started
building centrifuges in the
middle of the Bush
administration.

26:28.654 --> 26:30.722
The question is, what are we
going to do about it? Are we
going to roll it back or

26:30.722 --> 26:34.092
let them have this
program and go forward?

26:34.092 --> 26:38.964
So I think that's where we are
at this point. I absolutely
agree this agreement does not

26:38.964 --> 26:48.607
solve the Iranian problem in the
region. Iran is a country that
is destabilizing the region,

26:48.607 --> 26:53.111
a country that we have to be
concerned with. I don't see
this agreement as solving that

26:53.111 --> 26:58.050
problem. I think this agreement
is useful, not in spite of that,
but because of that,

26:58.050 --> 27:03.889
because all those conflicts, all
that ambition would be more
dangerous if Iran were
emboldened

27:03.889 --> 27:06.558
because they had a
nuclear weapon.

27:06.558 --> 27:08.360
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Dennis
Ross, as someone who has worked
on that -- those conflicts

27:08.360 --> 27:11.730
in the region, how do you
see that aspect of it?

27:11.730 --> 27:16.134
DENNIS ROSS: Look, there is no
question that they will get,
with sanctions relief,

27:16.134 --> 27:20.739
they will get to what amounts to
a windfall. True, it is their
money, but you have close

27:20.739 --> 27:24.977
to $150 billion that are in
frozen assets, frozen accounts
right now.

27:24.977 --> 27:29.248
They don't get it for about six
months. What Susan Rice said is
right. They have to implement

27:29.248 --> 27:33.085
the major obligations, the major
nuclear obligations in the deal.
And it will take about six

27:33.085 --> 27:38.023
months to do that. I think the
key here at this point is for
the Iranians to understand

27:38.023 --> 27:43.896
two things. One, we need to
reestablish deterrence not only
at the level of them not

27:43.896 --> 27:48.033
moving from threshold to nuclear
weapons state status, but also
we have to raise the cost

27:48.033 --> 27:50.869
to them of what they
do in the region.

27:50.869 --> 27:54.406
We have to be prepared to
compete with them. They have to
realize that if we see them

27:54.406 --> 27:59.645
giving a lot more money to
Hezbollah, a lot more money to
Hamas, to the Houthis or to

27:59.645 --> 28:04.850
(INAUDIBLE) in Iraq, they are
going to see much greater
competition from us.

28:04.850 --> 28:09.087
We should be talking to the
Europeans now about targeted
sanctions if we see that. And

28:09.087 --> 28:13.258
we should be doing contingency
planning with the Israelis and
with the Arabs to deal with

28:13.258 --> 28:16.461
increased activity by the
Iranians throughout the region.

28:16.461 --> 28:18.564
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I saw the
president in a phone call today
with Prime Minister Netanyahu

28:18.564 --> 28:21.800
was trying to reassure him
on some of these points.

28:21.800 --> 28:25.370
Jim Woolsey, I want to come to
this other question of
inspections. The president said

28:25.370 --> 28:33.278
-- it was noticeable the
president said 24/7 access. But
then, later, we see it's
something

28:33.278 --> 28:37.316
called managed access. How
comfortable are you with
whatever inspection arrangement
there

28:37.316 --> 28:38.250
is?

28:38.250 --> 28:42.721
JAMES WOOLSEY: Not at all.

28:42.721 --> 28:49.094
If we point out a violation or
the need for an inspection, you
have two weeks, and then

28:49.094 --> 28:54.066
it goes to a committee, and then
the committee looks at it for a
while, and then -- this

28:54.066 --> 29:01.373
has all been very elaborately
constructed in such a way as to
give Iran a lot of leeway

29:01.373 --> 29:05.143
in order to deal with this, and
they do not have to have,
ultimately, a huge industrial

29:05.143 --> 29:07.779
structure that they can't hide.

29:07.779 --> 29:10.782
They can hide the relevant parts
of being able to make a few
weapons in a relatively

29:10.782 --> 29:12.985
small space and can move them.

29:12.985 --> 29:15.287
JUDY WOODRUFF: Where do you
come down on this, General
Hayden?

29:15.287 --> 29:18.757
GEN. MICHAEL HAYDEN:
Pretty much where Jim is.

29:18.757 --> 29:24.129
The inspections are the
pass-fail aspect of the
agreement. And we cannot do it
through

29:24.129 --> 29:28.266
American espionage or national
technical means. The only way
we get a verifiable agreement

29:28.266 --> 29:32.704
is that the IAEA gets to
go where they want to go.

29:32.704 --> 29:36.742
And, Judy, fundamentally, I
think that's a technical
question that this international

29:36.742 --> 29:42.848
group should have the freedom to
move. The solution set here
moves this into a political

29:42.848 --> 29:44.983
process. And I'm just fearful
that that will make it much more
difficult to verify.

29:47.953 --> 29:50.822
SANDY BERGER: Look, I think the
agreement is quite clear. I
think the administration

29:50.822 --> 29:53.358
has done a good job here.

29:53.358 --> 29:59.464
If the Iranians don't let us
into a particular site, there is
a process of several weeks.

29:59.464 --> 30:05.237
If we're not satisfied, we and
our allies can go to the
Security Council and have the

30:05.237 --> 30:10.842
sanctions reimposed. If Russia
is screaming, if China is
screaming and if Iran is
screaming,

30:10.842 --> 30:15.147
they cannot block that. So, I
think that's really crystal
clear.

30:15.147 --> 30:20.552
Let me just make one other point
on the sanctions point. We
don't own these sanctions.
They're

30:20.552 --> 30:25.957
not ours. They're international
sanctions. They include the
Indians and the South Koreans

30:25.957 --> 30:30.962
and the Japanese and a lot of
the countries that aren't
terribly threatened by Iran.

30:30.962 --> 30:35.600
They opposed these sanctions,
because they wanted to bring
Iran to the table, and they

30:35.600 --> 30:40.872
believed we would negotiate
seriously. If we don't now
follow through on that, the
sanctions

30:40.872 --> 30:45.944
regime will unravel, Iran will
get its money without any
nuclear controls.

30:45.944 --> 30:49.581
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that raises
the question about what happens
if this falls apart. For

30:49.581 --> 30:51.383
the critics who are saying this
is the wrong deal, what's the
alternative, Dennis Ross?

30:56.221 --> 30:59.791
think the point that Sandy
just made is right.

30:59.791 --> 31:04.529
There is a reality here. You
have the international community
basically embracing this
agreement.

31:04.529 --> 31:08.400
Certainly, the members of
5-plus-one have embraced this
agreement. The Iranians will

31:08.400 --> 31:11.536
say they're going to implement
the agreement. I actually
think, if this were to be
blocked,

31:11.536 --> 31:15.240
the Iranians would come out and
say, we will implement it.

31:15.240 --> 31:17.642
And the European Union -- if you
read the agreement, the European
Union, commits, there

31:17.642 --> 31:21.980
are separate paragraphs where
the European Union commit, if
the Iranians do their part

31:21.980 --> 31:25.684
in terms of meeting these major
obligations, the E.U. is then
committed to lifting the

31:25.684 --> 31:28.053
sanctions.

31:28.053 --> 31:32.424
So, I am concerned that you
wouldn't be able to sustain
that. And so if the critics are

31:32.424 --> 31:36.595
really convinced that the best
way to deal with this is to
block the sanctions, they

31:36.595 --> 31:40.799
have to explain why the outcome
isn't going to be sanctions
collapse, the Iranians get

31:40.799 --> 31:44.169
the windfall, they're
really not restricted.

31:44.169 --> 31:49.975
In a sense, both -- from my
standpoint, the administration
has some issues it has to
address,

31:49.975 --> 31:56.248
including how you deal with the
suspect sites. It's an -- we
have 24/7 access to facilities

31:56.248 --> 32:01.386
like Natanz. It comes -- when
it comes to suspect sites, that
becomes more problematic,

32:01.386 --> 32:04.156
and then you're talking about
what could be a 30- to 35-day
period before you actually

32:04.156 --> 32:06.091
get access.

32:06.091 --> 32:10.095
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you're
saying the critics also have a
question to answer.

32:10.095 --> 32:13.832
Jim Woolsey, what is the answer?
Why wouldn't the sanctions
regime collapse, Iran just moves

32:13.832 --> 32:18.003
toward complete nuclear
program that it wants?

32:18.003 --> 32:21.306
JAMES WOOLSEY: Well, I think it
will come very close to doing
that anyway.

32:21.306 --> 32:25.710
We have to realize what we have
got here and what we're dealing
with. It's not a state

32:25.710 --> 32:31.216
-- I led once set of
negotiations and participated in
three with the Soviets. And
with the

32:31.216 --> 32:36.254
Soviets, it was a different
situation. They were far from
lovely folks to deal with.

32:36.254 --> 32:40.959
But with Iran, we're dealing
with a leadership of the country
that are theocratic,
totalitarian,

32:40.959 --> 32:45.664
genocidal imperialists. And
each of those words I think can
definitely be supported.

32:45.664 --> 32:51.069
They have a word, taquia, which
essentially means lying to
infidels. It's recommended.

32:51.069 --> 32:57.242
And we are not dealing with a
normal sort of autocratic state
that we have to be careful

32:57.242 --> 32:58.376
how we deal with.

32:58.376 --> 33:02.514
JUDY WOODRUFF: But my question
is, if this doesn't work, what's
the alternative?

33:02.514 --> 33:06.585
Isn't the alternative, Michael
Hayden, Iran has a clear path to
do what it wants?

33:06.585 --> 33:10.255
GEN. MICHAEL HAYDEN: It
depends. It depends on American
leadership. It depends on how

33:10.255 --> 33:14.059
clearly we state our reasons
that this is not a good enough
deal.

33:14.059 --> 33:19.431
And good enough might be as good
as it gets. But, Judy, if you
push that logic to far,

33:19.431 --> 33:23.802
you don't have a plan B, you
could actually back yourself
into a position where any deal

33:23.802 --> 33:27.239
is better than no deal. And I
don't think that's a sustainable
position.

33:27.239 --> 33:30.742
JUDY WOODRUFF: Gentlemen, we're
going to leave it there. It's
just day one of debating

33:30.742 --> 33:33.178
this nuclear agreement.

33:33.178 --> 33:37.849
We thank you all for being here,
Jim Woolsey, Michael Hayden,
Sandy Berger, and Dennis Ross.

33:37.849 --> 33:43.555
Thank you.

33:43.555 --> 33:52.731
GWEN IFILL: The Iran nuclear
deal is just one of the many
issues that could be turned

33:52.731 --> 33:56.968
inside out by the next president
of the United States.

33:56.968 --> 34:01.873
We turn now to another of our
periodic conversations with the
candidates running for the job,
Republican

34:01.873 --> 34:03.208
Bobby Jindal, the
governor of Louisiana.

34:03.208 --> 34:05.076
Welcome, Governor.

34:05.076 --> 34:07.612
GOV. BOBBY JINDAL (R-LA),
Presidential Candidate: Gwen,
thank you for having me.

34:07.612 --> 34:12.183
GWEN IFILL: You said today that
this would be a dangerous deal,
this Iran deal that the

34:12.183 --> 34:14.185
president announced today. Have
you had a chance to study it?
Why do you feel that?

34:17.355 --> 34:21.660
And this is why I think it is a
bad deal for the United States,
for Israel and our allies.

34:21.660 --> 34:26.031
Several details that are
troubling, so Iran keeps
thousands of centrifuges,
instead of

34:26.031 --> 34:30.101
giving up all of their
enrichment capacity. We don't
truly get anytime/anywhere
inspections.

34:30.101 --> 34:34.472
They're not cutting off their
ties to Hamas, Hezbollah, these
other terrorist groups.

34:34.472 --> 34:38.743
There are other issues I have
got with this deal as well. I
worry, under this president's

34:38.743 --> 34:41.980
deal, we could end up with a
nuclear arms race in the Middle
East. You could see Sunni

34:41.980 --> 34:45.517
countries now trying to buy
this technology from Pakistan.

34:45.517 --> 34:49.254
I hope that Secretary Clinton,
who's been the architect of this
president's foreign

34:49.254 --> 34:53.491
policy, will come out and oppose
this deal and say it's time for
America to stand with

34:53.491 --> 34:56.328
Israel. There is still time for
America to come out and say, we
will not allow Iran

34:56.328 --> 34:58.496
to become a nuclear power.

34:58.496 --> 35:01.633
So, there are several things I
don't like about this deal.
When they first started

35:01.633 --> 35:05.236
negotiating this deal, the
president himself said that we
were going to get
anytime/anywhere

35:05.236 --> 35:07.872
inspections, they wouldn't be
allowed to keep any enrichment
capacity. Unfortunately,

35:07.872 --> 35:09.808
that's not what this deal does.

35:09.808 --> 35:12.877
GWEN IFILL: Well, Secretary
Kerry, the current secretary of
state, said today that people

35:12.877 --> 35:16.081
who criticize it, as you just
have, don't have an alternative.

35:16.081 --> 35:20.151
As president, not as a candidate
for president, what would you do
to roll this back?

35:20.151 --> 35:22.887
GOV. BOBBY JINDAL: Well, Gwen,
I actually think we have a lot
of leverage right now,

35:22.887 --> 35:26.725
falling oil prices. The Iranian
economy is in very, very deep
trouble.

35:26.725 --> 35:31.196
I think, with tougher sanctions,
with a White House strategy that
says every option is on

35:31.196 --> 35:35.767
the table, we will stop the
Iranian regime, this Iranian
government from having a nuclear

35:35.767 --> 35:38.770
capability. We need to
understand this is a regime or
this is a country where they're

35:38.770 --> 35:42.640
still chanting death to America,
death to Israel. They still
haven't released their

35:42.640 --> 35:46.845
American prisoners. They still
haven't rejected, cut off ties
to terrorism.

35:46.845 --> 35:51.816
Secretary Kerry himself has said
they are a state sponsor of
terrorism, recently saying

35:51.816 --> 35:55.987
that they are one of the largest
state sponsors of terrorism in
the entire world. This is

35:55.987 --> 35:59.290
a country we cannot afford to
allow to become a nuclear power.

35:59.290 --> 36:03.128
So, I think every option needs
to be on the table. We need to
negotiate from strength.

36:03.128 --> 36:06.731
This president too often has
said what he wouldn't do,
instead of what he would do.

36:06.731 --> 36:10.235
I hope Secretary Clinton will
come out and others in the
Democratic Party will come out

36:10.235 --> 36:15.073
and say, with not just
Republicans, but on a bipartisan
basis, that this is an American

36:15.073 --> 36:18.309
issue, not a Democrat or
Republican issue. This is bad
for the regions.

36:18.309 --> 36:21.413
GWEN IFILL: Well, assuming that
you have to get past 14 other
Republican candidates

36:21.413 --> 36:22.914
before you get to Secretary
Clinton, I want to ask you a
little bit more about yourself

36:22.914 --> 36:25.550
first.

36:25.550 --> 36:30.288
You said, among other things,
that you don't like the idea of
hyphenated Americans.
Obviously,

36:30.288 --> 36:33.925
You're of Indian heritage. What
do you about -- to people of,
say, Italian-American heritage

36:33.925 --> 36:36.795
who think that you're asking
them to set that heritage aside?

36:36.795 --> 36:38.229
GOV. BOBBY JINDAL: Well, Gwen,
the great thing about America
is, we're a wonderful

36:38.229 --> 36:40.698
melting pot.

36:40.698 --> 36:45.136
Folks can be proud of their
heritage. But I think the
hyphenations, the divisions are

36:45.136 --> 36:49.674
keeping us apart. We're not
Italian-Americans or
Indian-Americans or
African-Americans or

36:49.674 --> 36:53.144
Asian-Americans or rich
Americans or poor Americans.
We're all Americans.

36:53.144 --> 36:57.415
Look, my parents are proud of
their Indian heritage, but they
chose to come here over

36:57.415 --> 37:00.819
40 years ago in search of the
American dream. They wanted to
raise their kids as Americans.

37:00.819 --> 37:05.090
That's why they came here.
What I worry about is, I look to
Europe. You have got

37:05.090 --> 37:07.292
second-, third-generation
immigrants that don't consider
themselves parts of those
societies.

37:12.797 --> 37:17.735
English, adopt our values, roll
up their sleeves, get to work.
Look, I think it's common sense

37:17.735 --> 37:20.472
to say, if you want to come
here, you should want to be an
American. Otherwise, why are

37:20.472 --> 37:25.910
you coming here? We can still
embrace our Italian heritage or
our old country heritages,

37:25.910 --> 37:28.513
but we should be Americans.
Stop the hyphenated Americans.

37:28.513 --> 37:31.749
GWEN IFILL: And I want to ask
you about another one of your
Republican competitors.

37:31.749 --> 37:35.487
And, of course, that is Donald
Trump, who has been sucking a
lot of the air out.

37:35.487 --> 37:39.891
Today, there's a new poll, a
small poll, not a necessarily
representative poll, but showing

37:39.891 --> 37:45.897
him at least by name recognition
doing fairly well. Do you agree
with his approach and

37:45.897 --> 37:50.401
the words in particular that he
used to describe the immigration
problem?

37:50.401 --> 37:51.302
GOV. BOBBY JINDAL: No, Gwen. I
do not. And I have said I don't
agree with his comments.

37:58.376 --> 38:02.447
in D.C. need to calm down here.
The funny thing is, every time
they attack Donald, I

38:02.447 --> 38:05.450
actually think he enjoys it.
And I think he gets the best of
those exchanges.

38:05.450 --> 38:09.787
I think there is political
correctness run amok in D.C.
You saw the bill last week

38:09.787 --> 38:13.858
where they tried to -- one
congresswoman tried to stop the
use of the word husband and
wife.

38:13.858 --> 38:17.428
This is a free country. And
the great thing on the
Republican side is, we have got

38:17.428 --> 38:21.466
a lot of candidates running. It
will be an open debate, unlike
on the Democratic side.

38:21.466 --> 38:26.571
The voters will get to decide,
not the establishment. I know
the RNC tried to get him to tone

38:26.571 --> 38:30.475
down or try to sensor him. And
I think that's a mistake. Let
folks debate it out. Obviously,

38:30.475 --> 38:32.110
I think I'm better qualified. I
think people should vote for me,
instead of him or the

38:32.110 --> 38:34.245
others running.

38:34.245 --> 38:38.683
But the good news is, this is an
open and free debate. There's a
First Amendment.

38:38.683 --> 38:42.387
Let the voters decide. Let's
stop trying to be political
correct. Now, look, obviously,

38:42.387 --> 38:43.821
he enjoys the controversy. I
think he actually benefits from
it.

38:43.821 --> 38:44.689
(CROSSTALK)

38:44.689 --> 38:46.824
GWEN IFILL: Well, I'm
sure that's true as well.

38:46.824 --> 38:51.963
But speaking of debates, how do
you get on to a debate stage
which is so crowded and

38:51.963 --> 38:56.000
which, at least in the first two
instances, they're saying only
the people who rank the

38:56.000 --> 38:58.603
highest, top 10, will make it
onto that stage? How do you get
your message out if you don't

38:58.603 --> 39:00.205
make it onto that stage?

39:00.205 --> 39:02.440
GOV. BOBBY JINDAL: Well, Gwen,
that's a great question.

39:02.440 --> 39:05.843
And you said something earlier I
want to come back to about this
being about name I.D. And

39:05.843 --> 39:08.880
that's really what the polls are
right now. It is really a
beauty contest. At this

39:08.880 --> 39:11.716
point, if you have run for
president before, if you have a
famous last night name, if
you're

39:11.716 --> 39:15.687
in D.C. in the Senate and in
front of the cable news cameras
every day, then obviously

39:15.687 --> 39:17.655
you have more name I.D. I
think, if Tom Brady got in this
race, he would probably

39:17.655 --> 39:21.659
be first in terms of the
national polls now.

39:21.659 --> 39:25.930
The reality is this. The voters
are going to get to decide, not
the D.C. establishment,

39:25.930 --> 39:30.702
not the donors in New York. I'm
spending my time in Iowa, in New
Hampshire, in other

39:30.702 --> 39:34.038
states talking directly to
voters. We're getting a great
response at every town hall,

39:34.038 --> 39:36.975
getting hundreds and hundreds
of people coming out.

39:36.975 --> 39:40.945
We're staying afterwards until
the last person leaves,
answering everybody's questions.
I

39:40.945 --> 39:43.181
think voters are saying we don't
want just somebody who is going
to give a good speech.

39:43.181 --> 39:46.684
We want somebody who is going
to embrace our principles.

39:46.684 --> 39:50.321
Jeb Bush says you have got to be
willing to lose the primary in
order to win the general.

39:50.321 --> 39:53.891
Gwen, I disagree with that.
When the establishment says
that, they're saying, stop being
conservative.

39:53.891 --> 39:57.795
Try to get the left and the
media to like you. I think
voters are saying, we want

39:57.795 --> 40:00.832
somebody who is going to repeal
Obamacare, secure the border,
stand with Israel, somebody

40:00.832 --> 40:02.300
who is going to shrink the size
of government, somebody who is
going to stand up to radical

40:02.300 --> 40:04.569
Islamic terrorism.

40:04.569 --> 40:06.804
So, we're going out and directly
talking to voters. We have had
a great response. We're

40:06.804 --> 40:09.440
going to continue to do that.

40:09.440 --> 40:12.577
GWEN IFILL: Governor Bobby
Jindal of Louisiana, Republican
candidate for president, thank

40:12.577 --> 40:14.612
you for joining us. We
will be talking again.

40:14.612 --> 40:23.354
GOV. BOBBY JINDAL: Gwen,
thank you for having me.

40:23.354 --> 40:29.961
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's been a
once-in-a-lifetime journey, and
today NASA believes its New
Horizons

40:29.961 --> 40:35.133
spacecraft finally made a
successful flyby of Pluto.

40:35.133 --> 40:41.472
Once considered the ninth planet
in our solar system, Pluto is
billions of miles away.
Confirmation

40:41.472 --> 40:45.343
of the spacecraft's arrival is
expected tonight. But there
were celebrations earlier today

40:45.343 --> 40:50.381
at mission control, as all
signs pointed to success.

40:50.381 --> 40:54.152
Science correspondent Miles
O'Brien fills in the picture of
this mission.

40:54.152 --> 40:58.323
This story was done with help
from the PBS program "NOVA,"
which airs "Chasing Pluto"

40:58.323 --> 41:00.992
tomorrow night.

41:00.992 --> 41:08.700
MILES O'BRIEN: Ready or not, it
is finally time for Pluto's
closeup. Once a full-fledged

41:08.700 --> 41:15.173
planet, now considered something
less, it remains an intriguing
mystery 85 years after

41:15.173 --> 41:20.712
its discovery, but not for long.
The picture is growing clearer
as a fast-moving spacecraft

41:20.712 --> 41:24.048
arrives at the solar
system's underdog.

41:24.048 --> 41:26.651
ALAN STERN, New Horizons
Principal Investigator: It was
always the planet with the
little

41:26.651 --> 41:32.824
question marks everywhere. We
didn't know anything. And
because it's the last in the

41:32.824 --> 41:36.127
public mind, it takes
a special place.

41:36.127 --> 41:41.466
MILES O'BRIEN: Pluto has taken
a special place in planetary
scientist Alan Stern's

41:41.466 --> 41:46.871
mind since 1988. That's when he
first began pushing NASA to send
a spacecraft to what

41:46.871 --> 41:56.080
was then the ninth planet
in our solar system.

41:56.080 --> 42:02.487
The three-billion-mile journey
of the New Horizons spacecraft
began in 2006. It left

42:02.487 --> 42:08.259
the Earth faster than any
spacecraft ever, making a
beeline for Pluto, getting a
gravitational

42:08.259 --> 42:13.498
kick from Jupiter as it bulleted
past, snapping pictures all the
while. And now, after nearly

42:13.498 --> 42:18.136
a decade in space, New
Horizons is finally there.

42:18.136 --> 42:21.672
HAL WEAVER, New Horizons Project
Scientist: I like to call this
a mission of delayed

42:21.672 --> 42:26.110
gratification, because it takes
nine-and-a-half years to get all
the way out to Pluto, but

42:26.110 --> 42:32.450
we're almost there. And the
opportunity to transform Pluto
from a little pixelated

42:32.450 --> 42:37.855
blob into a world with
complexity and diversity is just
going to be amazing.

42:37.855 --> 42:41.592
MILES O'BRIEN: Hal Weaver is
the New Horizons project
scientist. He admits to some
nerves

42:41.592 --> 42:43.861
here in the home stretch.

42:43.861 --> 42:49.100
HAL WEAVER: Oh, yes, I'm
somewhat nervous because, in the
space business, you're only

42:49.100 --> 42:54.105
as strong as your weakest link.
And we have put so much effort
into making sure that we

42:54.105 --> 42:58.943
squeeze as much as possible out
of this mission scientifically.

42:58.943 --> 43:04.982
MILES O'BRIEN: And that
scientific to-do list is a long
one. Despite what we may

43:04.982 --> 43:11.422
imagine, Pluto is no simple
ice-covered rock, although, with
a surface temperature of 387

43:11.422 --> 43:17.462
below zero Fahrenheit, there is
plenty of ice, ice made of
carbon dioxide, methane,

43:17.462 --> 43:22.867
ethane and nitrogen, also the
main ingredient of its
atmosphere.

43:22.867 --> 43:29.040
Besides cold, the Pluto weather
can be cloudy, hazy and windy.
The sun is so distant that

43:29.040 --> 43:35.012
high noon on Pluto is like dusk
here on Earth. It appears there
are mountains and valleys.

43:35.012 --> 43:41.018
And, yes, it is red. Sorry,
Mars, you're not as special as
we once thought.

43:41.018 --> 43:44.822
ALAN STERN: So, we think that
the color of the surface is a
direct byproduct of a

43:44.822 --> 43:50.862
process called space weathering,
where the radiation from the sun
and cosmic rays generate

43:50.862 --> 43:54.165
trace constituents in the
ices that have color.

43:54.165 --> 43:59.837
MILES O'BRIEN: No less
interesting than Pluto is its
largest moon, Charon. It is

43:59.837 --> 44:04.308
covered with plain old water
ice. They will be on the
lookout for cracks in the
surface,

44:04.308 --> 44:08.179
which could be telltale signs
of liquid water below.

44:08.179 --> 44:15.786
HAL WEAVER: So I would be
surprised if we see evidence of
some liquid water underneath

44:15.786 --> 44:19.757
Charon's surface, but I wouldn't
say it's out of the question.
If we see cracks on

44:19.757 --> 44:25.630
Charon's surface, and especially
if we can see some venting from
Charon's surface, that

44:25.630 --> 44:27.865
would be really cool.

44:27.865 --> 44:32.503
MILES O'BRIEN: Clyde Tombaugh
would heartily agree. In 1930,
he discovered Pluto at the

44:32.503 --> 44:37.308
Percival Lowell Observatory
in Flagstaff, Arizona.

44:37.308 --> 44:42.914
Tombaugh named his quarry Pluto
for the Roman god of the
underworld. Conveniently, the

44:42.914 --> 44:48.586
first two letters are Percival
Lowell's initials. And,
coincidentally, about that time,
Disney's

44:48.586 --> 44:54.425
cartoon dog of the same name
first appeared on the silver
screen.

44:54.425 --> 44:59.830
Underdog indeed, and yet the
ninth planet just the same. But
the dogged march of scientific

44:59.830 --> 45:04.969
discovery set Pluto up for a
cosmically unpopular demotion.

45:04.969 --> 45:09.073
MIKE BROWN, California Institute
of Technology: As we had been
discovering larger and larger

45:09.073 --> 45:12.710
and larger objects, that I -- in
my opinion, it made no sense
that Pluto was called a planet,

45:12.710 --> 45:15.313
and it shouldn't be a planet.

45:15.313 --> 45:21.018
MILES O'BRIEN: That's
astronomer and Pluto killer Mike
Brown, appearing in the PBS
"NOVA"

45:21.018 --> 45:27.191
program "Chasing Pluto."
Starting in 1992, he and his
colleagues discovered a region

45:27.191 --> 45:33.197
of large, rocky, icy,
planet-shaped debris at the
outer edge of the solar system.

45:33.197 --> 45:38.769
It's called the Kuiper belt,
leftovers from the formation of
planets 4.6 billion years

45:38.769 --> 45:45.743
ago. But the debris really hit
the fan for our beloved underdog
in 2005, when Brown and

45:45.743 --> 45:51.215
his team discovered this object,
Eris. It's more massive than
Pluto.

45:51.215 --> 45:57.154
MIKE BROWN: I had to make a
decision, what we were going to
call it. Is it a planet?

45:57.154 --> 46:02.326
Is it not a planet? Is it the
10th planet? Is it the 52nd
planet? Is it -- is Pluto

46:02.326 --> 46:06.464
not a planet? I knew that, that
no matter what I said, it would
be debated for a long

46:06.464 --> 46:08.666
time.

46:08.666 --> 46:12.536
MILES O'BRIEN: Eventually,
astronomers decided to call
Pluto and the other big Kuiper
belt

46:12.536 --> 46:16.073
objects dwarf planets.

46:16.073 --> 46:21.812
Whatever Pluto is called, New
Horizons is well-poised to
understand it much better.

46:21.812 --> 46:27.551
The grand piano-sized
spacecraft is brimming with
seven scientific instruments,
spectrometers

46:27.551 --> 46:34.091
that measure infrared,
ultraviolet, plasma and solar
wind, a student-built dust
counter,

46:34.091 --> 46:41.198
a radio device to characterize
the atmosphere, and, of course,
cameras, visible, infrared

46:41.198 --> 46:45.302
and the one that should make the
Pluto screen savers, LORRI,
short for Long Range
Reconnaissance

46:45.302 --> 46:47.071
Imager.

46:47.071 --> 46:50.808
ALAN STERN: Ultimately, LORRI
will allow us to map the surface
of Pluto well enough

46:50.808 --> 46:55.479
that, if we flew over New York
City at the same altitude and
looked down with LORRI,

46:55.479 --> 46:58.616
we could count the ponds in
Central Park and the wharfs on
the Hudson. It's a very
detailed

46:58.616 --> 47:01.686
imagery at closest approach.

47:01.686 --> 47:06.357
MILES O'BRIEN: By and large,
the spacecraft has run well
these past nine-and-a-half
years,

47:06.357 --> 47:10.628
despite a brief scare on July 4,
when the computer crashed,
causing the probe to go

47:10.628 --> 47:14.365
dark for a while. The team
says it is ready regardless.

47:14.365 --> 47:15.833
MARK HOLDRIDGE, New Horizons
Encounter Mission Manager: We
have done dozens of operational

47:15.833 --> 47:18.169
readiness tests.

47:18.169 --> 47:22.973
MILES O'BRIEN: Mark Holdridge
is the encounter mission manager
for New Horizons at the Johns

47:22.973 --> 47:28.846
Hopkins Applied Physics
Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.
One of his key jobs has been to

47:28.846 --> 47:33.984
lead the team through numerous
dress rehearsals, staying sharp
for the big event.

47:33.984 --> 47:38.022
MARK HOLDRIDGE: So, we have
been really careful about timing
the operational readiness

47:38.022 --> 47:43.094
tests to make sure that the last
one doesn't happen too soon
before the actual encounter,

47:43.094 --> 47:45.463
because we will forget things.

47:45.463 --> 47:50.534
MILES O'BRIEN: They can't
afford to forget, because New
Horizons will not orbit Pluto.

47:50.534 --> 47:56.107
It is supposed to whiz by 18
times faster than a speeding
bullet, 7,800 miles from the

47:56.107 --> 48:02.279
surface, taking pictures and
Hoovering up data as quickly as
it can.

48:02.279 --> 48:06.951
The spacecraft will not be
transmitting while it gathers
its science, leaving the team
hanging

48:06.951 --> 48:11.155
for 13 hours before they even
get a phone home. The postcards
are supposed to come

48:11.155 --> 48:13.591
in the next day.

48:13.591 --> 48:16.894
HAL WEAVER: We have no idea
what we're going to see. We're
going to be surprised. I'm

48:16.894 --> 48:19.396
positive of that.

48:19.396 --> 48:25.136
MILES O'BRIEN: Assuming all
goes well, NASA and APL will aim
New Horizons toward another

48:25.136 --> 48:32.076
Kuiper belt object for a flyby
in 2019. But for now, all eyes
in the world of planetary

48:32.076 --> 48:37.014
science are focused on Pluto and
the end of an era, as they
finish the first forays of

48:37.014 --> 48:40.584
exploration into our
celestial neighborhood.

48:40.584 --> 48:46.757
ALAN STERN: People will look
back on this time, from the '60s
to 2015, in future centuries,

48:46.757 --> 48:52.163
I think, and say, that is when
the solar system was first
explored.

48:52.163 --> 48:56.567
MILES O'BRIEN: The underdog at
the edge of our understanding
may be the last, and

48:56.567 --> 49:02.773
the least, but perhaps that is
why unlocking its mysteries
seems so worthwhile.

49:02.773 --> 49:06.577
Miles O'Brien, the "PBS
NewsHour," Laurel, Maryland.

49:06.577 --> 49:12.449
JUDY WOODRUFF: And online, you
can find more videos on Pluto
and follow "NOVA"'s live

49:12.449 --> 49:20.591
tweets on the flyby. That's on
our home page, PBS.org/NewsHour.

49:20.591 --> 49:32.136
GWEN IFILL: Tonight on
"Frontline": an inside look into
the plight of Yazidi women and
children,

49:32.136 --> 49:36.507
the religious minority in Iraq
who have been targeted by ISIS.

49:36.507 --> 49:42.079
Survivors say women and children
are held for months and girls as
young as 9 are subject

49:42.079 --> 49:47.017
to rape. One man is leading an
underground railroad to rescue
those who have been taken

49:47.017 --> 49:50.955
captive by the terrorist group,
but part of the operation's
success depends on women fleeing

49:50.955 --> 49:53.557
their captors.

49:53.557 --> 50:03.234
NARRATOR: The rescue operation
begins. Khalil's contact tells
the family to sneak out of the

50:03.234 --> 50:05.936
house in the middle of the night
and meet him in a car waiting
outside.

50:05.936 --> 50:10.708
The contact will then guide them
out of ISIS territory through a
series of safe houses

50:10.708 --> 50:15.646
along the border of Turkey and
Iraq. Abu Shuja (ph) heads
toward the border to meet

50:15.646 --> 50:19.817
them, hoping that, this
time, they make it.

50:19.817 --> 50:31.629
MAN (through translator):
We got here first.

50:31.629 --> 50:37.902
We're waiting for the family.
They could arrive any minute,
but they have been delayed

50:37.902 --> 50:46.911
on the other side. Their family
has come to meet them. They're
the relatives of the

50:46.911 --> 50:51.215
captive women and children.

50:51.215 --> 50:57.922
NARRATOR: After two hours, the
contact calls Abu Shuja, saying
they have arrived.

50:57.922 --> 51:01.859
MAN (through translator):
Are they here?

51:01.859 --> 51:06.630
WOMAN (through translator):
I think they're over there.

51:06.630 --> 51:11.268
MAN (through translator):
Where? Where did they go?

51:11.268 --> 51:14.872
MAN (through translator):
They're here.

51:14.872 --> 51:20.210
NARRATOR: The women and
children snuck out while their
captor was asleep.

51:20.210 --> 51:39.363
MAN (through translator):
Welcome back. God bless you.

51:39.363 --> 51:50.541
You're OK. You're OK.

51:50.541 --> 52:02.386
WOMAN (through translator):
We're grateful to you. We will
never forget what you have

52:02.386 --> 52:04.221
done for us.

52:04.221 --> 52:07.291
NARRATOR: Medina's (ph) two
daughters are 9 and 10, the age
when ISIS says girls can

52:07.291 --> 52:25.676
be forced into marriage. The
girls haven't seen their family
in seven months.

52:25.676 --> 52:46.030
GWEN IFILL: "Frontline" airs
tonight on most PBS stations.

52:46.030 --> 52:49.533
JUDY WOODRUFF: And finally
tonight, to our "NewsHour"
Shares of the day, something
that

52:49.533 --> 52:52.736
caught our eye which might
be of interest to you, too.

52:52.736 --> 52:57.541
The Central Intelligence Agency
recently has allowed a peek into
its vaults of historic

52:57.541 --> 53:03.714
spy gear, posting photos of spy
artifacts to its Web site each
week, like this miniature

53:03.714 --> 53:09.553
camera that can fit inside a
pack of cigarettes or this radio
receiver hidden inside a smoking

53:09.553 --> 53:15.059
pipe. Other artifacts of the
week? This hollowed-out silver
dollar which concealed

53:15.059 --> 53:20.464
messages or film, and this Cold
War-era lady's compact mirror
with a secret code hidden
inside.

53:20.464 --> 53:22.599
Calling James Bond.

53:22.599 --> 53:24.334
GWEN IFILL: I have one
of those. No, I don't.

53:24.334 --> 53:26.403
(LAUGHTER)

53:26.403 --> 53:31.542
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
online: After a 55-year gap,
fans can finally read a new

53:31.542 --> 53:35.879
Harper Lee book. "Go Set a
Watchman" continues the story of
Atticus Finch, one of the most

53:35.879 --> 53:39.416
beloved characters
from her first book.

53:39.416 --> 53:43.821
We wondered what critics had to
say about "To Kill a
Mockingbird" when it was
released

53:43.821 --> 53:49.326
in 1960. You can find those
reviews on our home page.
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:49.326 --> 53:53.197
JUDY WOODRUFF: And tune in
later tonight on "Charlie Rose":
more analysis of the Iran

53:53.197 --> 53:55.265
nuclear deal.

53:55.265 --> 53:57.534
And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

53:57.534 --> 54:02.206
On Wednesday, we will continue
our running series of extended
interviews with presidential

54:02.206 --> 54:05.409
candidates. Next up, Gwen talks
to Republican Senator Ted Cruz.

54:05.409 --> 54:06.510
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:06.510 --> 54:08.979
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

54:08.979 --> 54:12.716
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening. For all of us
here at the "PBS NewsHour,"

54:12.716 --> 54:12.916
thank you, and good night.
