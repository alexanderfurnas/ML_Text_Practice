JUDY WOODRUFF: Monday
marks the 50th anniversary
of the beginning of
the June 1967 Six-Day

00:06.900 --> 00:10.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
War, fought between
Israel and several
neighboring Arab nations.

00:10.466 --> 00:13.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The swift Israeli
victory was total.

00:13.300 --> 00:18.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But no one knew at the time,
and in the war's aftermath,
that many of the dividing lines

00:20.233 --> 00:23.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
struck would define
relations in the region
for the ensuing 50 years.

Former "NewsHour" correspondent

the war then for The New York

Times, and he remembers those
historic days for us now.

TERENCE SMITH, Former "NewsHour"
Correspondent: The Six-Day War
between Israel and her Arab

00:36.033 --> 00:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
neighbors began 50 years ago
shortly after dawn on the hot,
dry morning of June 5, 1967.

00:45.466 --> 00:50.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the course of six frantic
days, Israel decimated the
armies and air forces of Egypt,

00:52.333 --> 00:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jordan and Syria, and redrew
the map of the Middle East.

00:56.266 --> 01:01.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The war created a
stalemate between Israel
and the Palestinians
in Jerusalem and the

01:02.333 --> 01:04.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
West Bank that
persists to this day.

01:04.433 --> 01:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is the same stand-off
that confronted President
Trump on his recent visit.

01:11.400 --> 01:14.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I covered the battle for
Jerusalem and the West
Bank as an incredibly
green, inexperienced

01:16.100 --> 01:18.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
correspondent for
The New York Times.

01:18.300 --> 01:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I had arrived in Israel just 10
days before on my first foreign
assignment for the paper,

01:24.600 --> 01:27.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and I knew nothing.

01:27.433 --> 01:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Scrambling after the Israeli
army units as they conquered the
ancient Old City of Jerusalem,

01:34.433 --> 01:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I followed them inside as they
took control of the Western
Wall, the retaining wall of

01:38.866 --> 01:40.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Second Temple.

01:40.933 --> 01:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Suddenly, the troops were
face-to-face with the
holiest site in Judaism.

01:46.933 --> 01:51.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Israelis had not been
able to visit or pray
at the wall since 1948.

01:51.766 --> 01:53.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was quite a moment.

01:53.866 --> 01:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I covered the Israeli units
as they swept through the West
Bank, driving Jordan's Arab

02:00.600 --> 02:03.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
legion from Bethlehem
down to Jericho and to the
banks of the Jordan River.

02:05.533 --> 02:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Burned-out Jordanian tanks
and armored personnel
carriers littered the highway.

02:10.666 --> 02:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Where the troops stopped then
is the armistice line today.

02:14.733 --> 02:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fighting in Jerusalem
and on the West Bank had been
fierce, with heavy casualties,

02:20.933 --> 02:23.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but it was largely
over in 96 hours.

02:23.433 --> 02:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Israelis and Palestinians
alike were stunned.

02:26.333 --> 02:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Suddenly, two peoples
who had been separated by
the so-called Green Line
for 19 years confronted

02:33.300 --> 02:34.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
each other.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Both sides were curious
about the other.

02:36.866 --> 02:41.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As soon as they could,
ordinary Israelis poured
into the walled Old City.

02:43.933 --> 02:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Curiosity and the universal
human instinct for bargains
drove them into the shops in

02:48.800 --> 02:50.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the narrow streets
of the Old City.

02:50.866 --> 02:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The shelves on the Jordanian
side were stocked with duty-free
electronics and small luxuries

02:56.966 --> 03:01.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that were unavailable
or much more expensive
in high-tariff Israel.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The bargains flew
off the shelves.

03:05.666 --> 03:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And not just ordinary Israelis.

03:08.066 --> 03:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Teddy Kollek, the mayor of
Israeli Jerusalem, and Israel's
defense minister, Moshe Dayan,

03:15.066 --> 03:19.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
both famous antiquities
collectors, descended
on the Arab dealers
in East Jerusalem and

03:20.466 --> 03:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
negotiated for ancient treasures
to add to their collections.

03:25.100 --> 03:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Palestinians began to explore
West Jerusalem and meet
Israelis for the first time.

03:32.066 --> 03:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A few had the nerve to travel
to Jaffa to visit homes that
they or their parents had

03:36.166 --> 03:38.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fled in 1948.

03:38.900 --> 03:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the process of getting
to know each other in
the first weeks after
the war, Palestinians

03:45.933 --> 03:49.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
discovered that Israelis were
not, in fact, 10 feet-tall, and
Israelis found that Palestinians

03:51.000 --> 03:54.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
were not, in fact,
all cutthroats.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It wasn't all
sweetness and light.

03:56.766 --> 03:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A lot of blood had been spilled.

03:59.433 --> 04:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But people on either side of the
Green Line wanted to see what
they could while they could.

04:06.366 --> 04:11.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a shared assumption
that, because the Israeli
victory had been so total, that,

04:12.200 --> 04:15.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this time, some sort of
peace was inevitable.

04:15.733 --> 04:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was an assumption, not
necessarily an aspiration,
not for everyone.

04:22.700 --> 04:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People on both sides expected
that the cease-fire would be
replaced by an agreement, Israel

04:28.133 --> 04:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would give up some of the
occupied territory, just as it
had during the Suez crisis nine

04:33.833 --> 04:37.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
years earlier, and that,
this time, finally,
there would be peace.

04:38.533 --> 04:40.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How could it not?

04:40.566 --> 04:45.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
No one I spoke to in
those months after the
war thought that the
stand-off between Israel

04:45.233 --> 04:49.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the Palestinians
would last for 50 years.

04:49.166 --> 04:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even the deeply cynical Moshe
Dayan famously said he was
just waiting for the phone to

04:55.733 --> 04:59.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ring from the other
side to negotiate peace.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It wasn't to be.

05:01.633 --> 05:06.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
By the fall of that year, the
Arab states met in Khartoum
and agreed on their famous

05:07.800 --> 05:11.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
three no's: no negotiation,
no recognition, no
peace with Israel.

05:13.833 --> 05:18.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time, the first
Jewish settlers had established
a rump settlement on the West

05:18.966 --> 05:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Bank, promising not to leave.

05:21.133 --> 05:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I remember asking Dayan at a
news conference, what was going
to be done about the settlers?

05:28.033 --> 05:32.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"If we can solve the big
issues," he told me, "the
settlers will be no problem."

05:34.133 --> 05:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, there are some 400,000
Israelis settlers in the West
Bank and 350,000 more in East

05:40.900 --> 05:43.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Jerusalem.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are still promising not
to leave, and constitute a
major political voice on the

05:48.366 --> 05:50.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right in Israel.

05:50.800 --> 05:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the elements of
a deadlock, the same
deadlock that has defied a
solution for 50 years, were

05:56.966 --> 05:59.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in place before
the year was out.
