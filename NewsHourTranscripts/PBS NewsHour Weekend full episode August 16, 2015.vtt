LEAKED BY FORMER NATIONAL

LEADERS, AND AMERICAN CITIZENS.

00:51.118 --> 00:52.419
NOW, ANOTHER CHAPTER HAS BEEN

00:52.419 --> 00:54.054
REVEALED: HOW TELECOMMUNICATIONS

00:54.054 --> 00:56.523
GIANT AT&T DEMONSTRATED A,"

00:56.523 --> 00:58.892
EXTREME WILLINGNESS TO HELP"

00:58.892 --> 01:00.260
THE N.S.A.

01:00.260 --> 01:01.762
AN ARTICLE JOINTLY PUBLISHED BY"

01:01.762 --> 01:02.863
THE NEW YORK TIMES" AND THE

01:02.863 --> 01:04.231
INVESTIGATIVE NON-PROFIT PRO-

01:04.231 --> 01:06.934
PUBLICA REPORTS AT&T FORWARDED

01:06.934 --> 01:09.236
ONE MILLION EMAILS A DAY TO THE

01:09.236 --> 01:11.905
N.S.A., HANDED OVER ONE BILLION

01:11.905 --> 01:13.540
CELL PHONE RECORDS A DAY TO THE

01:13.540 --> 01:15.976
N.S.A., AND ASSISTED THE N.S.A.

01:15.976 --> 01:18.078
IN WIRETAPPING INTERNET LINES AT

01:18.078 --> 01:19.780
THE UNITED NATIONS HEADQUARTERS.

01:19.780 --> 01:20.948
THIS IS ACCORDING TO DOCUMENTS

01:20.948 --> 01:22.950
PROVIDED BY SNOWDEN, WHO REMAINS

01:22.950 --> 01:24.952
IN RUSSIA, TO AVOID U.S.

01:24.952 --> 01:26.753
PROSECUTION FOR ESPIONAGE.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.288
JOINING ME NOW TO DISCUSS THIS

01:28.288 --> 01:29.723
IS REPORTER JEFF LARSON FROM

01:29.723 --> 01:30.424
PRO-PUBLICA.

01:30.424 --> 01:31.758
A YOU YOUR COLLEAGUES AT

01:31.758 --> 01:33.226
PRO-PUBLIC WORKS PUBLICA AND THE

01:33.226 --> 01:34.127
TIMES PUBLISHED THIS.

01:34.127 --> 01:35.028
HOW DID YOU PROVE THAT THIS

01:35.028 --> 01:36.697
EXISTED?

01:36.697 --> 01:40.867
>> IT WAS A LONG TIME TO PROVE

01:40.867 --> 01:43.503
THAT FAIRVIEW WAS AT&T.

01:43.503 --> 01:44.905
WE WENT THROUGH THE DOCUMENTS

01:44.905 --> 01:47.007
WITH A FINE TOOTH COMB LOOKING

01:47.007 --> 01:48.942
FOR THINGS LIKE INTERNAL

01:48.942 --> 01:52.980
ACRONYMS THAT AT&T USED, AND FCC

01:52.980 --> 01:57.417
REPORTS.

01:57.417 --> 01:59.019
>> THEIR VIEW WAS SORT OF A CODE

01:59.019 --> 02:00.287
NAME THAT YOU HADN'T FIGURED OUT

02:00.287 --> 02:01.221
THAT WAS AT&T.

02:01.221 --> 02:02.155
>> EXACTLY.

02:02.155 --> 02:03.457
IT'S BEEN OUT BEFORE, THERE'S

02:03.457 --> 02:05.492
BEEN MENTIONS ON BRAZILIAN TV ON

02:05.492 --> 02:07.361
FAIRVIEW.

02:07.361 --> 02:08.862
NO ONE HAD PUT TWO AND TWO

02:08.862 --> 02:10.630
TOGETHER AND PUT IT TOGETHER.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.532
SO STARTING IN FEBRUARY WE

02:12.532 --> 02:14.267
LOOKED THROUGH THE DOCUMENTS AND

02:14.267 --> 02:16.003
TRIED TO SHOW THIS, IT'S AN

02:16.003 --> 02:20.674
EXTREMELY CLOSE PARTNERSHIP.

02:20.674 --> 02:23.610
AT&T ENGINEERS CAME IN HAND WITH

02:23.610 --> 02:25.879
THE NSA TO ENABLE SPYING AND IN

02:25.879 --> 02:28.048
SOME CASES IN MANY CASES THE

02:28.048 --> 02:29.783
AT&T ACTUALLY DOES THE FILTERING

02:29.783 --> 02:31.785
ON BEHALF OF THE NSA, IN THEIR

02:31.785 --> 02:32.753
OWN FACILITY.

02:32.753 --> 02:33.653
Sreenivasan: SO THEY'RE NOT

02:33.653 --> 02:34.721
ACTUALLY HANDING ALL THE

02:34.721 --> 02:36.123
INFORMATION THEY'RE SORTING IT

02:36.123 --> 02:38.158
OUT BEFORE IT GOES TO THE NSA?

02:38.158 --> 02:39.459
>> YES, BUT IT'S A LARGE

02:39.459 --> 02:40.427
PORTION.

02:40.427 --> 02:44.965
THE THOSE CELL PHONE RECORDS ARE

02:44.965 --> 02:46.700
PRETTY BULKY AND THEY

02:46.700 --> 02:50.537
INCLUDE DOMESTIC ONES.

02:50.537 --> 02:52.406
IT TURNED OUT IN 2013 THAT

02:52.406 --> 02:55.142
VERIZON WAS HANDING OUT THEM BUT

02:55.142 --> 02:57.944
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SAID IT WAS

02:57.944 --> 02:59.146
ONLY LAND LINE AND NOT CELL

02:59.146 --> 03:00.580
PHONE RECORDS.

03:00.580 --> 03:10.490
>> HOW DO YOU SORT THROUGH THAT

03:10.490 --> 03:11.525
AND WHERE DO THEY GET ACCESS TO

03:11.525 --> 03:12.325
THAT?

03:12.325 --> 03:13.593
JUST PEOPLE USING at&t.com

03:13.593 --> 03:15.529
E-MAIL?

03:15.529 --> 03:17.464
>> IT'S NOT AT&T E-MAIL, IT IS

03:17.464 --> 03:24.004
THE BIG PIPES OF THE INTERNET

03:24.004 --> 03:26.039
AND THEY ALSO PROVIDE THOSE BIG

03:26.039 --> 03:27.908
PIPES TO CORPORATE PARTNERS THAT

03:27.908 --> 03:29.776
AT&T HAS.

03:29.776 --> 03:32.779
SO YOU KNOW PLACES LIKE LEVEL 3,

03:32.779 --> 03:34.714
OR COMCAST, IF YOU HAVE HOME

03:34.714 --> 03:36.850
INTERNET, IT LARGELY WILL GO

03:36.850 --> 03:38.685
OVER AT&T NETWORKS AT SOME POINT

03:38.685 --> 03:39.886
WHEN IT TRANSITS THE UNITED

03:39.886 --> 03:41.154
STATES.

03:41.154 --> 03:44.024
LARGELY WITH THE NSA BECAUSE

03:44.024 --> 03:45.225
IT'S A FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE

03:45.225 --> 03:47.027
AGENCY THEY ARE INTERESTED IN

03:47.027 --> 03:48.929
FORTUNE E-MAIL SO A LARGE

03:48.929 --> 03:50.330
PORTION OF THAT WILL BE PEOPLE

03:50.330 --> 03:51.731
OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND

03:51.731 --> 03:53.200
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY COVERED

03:53.200 --> 03:54.534
BY UNITED STATES LAW.

03:54.534 --> 03:56.002
IT'S FAIR GAME AS FAR AS THE NSA

03:56.002 --> 03:58.705
IS CONCERNED.

03:58.705 --> 03:59.840
>> WHEN YOU LOOK THROUGH THESE

03:59.840 --> 04:01.308
POWERPOINTS YOU ACTUALLY SEE

04:01.308 --> 04:03.310
INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE NSA TO

04:03.310 --> 04:06.113
BEHAVE NICELY WHEN THEY GO INTO

04:06.113 --> 04:07.347
AT&T OFFICES.

04:07.347 --> 04:08.415
>> RIGHT THEY SAY THIS IS A

04:08.415 --> 04:09.950
COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP

04:09.950 --> 04:10.984
RIGHT?

04:10.984 --> 04:14.721
THAT THERE'S THIS EXTREME

04:14.721 --> 04:16.523
WILLINGNESS TO HELP ON AT&T'S

04:16.523 --> 04:17.824
BEHALF RIGHT?

04:17.824 --> 04:19.693
SHORTLY AFTER 9/11 THERE WERE

04:19.693 --> 04:20.994
TWO TELECOMS THAT WENT TO THE

04:20.994 --> 04:23.163
NSA AND SAID HOW CAN WE HELP

04:23.163 --> 04:24.131
RIGHT?

04:24.131 --> 04:26.433
ONE OF THEM WE KNOW NOW IS AT&T.

04:26.433 --> 04:29.469
SO THIS IS YOU KNOW AT&T SEES

04:29.469 --> 04:31.204
THIS AS SORT OF A PATRIOTIC DUTY

04:31.204 --> 04:32.239
I THINK.

04:32.239 --> 04:32.939
Sreenivasan: WHAT DOES AT&T

04:32.939 --> 04:34.407
SAY ABOUT THIS?

04:34.407 --> 04:36.543
>> AT&T SORT OF GAVE US A

04:36.543 --> 04:38.745
SURPRISING RESPONSE, WE DON'T

04:38.745 --> 04:40.013
COMMENT ON NATIONAL SECURITY

04:40.013 --> 04:41.882
MATTERS RIGHT?

04:41.882 --> 04:44.084
AND LATER WHEN WE CIRCLE BACK TO

04:44.084 --> 04:46.553
THEM THEY SAID, WE COMPLY WITH

04:46.553 --> 04:48.188
THE LAW ESSENTIALLY RIGHT?

04:48.188 --> 04:51.625
SO WE DON'T WILLINGLY DO THIS.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.627
WE ONLY COMPLY WITH THE LAW.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.028
WHICH IS SORT OF AT ODDS WITH

04:55.028 --> 04:56.163
WHAT'S IN THE DOCUMENTS.

04:56.163 --> 04:57.264
Sreenivasan: AND DOES THAT

04:57.264 --> 04:58.832
MEAN ESSENTIALLY THEY ARE BEING

04:58.832 --> 05:00.033
COMPELLED?

05:00.033 --> 05:01.368
>> WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE THE

05:01.368 --> 05:03.803
DOCUMENTS ARE SO OLD, OR I MEAN

05:03.803 --> 05:05.205
TWO YEARS OLD WE DON'T KNOW HOW

05:05.205 --> 05:06.606
THINGS HAVE CHANGED AFTER

05:06.606 --> 05:07.774
CONGRESS PASSED THE U.S.A.

05:07.774 --> 05:10.410
FREEDOM ACT, WE ALSO DON'T

05:10.410 --> 05:12.679
NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED

05:12.679 --> 05:14.047
IN THE TWO INTERVENING YEARS.

05:14.047 --> 05:17.384
WE KNOW VERIZON DID TRY AND

05:17.384 --> 05:19.819
CHALLENGE SOME THINGS IN COURT

05:19.819 --> 05:21.555
BUT WE REALLY HAVE NO IDEA IF

05:21.555 --> 05:22.956
THE PROGRAM IS EXACTLY THE SAME

05:22.956 --> 05:24.925
AS IT WAS IN 2013 BEFORE THE

05:24.925 --> 05:26.660
SNOWDEN REVELATIONS.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.661
>> JEFF LARSON FROM PRO-PUBLICA

05:27.661 --> 05:28.595
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

05:28.595 --> 05:29.930

BETTER.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.919
BOND DIED SATURDAY, IN FLORIDA.

05:52.919 --> 05:54.721
GRANDSON OF A SLAVE AND SON OF A

05:54.721 --> 05:56.223
COLLEGE PRESIDENT, BOND ATTENDED

05:56.223 --> 05:57.557
ATLANTA'S MOREHOUSE COLLEGE,

WHERE HE WAS A STUDENT IN A

05:58.892 --> 06:00.360
PHILOSOPHY CLASS TAUGHT BY

06:00.360 --> 06:02.162
MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

PLANNING NONVIOLENT PROTESTS

06:09.436 --> 06:11.071
THROUGHOUT THE SEGREGATED SOUTH.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.506
AT THE AGE OF 26, BOND WAS

06:13.506 --> 06:14.941
ELECTED TO THE GEORGIA STATE

06:14.941 --> 06:17.510
LEGISLATURE AND SERVED 20 YEARS.

06:17.510 --> 06:19.012
HE MADE A RUN FOR CONGRESS BUT

06:19.012 --> 06:20.580
LOST AN EPIC RACE TO FELLOW

06:20.580 --> 06:21.781
CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST JOHN

06:21.781 --> 06:24.217
LEWIS, IN 1986.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.586
BOND WAS THE FIRST PRESIDENT OF

06:26.586 --> 06:28.388
THE SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER,

06:28.388 --> 06:29.589
WHICH ADVOCATES FOR JUSTICE AND

EQUALITY, AND LATER, CHAIRMAN OF

THE N.A.A.C.P., AND SERVED MORE

06:33.159 --> 06:34.828
THAN A DECADE IN THAT POST.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.429
TWO YEARS AGO, BOND SPOKE AT THE

06:36.429 --> 06:38.732
50th ANNIVERSARY OF THE 1963

06:38.732 --> 06:40.367
MARCH ON WASHINGTON FOR JOBS AND

06:40.367 --> 06:41.434
FREEDOM.

06:41.434 --> 06:42.669
>> WE ARE STILL BEING TESTED BY

06:42.669 --> 06:44.371
HARDSHIPS AND ADVERSITY.

06:44.371 --> 06:45.705
FROM THE ELEVATION OF STAND YOUR

06:45.705 --> 06:47.440
GROUND LAWS TO THE EVISCERATION

06:47.440 --> 06:49.175
OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT.

06:49.175 --> 06:51.177
BUT TODAY WE COMMIT OURSELVES AS

06:51.177 --> 06:53.280
WE DID 50 YEARS AGO TO GREATER

06:53.280 --> 06:56.216
EFFORTS AND GRANDER VICTORIES.

06:56.216 --> 06:57.083
>> Sreenivasan: JULIAN BOND WAS

06:57.083 --> 06:58.051
75.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.819
TO DISCUSS HIS LEGACY, I AM

06:59.819 --> 07:01.221
JOINED VIA SKYPE FROM MARTHA'S

07:01.221 --> 07:02.455
VINEYARD BY CONGRESSWOMAN

07:02.455 --> 07:03.823
ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, A CIVIL

07:03.823 --> 07:05.325
RIGHTS PIONEER IN HER OWN RIGHT,

07:05.325 --> 07:06.693
WHOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH BOND

07:06.693 --> 07:08.194
WENT BACK TO THEIR DAYS AT

07:08.194 --> 07:09.429
SNICK.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.797
WHEN YOU HEARD THE NEWS WHAT

07:10.797 --> 07:12.732
WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND?

07:12.732 --> 07:13.967
>> WELL I WASN'T EVEN A LITTLE

07:13.967 --> 07:15.869
BIT READY TO LOSE MY GOOD FRIEND

07:15.869 --> 07:18.605
AND CONSTITUENT.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.807
BECAUSE -- BECAUSE JULIAN HAS

07:20.807 --> 07:23.143
LIVED IN WASHINGTON NOW, FOR

07:23.143 --> 07:24.878
MORE THAN 25 YEARS AND BEEN A

07:24.878 --> 07:26.579
CHAMPION AMONG OTHER THINGS FOR

07:26.579 --> 07:28.882
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

07:28.882 --> 07:31.017
I SAW HIM ONLY A FEW MONTHS AGO

07:31.017 --> 07:33.920
WHEN HE CAME RIGHT AFTER

07:33.920 --> 07:36.690
FERGUSON WHEN I HAD A FORUM AT

07:36.690 --> 07:39.259
HOWARD UNIVERSITY, TO DISCUSS

07:39.259 --> 07:41.461
RACIAL PROFILING.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.930
I WANTED TO HAVE JULIAN COME

07:43.930 --> 07:46.599
BECAUSE I WANTED TO HAVE THIS

07:46.599 --> 07:48.435
CONVERSATION, JULIAN AND ME WITH

07:48.435 --> 07:50.437
THE STUDENTS IN ORDER TO LET

07:50.437 --> 07:52.205
THEM KNOW WE WERE IN TOUCH WITH

07:52.205 --> 07:54.007
THEIR MOVEMENT AND WE UNDERSTOOD

07:54.007 --> 07:56.743
THEIR MOVEMENT AT A DISTANCE,

07:56.743 --> 07:58.545
THAN OUR MOVEMENT AND AS THEIR

07:58.545 --> 08:00.647
MOVEMENT SHOWED THAT OUR

08:00.647 --> 08:02.782
MOVEMENT NEEDED TO BE UPDATED.

08:02.782 --> 08:04.250
BECAUSE FOR ALL THE ACHIEVEMENTS

08:04.250 --> 08:05.585
OF OUR MOVEMENT WE HAD NOT

08:05.585 --> 08:07.921
TOUCHED RACIAL PROFILING.

08:07.921 --> 08:11.091
WHAT JULIAN MANAGED TO DO WAS

08:11.091 --> 08:13.293
SOMETHING THAT MOST OF US WHO

08:13.293 --> 08:14.661
WERE IN SNCC, THE STUDENT

08:14.661 --> 08:15.729
NONVIOLENT COORDINATING

08:15.729 --> 08:18.031
COMMITTEE, DID NOT DO.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.133
HE MANAGED TO SPEND HIS ENTIRE

08:20.133 --> 08:22.001
LIFE IN CIVIL RIGHTS.

08:22.001 --> 08:24.504
NOT THE SENTIMENTAL CIVIL RIGHTS

08:24.504 --> 08:27.173
OF OUR SNCC DAYS BUT THE CIVIL

08:27.173 --> 08:28.675
RIGHTS OF OUR TIME.

08:28.675 --> 08:29.743
AND THAT'S WHY HE WAS SO

08:29.743 --> 08:31.945
RESPECTED AND SUCH A

08:31.945 --> 08:33.747
SOUGHT-AFTER SPEAKER.

08:33.747 --> 08:34.748
Sreenivasan: CAN YOU GIVE US

08:34.748 --> 08:36.416
AN IDEA OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS

08:36.416 --> 08:38.685
THAT HE HAS MADE THAT MOST OF US

08:38.685 --> 08:40.286
OF THIS GENERATION NOW MIGHT NOT

08:40.286 --> 08:42.055
RECOGNIZE?

08:42.055 --> 08:44.023
>> WELL, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

08:44.023 --> 08:47.293
FROM THE GENERATION OF SNCC

08:47.293 --> 08:49.229
PEOPLE, THOSE OF US WHO WERE IN

08:49.229 --> 08:53.199
THE STUDENT MOVEMENT, THERE WERE

08:53.199 --> 08:56.102
TWO OR THREE THAT ACHIEVED SOME

08:56.102 --> 08:59.572
KINDS OF PROMINENCE AFTERWARDS.

08:59.572 --> 09:02.342
MARION BERRY BECAME THE MAYOR OF

09:02.342 --> 09:04.677
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

09:04.677 --> 09:08.114
JOHN LEWIS WHO STILL IS THE ICON

09:08.114 --> 09:10.383
OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.051
JULIAN BOND AND I'M RUNNING OUT

09:12.051 --> 09:13.686
OF NAMES.

09:13.686 --> 09:16.222
THE FACT IS NOT EVERYBODY

09:16.222 --> 09:18.525
SURVIVED THOSE SNCC DAYS, IT

09:18.525 --> 09:20.994
TOOK A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT OF

09:20.994 --> 09:22.061
PEOPLE.

09:22.061 --> 09:24.130
IT ALMOST DESTROYED SOME PEOPLE.

09:24.130 --> 09:25.899
SO JULIAN WAS NOT ONLY A

09:25.899 --> 09:28.802
SURVIVOR OF SNCC.

09:28.802 --> 09:31.337
HE WENT ON TO GROW THE CIVIL

09:31.337 --> 09:32.472
RIGHTS MOVEMENT.

09:32.472 --> 09:33.306
Sreenivasan: WHAT ARE YOU

09:33.306 --> 09:34.941
GOING TO MISS MOST ABOUT HIM?

09:34.941 --> 09:37.377
>> I'M GOING TO MISS HAVING A

09:37.377 --> 09:39.913
NATIONAL SPOKESMAN, WHEN

09:39.913 --> 09:41.648
SOMETHING HAPPENED ON OUR

09:41.648 --> 09:43.516
RIGHTS, TO SPEAK OUT FOR THE

09:43.516 --> 09:44.684
COUNTRY.

09:44.684 --> 09:45.952
THERE ARE REALLY VERY FEW

09:45.952 --> 09:47.287
LEADERS LIKE THAT WHO ARE

09:47.287 --> 09:48.855
NATIONALLY KNOWN, WHO ARE

09:48.855 --> 09:50.824
NATIONALLY PROMINENT AND WHO ARE

09:50.824 --> 09:52.559
NATIONALLY APPRECIATED, ACROSS

09:52.559 --> 09:53.893
THE GENERATION.

09:53.893 --> 09:57.030
AND SOMEHOW HE MANAGED NOT TO

09:57.030 --> 10:00.233
STOP SERVING UNTIL THE END OF

10:00.233 --> 10:01.568
HIS LIFE.

10:01.568 --> 10:04.370
THAT IS QUITE A LIFE TO HAVE

10:04.370 --> 10:05.572
LIVED.

10:05.572 --> 10:06.706
>> CONGRESSWOMAN ELEANOR HOLMES

10:06.706 --> 10:07.340
NORTON.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.142
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.344
>> ALWAYS A PLEASURE.

10:20.887 --> 10:21.788
>> Sreenivasan: AFTER TWO

10:21.788 --> 10:23.323
DECADES IN BUSINESS, amazon.com

10:23.323 --> 10:24.824
IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST INTERNET

10:24.824 --> 10:26.159
RETAILER, WITH A STOCK VALUE

10:26.159 --> 10:27.627
THAT HAS INCREASED TEN-FOLD

10:27.627 --> 10:28.795
SINCE 2008.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.196
THAT SUCCESS IS DRIVEN BY A

10:30.196 --> 10:32.198
WORKFORCE MOTIVATED BY DATA-

10:32.198 --> 10:34.267
DRIVEN MANAGERS WHO ENFORCE

10:34.267 --> 10:35.802
PRINCIPLES LAID DOWN BY COMPANY

10:35.802 --> 10:37.136
FOUNDER JEFF BEZOS.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.771
THAT'S PART OF THE TAKEAWAY FROM

10:38.771 --> 10:40.273
TODAY'S "NEW YORK TIMES" STORY,"

10:40.273 --> 10:41.941
INSIDE AMAZON: WRESTLING BIG

10:41.941 --> 10:44.143
IDEAS IN A BRUISING WORKPLACE."

10:44.143 --> 10:45.378
BASED ON MORE THAN 100

10:45.378 --> 10:46.679
INTERVIEWS, THE STORY DEPICTS A

10:46.679 --> 10:47.614
CORPORATE CULTURE WHERE

10:47.614 --> 10:49.015
EMPLOYEES ARE PUSHED TO THE

10:49.015 --> 10:49.916
LIMIT.

10:49.916 --> 10:51.117
DAVID STREITFELD IS ONE OF THE

10:51.117 --> 10:51.784
AUTHORS.

10:51.784 --> 10:52.519
HE JOINS ME NOW FROM SAN

10:52.519 --> 10:53.319
FRANCISCO.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.754
>> WHAT IS THE CULTURE THAT YOU

10:54.754 --> 10:56.456
FOUND?

10:56.456 --> 10:59.092
>> IT IS A VERY INTENSE CULTURE,

10:59.092 --> 11:01.094
A VERY HARD-WORKING CULTURE, A

11:01.094 --> 11:04.430
CULTURE WHERE PEOPLE FEEL THEY

11:04.430 --> 11:06.199
WANT TO PUSH THEMSELVES, AS FAR

11:06.199 --> 11:08.301
AS THEY CAN, AND THEY DO.

11:08.301 --> 11:09.102
Sreenivasan: SO FAR NONE OF

11:09.102 --> 11:10.370
THAT WHAT YOU JUST SAID SOUNDS

11:10.370 --> 11:13.339
LIKE A BAD THING FOR A COMPANY.

11:13.339 --> 11:14.507
>> NO, IT'S A GREAT THING FOR A

11:14.507 --> 11:15.375
COMPANY.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.343
IF YOU HAVE A COMPANY OF TYPE-A

11:17.343 --> 11:19.312
PERFORMERS AND THEY'RE ALWAYS

11:19.312 --> 11:22.015
PERFORMING AT THE LIMITS OF WHAT

11:22.015 --> 11:23.816
THEY CAN DO, YOU CAN DO AMAZING

11:23.816 --> 11:25.151
THINGS.

11:25.151 --> 11:26.953
WHICH AMAZON INDEED HAS.

11:26.953 --> 11:28.621
>> WHAT DO YOU FIND UNIQUE ABOUT

11:28.621 --> 11:30.023
WHAT'S HAPPENING INSIDE AMAZON'S

11:30.023 --> 11:31.991
WORK CULTURE?

11:31.991 --> 11:35.094
>> THE UNIQUE WAS JUST HOW WELL

11:35.094 --> 11:38.631
THEY MAINTAINED THAT CULTURE OF

11:38.631 --> 11:41.367
ENDURANCE AND EXCELLENCE.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.369
STARTUPS DO THAT SORT OF THING.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.572
THEY WORK ALL THE TIME.

11:45.572 --> 11:46.606
AND PEOPLE ARE COMPLETELY

11:46.606 --> 11:47.974
DEVOTED TO THE COMPANY AND THE

11:47.974 --> 11:50.243
REST OF THEIR LIFE FALLS AWAY.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.779
THE UNIQUE THING WITH AMAZON IS,

11:52.779 --> 11:54.647
THEY HAD PRESERVED TO A LARGE

11:54.647 --> 11:59.218
EXTENT THAT START-UP CULTURE, TO

11:59.218 --> 12:01.654
A COMPANY THAT WAS EMPLOYING

12:01.654 --> 12:04.557
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.426
AND THAT'S A REMARKABLE THING TO

12:06.426 --> 12:08.061
DO, AND I DON'T KNOW OF MANY

12:08.061 --> 12:09.495
OTHER COMPANIES, IF ANY, THAT

12:09.495 --> 12:11.331
HAVE MANAGED TO DO IT.

12:11.331 --> 12:12.365
>> SOME OF THE ANECDOTES YOU

12:12.365 --> 12:14.233
WRITE ABOUT ARE ALMOST IN DIRECT

12:14.233 --> 12:17.403
OPPOSITION TO THE OTHER STORIES

12:17.403 --> 12:19.005
OF TECH LIFE THAT'S THAT WE

12:19.005 --> 12:20.640
HEAR, THAT NET FLEX HAVE A YEAR

12:20.640 --> 12:21.941
LONG MATERNITY OR PATERNITY

12:21.941 --> 12:25.244
LEAVE, AND GOOGLE HAS A GREAT

12:25.244 --> 12:28.114
POLICY, AND AMAZON IS NOT LIKE

12:28.114 --> 12:30.283
THAT.

12:30.283 --> 12:33.620
>> IT'S MUCH MORE SEVERE.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.989
HAS A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY BUT ITS

12:35.989 --> 12:39.826
SELF IMAGE IS NOT AS A TECH

12:39.826 --> 12:44.030
COMPANY, IT IS OF A RETAILER.

12:44.030 --> 12:46.099
IN THE RETAIL BUSINESS MARGINS

12:46.099 --> 12:49.235
ARE VERY THIN AND BENEFITS ARE

12:49.235 --> 12:51.471
COMPARATIVELY LESS.

12:51.471 --> 12:52.271
Sreenivasan: AND YOU DESCRIBE

12:52.271 --> 12:53.573
THE SITUATION AT THE END OF

12:53.573 --> 12:55.642
EVERY YEAR WHERE THEY CUT BACK

12:55.642 --> 12:57.477
THEIR EMPLOYEES OR THEIR LOWEST

12:57.477 --> 12:59.112
PERFORMERS?

12:59.112 --> 13:02.215
>> AMAZON USES A TECHNIQUE WHICH

13:02.215 --> 13:05.718
WAS RELATIVELY WIDESPREAD IN

13:05.718 --> 13:07.687
CORPORATE AMERICA MAYBE TEN

13:07.687 --> 13:08.721
YEARS AGO.

13:08.721 --> 13:09.856
AND SOME COMPANIES, OTHER

13:09.856 --> 13:12.091
COMPANIES STILL USE IT NOW,

13:12.091 --> 13:14.994
CALLED THE CRUDEST NAME FOR IT

13:14.994 --> 13:16.629
WHICH COMPANIES DO NOT USE IS

13:16.629 --> 13:18.031
RANK AND YANK.

13:18.031 --> 13:20.600
YOU DECIDE WHERE EVERYONE FITS,

13:20.600 --> 13:22.201
AND THOSE AT THE BOTTOM, THOSE

13:22.201 --> 13:23.936
THAT RANK THE LOWEST, YOU EITHER

13:23.936 --> 13:26.239
ENCOURAGE TO LEAVE, OR YOU COULD

13:26.239 --> 13:27.807
JUST RELEASE THEM.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.642
Sreenivasan: WHAT DID AMAZON

13:29.642 --> 13:30.777
SAY TO THIS AS YOU WERE

13:30.777 --> 13:32.812
REPORTING?

13:32.812 --> 13:36.049
>> AMAZON HAS ALWAYS PRIDED

13:36.049 --> 13:39.085
ITSELF ON BEING A VERY TOUGH

13:39.085 --> 13:40.319
PLACE TO WORK.

13:40.319 --> 13:41.854
THEY'VE SAID THIS FROM THE VERY

13:41.854 --> 13:43.156
BEGINNING.

13:43.156 --> 13:46.693
AS JEFF BEZOS SAID EARLY ON TO

13:46.693 --> 13:49.062
NEW EMPLOYEES, IT'S NOT EASY TO

13:49.062 --> 13:50.563
WORK HERE.

13:50.563 --> 13:54.701
AND WITHOUT IT BEING -- WITHOUT

13:54.701 --> 13:56.235
THOSE HIGH STANDARDS, YOU

13:56.235 --> 13:58.371
PROBABLY NEVER WOULD HAVE HEARD

13:58.371 --> 13:59.772
OF AMAZON.

13:59.772 --> 14:02.375
IT WOULD NOT EXIST NOW.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.777
THE QUESTION IS FOR EMPLOYEES

14:04.777 --> 14:09.949
WHO ARE DIVERTED BY CRISES, WHAT

14:09.949 --> 14:11.884
HAPPENS TO THEM?

14:11.884 --> 14:12.685
Sreenivasan: DAVID STREITFELD,

14:12.685 --> 14:14.420
ONE OF THE CO-AUTHORS ON THE NEW

14:14.420 --> 14:16.089
YORK TIMES, THANKS VERY MUCH.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.824
>> THANK YOU.

14:27.600 --> 14:28.634
>> Sreenivasan: OUR SIGNATURE

14:28.634 --> 14:29.936
SEGMENT TONIGHT TAKES US TO

14:29.936 --> 14:31.204
HAWAII, A STATE THAT SEES

14:31.204 --> 14:32.905
SUNSHINE THREE OUT OF EVERY FOUR

14:32.905 --> 14:34.907
DAYS, AND HAS USED THAT SUNSHINE

14:34.907 --> 14:35.975
TO BECOME ONE OF THE TOP TEN

14:35.975 --> 14:37.243
STATES FOR DEVELOPING RENEWABLE

14:37.243 --> 14:38.377
SOLAR ENERGY.

14:38.377 --> 14:39.812
CONVERTING THAT SOLAR ENERGY

14:39.812 --> 14:41.681
INTO ELECTRICITY HASN'T BEEN SO

14:41.681 --> 14:42.548
SIMPLE.

14:42.548 --> 14:43.883
IN THIS UPDATED STORY WE FIRST

14:43.883 --> 14:45.151
BROADCAST IN THE SPRING,

14:45.151 --> 14:46.419
NEWSHOUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

14:46.419 --> 14:47.687
MIKE TAIBBI REPORTS THAT

14:47.687 --> 14:49.522
HOMEOWNERS IN HONOLULU AND THEIR

14:49.522 --> 14:51.424
UTILITY COMPANY FIND THEMSELVES

14:51.424 --> 14:54.460
AT A CROSSROADS.

14:54.460 --> 14:55.595
>> Reporter: THEY'RE EVERYWHERE

14:55.595 --> 14:56.996
ON OAHU: ON THE ROOFS OF

14:56.996 --> 14:58.898
BUSINESSES, LIBRARIES, AND ONE

14:58.898 --> 15:00.867
HOUSE AFTER ANOTHER.

15:00.867 --> 15:02.268
THE AMOUNT OF ROOFTOP SOLAR NOW

15:02.268 --> 15:04.303
ACCOUNTS FOR 12% OF THE ELECTRIC

15:04.303 --> 15:05.438
UTILITY'S USERS.

15:05.438 --> 15:06.739
THAT'S MORE THAN 20 TIMES THE

15:06.739 --> 15:08.107
NATIONAL AVERAGE.

15:08.107 --> 15:09.175
IT'S BY FAR THE HIGHEST

15:09.175 --> 15:10.576
PENETRATION OF INDIVIDUAL

15:10.576 --> 15:13.379
ROOFTOP SOLAR IN THE COUNTRY.

15:13.379 --> 15:14.747
BUT IN THIS TROPICAL STATE,

15:14.747 --> 15:16.382
WHERE THE COMBINATION OF SKY-

15:16.382 --> 15:17.750
HIGH ENERGY PRICES, ABUNDANT

15:17.750 --> 15:19.819
SUNSHINE, AND FEDERAL AND STATE

15:19.819 --> 15:22.155
TAX CREDITS MAKES GOING SOLAR A

15:22.155 --> 15:24.190
NO-BRAINER, THE VERY POPULARITY

15:24.190 --> 15:25.658
OF THESE PANELS HAS BECOME A

15:25.658 --> 15:26.492
PROBLEM...

15:26.492 --> 15:27.326
>> SO WE DRIVE UP, AND YOU HAVE

15:27.326 --> 15:28.060
THESE LOVELY SOLAR PANELS ON

15:28.060 --> 15:28.928
YOUR ROOF.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.463
HOW'S THAT WORKING OUT FOR YOU?

15:30.463 --> 15:31.798
>> IT'S NOT.

15:31.798 --> 15:32.665
>> Reporter: NOT WORKING OUT

15:32.665 --> 15:34.233
BECAUSE BY THE TIME AIRCRAFT

15:34.233 --> 15:35.501
MECHANIC CARLTON HO JOINED THE

15:35.501 --> 15:37.170
ROOFTOP SOLAR PARADE IN

15:37.170 --> 15:38.838
SEPTEMBER 2013, THERE WERE SO

15:38.838 --> 15:40.540
MANY PEOPLE IN HIS AREA THAT HAD

15:40.540 --> 15:42.308
INSTALLED PANELS THAT THE LOCAL

15:42.308 --> 15:45.211
UTILITY COMPANY TOLD HIM, "DON'T

15:45.211 --> 15:47.246
TURN ON THAT SWITCH YET."

15:47.246 --> 15:48.014
SO, IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF

15:48.014 --> 15:49.248
TURNING THE SWITCH ON AND YOU

15:49.248 --> 15:50.082
HAVE JUICE.

15:50.082 --> 15:51.150
>> YEAH.

15:51.150 --> 15:52.084
>> Reporter: FROM YOUR OWN ROOF.

15:52.084 --> 15:53.019
>> AND EVERYTHING'S AWESOME!

15:53.019 --> 15:54.387
[LAUGHS]

15:54.387 --> 15:54.854
>> Reporter: BUT IT'S NOT THAT

15:54.854 --> 15:55.688
SIMPLE.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.056
WHEN YOU INSTALL SOLAR PANELS,

15:57.056 --> 15:58.191
YOU'RE STILL RELIANT ON THE

15:58.191 --> 15:59.592
LOCAL UTILITY.

15:59.592 --> 16:00.760
WHEN IT'S DARK OR WHEN THE SUN

16:00.760 --> 16:02.829
ISN'T SHINING, YOU NEED THE GRID

16:02.829 --> 16:04.764
TO PROVIDE ELECTRICITY.

16:04.764 --> 16:06.532
EVEN SO, SOLAR CUSTOMERS HAVE A

16:06.532 --> 16:07.567
FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT

16:07.567 --> 16:10.036
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UTILITY.

16:10.036 --> 16:11.704
BECAUSE WHEN THE SUNIS SHINING,

16:11.704 --> 16:13.339
ANY EXTRA ENERGY THEIR PANELS

16:13.339 --> 16:15.308
GENERATE IS SUPPLIED BACK TO THE

16:15.308 --> 16:17.310
GRID. THAT EARNS A CREDIT,

16:17.310 --> 16:18.644
FURTHER REDUCING THEIR ELECTRIC

16:18.644 --> 16:20.079
BILL.

16:20.079 --> 16:21.581
IN SOME SECTIONS OF OAHU, WITH

16:21.581 --> 16:23.583
SO MANY HOMEOWNERS GOING SOLAR,

16:23.583 --> 16:25.318
THE UTILITY SAID THE SAFETY AND

16:25.318 --> 16:27.153
RELIABILITY OF THE GRID COULD BE

16:27.153 --> 16:28.588
THREATENED AND IT SLOWED TO A

16:28.588 --> 16:29.956
CRAWL THE APPROVAL OF NEW

16:29.956 --> 16:30.923
SYSTEMS.

16:30.923 --> 16:31.891
>> WE KNOW THERE IS STILL MORE

16:31.891 --> 16:32.625
TO DO.

16:32.625 --> 16:33.559

16:35.895 --> 16:37.296
COMPANY, OR HECO, AS THE UTILITY

16:37.296 --> 16:39.031
IS KNOWN.

16:39.031 --> 16:40.266
>> WHAT WAS HAPPENING WAS THAT

16:40.266 --> 16:42.635
POWER, WHICH NORMALLY FLOWS FROM

16:42.635 --> 16:44.937
THE GRID TO OUR CUSTOMERS, WERE

16:44.937 --> 16:47.240
NOW BEGINNING TO FLOW BACK INTO

16:47.240 --> 16:48.574
THOSE SUBSTATIONS.

16:48.574 --> 16:51.444
SUBSTATIONS WHICH WERE NOT 30,

16:51.444 --> 16:53.746
40 YEARS AGO DESIGNED TO OPERATE

16:53.746 --> 16:54.747
IN THAT MANNER.

16:54.747 --> 16:56.148
>> Reporter: IN ADDITION, HECO

16:56.148 --> 16:57.717
HAD A HARD TIME MEASURING ALL

16:57.717 --> 16:58.751
THAT SOLAR.

16:58.751 --> 17:00.052
>> RIGHT NOW, WE DON'T KNOW

17:00.052 --> 17:01.888
EXACTLY HOW MUCH POWER ROOFTOP

17:01.888 --> 17:03.155
SOLAR IS PRODUCING, AT ANY GIVEN

17:03.155 --> 17:04.290
MOMENT.

17:04.290 --> 17:05.358
>> Reporter: SO YOU CAN'T SEE AT

17:05.358 --> 17:07.660
ALL WHAT 10-12% OF YOUR CUSTOMER

17:07.660 --> 17:09.228
BASE IS PRODUCING?

17:09.228 --> 17:10.096
>> WE CANNOT.

17:10.096 --> 17:11.297
WE CANNOT SEE THAT.

17:11.297 --> 17:12.131
>> Reporter: BUT WHILE HECO

17:12.131 --> 17:13.499
STUDIED THE PROBLEM, HOMEOWNERS

17:13.499 --> 17:14.567
LIKE CARLTON HO WERE LEFT

17:14.567 --> 17:15.735
WAITING.

17:15.735 --> 17:16.836
IT HAD BEEN A YEAR-AND-A-HALF

17:16.836 --> 17:19.171
THAT HIS SYSTEM HAD SAT UNUSED.

17:19.171 --> 17:21.374
HO WAS LEFT PAYING HIS REGULAR

17:21.374 --> 17:22.541
ELECTRIC BILL: ABOUT $150 A

17:22.541 --> 17:23.576
MONTH.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.211
PLUS ANOTHER $240 A MONTH IN

17:25.211 --> 17:27.480
PAYMENTS FOR THE $23,000 SOLAR

17:27.480 --> 17:29.315
PANELS HE'D BOUGHT BUT COULDN'T

17:29.315 --> 17:30.950
USE.

17:30.950 --> 17:33.386
>> HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC NEEDS TO

17:33.386 --> 17:36.889
AND HAS TAKEN STEPS TO WORK WITH

17:36.889 --> 17:38.591
OUR CUSTOMERS TO FIND SOLUTIONS

17:38.591 --> 17:42.228
THAT WORKS FOR THEM AND WORKS

17:42.228 --> 17:43.462
FOR THE GRID.

17:43.462 --> 17:45.031
IT'S BEEN LEARNING MOMENTS, FOR

17:45.031 --> 17:47.233
US WITHIN THE UTILITY.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.334
>> Reporter: AND FOR THE SOLAR

17:48.334 --> 17:49.902
INDUSTRY WHICH TOOK A BIG HIT

17:49.902 --> 17:51.470
WHEN THE UTILITY SLOWED NEW

17:51.470 --> 17:53.005
APPROVALS: THERE WERE HUNDREDS

17:53.005 --> 17:54.907
OF LAYOFFS AND STOCKPILES OF

17:54.907 --> 17:56.709
SOLAR EQUIPMENT.

17:56.709 --> 17:57.877
BUT THOSE SOLAR CUSTOMERS

17:57.877 --> 17:59.612
WAITING TO TURN ON THEIR SYSTEMS

17:59.612 --> 18:00.813
OR EVEN GET PERMISSION TO START

18:00.813 --> 18:02.715
CONSTRUCTION KNEW THAT GOING

18:02.715 --> 18:04.216
SOLAR WOULD STILL BE A GOOD

18:04.216 --> 18:06.218
DEAL: A SYSTEM UP AND RUNNING

18:06.218 --> 18:07.954
WOULD REDUCE THEIR ENERGY BILLS

18:07.954 --> 18:09.355
DRAMATICALLY.

18:09.355 --> 18:10.756
IN THE MEANTIME, NON-SOLAR

18:10.756 --> 18:12.525
CUSTOMERS, STILL THE MAJORITY,

18:12.525 --> 18:13.859
WERE PAYING MUCH MORE TO

18:13.859 --> 18:15.494
MAINTAIN THE PUBLIC GRID THAN

18:15.494 --> 18:17.029
THOSE WITH THEIR OWN PANELS ON

18:17.029 --> 18:19.365
THE ROOF, A DISPARITY HECO

18:19.365 --> 18:21.200
SUGGESTED COULD BE UNFAIR.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.401
>> IT MAKES SENSE THAT EVERYONE

18:22.401 --> 18:23.669
WHO USES THE GRID SHOULD PAY

18:23.669 --> 18:25.071
THEIR SHARE.

18:25.071 --> 18:26.238
>> Reporter: HECO SAYS THAT NON-

18:26.238 --> 18:27.740
SOLAR CUSTOMERS HAVE IN A SENSE

18:27.740 --> 18:29.275
BEEN SUBSIDIZING THOSE WITH

18:29.275 --> 18:31.110
ROOFTOP SOLAR WHEN IT COMES TO

18:31.110 --> 18:32.745
KEEPING THE GRID HUMMING.

18:32.745 --> 18:34.380
A COST SHIFT ESTIMATED AT MORE

18:34.380 --> 18:36.315
THAN $50 MILLION.

18:36.315 --> 18:38.084
ALL THESE PROBLEMS-- DELAYS,

18:38.084 --> 18:39.151
QUESTIONS ABOUT GRID

18:39.151 --> 18:40.753
RELIABILITY, AND FAIRNESS--

18:40.753 --> 18:42.388
COULD SOON BE SEEN ALL ACROSS

18:42.388 --> 18:43.756
THE COUNTRY AS THE PENETRATION

18:43.756 --> 18:45.591
OF ROOFTOP SOLAR CONTINUES TO

18:45.591 --> 18:46.993
INCREASE.

18:46.993 --> 18:48.761
SOLAR PANELS ARE NO LONGER JUST

18:48.761 --> 18:50.396
FOR SUNBELT STATES, EVEN THE

18:50.396 --> 18:51.998
WHITE HOUSE HAD PANELS INSTALLED

18:51.998 --> 18:53.532
LAST YEAR.

18:53.532 --> 18:54.233

CONTRACTOR WHO ALSO TEACHES

18:56.936 --> 18:58.437
ENERGY POLITICS.

18:58.437 --> 19:00.740
>> WE ARE ON THE NEW FRONTIER IN

19:00.740 --> 19:03.909
HAWAII AS FAR AS TRYING TO COME

19:03.909 --> 19:09.181
UP WITH A PRACTICAL, SAFE ANSWER

19:09.181 --> 19:10.816
TO AN-- A VERY, VERY DIFFICULT

19:10.816 --> 19:13.953
QUESTION WHICH DOES NOT HAVE A

19:13.953 --> 19:15.187
DEFINITIVE ANSWER.

19:15.187 --> 19:16.655
>> Reporter: NAMELY, HOW MUCH

19:16.655 --> 19:17.990
ROOFTOP SOLAR CAN THE GRID

19:17.990 --> 19:19.325
ACCOMMODATE.

19:19.325 --> 19:20.359
AND WHILE DELAYS FOR ROOFTOP

19:20.359 --> 19:21.761
SOLAR CUSTOMERS HAVE ANGERED

19:21.761 --> 19:23.796
MANY IN HAWAII, MANGELSDORF

19:23.796 --> 19:25.664
ARGUES THAT THE CAUTION SHOWN BY

19:25.664 --> 19:27.633
THE UTILITY IS UNDERSTANDABLE.

19:27.633 --> 19:28.968
>> YOU CANNOT ALLOW A FREE-FOR-

19:28.968 --> 19:30.469
ALL, ANYBODY AND EVERYBODY TO

19:30.469 --> 19:32.071
CONNECT TO A UTILITY GRID

19:32.071 --> 19:34.306
WITHOUT ANY TYPE OF REQUIREMENTS

19:34.306 --> 19:36.275
OR MONITORING.

19:36.275 --> 19:38.277
I MEAN THE UTILITY GRID IS A

19:38.277 --> 19:40.079
PUBLIC GOOD, PUBLIC

19:40.079 --> 19:41.147
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MUST BE

19:41.147 --> 19:42.381
MAINTAINED.

19:42.381 --> 19:43.449
>> Reporter: BUT SOME SAY DELAYS

19:43.449 --> 19:45.051
IN APPROVING ROOFTOP SOLAR ARE

19:45.051 --> 19:46.719
LESS ABOUT PRUDENCE AND MORE

19:46.719 --> 19:47.987
ABOUT PROFIT, AND ABOUT

19:47.987 --> 19:49.255
PRESERVING THE UTILITY'S CENTURY

19:49.255 --> 19:50.656
OLD BUSINESS MODEL AS A

19:50.656 --> 19:51.824
MONOPOLY.

19:51.824 --> 19:53.692
>> THE PROBLEM IS, IS THAT THEY

19:53.692 --> 19:55.194
INHERENTLY DON'T WANT TO SEE

19:55.194 --> 19:56.796
MORE OF THIS ROOFTOP SOLAR, AND

19:56.796 --> 19:58.130
YET THEY'RE ALSO ARBITERS OF

19:58.130 --> 19:59.698
WHAT POWER CAN COME ON OR WHAT'S

19:59.698 --> 20:01.000
RELIABLE AND WHAT'S SAFE.

20:05.004 --> 20:06.038
CONTRACTOR.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.873
>> THE COMPARISON WOULD BE, FOR

20:07.873 --> 20:10.176
EXAMPLE, THE TYPEWRITER INDUSTRY

20:10.176 --> 20:11.677
TRYING TO STOP COMPUTERS,

20:11.677 --> 20:13.379
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO PRESERVE

20:13.379 --> 20:14.980
THEIR OWN BUSINESS MODEL.

20:14.980 --> 20:17.983
AND HERE ARGUE THAT THERE'S A

20:17.983 --> 20:19.518
BETTER MODEL OUT THERE THAT'S

20:19.518 --> 20:21.454
GOING TO BE CHEAPER AND CLEANER.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.656

20:23.656 --> 20:24.857
SOME FUNDAMENTAL WAY TO SEE THE

20:24.857 --> 20:25.858
FUTURE?

20:25.858 --> 20:28.327
>> I DON'T THINK WE FAILED, I

20:28.327 --> 20:31.363
DO, IN HINDSIGHT, BELIEVE THAT

20:31.363 --> 20:33.099
WE COULD HAVE SEEN IT SOONER.

20:33.099 --> 20:35.868
THIS CHANGE IN RELATIONSHIP, THE

20:35.868 --> 20:37.436
CHANGE IN THE COMPACT BETWEEN

20:37.436 --> 20:39.138
THE UTILITY AND ITS CUSTOMERS.

20:39.138 --> 20:40.739
>> Reporter: THE NUMBER OF SOLAR

20:40.739 --> 20:43.075
PANEL PERMITS IN HAWAII IS UP,

20:43.075 --> 20:44.743
COMPARED TO A YEAR AGO, AND HECO

20:44.743 --> 20:47.613
SAYS IT HOPES TO TRIPLE ROOFTOP

20:47.613 --> 20:49.482
SOLAR CAPACITY IN 15 YEARS.

20:49.482 --> 20:50.516
BUT HECO MAY NOT BE IN A

20:50.516 --> 20:52.651
POSITION TO DECIDE THAT.

20:52.651 --> 20:54.353
IT IS BEING SOLD TO NEXT ERA, A

20:54.353 --> 20:56.722
FLORIDA BASED UTILITY GIANT.

20:56.722 --> 20:57.823
IF THE DEAL WITH NEXT ERA DOES

20:57.823 --> 20:59.458
GO THROUGH, HAWAII'S ELECTRICITY

20:59.458 --> 21:00.926
CONSUMERS WILL BE SERVICED BY A

21:00.926 --> 21:02.795
COMPANY THAT SAYS IT IS

21:02.795 --> 21:03.896
COMMITTED TO RENEWABLE ENERGY

21:03.896 --> 21:04.897
SOURCES.

21:04.897 --> 21:06.031

21:06.031 --> 21:07.233
UNDER SCRUTINY FROM HAWAII'S

21:07.233 --> 21:09.235
GOVERNOR, ENERGY ORGANIZATIONS,

21:20.746 --> 21:22.681
TO HIT THAT TARGET, STATE

21:22.681 --> 21:23.949
