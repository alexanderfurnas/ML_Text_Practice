WEBVTT

00:06.240 --> 00:10.110
GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill. Judy Woodruff is
back with us tomorrow.

00:10.110 --> 00:16.016
On the "NewsHour" tonight: a
historic visit. Pope Francis
meets the Castros and says mass

00:16.016 --> 00:20.554
in Cuba. Ahead of his U.S.
visit, we look at the man
leading the Catholic Church.

00:20.554 --> 00:23.323
GARRY WILLS, Author, "The Future
of the Catholic Church with Pope
Francis": The secret to him

00:23.323 --> 00:29.329
is pretty open. He's a
Christian. He follows Jesus. He
talks like Jesus. Jesus talked
about

00:29.329 --> 00:34.201
the poor. And that's all the
pope is saying. Start with the
poor.

00:34.201 --> 00:40.007
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead:
Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker
drops out of the Republican
race,

00:40.007 --> 00:45.612
and religion steps in, as three
candidates jockey for an edge in
shifting polls.

00:45.612 --> 00:51.118
Then: the story of one family of
Syrian refugees who made it to
the U.S., as Secretary of State

00:51.118 --> 00:55.322
John Kerry opens
the door to more.

00:55.322 --> 01:00.394
And America after Charleston: a
return to the city where nine
people were killed three

01:00.394 --> 01:05.766
months ago, a PBS town hall on
healing, forgiveness and race --
all that and more on tonight's

01:05.766 --> 01:09.569
"PBS NewsHour."

01:09.569 --> 01:13.073
(BREAK)

01:13.073 --> 01:26.286
GWEN IFILL: A river of humanity
continued flowing into Europe
today, but it appeared

01:26.286 --> 01:30.557
to be somewhat better regulated.
Thousands of people were being
taken in buses directly

01:30.557 --> 01:36.129
from Croatia, across
Hungary and on to Austria.

01:36.129 --> 01:40.467
Jonathan Miller of Independent
Television News reports from the
Croatian/Hungarian border.

01:40.467 --> 01:46.406
JONATHAN MILLER: The Hungarian
military is busy building its
razor wire fence, just like

01:46.406 --> 01:51.545
the one on its Serbian frontier.
They want to ensure that the
transit into Hungary is

01:51.545 --> 01:54.614
totally controlled. From here,
they are just bussed straight
through Hungary to the Austrian

01:54.614 --> 01:57.584
border.

01:57.584 --> 02:02.522
Earlier this afternoon, I
visited a brand-new refugee
transit center that's been built
right

02:02.522 --> 02:07.260
on the Serbian border about an
hour-and-a-half south. It's
quite impressive, 300 military

02:07.260 --> 02:13.734
tents erected in just 24 hours
flat, capacity around 4,000, and
3,000 already there. They

02:13.734 --> 02:19.139
get registered, then food,
medical attention, a shower and
shelter.

02:19.139 --> 02:23.977
The U.N. Refugee Agency is
there, and they told me that 97
percent of these people come

02:23.977 --> 02:28.048
from the world's top 10
refugee-referring countries.
They all know exactly where they

02:28.048 --> 02:31.485
want to go and they know
exactly how to get there.

02:31.485 --> 02:36.690
MAN: Well, many of them have
received, through different
media, social media, very
precise

02:36.690 --> 02:40.293
information. So they have
been briefed where to go.

02:40.293 --> 02:44.164
JONATHAN MILLER: The head of the
International Federation of the
Red Cross commended the

02:44.164 --> 02:48.568
Croatians for bringing a
semblance of order to the chaos
of the past few days. He said

02:48.568 --> 02:53.440
it was now the duty of the E.U.
leaders to find solutions to
this problem.

02:53.440 --> 02:57.944
MAN: These are proud fathers and
mothers that used to take care
of their children and their

02:57.944 --> 03:00.947
families. Some of them are
doctors and engineers and
teachers that were taking care
of their

03:00.947 --> 03:03.383
own lives.

03:03.383 --> 03:07.821
Here they are because of all the
circumstances we know and all
the push factors for which

03:07.821 --> 03:14.694
we do not have a new solution in
this situation. And it is our
duty, as individuals, as
humanitarian

03:14.694 --> 03:19.132
organizations, as simple
citizens of this world, to do
what is expected to us, what

03:19.132 --> 03:22.436
is show our shared humanity.

03:22.436 --> 03:27.007
JONATHAN MILLER: By tomorrow,
the people in that transit camp
will be up where I am now,

03:27.007 --> 03:31.244
waiting for buses through
Hungary to Austria. And by
tomorrow night, they will be at
the

03:31.244 --> 03:36.716
gates of Vienna. The U.N.
Refugee Agency says there is no
letup to this surge. In fact,

03:36.716 --> 03:39.920
they are seeing ever more
people entering Croatia.

03:39.920 --> 03:45.525
GWEN IFILL: Tomorrow, interior
ministers from the various
European Union states meet in

03:45.525 --> 03:50.363
Brussels. There's no sign of
agreement on a proposal to
relocate 120,000 people now

03:50.363 --> 03:54.568
in Greece, Italy or Hungary.

03:54.568 --> 03:59.773
In Nigeria, more than 50 people
were killed and hundreds more
injured in a series of bombings

03:59.773 --> 04:06.113
overnight. Attackers struck in
the northeastern city of
Maiduguri, the capital of Borno
state,

04:06.113 --> 04:12.886
where Boko Haram is active. The
Islamic militant group has
recently lost territory to the
military.

04:12.886 --> 04:19.392
The U.N.'s nuclear watchdog
reported significant progress
today in looking at Iran's past
nuclear

04:19.392 --> 04:24.030
activities. The head of the
International Atomic Energy
Agency, Yukiya Amano, said he

04:24.030 --> 04:29.035
now has environmental samples
from the Parchin military site.
But he also acknowledged that

04:29.035 --> 04:33.707
renovations may obscure what
actually went on there.

04:33.707 --> 04:38.678
The U.S. presidential race will
have one less candidate.
Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker

04:38.678 --> 04:44.351
is quitting the Republican
nomination contest. He initially
led the polls in Iowa, but has

04:44.351 --> 04:50.590
since fallen far back in the
pack. Fifteen Republicans are
still in the race.

04:50.590 --> 04:54.961
Volkswagen stock plunged today
after the company admitted it
rigged U.S. emissions tests of

04:54.961 --> 05:01.168
its diesel vehicles. V.W. shares
fell nearly 20 percent in
trading across Europe. Analysts

05:01.168 --> 05:04.571
in Frankfurt said that
should come as no surprise.

05:04.571 --> 05:08.742
OLIVER ROTH, Equities Trader
(through translator): There is a
giant scandal and it has arrived

05:08.742 --> 05:13.013
as a shock even here. The
management of Volkswagen already
confessed to this, and now there
is

05:13.013 --> 05:17.617
a threat of several billion
dollars worth of penalties, and
the shares plunged accordingly.

05:17.617 --> 05:23.089
GWEN IFILL: Bloomberg reported
today the Justice Department has
opened a criminal investigation

05:23.089 --> 05:27.727
of Volkswagen. And Germany said
it will investigate whether V.W.
falsified emissions results in

05:27.727 --> 05:30.096
Europe.

05:30.096 --> 05:36.836
Meanwhile, on Wall Street, the
Dow Jones industrial average
gained 125 points to close at
16510.

05:36.836 --> 05:41.541
The Nasdaq rose one point,
and the S&P 500 added nine.

05:41.541 --> 05:48.081
A former peanut company owner
faces 28 years in federal prison
for a deadly salmonella

05:48.081 --> 05:53.320
outbreak. Stewart Parnell was
sentenced today in Albany,
Georgia. He'd been convicted of

05:53.320 --> 05:58.058
knowingly shipping tainted
foods. The resulting salmonella
outbreak killed nine people and

05:58.058 --> 06:03.697
sickened hundreds
in 2008 and 2009.

06:03.697 --> 06:08.068
Firefighters in Northern
California made progress today
against some of the worst
wildfires

06:08.068 --> 06:12.872
in the state's history. But over
the weekend, they raised the
number of homes destroyed

06:12.872 --> 06:19.346
to 1,600 in two huge fires north
of San Francisco. South of the
city, a new blaze broke out over

06:19.346 --> 06:24.718
the weekend. It destroyed 10
more homes and killed one
person.

06:24.718 --> 06:29.856
A new study out today finds
Americans may be recycling a lot
less trash than anyone

06:29.856 --> 06:34.928
thought. Researchers at Yale
University measured what's going
into landfills, and found the

06:34.928 --> 06:39.499
average person tosses away five
pounds of trash a day. That's
more than twice what the

06:39.499 --> 06:43.136
government had estimated.

06:43.136 --> 06:48.608
The global growth of Internet
access is slowing for the third
year in a row. The U.N.
Broadband

06:48.608 --> 06:53.613
Commission estimates the number
of people online will grow by
just over 8 percent this

06:53.613 --> 06:57.851
year, down half-a-percent from
last year. Yet more than half
the world's population,

06:57.851 --> 07:02.956
better than four billion
people, remain offline.

07:02.956 --> 07:07.794
And some of television's biggest
stars are polishing their new
Emmys today, including

07:07.794 --> 07:13.800
Tony Award winner Viola Davis,
who was named best actress in a
drama series for her work

07:13.800 --> 07:18.872
on ABC's "How to Get Away With
Murder." She's the first black
woman to win that award.

07:18.872 --> 07:22.942
VIOLA DAVIS, Actress: The only
thing that separates women of
color from anyone else

07:22.942 --> 07:24.277
is opportunity.

07:24.277 --> 07:28.648
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

07:28.648 --> 07:38.658
VIOLA DAVIS: You cannot win an
Emmy for roles that are simply
not there.

07:38.658 --> 07:44.664
GWEN IFILL: HBO was the big
winner, with 14 statuettes, far
outpacing any over-the-air

07:44.664 --> 07:50.103
network. But the awards telecast
itself was the least-watched
show ever.

07:50.103 --> 07:55.775
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Pope Francis in Cuba a day
before he arrives in the United

07:55.775 --> 08:01.181
States; a debate over religion
stirs an already boiling pot;
it's Politics Monday, and much

08:01.181 --> 08:14.027
more.

08:14.027 --> 08:18.898
Huge crowds turned out to see
the pope in Cuba on the second
full day of his trip there,

08:18.898 --> 08:23.169
a day that marked the
anniversary of when he decided,
as a teenager, to become a
priest.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.705
He delivered a message about
the importance of change.

08:25.705 --> 08:28.708
William Brangham
has this report.

08:28.708 --> 08:32.612
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Thousands of
Cubans welcomed Pope Francis
this morning as he celebrated

08:32.612 --> 08:39.486
mass in the eastern Cuban city
of Holguin. Festive songs mixed
with traditional hymns

08:39.486 --> 08:43.123
and with the pontiff's call
for tolerance and mercy.

08:43.123 --> 08:47.127
POPE FRANCIS, Leader of Catholic
Church (through translator):
Jesus invites us to slowly
overcome

08:47.127 --> 08:51.798
our preconceptions and our
resistance to change in others,
and even in ourselves.

08:51.798 --> 08:55.969
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Today's
remarks were in keeping with
Sunday's packed mass in Havana's

08:55.969 --> 09:01.007
Revolution Square. There,
Francis urged Cubans to put
humankind ahead of ideology, a
subtle

09:01.007 --> 09:03.877
jab at the country's
communist system.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.546
POPE FRANCIS (through
translator): Service is never
ideological, for we do not serve

09:06.546 --> 09:09.149
ideas. We serve people.

09:09.149 --> 09:13.653
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Cuban security
forces kept political dissidents
away, blocking them from

09:13.653 --> 09:17.991
attending some events and
detaining several others. But
from all appearances, those who

09:17.991 --> 09:22.162
did hear and see the first Latin
American pope were receptive.

09:22.162 --> 09:26.065
GILBERTO YANEZ, Cuba (through
translator): Pope Francis had a
very deep message, a message

09:26.065 --> 09:30.670
of hope, cordiality, of helping
each other, many beautiful and
appealing things.

09:30.670 --> 09:35.008
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Hours later,
Francis met with Fidel Castro,
the retired founder of

09:35.008 --> 09:39.078
Cuba's communist revolution.
Vatican officials described
their 40-minute meeting as --
quote

09:39.078 --> 09:42.382
-- "informal and familial." The
pope held separate talks with
Castro's brother, the

09:42.382 --> 09:46.119
current president, Raul Castro.

09:46.119 --> 09:51.090
And late today, Francis traveled
to Santiago to visit the shrine
of Cuba's patron saint,

09:51.090 --> 09:56.396
the Virgin of Charity. This
papal visit came as the U.S. and
Cuba have restored diplomatic

09:56.396 --> 10:00.266
relations, thanks in part to
some behind-the-scenes brokering
by the Vatican.

10:00.266 --> 10:05.305
And, tomorrow, the pope begins
his first-ever trip to the U.S.
He will fly first to Washington,

10:05.305 --> 10:07.841
where he will meet with
President Obama on Wednesday and
address a joint meeting of
Congress

10:07.841 --> 10:10.643
on Thursday.

10:10.643 --> 10:16.382
GWEN IFILL: After the pope
leaves the nation's capital, he
continues to New York City and

10:16.382 --> 10:19.486
Philadelphia. In those cities,
he is scheduled to meet with
some of the poorest and the most

10:19.486 --> 10:23.289
powerless, delivering a message
of inclusiveness that has
snagged the attention of
Catholics

10:23.289 --> 10:26.459
and non-Catholics alike.

10:26.459 --> 10:31.397
Judy Woodruff brings us a
portrait of the church's first
Latin American pope.

10:31.397 --> 10:43.142
JUDY WOODRUFF: On March 13,
2013, a new pope was elected.
Many were surprised to learn

10:43.142 --> 10:52.452
he is an Argentine, Jorge Mario
Bergoglio, the first pope from
the Americas, first Jesuit,

10:52.452 --> 10:58.057
and first non-European in more
than a millennium. His chosen
name, Francis, honors Saint
Francis

10:58.057 --> 11:01.794
of Assisi and his special
concern for the poor.

11:01.794 --> 11:07.333
POPE FRANCIS (through
translator): How I would like a
poor church for the poor.

11:07.333 --> 11:13.306
JUDY WOODRUFF: Soon, the new
pope's message of change
expanded to include others who
had

11:13.306 --> 11:18.811
been marginalized: women,
the divorced, homosexuals.

11:18.811 --> 11:23.049
When queried about gays, he sent
a clear sign of a new approach
by asking a provocative

11:23.049 --> 11:26.252
question in return.

11:26.252 --> 11:30.256
POPE FRANCIS (through
translator): If someone is gay
and seeks God and has goodwill,
who

11:30.256 --> 11:32.759
am I to judge?

11:32.759 --> 11:38.164
JUDY WOODRUFF: His statements on
women's roles also made
headlines.

11:38.164 --> 11:43.503
POPE FRANCIS (through
translator): Women in the church
are more important than bishops

11:43.503 --> 11:48.741
and priests. I think we are
missing a theological
explanation on this.

11:48.741 --> 11:54.213
JUDY WOODRUFF: But critics say
not much has actually changed in
terms of doctrine, for

11:54.213 --> 11:57.717
example, that women can
never become priests.

11:57.717 --> 12:02.121
MARIE DENNIS, Co-President, Pax
Christi International: I don't
think that there is yet any
signal

12:02.121 --> 12:07.894
that the deep, rich, important
voice of women in the Catholic
Church is going to be heard.

12:07.894 --> 12:11.998
JUDY WOODRUFF: Marie Dennis is
co-president of Pax Christi
International, the Catholic

12:11.998 --> 12:14.601
peace and justice movement.

12:14.601 --> 12:19.939
MARIE DENNIS: I am hopeful that
Pope Francis will bring a change
in the Catholic Church

12:19.939 --> 12:25.778
in terms of its relationship
with the women in the church.
But I'm concerned that, so

12:25.778 --> 12:29.449
far, that isn't too evident.

12:29.449 --> 12:34.921
JUDY WOODRUFF: Francis
decentralized the hidebound
church bureaucracy known as the
Curia and

12:34.921 --> 12:41.060
accused its members of being
careerist and of having
spiritual Alzheimer's.

12:41.060 --> 12:47.266
He moved to clean up the
notorious Vatican Bank, firing
conservatives and promoting
newcomers

12:47.266 --> 12:52.672
who share his vision. And he
looked to make lasting change
around the Vatican's most
shameful

12:52.672 --> 12:59.646
and deeply troubling wound, the
child sex abuse scandal.
American archbishops were forced

12:59.646 --> 13:05.585
to resign. A former church
ambassador to the Dominican
Republic was indicted. A new
tribunal

13:05.585 --> 13:09.622
was created to investigate
top-ranked churchmen.

13:09.622 --> 13:13.226
Still, the efforts were
criticized as too little, too
late.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.294
GARRY WILLS, Author, "The Future
of the Catholic Church with Pope
Francis": I have liberal

13:15.294 --> 13:20.800
friends who think he should have
come in and just changed the
whole proceeding for priest

13:20.800 --> 13:22.802
abusers.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.638
JUDY WOODRUFF: Garry Wills is
the author of "The Future of the
Catholic Church with Pope

13:25.638 --> 13:27.540
Francis."

13:27.540 --> 13:31.577
GARRY WILLS: He's trying to do
something along that line, but
there's nothing that would

13:31.577 --> 13:38.951
be adequate, except to fire all
the bishops, because they were
all complicit in the cover-up.

13:38.951 --> 13:43.322
JUDY WOODRUFF: But if changes in
policies have been slow to come,
the new pope's shift

13:43.322 --> 13:48.461
in tone and unique
pastoral style has not.

13:48.461 --> 13:54.500
Even so, little was known about
the unassuming 76-year-old who
had spent nearly his entire

13:54.500 --> 14:01.207
life in Argentina. An intrigued
world wondered, who is Pope
Francis?

14:01.207 --> 14:07.013
GARRY WILLS: The secret to him
is pretty open. He's a
Christian. He follows Jesus. He
talks

14:07.013 --> 14:10.883
like Jesus. Jesus talked about
the poor. And that's all the
pope is saying. Start with

14:10.883 --> 14:13.019
the poor.

14:13.019 --> 14:17.356
JUDY WOODRUFF: Professor Stephen
Schneck directs the Institute
for Policy Research & Catholic

14:17.356 --> 14:20.259
Studies at Catholic University.

14:20.259 --> 14:23.663
What do we need to know about
this man, in the beginning?

14:23.663 --> 14:25.698
STEPHEN SCHNECK, Director,
Institute for Policy Research &
Catholic Studies, Catholic
University:

14:25.698 --> 14:31.204
He's, you know, a
second-generation immigrant. And
I think the immigrant experience
of Italians

14:31.204 --> 14:38.377
in Argentina was unique. And
Argentine history was one of the
shaping factors here.

14:38.377 --> 14:42.248
It's a different history than
the United States, and, you
know, the forces of political
life

14:42.248 --> 14:45.618
and culture are different
than the United States.

14:45.618 --> 14:51.224
JUDY WOODRUFF: Born in Buenos
Aires, the eldest son of an
Italian immigrant accountant,
the

14:51.224 --> 14:56.863
pope-to-be graduated secondary
school with a chemical
technician's diploma and worked

14:56.863 --> 15:02.068
in a lab, as a janitor sweeping
floors, and even as a nightclub
bouncer, before joining

15:02.068 --> 15:03.236
the Jesuits.

15:03.236 --> 15:06.272
Biographer Sergio Rubin:

15:06.272 --> 15:12.145
SERGIO RUBIN, Pope Francis
Biographer (through translator):
In just six years, he went from

15:12.145 --> 15:18.050
being a priest in a small
convent in a province to being
archbishop of Buenos Aires and
future

15:18.050 --> 15:23.456
cardinal primate of Argentina.
His career has been meteoric.

15:23.456 --> 15:28.194
JUDY WOODRUFF: In his Argentina,
he was known as the slum...

15:28.194 --> 15:28.728
STEPHEN SCHNECK: As
the slum bishop, yes.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.963
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why?

15:30.963 --> 15:33.800
STEPHEN SCHNECK: Well, because
that's where he -- that's where
the center of his gravity

15:33.800 --> 15:37.403
was for his time as archbishop.

15:37.403 --> 15:42.608
JUDY WOODRUFF: He quadrupled the
number of priests in the slums,
lived in a small apartment,

15:42.608 --> 15:46.345
rode public transportation
and cooked his own meals.

15:46.345 --> 15:51.250
GARRY WILLS: He said, the mark
of the shepherd is you have got
the smell of the sheep. You

15:51.250 --> 15:59.826
have to go out and not only
teach, but listen to the people
of God. And he said, my ideal

15:59.826 --> 16:07.400
of a pastor was a priest I knew
who knew who the name of every
dog in the slum.

16:07.400 --> 16:14.974
JUDY WOODRUFF: In 2001,
Bergoglio was made a cardinal by
Pope John Paul II. After John

16:14.974 --> 16:21.447
Paul's death four years later,
Cardinal Bergoglio was
reportedly a front-runner to
replace him,

16:21.447 --> 16:26.118
until he asked his peers to vote
instead for Joseph Ratzinger,
who became Pope Benedict

16:26.118 --> 16:27.954
XVI.

16:27.954 --> 16:30.857
He wasn't putting
himself forward?

16:30.857 --> 16:33.025
STEPHEN SCHNECK: He wasn't
putting himself forward, but
just the reverse.

16:33.025 --> 16:38.297
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the years that
followed, Bergoglio remained
deliberately low-profile.

16:38.297 --> 16:43.669
But once he became pope, Francis
signaled he was different, with
early gestures, such

16:43.669 --> 16:47.874
as washing the feet of prison
inmates and those with
disabilities.

16:47.874 --> 16:50.977
MAN: Coming to America. Pope
Francis will be heading to
Philadelphia.

16:50.977 --> 16:55.581
JUDY WOODRUFF: The pope's first
ever visit to the U.S. will
include a rare trip to speak

16:55.581 --> 17:01.120
to a joint session of Congress,
following an invitation from
House Speaker John Boehner.

17:01.120 --> 17:05.091
The speaker released this video
in anticipation of the papal
visit:

17:05.091 --> 17:09.629
REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH),
Speaker of the House: There's a
lot of interest in what the pope

17:09.629 --> 17:17.236
is saying, his outreach to the
poor, the fact that, you know,
people ought to be more
religious.

17:17.236 --> 17:23.009
He's got some other positions
that are a bit more
controversial, but it's the
pope.

17:23.009 --> 17:27.313
GARRY WILLS: What he will want
to do is heal. He's not a
bomb-thrower, and he will not
come

17:27.313 --> 17:30.049
to insult anybody.

17:30.049 --> 17:36.722
JUDY WOODRUFF: But Francis has
not been shy about taking on
controversial political issues.

17:36.722 --> 17:43.529
Most notably, he has spoken out
about climate change and the
negative impact of global
capitalism.

17:43.529 --> 17:47.967
His recent encyclical
highlighted humanity's role in
global warming and he urged
leaders

17:47.967 --> 17:50.803
to act.

17:50.803 --> 17:57.410
POPE FRANCIS (through
translator): This home of ours
is being ruined. And that
damages

17:57.410 --> 18:01.347
everyone, especially the poor.

18:01.347 --> 18:07.386
JUDY WOODRUFF: The encyclical
calls for radical changes to the
global economic system. So

18:07.386 --> 18:13.826
does Canadian activist Naomi
Klein, whose bestseller "This
Changes Everything" blames

18:13.826 --> 18:19.298
capitalism for ruining the
Earth, and led her to joining
the pope's team of advisers.

18:19.298 --> 18:22.969
NAOMI KLEIN, Activist: And I
think that the encyclical is
just kind of a truth bomb. Like,

18:22.969 --> 18:29.842
it's just -- it just has the
force of coming from a place
that isn't about appeasing
public

18:29.842 --> 18:35.014
opinion, but is just about
trying to tell powerful truths.
And when people, when powerful

18:35.014 --> 18:38.584
people start telling powerful
truths, it's contagious.

18:38.584 --> 18:45.291
JUDY WOODRUFF: It is his
identification with the poor
that most differentiates Pope
Francis.

18:45.291 --> 18:51.297
His remarks on inequality and
the excesses of modern
capitalism have been forceful,
and

18:51.297 --> 18:56.135
he has attacked supply-side
economics, policies that call
for tax cuts for the rich, as a

18:56.135 --> 18:59.138
near-sacrilegious heresy.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.675
STEPHEN SCHNECK: For him, these
are primarily moral issues. He
is, in fact, speaking as

19:02.675 --> 19:10.516
a pastor when he is reminding us
of the moral cost of our
economy, of the profound moral

19:10.516 --> 19:13.586
dimension of caring
for creation.

19:13.586 --> 19:19.225
JUDY WOODRUFF: Most recently,
Francis called upon Catholic
parishes and religious
communities

19:19.225 --> 19:25.965
to take in refugees who are
pouring out of the Middle East.
Who is Pope Francis? To a

19:25.965 --> 19:29.935
great extent, he remains an
image we create for ourselves.

19:29.935 --> 19:33.539
STEPHEN SCHNECK: Pope Francis is
the conscience for this age of
the world.

19:33.539 --> 19:35.474
NAOMI KLEIN: He is
a man in a hurry.

19:35.474 --> 19:38.010
MARIE DENNIS: Pope Francis
is a breath of fresh air.

19:38.010 --> 19:41.814
GARRY WILLS: I think of him as
kind of the Joan Rivers: Can we
talk?

19:41.814 --> 19:46.185
JUDY WOODRUFF: Whatever the pope
has to say during this visit to
the United States, one

19:46.185 --> 19:51.190
thing seems certain: He is
already a transformative figure.

19:51.190 --> 19:56.295
And, finally, it's way too early
to ask this question. What's his
legacy likely to be?

19:56.295 --> 20:02.802
STEPHEN SCHNECK: What he has
done, I think, is he has
transformed the Catholic
attitude

20:02.802 --> 20:08.974
towards the world. He's calling
us to the margins and to the
marginalized. And that

20:08.974 --> 20:13.913
is, of course, the oldest
Christian message.

20:13.913 --> 20:39.572
GWEN IFILL: You can follow all
our coverage of the pope's U.S.
visit online at
PBS.org/NewsHour.

20:39.572 --> 20:44.677
As we reported just a few
minutes ago, Wisconsin Governor
Scott Walker has just decided to

20:44.677 --> 20:48.514
drop out of the Republican
nominating race. He spoke to
supporters in Madison.

20:48.514 --> 20:50.783
Here's what he had to
say just moments ago:

20:50.783 --> 20:53.886
GOV. SCOTT WALKER (R-WI), Former
Presidential Candidate: I was
sitting at church yesterday.

20:53.886 --> 20:58.457
The pastor's words reminded me
that the Bible is full of
stories about people who are
called

20:58.457 --> 21:02.862
to be leaders in unusual ways.

21:02.862 --> 21:09.635
Today, I believe that I am being
called to lead by helping to
clear the field in this

21:09.635 --> 21:15.141
race, so that a positive
conservative message can rise to
the top of the field. With this

21:15.141 --> 21:20.412
in mind, I will suspend
my campaign immediately.

21:20.412 --> 21:26.752
I encourage other Republican
presidential candidates to
consider doing the same, so

21:26.752 --> 21:33.759
that the voters can focus on a
limited number of candidates who
can offer a positive
conservative

21:33.759 --> 21:38.297
alternative to the current
front-runner. This is
fundamentally important to the
future of

21:38.297 --> 21:42.568
the party and, more importantly,
to the future of our country.

21:42.568 --> 21:47.573
GWEN IFILL: Walker's decision
was the headline of the day, but
not the tum -- sum total,

21:47.573 --> 21:52.878
that is, of a weekend of
politics, which also strayed
onto the third rail of religion.

21:52.878 --> 21:56.315
Joining me for Politics Monday,
Susan Page of USA Today and Amy
Walter of The Cook Political

21:56.315 --> 21:57.583
Report.

21:57.583 --> 22:01.253
Let's start by talking
about Scott Walker.

22:01.253 --> 22:06.625
Did he lose support, lose money,
or was it the tail chasing the
elephant, as it were?

22:06.625 --> 22:09.461
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: As it were. It's
probably a combination of both.

22:09.461 --> 22:13.832
You know, Scott Walker was a
candidate who looked so perfect
on paper. And I'm guilty

22:13.832 --> 22:17.903
of saying this, too, that he
looked like the ideal candidate
for the Republican Party.

22:17.903 --> 22:22.775
But when it came to being an
actual candidate, not a paper,
but a real-live candidate, he

22:22.775 --> 22:25.511
didn't do a particularly
good job of it.

22:25.511 --> 22:30.249
And part of it was his message,
which was I am the consistent
conservative, I did something

22:30.249 --> 22:33.118
in a blue state that no other
Republican governor has been
able to do...

22:33.118 --> 22:34.887
GWEN IFILL: Which is to
knock down the unions.

22:34.887 --> 22:38.324
AMY WALTER: Which is to knock
down the unions. Elect me
because I can be both an
electable

22:38.324 --> 22:40.859
candidate, but a
conservative candidate.

22:40.859 --> 22:44.563
That message got muddled
throughout the campaign when he
was chasing -- and talk about
chasing

22:44.563 --> 22:49.001
the tail -- mostly, what he
seemed to be chasing was a party
or a message that kept moving

22:49.001 --> 22:52.137
to the right, and he was
moving along with it.

22:52.137 --> 22:56.008
GWEN IFILL: So, if this is a
party of outsiders, does that
mean that, if you are a governor

22:56.008 --> 22:59.211
or someone who actually comes
from inside the process, the
system, that you are at a

22:59.211 --> 23:01.046
disadvantage?

23:01.046 --> 23:03.449
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau
Chief, USA Today: Well, it is
sort of amazing that in the
latest

23:03.449 --> 23:07.219
poll, we have got -- Scott
Walker was at less than one-half
of 1 percent, this guy who has

23:07.219 --> 23:12.424
won three gubernatorial
elections in Wisconsin, and --
which is significant, to be the
only

23:12.424 --> 23:15.728
person in American history, the
only governor to survive a
recall election -- and at the

23:15.728 --> 23:19.431
top of the field we have three
people who have never won an
office, among them, Donald

23:19.431 --> 23:22.401
Trump, Ben Carson
and Carly Fiorina.

23:22.401 --> 23:25.738
Now, that might say this is the
year of the outsider. We have
seen that before. But I

23:25.738 --> 23:30.376
think that we -- I think that it
continues to be the likelihood
that we -- that the Republican

23:30.376 --> 23:33.579
Party will nominate someone
who's held office before.

23:33.579 --> 23:36.515
And so, in this way, Scott
Walker's withdrawal is good news
for people like Jeb Bush and

23:36.515 --> 23:37.216
Marco Rubio...

23:37.216 --> 23:38.484
GWEN IFILL: That was my next
question. Who benefits?

23:38.484 --> 23:42.288
SUSAN PAGE: ... and John Kasich,
who have maybe just a little bit
more territory now

23:42.288 --> 23:45.758
to claim that part of
the party's support.

23:45.758 --> 23:49.028
GWEN IFILL: So we can assume
that, somewhere, in some
basement of campaign
headquarters,

23:49.028 --> 23:50.629
people are dialing
for his support?

23:50.629 --> 23:53.499
AMY WALTER: Well, and some of
them are already moving over.

23:53.499 --> 23:58.570
We started to hear talk about
supporters, donors already
starting to give money to other

23:58.570 --> 24:02.675
candidates. The candidate that
seems to benefit most from them,
maybe somebody like Marco

24:02.675 --> 24:08.614
Rubio, who is already picking up
some of his support and staff in
some of these early states.

24:08.614 --> 24:11.617
SUSAN PAGE: But I don't think
Scott Walker is a victim of
Donald Trump, which I think

24:11.617 --> 24:15.020
some people are trying to -- he
was a victim of his own failure
to campaign effectively.

24:15.020 --> 24:20.192
He had a great speech in January
in Iowa that really launched
him. He was leading in Iowa.

24:20.192 --> 24:24.897
But then he became a very
inconsistent campaigner. He has
flip-flopped on birthright
citizenship.

24:24.897 --> 24:27.866
He seemed uncertain on
addressing national security
issues. This was a failure of
this

24:27.866 --> 24:31.103
candidate to deliver
on his promise.

24:31.103 --> 24:35.574
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk about
another candidate who a lot of
supporters seem to think is
showing

24:35.574 --> 24:37.343
promise, but had an interesting
-- I guess depending on how you
look at it -- it looked

24:37.343 --> 24:39.745
like a stumble this weekend.

24:39.745 --> 24:43.082
And that's Dr. Ben Carson, who
was on "Meet the Press" and over
the weekend he was asked

24:43.082 --> 24:46.418
about people who should
be running for president.

24:46.418 --> 24:48.587
Actually, let's just play what
he said, so that we can make our
own judgment about what

24:48.587 --> 24:50.222
he meant.

24:50.222 --> 24:49.254
CHUCK TODD, Moderator, "Meet the
Press": Should a president's
faith matter? Should your faith

24:49.254 --> 24:50.689
matter to voters?

24:50.689 --> 24:51.090
BEN CARSON (R), Presidential
Candidate: Well, I guess it
depends on what that faith is.

24:51.090 --> 24:51.123
If it's inconsistent with the
values and principles of
America, then of course it
should matter.

24:51.123 --> 24:51.123
But if it fits within the realm
of America and consistent with
the Constitution, no problem.

24:51.123 --> 24:51.590
CHUCK TODD: So, do you believe
that Islam is consistent with
the constitution?

24:51.590 --> 24:51.190
BEN CARSON: No, I don't. I do
not. I wouldn't advocate that we
put a Muslim in charge of

24:51.190 --> 24:52.091
this nation. I absolutely
wouldn't agree with that.

24:52.091 --> 24:55.561
GWEN IFILL: Now, this was an
interesting exchange, because
Chuck Todd basically threw out
an

24:55.561 --> 24:59.498
open-ended question, and then he
opened the door and drove the
truck through, the question

24:59.498 --> 25:03.435
about whether having a Muslim as
president is consistent with the
Constitution, which

25:03.435 --> 25:05.270
doesn't have a religious test.

25:05.270 --> 25:07.740
AMY WALTER: Correct.

25:07.740 --> 25:12.911
But I think we're now sort of
splicing and dicing maybe this a
little bit too much, just

25:12.911 --> 25:17.750
in that I think the fundamental
thing, the takeaway, at least
for me, was that this was

25:17.750 --> 25:23.055
a candidate that looked like he
was saying that: I don't want to
see a Muslim elected

25:23.055 --> 25:25.891
president, whether -- as opposed
to getting into a debate about
whether -- the constitutionality

25:25.891 --> 25:28.694
of whether a Muslim
could be president.

25:28.694 --> 25:32.331
In fact, you're hearing a lot of
Republicans saying he didn't
advocate that people couldn't

25:32.331 --> 25:35.768
elect one. He just
doesn't want to see one.

25:35.768 --> 25:40.039
But I think what a lot of voters
are going to see out there --
and if he is the nominee,

25:40.039 --> 25:45.110
this, I think, would be a very
big problem for the Republican
Party -- is a party, Republican

25:45.110 --> 25:51.417
Party that seems intent on
dismissing or looking like
they're closing down ranks,
instead of

25:51.417 --> 25:55.788
opening up their base to a
bigger, broader electorate.

25:55.788 --> 25:59.625
If you look at what Republicans
talked about after the 2012
elections, the number takeaway

25:59.625 --> 26:05.764
from the RNC was, we are a party
that is too insular, we are too
white, we are too old,

26:05.764 --> 26:09.134
we need to expand our base, we
need to bring different people
in.

26:09.134 --> 26:11.603
That's not a message
that brings people in.

26:11.603 --> 26:17.443
GWEN IFILL: And yet, and yet, if
you're just going by what it is
that the Republican polling

26:17.443 --> 26:21.146
universe believes, this is
actually a popular position that
he's taking.

26:21.146 --> 26:24.750
So, you wonder sometimes. And
he's continued to defend it
after a first statement. You

26:24.750 --> 26:29.354
wonder whether he's -- doubling
down is the new Republican
political tactic.

26:29.354 --> 26:32.124
SUSAN PAGE: Well, I think that
Donald Trump that has
demonstrated doubling down can
serve

26:32.124 --> 26:35.994
you well. It makes you look
tough. You never have to
apologize.

26:35.994 --> 26:40.866
And in a Republican primary, I'm
not sure this is a big problem
for Dr. Ben Carson,

26:40.866 --> 26:43.368
because a lot of Republicans
would agree that they wouldn't
be comfortable with a Muslim

26:43.368 --> 26:47.339
as president. But when you're
trying to run for president of
this great diverse nation

26:47.339 --> 26:50.409
-- not that there are so many
Muslim voters, although there
are a couple million -- it's

26:50.409 --> 26:54.947
that it seems intolerant to say
that you wouldn't elect a Muslim
president.

26:54.947 --> 26:58.150
There was a time when we
wouldn't have elected a black
president. And we did. Or we
wouldn't

26:58.150 --> 27:01.653
have elected a Catholic
president. And we did. And so
who is to say that there
wouldn't

27:01.653 --> 27:04.356
come a time when we would
elect a Muslim president?

27:04.356 --> 27:07.226
So I think there are a lot of
people, Americans who are
non-Muslims, who would say, this
is

27:07.226 --> 27:10.863
not the -- this is not what I
think of when I think of the
country of America.

27:10.863 --> 27:13.799
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk about the
two women in the race briefly
here. We have Carly Fiorina,

27:13.799 --> 27:14.533
who actually seems
to be surging a bit.

27:14.533 --> 27:16.335
AMY WALTER: Yes.

27:16.335 --> 27:18.070
GWEN IFILL: Of course, these
polls, after every debate,
somebody else surges, depending

27:18.070 --> 27:20.205
on what the headline
said the next day.

27:20.205 --> 27:22.908
But how is she trying to
capitalize on this moment?

27:22.908 --> 27:27.246
AMY WALTER: Well, the first
question is, can she capitalize
by getting money and by getting

27:27.246 --> 27:29.915
infrastructure? Those are two
things that she hasn't had.

27:29.915 --> 27:35.554
So she's got to like do this on
the fly, put together a campaign
team. She has a very skeletal

27:35.554 --> 27:41.326
staff. This is going to be
important for her. And the
second is taking the incoming
flak

27:41.326 --> 27:48.100
for her record as the CEO of
H.P. It was very, very rocky.
She talked a lot about what some

27:48.100 --> 27:51.803
of her successes were, but, at
the end of the day, she was
fired. The company didn't

27:51.803 --> 27:56.241
do particularly well
during her tenure there.

27:56.241 --> 27:59.811
That is going to be something
that is a serious line of attack
that she's got to figure out

27:59.811 --> 28:02.147
a better answer for.

28:02.147 --> 28:04.550
SUSAN PAGE: There's a lot of
things about our politics that
don't make sense, but one

28:04.550 --> 28:05.884
thing that actually happens in a
presidential election is you get
submitted to scrutiny.

28:05.884 --> 28:07.286
AMY WALTER: Yes.

28:07.286 --> 28:09.788
SUSAN PAGE: And you either
stand up to it or you don't.

28:09.788 --> 28:13.292
And Scott Walker got submitted
to some scrutiny, and he didn't
stand up to it. And now Carly

28:13.292 --> 28:17.629
Fiorina is now from the bottom
of the pack into the top tier,
and she is going to have

28:17.629 --> 28:19.565
a chance to demonstrate whether
she can stand up to the
scrutiny.

28:19.565 --> 28:20.365
GWEN IFILL: These are
not new arguments.

28:20.365 --> 28:22.200
SUSAN PAGE: No. No.

28:22.200 --> 28:25.404
GWEN IFILL: This was litigated
against her when she ran for the
California Senate.

28:25.404 --> 28:28.740
SUSAN PAGE: And she didn't do so
well last time. But she's done
better this time in addressing

28:28.740 --> 28:34.146
the questions about her tenure
as head of H.P. than she did
then.

28:34.146 --> 28:36.481
But this is different. The
stakes are pretty -- the stakes
are very high and the scrutiny

28:36.481 --> 28:38.817
is very tough.

28:38.817 --> 28:40.552
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk about
Hillary Clinton. She was on --
she has got a whole new media

28:40.552 --> 28:42.354
strategy.

28:42.354 --> 28:47.993
Now she did a Sunday talk show.
She did late night. She's done
all kinds of -- a day rolling

28:47.993 --> 28:51.597
out kind of a new media
strategy, trying to say, I
guess, reintroduce,
re-re-reintroduce

28:51.597 --> 28:53.999
herself.

28:53.999 --> 28:58.170
Let's hear what she had to
yesterday on "Face the Nation"
to our friend John Dickerson.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.939
JOHN DICKERSON, Host, "Face the
Nation": Give us three words
that is the real Hillary
Clinton.

29:00.939 --> 29:01.873
(LAUGHTER)

29:01.873 --> 29:04.743
JOHN DICKERSON: Just three.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.845
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: Just
three? I can't possibly do that.

29:06.845 --> 29:10.983
I mean, look, I am a real
person, with all the pluses and
minuses that go along with

29:10.983 --> 29:13.385
being that.

29:13.385 --> 29:16.188
GWEN IFILL: OK, it's been 20
years that she's been in the
public eye. Why are we having

29:16.188 --> 29:18.390
this conversation? Why is she
having this conversation?

29:18.390 --> 29:23.295
AMY WALTER: This has been the
debate that the Clinton campaign
has had with folks like

29:23.295 --> 29:27.065
us in the media from the very
beginning. She's the most famous
person nobody really knows.

29:27.065 --> 29:30.068
This is our chance to
go and reintroduce her.

29:30.068 --> 29:34.139
But if you're going to
reintroduce one of the most
famous people in the world, it
has

29:34.139 --> 29:41.813
to look genuine. So I think the
challenge for her is that she's
not the best orator.

29:41.813 --> 29:43.882
She is not somebody that's going
to go up and rev up a crowd in
the way some of these

29:43.882 --> 29:46.518
other candidates do.

29:46.518 --> 29:50.355
But she's very good at other
things. And it's focusing on
those things. I thought she did

29:50.355 --> 29:54.326
very well on "Face the Nation"
yesterday. She's very good in
that context, especially

29:54.326 --> 29:56.595
when it's policy-heavy. When it
comes to some of the other parts
of campaigning, not so

29:56.595 --> 29:57.696
good.

29:57.696 --> 29:59.064
SUSAN PAGE: Well, she was pretty
good on "Jimmy Fallon," though.

29:59.064 --> 29:59.598
AMY WALTER: Oh, that's...

29:59.598 --> 30:01.099
(CROSSTALK)

30:01.099 --> 30:03.735
SUSAN PAGE: Although, if you
have to say, "I'm a real
person," as though that should

30:03.735 --> 30:08.840
be news to people, possibly a
sign of danger as a candidate.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.410
The question is, do you have a
second chance to make a first
impression? Impressions of

30:11.410 --> 30:14.413
her pretty well-set, hard to
change. Maybe not impossible.

30:14.413 --> 30:16.682
GWEN IFILL: I have to ask one
more thing. In your column this
week, you made a reference

30:16.682 --> 30:17.582
to Death Cab For Cutie.

30:17.582 --> 30:18.517
AMY WALTER: Yes.

30:18.517 --> 30:20.485
GWEN IFILL: What were
you talking about?

30:20.485 --> 30:22.354
AMY WALTER: Oh, my gosh, you
didn't know about them? They're
a great indie band. They're

30:22.354 --> 30:22.654
great.

30:22.654 --> 30:23.555
(CROSSTALK)

30:23.555 --> 30:26.758
GWEN IFILL: And? And the
connection to politics is?

30:26.758 --> 30:31.263
AMY WALTER: That they have a
song called "The Sound of
Settling," which in my mind goes

30:31.263 --> 30:36.902
to the challenge for Jeb Bush
and Hillary Clinton, in that
they're not the most exciting

30:36.902 --> 30:41.339
candidates, but ultimately you
may just find that voters are
settling for them.

30:41.339 --> 30:45.010
GWEN IFILL: Does that reasoning
ring true you, Susan?

30:45.010 --> 30:49.314
SUSAN PAGE: Well, I do think we
have a sorting out process, and
sometimes the candidates

30:49.314 --> 30:52.217
that we have counted out early
on ended up -- end up winning
the election. And we should

30:52.217 --> 30:54.553
never forget that.

30:54.553 --> 30:56.588
GWEN IFILL: There is nothing
wrong with a -- little indie
band references in our Politics

30:56.588 --> 30:56.888
Monday.

30:56.888 --> 30:58.056
AMY WALTER: No.

30:58.056 --> 30:59.324
GWEN IFILL: Amy
Walter, Susan Page...

30:59.324 --> 31:00.792
AMY WALTER: Listen to
them. They're good.

31:00.792 --> 31:01.560
GWEN IFILL: You insist that
I have to listen to them?

31:01.560 --> 31:01.526
AMY WALTER: No.

31:01.526 --> 31:02.127
(LAUGHTER)

31:02.127 --> 31:03.562
GWEN IFILL: I will
see what I can do.

31:03.562 --> 31:04.296
(LAUGHTER)

31:04.296 --> 31:10.435
GWEN IFILL: Thank
you both very much.

31:10.435 --> 31:29.221
Stay with us.

31:29.221 --> 31:34.292
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
what happens when Syrians find
refuge; we follow one family

31:34.292 --> 31:39.865
as they settle in to their new
life in the U.S.; and we preview
tonight's PBS special,

31:39.865 --> 31:42.467
"America After Charleston."

31:42.467 --> 31:47.072
You joined us a year ago in
Ferguson. And what would you say
has changed since then,

31:47.072 --> 31:49.441
if anything?

31:49.441 --> 31:54.980
UMI SELAH, Dream Defenders:
Nothing. Absolutely nothing has
changed since a year ago. But

31:54.980 --> 31:57.849
what we have learned in the past
year is not that Black Lives
Matter, but black deaths

31:57.849 --> 32:00.118
matter.

32:00.118 --> 32:04.422
GWEN IFILL: But, first, Greece's
former prime minister returned
to power this evening after

32:04.422 --> 32:08.493
his snap election
gamble paid off.

32:08.493 --> 32:12.164
But as special correspondent
Malcolm Brabant reports from
Athens, many in the
cash-strapped

32:12.164 --> 32:15.534
country are more resigned
than enthusiastic.

32:15.534 --> 32:21.439
MALCOLM BRABANT: The scale of
Alexis Tsipras' victory came as
a surprise. Before the election,

32:21.439 --> 32:25.110
opinion polls had suggested a
much tighter race between the
conservative New Democracy

32:25.110 --> 32:29.648
opposition and Tsipras'
left-wing Syriza Party.

32:29.648 --> 32:34.719
In the end, he had a clear lead
over New Democracy. And although
he didn't win an outright
majority,

32:34.719 --> 32:38.523
he secured enough parliamentary
seats to form a coalition
government with his previous
partner,

32:38.523 --> 32:42.060
the right-wing Independent
Greeks, ANEL.

32:42.060 --> 32:47.632
ALEXIS TSIPRAS, Greek Prime
Minister (through translator):
We fought a tough and difficult

32:47.632 --> 32:52.003
battle. I feel vindicated today,
because the Greek people gave us
a clear mandate to continue

32:52.003 --> 32:56.107
fighting inside and outside the
country and boost our people's
pride.

32:56.107 --> 33:00.946
MALCOLM BRABANT: A breakaway
faction of his Syriza Party that
opposed the latest bailout

33:00.946 --> 33:07.652
deal was wiped out in the
election, and so his authority
has been reasserted.

33:07.652 --> 33:12.090
Reaction was muted. Normally,
after a Greek election, the
streets are full of people
celebrating.

33:12.090 --> 33:17.229
But the country is weary after
five years of never-ending
crisis. Despite his policy

33:17.229 --> 33:22.734
flip-flops, some Syriza
supporters still regard Tsipras
as the golden boy of the left.

33:22.734 --> 33:27.739
MAN (through translator): I am
very happy. I live for my
children and grandchildren.

33:27.739 --> 33:32.177
Tsipras is our hope. He is all
we can hope for. Otherwise, we
are lost.

33:32.177 --> 33:35.814
WOMAN (through translator): This
is the third time that I am
voting for Syriza and Alexis

33:35.814 --> 33:39.484
Tsipras. I am very proud,
and I feel very happy.

33:39.484 --> 33:46.858
MAN: I am not happy, but I was
expecting it. I believed that
the Greeks would vote for

33:46.858 --> 33:53.398
New Democracy. But,
unfortunately for me, and I
think for my country, they kept
on giving

33:53.398 --> 33:57.836
their support to Syriza.

33:57.836 --> 34:02.040
MALCOLM BRABANT: The most
significant figure in this
election was the 44 percent of
people

34:02.040 --> 34:07.312
who decided not to vote. The low
turnout was the worst in Greek
electoral history and an

34:07.312 --> 34:12.817
indication that people are
disillusioned with politics and
politicians.

34:12.817 --> 34:18.089
Alexis Tsipras only succeeded
because he convinced his core
supporters to go out and vote.
His

34:18.089 --> 34:23.628
opponents didn't. The sense of
hope that Tsipras engendered
earlier in the year has now
vanished.

34:23.628 --> 34:26.998
People are bracing themselves
for still more austerity. And
the latest tax bills are due

34:26.998 --> 34:31.770
to arrive in the mail any day.

34:31.770 --> 34:36.374
International investors are
tapping into the expertise of
political analyst Nick
Malkoutzis

34:36.374 --> 34:41.212
to determine whether Greece is
worth the risk, now that Tsipras
has the potential to be prime

34:41.212 --> 34:45.984
minister for the next four
years. Today, in Athens, the
skies roared with thunder. The

34:45.984 --> 34:50.622
big question on everyone's lips
is, after Tsipras' first stormy
term, will there now

34:50.622 --> 34:52.457
be calm?

34:52.457 --> 34:55.660
NICK MALKOUTZIS, Deputy Editor,
Kathimerini: Everyone is asking
the question really, is

34:55.660 --> 35:01.232
he going to deliver, because
he's been such of an enigma over
the past few months? I think

35:01.232 --> 35:06.338
that the two things you can
point to that would perhaps make
you think he can is that

35:06.338 --> 35:11.009
he's emerged from these
elections politically
strengthened. It's clear
certainly to Greece's

35:11.009 --> 35:15.547
lenders that he's the
only player in town.

35:15.547 --> 35:20.285
And the second is that he
returns with the same
government, so there isn't a
question

35:20.285 --> 35:24.556
of people getting used to their
portfolios and learning what
they have to do.

35:24.556 --> 35:28.727
MALCOLM BRABANT: Philip
Ammerman, a Greek American
financial adviser, is working
with

35:28.727 --> 35:33.031
conglomerates that want to
purchase some of Greece's
nationalized assets that are
being

35:33.031 --> 35:38.136
privatized as part of the
restructuring program. He has
grave doubts about Tsipras
ability

35:38.136 --> 35:40.638
to force through
unpopular austerity.

35:40.638 --> 35:44.109
PHILIP AMMERMAN, Financial
Adviser: He has a mandate but he
only has a majority of five

35:44.109 --> 35:49.381
votes in the Greek Parliament.
And, previously, the Syriza
Party, if you will recall, a
month

35:49.381 --> 35:54.386
ago, a month-and-a-half ago,
fell apart precisely because of
implementing the Troika's
program.

35:54.386 --> 35:58.456
Now they have voted it. They
have voted for the third rescue
package, but they have not

35:58.456 --> 36:03.661
voted through the implementing
arrangements. So the proof of
the pudding is going to be,

36:03.661 --> 36:09.134
how many Syriza and ANEL M.P.s
stay with the governing
coalition when it comes time to

36:09.134 --> 36:15.073
implement these structural
adjustment programs that have to
be done. I think it's going to

36:15.073 --> 36:18.410
be very difficult for him to
last beyond 12 months,
personally.

36:18.410 --> 36:22.947
MALCOLM BRABANT: But Tsipras'
first main task has nothing to
do with the economy.

36:22.947 --> 36:29.287
An emergency E.U. summit on the
refugee crisis requires his
participation later this week.

36:29.287 --> 36:33.691
Hard-line nations will want to
know whether Tsipras will tear
down the fence on the Turkish

36:33.691 --> 36:38.163
border which is forcing people
to take the perilous sea route
via the Greek islands.

36:38.163 --> 36:47.172
For the "PBS NewsHour," this
is Malcolm Brabant in Athens.

36:47.172 --> 37:02.787
GWEN IFILL: The Obama
administration's plans to settle
as many as 10,000 Syrian
refugees

37:02.787 --> 37:06.758
in the U.S. within a year
is coming under fire.

37:06.758 --> 37:12.330
In a statement released Sunday,
Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck
Grassley and House Judiciary

37:12.330 --> 37:17.669
Chairman Bob Goodlatte, both
Republicans, said the Islamic
State group will use the

37:17.669 --> 37:23.475
refugee crisis to try to enter
the United States and that the
administration doesn't

37:23.475 --> 37:27.846
have a concrete and foolproof
plan to ensure that terrorists
won't be able to enter the

37:27.846 --> 37:29.514
country.

37:29.514 --> 37:33.051
So far, fewer than 2,000
refugees have settled here.

37:33.051 --> 37:36.521
Tonight, the story of one
family that recently arrived.

37:36.521 --> 37:38.823
Special correspondent
Marcia Biggs reports.

37:38.823 --> 37:44.229
MARCIA BIGGS: It's a theme that
played out all over America this
month, children getting

37:44.229 --> 37:48.166
ready for their first days of
school. But for this family,
it's an entirely new kind

37:48.166 --> 37:51.836
of fresh start.

37:51.836 --> 37:57.509
Mohamed and Amira Darbi and
their three children arrived
only two months ago, five of the
roughly

37:57.509 --> 38:02.747
1,700 Syrian refugees that the
United States has taken in since
2011.

38:02.747 --> 38:06.784
MOHAMED DARBI, Refugee (through
translator): I have been in the
U.S. for 50 days now, and

38:06.784 --> 38:08.286
I like it.

38:08.286 --> 38:11.222
MARCIA BIGGS: "And before
the 50 days?" I asked.

38:11.222 --> 38:13.791
MOHAMED DARBI (through
translator): I didn't know what
America meant.

38:13.791 --> 38:18.296
MARCIA BIGGS: Mohamed and Amira
are from Homs, the birthplace of
the Syrian revolution. He

38:18.296 --> 38:23.535
was a carpenter and she a
high school physics teacher.

38:23.535 --> 38:27.572
All three children were small in
2011, when the revolution began
and Bashar al-Assad issued

38:27.572 --> 38:30.508
a brutal crackdown
on their town.

38:30.508 --> 38:33.545
MOHAMED DARBI (through
translator): When they would
raid the homes, we were afraid
for our

38:33.545 --> 38:37.782
children, our women. We were
afraid they would kidnap one of
us. That's when the fear
started.

38:37.782 --> 38:39.851
MARCIA BIGGS: What did
you tell your children?

38:39.851 --> 38:44.355
AMIRA DARBI, Refugee (through
translator): The kids were very
scared. They would wake

38:44.355 --> 38:47.559
up in the middle of the night
and start crying. And I was
worried they would develop some

38:47.559 --> 38:52.497
sort of psychological problem.
The main reason I left was for
my kids.

38:52.497 --> 38:57.869
MARCIA BIGGS: It was 2012, when
the family narrowly missed the
missiles that flattened

38:57.869 --> 39:02.540
their neighborhood, that they
finally fled. They waited for
weeks near the border to be

39:02.540 --> 39:07.045
able to make the dangerous
crossing into Jordan, running
for their lives.

39:07.045 --> 39:09.781
MOHAMED DARBI (through
translator): I grabbed my
daughter and I ran through the
checkpoint.

39:09.781 --> 39:12.116
My wife grabbed our other
daughter, and we crossed even
though we knew they might shoot

39:12.116 --> 39:15.086
us. It was terrifying.

39:15.086 --> 39:19.390
AMIRA DARBI (through
translator): This day was the
most difficult of my life. I
still

39:19.390 --> 39:23.027
remember it. And, sometimes, I
still have nightmares about
crossing that checkpoint.

39:23.027 --> 39:28.733
MARCIA BIGGS: But once in
Jordan, the family struggled, at
first living with 200 families

39:28.733 --> 39:33.938
in a camp made only for five,
without work, without legal
documentation and bearing the

39:33.938 --> 39:37.342
stigma of being a refugee. The
proud protector of his family,
Mohamed had to think quickly

39:37.342 --> 39:39.577
on his feet.

39:39.577 --> 39:43.014
MOHAMED DARBI (through
translator): I was afraid that,
if anything should happen, they

39:43.014 --> 39:47.685
would send me back to Syria. So
I decided to register with the
UNHCR to protect myself

39:47.685 --> 39:51.956
and my children. I didn't waste
any time. I was one of the first
people who registered

39:51.956 --> 39:55.760
as a Syrian refugee. And on
that basis, they chose us.

39:55.760 --> 39:59.130
MARCIA BIGGS: Two-and-a-half
years later, they arrived here
in New Jersey, where they

39:59.130 --> 40:02.533
have been living with the help
of the U.S. government and
Church World Service, one of

40:02.533 --> 40:06.404
nine NGOs that helps
with refugee settlement.

40:06.404 --> 40:09.073
Tell me how you prepare for the
arrival of these families.

40:09.073 --> 40:12.277
MAHMOUD MAHMOUD, Church World
Service: Well, we find the
apartment. We pay for the
security

40:12.277 --> 40:17.548
deposit and first month's rent.
We move furniture into the
apartment, do the apartment
setup,

40:17.548 --> 40:21.119
buy groceries, put it into the
refrigerator so that they have
food to eat. And we actually

40:21.119 --> 40:24.122
go ourselves to pick up the
families from the airport for
the first time, and we're

40:24.122 --> 40:26.958
the first faces that
they see upon arrival.

40:26.958 --> 40:30.361
MARCIA BIGGS: So, what kind of
government assistance do they
receive and for how long?

40:30.361 --> 40:35.166
MAHMOUD MAHMOUD: The social
services assist them with
Medicaid, so that they have
health

40:35.166 --> 40:39.437
care if they need to go to the
doctor for any reason up until
eight months. They receive

40:39.437 --> 40:44.075
food stamps and they receive
a bit of cash assistance.

40:44.075 --> 40:46.744
MARCIA BIGGS: What
is required of them?

40:46.744 --> 40:51.082
MAHMOUD MAHMOUD: They must
attend ESL courses for at least
35 hours a week and they must

40:51.082 --> 40:54.619
show that they're trying to
find jobs themselves as well.

40:54.619 --> 40:58.389
MARCIA BIGGS: None of the family
speaks English. Mohamed and
Amira are enrolled in language

40:58.389 --> 41:02.827
classes. And CWS is trying
to Mohamed find a job.

41:02.827 --> 41:06.698
I'm sure it's not been an easy
transition. It's a very
different life here. What's been

41:06.698 --> 41:09.300
the most difficult part?

41:09.300 --> 41:13.037
MOHAMED DARBI (through
translator): When I first
arrived, I immediately felt that
I want

41:13.037 --> 41:17.575
to go back. The people are not
my people. I don't know how to
speak, I don't know how

41:17.575 --> 41:21.045
to walk, I don't know how to do
anything. It was strange. I was
lost. My children, how

41:21.045 --> 41:24.649
am I going to register them?
How am I going to work?

41:24.649 --> 41:27.719
I felt I wanted to go back, I
don't want to stay here. But
then everything falls into

41:27.719 --> 41:30.288
place and people blend in.

41:30.288 --> 41:32.824
AMIRA DARBI (through
translator): The language is
difficult. We're suffering with
language,

41:32.824 --> 41:36.794
but, God willing, we will learn
and we will stand on our own two
feet.

41:36.794 --> 41:39.931
MARCIA BIGGS: What's
been the best part?

41:39.931 --> 41:42.800
MOHAMED DARBI (through
translator): The best part about
it for me is that I can move
around

41:42.800 --> 41:48.072
freely. There's no sense of
imprisonment. I take the kids
around.

41:48.072 --> 41:53.044
The kids were stripped away from
going to parks, to rivers, to
the malls, to go shopping.

41:53.044 --> 41:57.048
And now they're back to school
and life came back to them. For
me, that was the best thing,

41:57.048 --> 42:02.353
when I saw that their future
came back to them. To me, that's
worth the entire world.

42:02.353 --> 42:05.156
MARCIA BIGGS: What's touched you
the most about these Syrian
families?

42:05.156 --> 42:10.595
MAHMOUD MAHMOUD: I believe it's
their drive to continue despite
what they have been through.

42:10.595 --> 42:15.400
Their work ethic is really
tremendous. They want to be
here. They want to be productive

42:15.400 --> 42:19.637
and active individuals
in the community.

42:19.637 --> 42:23.641
MARCIA BIGGS: All the children
are enrolled in school now,
5-year-old Shakad (ph) for

42:23.641 --> 42:28.946
the first time, 12-year-old
Hajar (ph) and 13-year-old
Nabiha (ph) with the help of an

42:28.946 --> 42:33.217
interpreter. Hajar and Nabiha
say their favorite part about
being in the U.S. is finally
feeling

42:33.217 --> 42:35.686
like they belong.

42:35.686 --> 42:44.595
What is the best thing about
school today? Math. You like
math? Science? And what do

42:44.595 --> 42:46.397
you want to be when you grow up?

42:46.397 --> 42:48.800
GIRL: A doctor.

42:48.800 --> 42:56.774
MARCIA BIGGS: You want to be a
doctor? You want to be an
engineer?

42:56.774 --> 43:00.244
GIRL (through translator): In
Jordan, they used to tell us,
you're Syrian. Go away from

43:00.244 --> 43:04.649
us. Don't talk to us. And they
separated the Jordanians and
Syrians at school. Why did

43:04.649 --> 43:08.352
that have to be? Aren't we all
human beings? Aren't we all one?

43:08.352 --> 43:13.224
MARCIA BIGGS: What is
school like for you here?

43:13.224 --> 43:18.696
GIRL (through translator): You
feel like you are the same, not
like in Jordan. We're all

43:18.696 --> 43:23.134
one and the same at school. For
example, the teacher doesn't get
upset with you because

43:23.134 --> 43:26.337
you're Syrian. She doesn't shout
at you bays you're Syrian. She
treats us like everyone

43:26.337 --> 43:28.906
else in class.

43:28.906 --> 43:32.243
MARCIA BIGGS: How did it feel to
put your kids on the school bus
for the first day of

43:32.243 --> 43:35.146
school here in the
United States?

43:35.146 --> 43:38.483
MOHAMED DARBI (through
translator): Of course, when I
see my children going to school,
and

43:38.483 --> 43:42.520
they're going to build their
future, I'm going to be the
happiest.

43:42.520 --> 43:47.959
For me, I see no future. I'm 42
years old. I will barely make a
living and provide for

43:47.959 --> 43:53.898
them a decent life. The future
is theirs. When they came back
from school yesterday,

43:53.898 --> 43:59.403
I asked them, "How was your
day?" They said: "We were really
happy. We had such a fun day."

43:59.403 --> 44:02.840
For me, that's beautiful.

44:02.840 --> 44:09.146
MARCIA BIGGS: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm Marcia Biggs in
Jersey City, New Jersey.

44:09.146 --> 44:13.217
GWEN IFILL: Now we return to the
root of what's forced millions
from their homes: the conflict

44:13.217 --> 44:16.053
in Syria.

44:16.053 --> 44:22.293
With multiple factions and
common enemies in play, the war
has become even more
complicated,

44:22.293 --> 44:27.031
as Russia now steps up its
support for Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad by moving
additional

44:27.031 --> 44:33.271
military men and weaponry into
Syria and expanding its base
there.

44:33.271 --> 44:36.641
Meanwhile, Moscow is calling for
greater coordination with the
U.S. to fight a common enemy:
the

44:36.641 --> 44:39.877
Islamic State group.

44:39.877 --> 44:42.246
Joining me now to help us sort
through some of this latest
tangle is chief foreign affairs

44:42.246 --> 44:45.349
correspondent Margaret Warner.

44:45.349 --> 44:48.419
So, Margaret, where does this
proposal or this talk about
having joint U.S.-Russia talks

44:48.419 --> 44:50.988
stand tonight?

44:50.988 --> 44:53.291
MARGARET WARNER: Well, Gwen,
even though there's been no
official announcement, in fact,
you

44:53.291 --> 44:57.461
could say the
military-to-military talks have
ray begun.

44:57.461 --> 45:03.501
Last Friday, Secretary of
Defense Ash Carter had a
conversation 50 minutes with his
counterpart,

45:03.501 --> 45:08.573
and this had been 18 months in
which the Obama administration
had cut off all contacts after

45:08.573 --> 45:13.244
Russia seized Ukraine or
certainly seized Crimea.

45:13.244 --> 45:19.216
So the question they're trying
to figure out, OK, publicly,
they're saying, the U.S. is

45:19.216 --> 45:22.954
saying, well, these are
deconfliction talks. Make sure
that our planes don't interfere

45:22.954 --> 45:26.257
with each other and we
don't have an accident.

45:26.257 --> 45:31.829
That is part of it. But really
what they want to know is, what
is Assad's intention here?

45:31.829 --> 45:36.801
And is it to prop up the Assad
government? I'm sorry --
Russian's intentions are to prop

45:36.801 --> 45:40.404
up the Assad government, or in
fact is it just to fight ISIS,
which is what Kerry had

45:40.404 --> 45:42.840
been told by Lavrov?

45:42.840 --> 45:47.578
GWEN IFILL: Now, is this just
old Cold War suspension, or do
we have reason to be worried

45:47.578 --> 45:51.716
that this is more than
what Russia says it is?

45:51.716 --> 45:53.985
MARGARET WARNER: Oh, well,
that's exactly -- and the
administration will admit this

45:53.985 --> 45:58.856
-- they do not want to be gamed,
as several said to me, the way
they were in Ukraine,

45:58.856 --> 46:05.463
where President Putin and
Foreign Minister Lavrov, Sergei
Lavrov, consistently, in the

46:05.463 --> 46:10.668
U.S. view, lied, not only to
them on the phone, face to face,
but lied to the world about

46:10.668 --> 46:14.071
whether they were in Ukraine and
what they were doing in Ukraine.

46:14.071 --> 46:19.143
And so this time, they didn't
want to be sucked into that.
They also want to make sure, you

46:19.143 --> 46:26.517
know, if his intention is to
help Assad fight ISIS and they
adopt Assad's view, which is

46:26.517 --> 46:30.655
everybody opposed to me is a
terrorist, well, the U.S.
doesn't want to get sucked into
that

46:30.655 --> 46:33.391
kind of endeavor or that
kind of partnership.

46:33.391 --> 46:37.461
GWEN IFILL: I can understand
that, but I just don't see --
how do face-to-face talks mean

46:37.461 --> 46:40.531
that they will tell the truth or
that they will get the truth?

46:40.531 --> 46:43.801
MARGARET WARNER: Excellent
point, Gwen, because Kerry has
already had three conversations

46:43.801 --> 46:48.039
with Lavrov.

46:48.039 --> 46:52.710
Based on what happened in
Ukraine, there is no guarantee
they will be told the truth.

46:52.710 --> 46:58.849
And the interventions with
Lavrov on the phone have, so
far, not slowed the Russian
advance

46:58.849 --> 47:03.387
of weapons and materiel and
men into Syria at all.

47:03.387 --> 47:07.324
GWEN IFILL: Is there any worry
or concern that part of the deal
if Lavrov were to talk

47:07.324 --> 47:09.527
to Kerry or Putin would
talk to president...

47:09.527 --> 47:11.262
MARGARET WARNER: Again, which
might happen next week.

47:11.262 --> 47:13.297
GWEN IFILL: Which might
happen next week in New York.

47:13.297 --> 47:16.867
Is there any concern that the
tradeoff might be keeping Assad
in power?

47:16.867 --> 47:19.437
MARGARET WARNER: Oh, yes.

47:19.437 --> 47:26.143
And, in fact, in London just
this weekend, Secretary Kerry
said, well, essentially, that

47:26.143 --> 47:32.917
Assad could be part of the
transition. Now, when you ask
why the turnaround,
administration

47:32.917 --> 47:37.421
officials tell me there is no
turnaround. If you were at the
Geneva Syria peace talks

47:37.421 --> 47:43.194
18 months ago, as I was, or you
read the clips, which I read
again today, Kerry's tone was

47:43.194 --> 47:47.264
absolutely hard and fast. There
is no role for President Assad
even in this transition

47:47.264 --> 47:49.567
phase.

47:49.567 --> 47:52.536
Yesterday or this weekend, Kerry
said, well, we're not obdurate
about that as to time and

47:52.536 --> 47:53.571
place.

47:53.571 --> 47:55.573
GWEN IFILL: And why the change?
So there was a change, but why?

47:55.573 --> 48:01.011
MARGARET WARNER: Oh, there's
definitely a change, because --
for two reasons.

48:01.011 --> 48:05.282
One, there is an urgency to get
something going on the political
process. And that's

48:05.282 --> 48:09.420
what Kerry is hoping, is that
this invitation to talk about
military-to-military will open

48:09.420 --> 48:15.426
up an opportunity and that we
could cooperate with the
Russians on that, as we did on
Iran.

48:15.426 --> 48:22.299
So, one, it's the E.U. The
European migrant crisis is
driving it, and, two, a growing

48:22.299 --> 48:28.272
concern that in fact Assad and
everybody other than ISIS is
losing control completely of

48:28.272 --> 48:32.076
Northern Syria, and that the
thing is just getting completely
out of hand.

48:32.076 --> 48:35.646
GWEN IFILL: For the record, what
is it that Russia says it is
actually -- they say that

48:35.646 --> 48:37.982
they're actually doing?

48:37.982 --> 48:40.751
MARGARET WARNER: They say they
are there -- they have always
had a base in Syria. This is not

48:40.751 --> 48:42.620
new. And they...

48:42.620 --> 48:43.654
GWEN IFILL: Advisers,
not military.

48:43.654 --> 48:44.155
MARGARET WARNER: Well...

48:44.155 --> 48:45.523
GWEN IFILL: Well, who knows.

48:45.523 --> 48:48.993
MARGARET WARNER: I don't know. I
don't know the details of that.

48:48.993 --> 48:53.230
But this is totally different.
The base is being expanded.
There were reports by Reuters,

48:53.230 --> 48:57.568
which no one would confirm to
me, that Russia is already
flying surveillance drones over

48:57.568 --> 49:04.408
Syria. So what they want to make
sure doesn't happen is that
essentially Assad gets this

49:04.408 --> 49:09.513
tremendous help from the
Russians and turns around and
uses it against his own
citizens,

49:09.513 --> 49:13.017
barrel-bombing them,
as Assad is doing now.

49:13.017 --> 49:17.021
GWEN IFILL: It sounds almost --
and tell me if this is too
simplistic -- like a pool game,

49:17.021 --> 49:22.293
that, on one hand, the migrant
crisis is pushing them toward
Russia, but they're afraid that

49:22.293 --> 49:26.096
Russia may have a bank shot
which takes them back toward
Assad. Does that make any sense?

49:26.096 --> 49:27.832
MARGARET WARNER: I couldn't have
said it better. I couldn't have
said it better. That's exactly

49:27.832 --> 49:29.633
it.

49:29.633 --> 49:33.103
And, as you say, the track
record is such that there's no
reason for President Obama

49:33.103 --> 49:35.272
to believe President
Putin anyway.

49:35.272 --> 49:38.309
GWEN IFILL: So, who holds the
cue, just following through on
that?

49:38.309 --> 49:42.446
MARGARET WARNER: I don't know.
Probably Putin, as he manages to
do.

49:42.446 --> 49:45.616
Obviously, he's trying to get
out of the deep freeze he's been
in with the rest of the world

49:45.616 --> 49:51.155
over Ukraine. And the U.S.
doesn't really want to be an
enabler to that. At the same

49:51.155 --> 49:55.492
time, they want to learn more
about the military operations.

49:55.492 --> 50:00.664
So, the administration, it
strikes me, is a little bit
caught. And then you also always

50:00.664 --> 50:04.735
have Secretary Kerry, who,
having completed the Iran deal,
some people say may be just

50:04.735 --> 50:07.972
looking for another great
negotiation he can get going.

50:07.972 --> 50:11.375
GWEN IFILL: Well, there's plenty
out there left to be done, but
one last thing.

50:11.375 --> 50:15.112
So, next week is the United
Nations General Assembly. This
is where any meeting between

50:15.112 --> 50:16.447
the president and President
Putin would likely occur.

50:16.447 --> 50:17.915
MARGARET WARNER: Yes.

50:17.915 --> 50:21.218
GWEN IFILL: Where does that
stand, an actual face-to-face of
leaders?

50:21.218 --> 50:24.221
MARGARET WARNER: There is still
-- there is debate and
discussion in the White House
over

50:24.221 --> 50:26.523
this, I'm told.

50:26.523 --> 50:33.397
It is very much in the air.
Kerry and Lavrov will obviously
talk, probably extensively

50:33.397 --> 50:38.469
and several times, in a
bilateral, just the two of them.
So, I wouldn't be a bit
surprised

50:38.469 --> 50:41.171
if Presidents Obama and
Putin were to meet.

50:41.171 --> 50:43.173
GWEN IFILL: And there will be a
pool cue in the corner waiting.

50:43.173 --> 50:44.041
(CROSSTALK)

50:44.041 --> 50:45.776
MARGARET WARNER: Yes.

50:45.776 --> 50:46.544
(CROSSTALK)

50:46.544 --> 50:49.580
GWEN IFILL: ... fix it up.

50:49.580 --> 50:50.848
(LAUGHTER)

50:50.848 --> 50:55.452
GWEN IFILL: Margaret Warner,
thank you very much.

50:55.452 --> 50:59.323
MARGARET WARNER: Thanks, Gwen.

50:59.323 --> 51:04.228
GWEN IFILL: Before we go
tonight: This weekend, I
traveled to Charleston, South
Carolina,

51:04.228 --> 51:09.133
to the Circular Congregational
Church for a town hall meeting
on race.

51:09.133 --> 51:14.338
We were just blocks away from
Emanuel AME Church, where nine
black worshipers attending

51:14.338 --> 51:19.476
Bible study were gunned down in
June. We spoke with local
residents and national experts

51:19.476 --> 51:23.213
and activists about Greece,
recovery, the Confederate Flag,
and whether black lives

51:23.213 --> 51:25.883
matter.

51:25.883 --> 51:31.622
In a "PBS NewsHour"/Marist poll
conducted last week before the
town hall, we found widespread

51:31.622 --> 51:37.361
agreement about the scope of the
problem; 60 percent of whites
and 56 percent of blacks

51:37.361 --> 51:43.300
say race relations have gotten
worse in the past year. But when
we asked if African-Americans

51:43.300 --> 51:48.372
and whites have the same job
opportunities, for example, 76
percent of black respondents

51:48.372 --> 51:54.211
said, no, they don't, while 52
percent of whites said, yes,
they do.

51:54.211 --> 51:58.983
And when we asked whether the
police treat blacks and whites
equally, 8 percent of
African-Americans

51:58.983 --> 52:03.754
said yes, compared to
42 percent of whites.

52:03.754 --> 52:09.259
At the town hall, I asked Umi
Selah, who founded a called the
Dream Defenders after Trayvon

52:09.259 --> 52:14.131
Martin was killed in Florida in
2012, whether anything has
changed.

52:14.131 --> 52:18.502
UMI SELAH, Dream Defenders: What
we have learned in the past year
is not that black lives matter,

52:18.502 --> 52:21.638
but black deaths matter. That's
the only time people wake up.
That's the only time people

52:21.638 --> 52:23.841
react.

52:23.841 --> 52:28.345
But, in South Carolina and
around the country, if the
politicians who are touting that
black

52:28.345 --> 52:33.317
lives matter really care, there
would be health care for black
families, so they could provide

52:33.317 --> 52:37.788
for better qualities of living.
There would be quality education
in the schools, if you

52:37.788 --> 52:41.025
really cared about black lives.
There wouldn't be mass
incarceration if you really
cared

52:41.025 --> 52:43.794
about black lives.

52:43.794 --> 52:48.565
GWEN IFILL: You can watch
"America After Charleston" in
full tonight at 9:00 p.m.
Eastern on most

52:48.565 --> 52:53.237
PBS stations. It will also be
streaming live on our home page.

52:53.237 --> 52:57.374
You can also find all of our
coverage on the pope's visit to
the u.s there, including a

52:57.374 --> 53:02.179
week of essays on faith and
religion. Today's contribution
is from a modern orthodox rabbi

53:02.179 --> 53:05.983
who says the pope inspires him.

53:05.983 --> 53:11.422
And a new study reveals doctors
are prescribing drugs that
reduce cholesterol to the
elderly

53:11.422 --> 53:16.560
at higher rates than ever
before. The catch? There is
little research showing that
benefits

53:16.560 --> 53:20.764
outweigh the risks of taking
these drugs. We have a report
from partners at Kaiser Health

53:20.764 --> 53:26.904
News. All that and more is on
our Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:26.904 --> 53:30.274
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm Gwen Ifill.

53:30.274 --> 53:33.610
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening. For all of us
here at the "PBS NewsHour,"

53:33.610 --> 53:34.445
thank you, and good night.
