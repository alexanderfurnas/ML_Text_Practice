JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.806 --> 00:06.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.807 --> 00:08.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:08.141 --> 00:10.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we look forward to having
her back as
soon as possible.

00:10.811 --> 00:15.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: It's
the last full
week of the presidential race.

00:15.048 --> 00:20.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We talk with supporters at
Clinton and Trump
at campaign rallies at opposite
ends of the

00:20.287 --> 00:21.989 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRISTEN WOODY, Hillary Clinton
Supporter:
Hillary Clinton is
well-qualified to serve

00:23.724 --> 00:25.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our country, and she needs to be
the president.

00:25.659 --> 00:29.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRYSTAL HOWARD, Donald Trump
Supporter: I
hope that he secures our borders
and hopefully

00:29.429 --> 00:31.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
takes care of our economy.

00:31.265 --> 00:35.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Monday: Critics
and defenders of FBI Director
James Comey

00:35.903 --> 00:41.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speak up, as his bombshell
announcement on
Hillary Clinton's e-mails
ripples through

00:41.508 --> 00:43.543 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the campaign.

00:43.577 --> 00:50.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And striving for peace amid 50
years of war:
where Colombia stands after a
rejected peace

00:50.384 --> 00:53.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deal brings FARC rebels back to
the negotiating
table.

00:53.954 --> 00:58.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS, Colombian
President: I
am absolutely determined to not
allow the

00:58.325 --> 01:00.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country to go back to war with
FARC.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The FARC doesn't want it.

01:02.229 --> 01:03.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We don't want it.

01:03.497 --> 01:11.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:11.071 --> 01:13.941 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:13.974 --> 01:23.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For Donald Trump
and Hillary
Clinton, it's the start of the
last full week

01:23.650 --> 01:25.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of presidential campaigning.

01:25.519 --> 01:30.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with just eight days to go
until Election
Day, the contest has been
injected with new

01:30.324 --> 01:31.892 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
uncertainty.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage.

01:33.794 --> 01:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: With Election Day
just around the
corner, the hot topic on the
campaign today

01:40.033 --> 01:45.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was something that's dogged the
Democratic
nominee for nearly two years,
her use of a

01:45.672 --> 01:48.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
private e-mail server as
secretary of state.

01:48.842 --> 01:51.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Now they apparently they want to
look at e-mails

01:51.812 --> 01:56.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of one of my staffers, and, by
all means,
they should look at them.

01:56.316 --> 02:02.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I am sure they will reach
the same conclusion
they did when they looked at my
e-mails for

02:02.956 --> 02:05.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the last year: There is no case
here!

02:05.125 --> 02:06.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:06.560 --> 02:09.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Hillary is not the victim.

02:09.629 --> 02:16.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The American people are the
victim of this
corrupt system in every way.

02:16.236 --> 02:20.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is your one chance
right now, November
8, to change it.

02:20.207 --> 02:25.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The FBI is scouring
hundreds of
thousands of newly discovered
e-mails to see

02:25.612 --> 02:31.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if any of them are relevant to
its investigation
of how she handled classified
information.

02:31.385 --> 02:36.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The e-mails were discovered on
the computer
of Anthony Weiner, the disgraced
former congressman

02:36.123 --> 02:42.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from New York who's under
investigation for
allegedly sending sexual
messages to a 15-year-old

02:42.362 --> 02:44.297 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
girl.

02:44.331 --> 02:49.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's the estranged husband of
Huma Abedin,
one of Clinton's closest aides,
who was conspicuously

02:49.436 --> 02:52.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
absent today from Clinton's
campaign plane.

02:52.873 --> 02:59.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, criticism continues
to build over
FBI Director James Comey's
decision to tell

02:59.479 --> 03:03.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congress of the new e-mails
before they were
evaluated.

03:03.450 --> 03:07.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former Attorney General Eric
Holder wrote
in today's Washington Post that:
"While Comey

03:07.988 --> 03:14.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a man of integrity and honor,
he committed
a serious error with potentially
severe implications."

03:14.661 --> 03:16.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
Director Comey is a man of
integrity.

03:16.596 --> 03:18.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's a man of principle.

03:18.131 --> 03:21.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The issue also
dominated the day's
White House news briefing.

03:21.668 --> 03:25.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST: The president
doesn't believe
that Director Comey is
intentionally trying

03:25.672 --> 03:27.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to influence the outcome of an
election.

03:27.674 --> 03:32.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm just not going to be in a
position to,
frankly, either defend or
criticize decisions

03:32.646 --> 03:36.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he's made with regard to
what to communicate
in public.

03:36.750 --> 03:42.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Meanwhile, CNN said
it had cut
ties with Donna Brazile, interim
chair of

03:42.122 --> 03:44.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Democratic National
Committee.

03:44.191 --> 03:50.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That followed today's WikiLeaks
release of
another batch of hacked Clinton
campaign e-mails.

03:50.263 --> 03:55.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of them was from Brazile,
then a CNN analyst,
the day before the network
hosted a debate

03:55.202 --> 03:59.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between Clinton and Bernie
Sanders in Flint,
Michigan.

03:59.172 --> 04:03.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She told campaign officials the
details of
one of the questions Clinton was
asked at

04:03.910 --> 04:07.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the event about the city's
tainted water crisis.

04:07.280 --> 04:12.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the second time hacked
e-mails showed
Brazile tipping the Clinton camp
to debate

04:12.119 --> 04:13.887 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
questions.

04:13.920 --> 04:18.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CNN said it is completely
uncomfortable with
her interactions with the
campaign while a

04:18.091 --> 04:19.860 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
network analyst.

04:19.893 --> 04:23.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the candidates were in
key battleground
states.

04:23.897 --> 04:27.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton was in Ohio, where polls
show a tight
race.

04:27.567 --> 04:32.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump was next door in Michigan,
trying to
gain ground in a state that
hasn't voted for

04:32.272 --> 04:38.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Republican presidential
candidate since
1988, and where current polls
show him behind.

04:38.445 --> 04:41.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

04:41.815 --> 04:46.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: Iraqi
troops fought their way inside
the city limits

04:46.586 --> 04:49.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Mosul, two weeks after their
offensive
began.

04:49.923 --> 04:55.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They advanced after seizing the
last village
held by Islamic State fighters
on the city's

04:55.061 --> 04:56.563 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
eastern edge.

04:56.596 --> 05:00.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special forces are using armored
vehicles
and tanks to make headway.

05:00.600 --> 05:05.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're backed by artillery and
airstrikes
targeting is positions.

05:05.705 --> 05:11.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lebanon finally has a new
president, after
the top post sat vacant for two
years during

05:11.278 --> 05:12.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a political crisis.

05:12.712 --> 05:15.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Parliament today elected
Michel Aoun.

05:15.582 --> 05:21.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's 81 years old, and a strong
ally of the
Islamist militant group
Hezbollah.

05:21.221 --> 05:26.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The election took several rounds
of voting,
after extra ballots suspiciously
appeared

05:26.259 --> 05:28.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the ballot box for the first
few counts.

05:28.995 --> 05:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Aoun's win is a victory for
pro-Iranian forces
in the region.

05:33.733 --> 05:38.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey has opened another phase
of the crackdown
that began after last summer's
failed coup.

05:38.972 --> 05:45.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, police arrested the chief
editor and
11 senior staff of a major
opposition newspaper.

05:45.946 --> 05:50.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Supporters rallied outside the
newspaper offices,
one of the oldest in Turkey.

05:50.684 --> 05:54.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A cartoonist for the paper
condemned the attempts
to silence journalists.

05:54.721 --> 05:58.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MUSA KART, Cartoonist (through
translator):
This is ridiculous.

05:58.525 --> 06:01.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You will not intimidate anyone
by putting
pressure.

06:01.328 --> 06:02.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I want to say that.

06:02.896 --> 06:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is impossible for people with
conscience
to endorse this scene.

06:06.499 --> 06:08.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You cannot justify this to the
world.

06:08.668 --> 06:14.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, I am being detained for
drawing cartoons,
and only for drawing cartoons.

06:14.107 --> 06:18.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just yesterday,
another 10,000
people were fired from their
government jobs

06:18.945 --> 06:20.113 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Turkey.

06:20.146 --> 06:24.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 100,000 have been
dismissed since
the coup.

06:24.251 --> 06:29.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police in Pakistan arrested
1,500 protesters
overnight in a bid to silence
critics of the

06:29.956 --> 06:32.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country's embattled prime
minister.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The effort continued today.

06:34.227 --> 06:41.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police used tear gas and batons
against followers
of opposition leader Imran Khan
outside Islamabad,

06:41.134 --> 06:42.902 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the capital.

06:42.936 --> 06:48.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The protesters are demanding
Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif step down, amid
allegations of

06:48.108 --> 06:49.943 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
corruption.

06:49.976 --> 06:55.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Swedish diplomat who saved
at least 20,000
Hungarian Jews from the
Holocaust has finally

06:55.515 --> 06:57.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
been pronounced dead.

06:57.117 --> 07:02.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Raoul Wallenberg was arrested by
the Soviets
as World War II ended.

07:02.055 --> 07:05.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Later, they said he died of a
heart attack
in 1947.

07:05.792 --> 07:12.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Sweden continued to list
Wallenberg as missing,
but has now formally classified
him as deceased.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Wall Street, it was a
quiet start to
the week.

07:15.201 --> 07:21.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost just
over 18 points to close at
18142.

07:21.808 --> 07:26.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell one point, and
the S&amp;P 500
dropped a fraction of a point.

07:26.379 --> 07:32.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the FBI director
earning both criticism and
praise for his

07:32.085 --> 07:38.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
handling of the Clinton e-mail
case; and how
that news is playing out on the
campaign trail;

07:38.425 --> 07:48.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plus, best friends who dreamed
of making a
zombie movie unexpectedly rise
to fame.

07:48.468 --> 07:56.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plus, best friends who dreamed
of making a
zombie movie unexpectedly rise
to fame.

07:56.176 --> 08:01.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more now on the FBI's
investigation into
the newly discovered e-mails
which may be

08:01.614 --> 08:06.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
related to Hillary Clinton's
e-mail server,
we turn to New York Times
reporter Michael

08:06.386 --> 08:10.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Schmidt and Politico reporter
Josh Gerstein.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the "NewsHour."

08:12.225 --> 08:13.960 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Josh Gerstein, to you first.

08:13.993 --> 08:17.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We know that, late this
afternoon, there was
a letter sent by the Department
of Justice

08:17.564 --> 08:19.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to congressional committee
chairs.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tell us what was in the letter.

08:21.534 --> 08:22.736 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Why was it sent?

08:22.769 --> 08:24.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSH GERSTEIN, Politico: Well,
it didn't say
very much.

08:24.537 --> 08:29.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was basically responding to
Democratic
complaints that what Comey did,
FBI Director

08:29.642 --> 08:34.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Comey did, on Friday, notifying
that they
had essentially reactivated this
Clinton e-mail

08:34.614 --> 08:39.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investigation, had a lot of
spawned speculation
and had a political impact.

08:39.552 --> 08:44.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they wanted more details on
if this complied
with Justice Department policy
and what's

08:44.391 --> 08:45.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going on in the investigation.

08:45.992 --> 08:50.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were only really like two
substantive
sentences in this letter.

08:50.864 --> 08:56.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of them said that they're
working on getting
this investigation done as
expeditiously as

08:56.336 --> 08:58.104 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
possible.

08:58.138 --> 09:01.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the other one really didn't
address this
issue of whether Comey might
have violated

09:01.908 --> 09:03.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Justice Department policy.

09:03.476 --> 09:07.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It just simply said the
department appreciated
the lawmakers' concerns.

09:07.747 --> 09:11.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know from our other reporting
that Attorney
General Loretta Lynch and Deputy
Attorney

09:11.818 --> 09:16.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
General Sally Yates strongly
advised Comey
against sending the letter, but
he felt he

09:16.289 --> 09:17.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
needed to, so he did it anyway.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let me turn to you, Michael
Schmidt.

09:21.828 --> 09:27.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How is the Justice Department,
how is the
FBI handling this cache of
hundreds of thousands

09:27.600 --> 09:29.335 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of e-mails?

09:29.369 --> 09:30.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL SCHMIDT, The New York
Times: What
they're doing is, they're
putting it in a

09:30.937 --> 09:34.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
computer program to allows them
to see whether
there's duplicates.

09:34.774 --> 09:38.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the real question here,
whether any
of the e-mails they're in
possession of are

09:38.578 --> 09:43.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ones they had before that they
know are classified
or they know they looked at or
if these are

09:43.783 --> 09:45.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
entirely a new batch.

09:45.585 --> 09:49.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it's a new batch, this could
be a very
time-consuming process, because
the FBI would

09:49.989 --> 09:55.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then have to take those e-mails
and send them
out to other government agencies
and departments,

09:55.295 --> 09:58.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where the information could have
originated
from to see if they're
classified.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How is that
going?

10:01.134 --> 10:02.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do we know how fast it's going?

10:02.535 --> 10:03.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL SCHMIDT: Well...

10:03.536 --> 10:05.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is this a
laborious -- go ahead.

10:05.538 --> 10:09.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL SCHMIDT: The process of
figuring out
the duplicates isn't hard.

10:09.075 --> 10:11.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The computer program can do that
pretty quickly.

10:11.444 --> 10:18.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they may have an idea even
right now or
even by tomorrow about sort of
the universe

10:18.551 --> 10:20.220 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of these.

10:20.253 --> 10:22.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's hundreds of thousands of
e-mails,
but the computer will be able to
quickly weed

10:22.622 --> 10:24.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out which ones are new.

10:24.357 --> 10:30.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, at that point, they will
sort of have
a sense of, OK, we have dozens,
hundreds,

10:30.129 --> 10:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thousands of new e-mails that we
really need
to dig into.

10:33.299 --> 10:37.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Josh
Gerstein, what is
known about what could be here?

10:37.570 --> 10:43.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're looking for e-mails that
came from
Hillary Clinton's server.

10:43.076 --> 10:47.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there a belief that there is
classified
material here?

10:47.080 --> 10:51.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH GERSTEIN: Well, you know,
the definitions
of classified have proved fairly
malleable

10:51.651 --> 10:53.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in this investigation.

10:53.419 --> 10:57.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it really wouldn't surprise
me if there
are additional copies, as
Michael says, of

10:57.991 --> 10:59.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the same e-mails.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think that would change
much in the
way this investigation went
forward.

11:02.896 --> 11:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, if there are more
e-mails of a
different kind or a different
ilk and then

11:07.000 --> 11:12.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
particularly if there are any
messages on
here that reflect people's
thoughts on this

11:12.138 --> 11:16.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issue, for example, if anyone
talks about,
like, I know this is classified,
but I'm sending

11:16.809 --> 11:19.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it anyway -- it seems very
unlikely anyone
would do that.

11:19.746 --> 11:24.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There wasn't really much
evidence of that
in the first tens of thousands
of e-mails

11:24.417 --> 11:26.219 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that the FBI went through.

11:26.252 --> 11:30.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But any message like that could
be potentially
incriminating for someone who
sent it, if

11:30.823 --> 11:32.525 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that exists.

11:32.559 --> 11:35.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael Schmidt,
is it your
understanding from your
reporting that FBI

11:35.728 --> 11:41.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officials already know what's
here or are
they truly looking for something
unknown?

11:41.100 --> 11:47.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL SCHMIDT: If you look at
Director Comey's
letter to Congress, he basically
says, we

11:47.740 --> 11:50.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
haven't had a chance to look at
these yet.

11:50.376 --> 11:55.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I sort of find it hard to
believe that the
FBI would go with such an
aggressive step

11:55.548 --> 12:00.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of telling Congress without
really having
some idea of what is truly here.

12:00.386 --> 12:05.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If these end up to be just a
bunch of duplicates,
then this will have been a big
hubbub over

12:05.692 --> 12:06.659 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
nothing.

12:06.693 --> 12:09.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I wonder what the FBI really
knows here.

12:09.195 --> 12:11.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And did that lead them to push
as far as they
did?

12:11.564 --> 12:15.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it
certainly raises that
question.

12:15.268 --> 12:20.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Josh Gerstein, I understand you
just recently
heard from Huma Abedin's
attorney.

12:20.740 --> 12:21.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are they saying?

12:21.741 --> 12:23.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is she saying?

12:23.476 --> 12:27.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH GERSTEIN: Well, we reported
on this,
this morning, that Huma Abedin
told colleagues

12:27.547 --> 12:32.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that she was mystified by why
there were any
of her e-mails on this computer.

12:32.852 --> 12:38.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She insisted this is Mr.
Weiner's laptop,
not hers, and she never stored
any e-mails

12:38.324 --> 12:41.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
intentionally on this computer
at any point.

12:41.361 --> 12:45.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so she's not sure exactly
how this all
came to pass.

12:45.465 --> 12:49.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She says she's cooperating with
the FBI, but
that they actually never reached
out to her

12:49.802 --> 12:54.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in connection with this most
recent dramatic
development in the
investigation.

12:54.207 --> 12:57.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was thought maybe that she
would be
asked for her consent to go
through the e-mails.

12:57.543 --> 12:59.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That never happened.

12:59.278 --> 13:03.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The FBI instead ended up getting
a warrant,
perhaps because the laptop does
belong to

13:03.650 --> 13:05.118 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mr. Weiner.

13:05.151 --> 13:07.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He probably wouldn't have
consented to them
going through it further.

13:07.654 --> 13:09.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so they decided to go that
route.

13:09.455 --> 13:13.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she is saying she doesn't
know how her
messages got on to this laptop
in the first

13:13.693 --> 13:15.495 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
place.

13:15.528 --> 13:18.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally,
Michael Schmidt,
the reporting over the weekend
about whether

13:18.564 --> 13:25.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Director Comey acted because of
pressure of
some sort from FBI agents who
felt that he

13:25.238 --> 13:28.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wasn't being tough enough on
Hillary Clinton,
what has your reporting told you
about that?

13:29.008 --> 13:31.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL SCHMIDT: Yes, I find
that hard to
believe.

13:31.244 --> 13:39.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that the line FBI agents
who really
knew what was going on with the
e-mail investigation

13:39.118 --> 13:44.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
understood why Director Comey
came out and
said that the bureau wasn't
recommending charges.

13:44.957 --> 13:48.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think they realized that there
wasn't criminal
intent there.

13:48.361 --> 13:55.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the idea that Director Comey
would do this
facing some insurrection by FBI
agents, I

13:55.134 --> 13:57.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
think, is probably not true.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, we're
going to leave
it there for now.

13:59.639 --> 14:02.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I know both of you continue
to watch this
very closely.

14:02.308 --> 14:04.143 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Michael Schmidt, Josh Gerstein,
we thank you.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL SCHMIDT: Thank you,
Judy.

14:05.244 --> 14:07.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOSH GERSTEIN: Thanks for having
me.

14:07.046 --> 14:10.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now for a
closer look at
Director Comey's decisions and
some of the

14:10.817 --> 14:14.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
behind the scenes at the FBI, we
turn to Peter
Zeidenberg.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's an attorney and partner at
Arent Fox.

14:16.889 --> 14:20.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He spent 17 years at the Justice
Department
as a federal prosecutor.

14:20.960 --> 14:25.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's also joined 100 others in
an open letter
critical of Comey's actions.

14:25.998 --> 14:29.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And Daniel Richman, he's
professor at Columbia
Law School.

14:29.635 --> 14:35.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's a former federal
prosecutor, himself,
and current policy adviser to
Director Comey.

14:35.441 --> 14:38.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

14:38.111 --> 14:40.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Daniel Richman, let me start
with you.

14:40.313 --> 14:45.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we have been discussing,
there is a lot
of criticism being directed at
Director Comey

14:45.351 --> 14:48.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for what he did on Friday.

14:48.187 --> 14:54.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you know about what
motivated him
and whether this was a result of
criticism

14:54.193 --> 14:57.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from the FBI or something else?

14:57.497 --> 15:01.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL RICHMAN, Columbia Law
School: I think
this is less about criticism
from anybody

15:01.534 --> 15:08.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and more about protecting the
credibility
of the organization and of his
own credibility

15:08.107 --> 15:09.876 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Congress.

15:09.909 --> 15:14.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here, we had him having made
statements about
the completion of the
investigation, about

15:14.313 --> 15:17.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the completion of the review of
the e-mails
back in July.

15:17.884 --> 15:23.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of a sudden, he's confronted
with very
little notice with a trove of
e-mails that

15:23.389 --> 15:25.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
appeared to be pertinent.

15:25.391 --> 15:27.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The next step is what to do.

15:27.193 --> 15:33.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think what he figured he
needed to do
immediately is get the
information that he

15:33.633 --> 15:35.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
had these right out.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Was this extraordinary?

15:37.303 --> 15:38.838 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

15:38.871 --> 15:43.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this is at a time when, as
everyone focused
on, there is an election going.

15:43.209 --> 15:46.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The last statement he made was
about the investigation
having been completed.

15:46.746 --> 15:51.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The last thing he wanted was
somewhere down
the line information coming out
that he sat

15:51.984 --> 15:56.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on these e-mails while the
election was -- and
during its final days, and while
Congress

15:56.689 --> 15:58.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was obviously monitoring the
progress.

15:58.591 --> 16:01.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Peter Zeidenberg,
what do you
make of that explanation?

16:01.761 --> 16:11.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER ZEIDENBERG, Former Justice
Department
Official: Well, I think it was
premature.

16:11.838 --> 16:12.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it was premature to
notify Congress
before he had had a chance to
actually examine

16:12.872 --> 16:13.840 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these e-mails.

16:13.873 --> 16:15.341 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so I think it was a mistake.

16:15.374 --> 16:17.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, frankly, I think it was
irresponsible
to do it and drop this bomb.

16:17.844 --> 16:24.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as Josh Gerstein mentioned,
it's very
possible, if not likely, that
all these e-mails

16:24.951 --> 16:26.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have been looked at already.

16:26.719 --> 16:28.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They could all be duplicates.

16:28.588 --> 16:31.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, do you -- are
you saying
you think he was trying to
influence the outcome

16:31.390 --> 16:32.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the presidential race?

16:32.391 --> 16:33.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETER ZEIDENBERG: No, I'm not.

16:33.726 --> 16:37.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm not questioning Mr.
Comey's motives
or his integrity.

16:37.230 --> 16:40.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just think it was a bad
decision.

16:40.333 --> 16:44.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean just on
the spur of
the moment?

16:44.136 --> 16:46.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, how do you explain it?

16:46.072 --> 16:51.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER ZEIDENBERG: I think that,
from the context,
that he was -- Congress put a
lot of pressure

16:51.911 --> 16:58.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on him, and I think he was
concerned about
being viewed as being not
completely forthright.

16:58.417 --> 17:01.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think it would -- and he
was in a difficult
position.

17:02.021 --> 17:05.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the fact is, he's going to
get criticism
either way.

17:05.591 --> 17:11.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if there were criticism
after the fact
of not being forthcoming enough,
I think the

17:11.230 --> 17:16.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
response is, I didn't know what
I had, and
it would have been irresponsible
to make a

17:16.269 --> 17:18.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pronouncement before examining
these e-mails.

17:18.905 --> 17:22.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Daniel Richman,
how do you
explain his decision to do this
against the

17:22.942 --> 17:29.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
advice of both the attorney
general, Loretta
Lynch, the deputy attorney
general?

17:29.882 --> 17:35.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a pretty significant
recommendation
to go against.

17:35.621 --> 17:40.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL RICHMAN: Those are
significant recommendations,
but I should note that had they
wanted him

17:40.426 --> 17:43.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not to do that, they could have
ordered him
not to do that.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They do have hierarchical power
over him.

17:45.865 --> 17:49.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I think it's really
interesting to note
that they didn't.

17:49.035 --> 17:50.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there is a reason why they
didn't.

17:50.569 --> 17:55.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fact is that this is an
extraordinary
place to be already.

17:55.141 --> 18:01.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Yes, there are important
departmental guidelines
that have really good reasons,
but, at the

18:01.881 --> 18:09.188 align:left position:0%,start line:66.67% size:100%
same time, all guidelines are in
the hands
in enforcement and
interpretation and in
application

18:09.221 --> 18:12.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in the highest Justice
Department officials,
of which the director is one.

18:12.992 --> 18:18.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, here you had two officials
who are hierarchically
above him who decided not to
prevent him from

18:19.031 --> 18:21.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
doing it, left it to his
decision.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He made his decision.

18:23.102 --> 18:26.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obviously, reasonable minds can
differ, and
they have differed.

18:26.472 --> 18:32.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But to put him out alone, as
they seem to
have done, and then snipe at him
from the

18:32.078 --> 18:33.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sides, seems to be not very
professional.

18:33.679 --> 18:37.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Peter Zeidenberg,
how do you
comment on that?

18:37.183 --> 18:44.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER ZEIDENBERG: Well, I think,
as I said,
he act on his own, apparently,
against advice.

18:44.824 --> 18:50.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, I think it's, as
I said, surprising,
disappointing and unprecedented.

18:50.329 --> 18:55.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We have been
hearing about
divisions inside the Justice
Department.

18:55.801 --> 19:02.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FBI officials -- there's been
reporting, most
of it anonymous, about FBI
officials critical

19:02.241 --> 19:06.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Director Comey, that he was
perhaps feeling
pressure in that way.

19:06.445 --> 19:08.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We heard the reporters.

19:08.180 --> 19:12.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We heard Michael Schmidt of The
New York Times
say he didn't think that was the
case.

19:12.051 --> 19:16.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you read the atmosphere
inside the
Department of Justice over all
this?

19:16.489 --> 19:20.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER ZEIDENBERG: That would
call for a bit
of speculation on my part.

19:20.226 --> 19:24.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I would say it's unfortunate how
we got here.

19:24.563 --> 19:26.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's a series of events.

19:26.332 --> 19:32.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, you know, President
Clinton getting
on the plane, Bill Clinton
getting on the

19:32.104 --> 19:36.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plane, and then Loretta Lynch
feeling that
she had to recuse herself, and
then handing

19:36.542 --> 19:41.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it over to Jim Comey, who then
felt constrained,
for some reasons, to give this
press conference,

19:41.981 --> 19:44.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which was really incredible,
back in July.

19:45.017 --> 19:48.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then he testified and said,
I will keep
you apprised, to Congress.

19:48.888 --> 19:54.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that was a mistake, to
say, I will
keep you apprised.

19:54.593 --> 19:56.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was premature.

19:56.328 --> 20:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Congress shouldn't be
involved intimately
with an ongoing investigation.

20:00.800 --> 20:04.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly,
Daniel Richman,
back to you.

20:04.470 --> 20:10.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the Clinton campaign and
others pointed
out that there is now new
reporting that Director

20:10.810 --> 20:16.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Comey didn't want it to be known
that the
administration had confirmed
that the Russians

20:16.649 --> 20:20.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were behind the hacking of the
Democratic
National Committee, arguing that
it was too

20:20.986 --> 20:23.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
close to the election, that this
would influence
the election.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is there inconsistency here?

20:25.825 --> 20:30.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL RICHMAN: There is only
inconsistency,
in the sense that there are
really different

20:30.529 --> 20:32.298 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
facts.

20:32.331 --> 20:36.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I certainly don't know all
the facts with
regard to the internal
deliberations with

20:36.168 --> 20:38.904 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
regard to the Russian hacking.

20:38.938 --> 20:44.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, yes, it certainly is the
norm that the
department doesn't confirm or
deny investigations

20:44.143 --> 20:49.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and doesn't confirm or deny the
focus on any
particular party.

20:49.248 --> 20:53.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This goes back, as Mr.
Zeidenberg said, to
what was thought to have been
the need -- and

20:53.752 --> 20:58.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the director decided it
was -- back
in July to make a statement
about there not

20:58.791 --> 21:00.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
being an investigation here.

21:00.726 --> 21:04.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once you make the statement --
or rather that
it was completed -- once you
make that statement,

21:04.897 --> 21:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it does come with an
obligation to
correct it.

21:07.633 --> 21:09.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

21:09.401 --> 21:12.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Peter Zeidenberg, just finally,
the public
watching all this, how much
confidence can

21:12.071 --> 21:17.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have that the Justice
Department in general
is not suffused with politics?

21:17.276 --> 21:23.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER ZEIDENBERG: Well, they --
that really
has been my experience when I
was in the public

21:23.048 --> 21:24.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
integrity section.

21:24.850 --> 21:30.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I believe that still to be
the case that
the career prosecutors are not
political.

21:30.789 --> 21:37.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, unfortunately,
this has gotten
pulled into that, and I think it
will raise

21:37.263 --> 21:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
questions in people's mind
that's unfair and
very unfortunate.

21:40.933 --> 21:44.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Peter Zeidenberg,
Daniel Richman,
we thank you both.

21:44.270 --> 21:46.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DANIEL RICHMAN: Thank you.

21:46.539 --> 21:54.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Even before this
FBI news broke
last Friday, I wanted to go out
on the campaign

21:54.547 --> 21:59.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
trail myself on this
next-to-the-last weekend
before Election Day to see both
candidates

21:59.718 --> 22:02.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up close, and talk directly to
voters.

22:02.388 --> 22:06.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I headed first to a Clinton
event in Daytona
Beach, Florida.

22:06.759 --> 22:12.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Twenty-four hours after FBI
Director Comey's
letter jolted the race for
president, these

22:12.565 --> 22:17.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Florida voters waiting to see
Hillary Clinton
said they were not deterred by
the news.

22:17.903 --> 22:19.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It doesn't bother you?

22:19.305 --> 22:20.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA PEREZ, Hillary Clinton
Supporter: No,
she has nothing to hide.

22:20.372 --> 22:23.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If she had, she -- no, she
doesn't.

22:23.709 --> 22:25.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do you want Trump as our
president?

22:25.578 --> 22:26.545 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Really?

22:26.579 --> 22:28.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I mean, think about it.

22:28.380 --> 22:30.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You got to weigh the pros and
the cons.

22:30.149 --> 22:34.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In fact, Lisa
Perez and her
friend Barbara Ballach sounded
protective

22:34.486 --> 22:35.821 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Clinton.

22:35.854 --> 22:38.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARBARA BALLACH, Hillary Clinton
Supporter:
She has nothing to hide.

22:38.724 --> 22:43.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As soon as it gets exposed,
people can put
it to rest.

22:43.329 --> 22:44.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm not worried about her
e-mails.

22:44.597 --> 22:47.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm more worried about the
issues.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.069 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Like what?

22:50.102 --> 22:51.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
For example, what?

22:51.103 --> 22:52.071 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What issues?

22:52.104 --> 22:53.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BARBARA BALLACH: Our economy.

22:53.906 --> 23:00.746 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I feel real strong about
immigration, and
what Trump is threatening to do.

23:00.779 --> 23:01.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's going to build a wall.

23:01.981 --> 23:05.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's going to ship people home
and break up
families.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's going to shame the Statue
of Liberty.

23:07.119 --> 23:08.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA PEREZ: Right.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's going to bring us down.

23:09.121 --> 23:10.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's going to make this economy
worse.

23:10.856 --> 23:13.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He is going to divide us.

23:13.292 --> 23:16.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Charles Ferguson
is a registered
Republican.

23:17.029 --> 23:18.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Did you consider Donald Trump?

23:18.597 --> 23:21.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLES FERGUSON, Hillary
Clinton Supporter:
Absolutely not.

23:22.001 --> 23:26.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think Donald Trump would be a
disaster for
this country.

23:26.138 --> 23:33.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I really think that it would be
absolute chaos,
and it would be -- he would be
-- he would

23:33.946 --> 23:38.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
make our country his piggy bank,
and he'd
be the chief pig.

23:38.417 --> 23:42.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: When Clinton
arrived to speak,
she raised the FBI's move.

23:42.588 --> 23:45.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
It's pretty strange to put
something like

23:46.025 --> 23:51.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that out with such little
information right
before an election.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

23:52.931 --> 23:57.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But many who came
to see her,
like Marlo Duffy, ignored the
e-mail matter

23:57.903 --> 23:58.871 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
altogether.

23:58.904 --> 24:00.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Who is this young person?

24:00.105 --> 24:01.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARLO DUFFY, Hillary Clinton
Supporter: This
is Samuel.

24:01.507 --> 24:02.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's six weeks old today.

24:02.808 --> 24:04.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And why are you
and Samuel
here?

24:04.877 --> 24:06.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARLO DUFFY: Because I want to
hear our future
president speak.

24:06.679 --> 24:08.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is historical, the first
woman president.

24:08.914 --> 24:13.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: To make that
happen, the campaign
is counting on canvassers,
supporters who

24:13.619 --> 24:18.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
knock on doors, make contact
with voters who
need a nudge to get to the
polls.

24:18.190 --> 24:21.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: We just
reached a
milestone.

24:21.727 --> 24:26.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 200 million Americans
are registered
to vote.

24:26.965 --> 24:28.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that includes 50 million
young people.

24:28.767 --> 24:30.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

24:30.235 --> 24:33.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Including the
three Woody sisters.

24:33.906 --> 24:36.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRISTEN WOODY, Hillary Clinton
Supporter:
There was no doubt in my mind
who my first

24:36.408 --> 24:38.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
vote would be cast for.

24:38.210 --> 24:41.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Hillary Clinton is
well-qualified to serve
our country, and she needs to be
the president.

24:42.014 --> 24:45.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Did you even
consider Mr. Trump?

24:45.150 --> 24:47.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAUREN WOODY, Hillary Clinton
Supporter: No,
definitely not.

24:47.319 --> 24:49.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's just ridiculous, and he
doesn't know
how to run the country.

24:49.521 --> 24:52.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He doesn't even know what he is
talking about
at any point.

24:52.658 --> 24:55.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you think
it would
mean if he were elected
president?

24:55.561 --> 24:58.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER WOODY, Hillary Clinton
Supporter:
Oh, it would set us back years
in progress

24:58.397 --> 25:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as far as race relations and
people getting
along.

25:01.166 --> 25:05.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Their mother,
Debra, and dad,
Carlos, rounded out the picture.

25:05.104 --> 25:08.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBRA WOODY, Hillary Clinton
Supporter: I
feel that Hillary is going to be
the answer

25:08.173 --> 25:11.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for not only my girls, but all
young women
and our entire country.

25:11.677 --> 25:13.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARLOS WOODY, Hillary Clinton
Supporter: Mr.
Trump is very volatile.

25:13.712 --> 25:15.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I am a registered Republican.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.750 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I will not vote for him.

25:17.783 --> 25:19.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have a Satan who was a
Republican.

25:19.118 --> 25:21.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: did you mean to
compare Donald
Trump to Satan?

25:21.620 --> 25:27.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARLOS WOODY: I think, when you
look at it,
he is a cold, callous
individual, and I don't

25:27.326 --> 25:28.293 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
think he has a conscience.

25:28.327 --> 25:29.628 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I really don't.

25:29.661 --> 25:32.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, the comparison is what it
is.

25:32.264 --> 25:37.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: From Daytona
Beach, it was
on to Las Vegas, where we found
Donald Trump

25:37.436 --> 25:41.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
newly energized by FBI
director's letter to
Congress.

25:41.807 --> 25:45.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Hillary has nobody but herself
to blame for

25:45.444 --> 25:48.614 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
her mounting legal problems.

25:48.647 --> 25:56.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Trump's
accusations play directly
into the dark image of Clinton
that animates

25:56.121 --> 25:58.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so many of his supporters.

25:58.323 --> 25:59.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where are you from?

25:59.625 --> 26:00.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CRYSTAL HOWARD, Donald Trump
Supporter: Chicago,
Illinois.

26:00.793 --> 26:02.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you came all
the way to
Las Vegas.

26:02.828 --> 26:04.263 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

26:04.296 --> 26:06.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CRYSTAL HOWARD: Absolutely,
because I don't
want a liar in the office.

26:06.131 --> 26:10.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Crystal Howard
was especially
excited because the first time
she came to

26:10.469 --> 26:13.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see a Trump rally, it was so
crowded, she
couldn't get in.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you think he will do as
president?

26:15.741 --> 26:20.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRYSTAL HOWARD: I hope that he
secures our
borders and hopefully takes care
of our economy.

26:20.379 --> 26:22.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What needs to
change about
the economy?

26:22.347 --> 26:23.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CRYSTAL HOWARD: We need more
jobs.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We more production.

26:25.651 --> 26:28.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need our jobs to quit leaving
America.

26:28.320 --> 26:31.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need our children to have
jobs when they
get out of college.

26:31.557 --> 26:36.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Several Trump
fans told us
they know he has flaws, but like
him anyway.

26:36.728 --> 26:39.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD JARRETT, Donald Trump
Supporter: I
am supporting him mainly because
he is the

26:39.264 --> 26:41.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lesser of the two evils.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They both have a lot of baggage.

26:43.469 --> 26:48.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A registered
Democrat, Richard
Jarrett was actually a delegate
to the 1996

26:48.841 --> 26:50.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democratic National Convention
in Chicago.

26:50.976 --> 26:53.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you say baggage, what are
you referring
to?

26:53.312 --> 26:58.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD JARRETT: Well, I mean,
the -- he won't
release his tax returns.

26:58.450 --> 27:01.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's questions about the
women who came
out against him.

27:01.553 --> 27:07.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's other questions about
how up and down
he is, saying crazy stuff and
conspiracies

27:07.092 --> 27:08.894 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and so forth.

27:08.927 --> 27:12.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think all of that is still
better than
what the Clinton crime family
has to offer.

27:12.364 --> 27:17.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Rebecca Burr,
another Democrat
who supported Bernie Sanders in
the Nevada

27:17.536 --> 27:20.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
caucuses, came wearing a prison
uniform.

27:21.006 --> 27:24.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"U.S. Department of Justice
inmate Hillary
Rodham Clinton."

27:24.376 --> 27:26.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBECCA BURR, Donald Trump
Supporter: I'm
looking at the bigger picture
here.

27:26.745 --> 27:28.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am looking for someone who
doesn't rig an
election.

27:28.847 --> 27:33.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am looking for someone who
doesn't take
money from foreign interests
from overseas.

27:33.719 --> 27:38.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I am not saying Trump is
perfect, but
he is far better than Hillary
Clinton any

27:38.924 --> 27:40.692 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
day.

27:40.726 --> 27:43.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What was your
reaction when
the story came out about Mr.
Trump's comments

27:43.061 --> 27:45.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in 2005, the "Access Hollywood"
tape?

27:45.063 --> 27:50.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBECCA BURR: I thought was that
that was
something that Hillary knew all
along.

27:50.168 --> 27:54.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know that she has a lot of
tricks up her
sleeves.

27:54.773 --> 27:57.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I wouldn't be surprised if
she has more
dirt on him.

27:57.075 --> 27:59.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But as far as, does it offend me
as a woman?

27:59.177 --> 28:00.879 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

28:00.913 --> 28:04.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: As your president,
I will go
into the poorest communities and
work on a

28:04.583 --> 28:07.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
national plan for
revitalization.

28:07.486 --> 28:10.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We will break decades of
failure.

28:10.455 --> 28:15.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Failures that
Arizonan James
Barber says he knows firsthand.

28:15.093 --> 28:19.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES BARBER, Donald Trump
Supporter: I want
him to go into the inner cities
and fix them.

28:19.731 --> 28:22.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It has not gotten better in the
50 years.

28:22.100 --> 28:25.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, hopefully, he will bring a
much-needed
change.

28:25.737 --> 28:28.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And with that, we
turn to Politics
Monday.

28:28.807 --> 28:33.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining me are Amy Walter of The
Cook Political
Report, and from The New York
Times, Yamiche

28:33.946 --> 28:34.913 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Alcindor.

28:34.947 --> 28:36.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tamara Keith is away.

28:36.315 --> 28:38.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Eight days to go.

28:38.383 --> 28:39.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to both of you.

28:39.651 --> 28:40.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, Amy -- thumbs up.

28:40.652 --> 28:41.853 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:41.887 --> 28:43.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: We're
so close.

28:43.722 --> 28:47.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, where does
this race stand,
and how much effect is this FBI
news having?

28:47.993 --> 28:52.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: It seems like the
race stands
at a place where it's always
wanted to go,

28:52.731 --> 28:57.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is basically somewhere
between a two-
and a four-point Clinton lead.

28:57.369 --> 29:02.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even before the FBI -- the notes
of the FBI
investigation came out, we
already started

29:02.975 --> 29:07.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to see a tightening of the race,
that Hillary
Clinton's big, big lead, in some
cases, it

29:07.980 --> 29:11.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was double digits, was narrowing
down, in
part because -- and this has
been a theme

29:11.950 --> 29:17.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we have seen this entire
campaign, Judy -- whenever
the focus is on one candidate,
the other candidate

29:17.623 --> 29:19.424 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
benefits.

29:19.458 --> 29:22.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For most of October, the focus
was on Donald
Trump and all of his problems,
whether that

29:22.427 --> 29:27.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was debates or his other
troubles.

29:27.099 --> 29:32.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the last week, even before
the FBI story,
it was about the Clinton
Foundation.

29:32.371 --> 29:35.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was about Obamacare rates
increasing.

29:35.073 --> 29:38.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what we're starting to
see is that
Republicans started to come
home.

29:38.810 --> 29:40.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The focus was on her negative
traits.

29:40.912 --> 29:46.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think that this race still
is a Hillary
Clinton lead, smaller, and it
now comes down

29:47.019 --> 29:51.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to discussing the battleground
states, where
she continues to have an
advantage.

29:51.790 --> 29:56.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He may -- this may have stopped
his fall in
some of these states, but I
don't think that

29:56.128 --> 29:57.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's enough to push him over the
top.

29:57.796 --> 30:00.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Yamiche, you
have been
watching these candidates on the
trail.

30:00.532 --> 30:02.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I know you were in North
Carolina over the
weekend.

30:02.134 --> 30:04.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm going to ask you about
that in a moment.

30:04.469 --> 30:08.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when you look at what the
candidates are
saying on the trail, do they
look like they

30:08.874 --> 30:10.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have changed their approach in
some way?

30:10.709 --> 30:14.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YAMICHE ALCINDOR, The New York
Times: I think
that Hillary Clinton has changed
her approach

30:14.312 --> 30:18.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a bit, because she was really
talking a lot
about Donald Trump and all his
problems, talking

30:18.750 --> 30:23.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot about his sexual assault
allegations,
and this idea of him being
unqualified, and

30:23.488 --> 30:26.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really doubling down on the idea
that she
has the experience.

30:26.758 --> 30:30.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now we're seeing that she's also
kind of talking
a little bit about the FBI and
talking a little

30:30.662 --> 30:35.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bit about whether or not there
is any partisanship
or what's going on with the fact
that this

30:35.600 --> 30:37.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
announcement was made so late in
the game.

30:37.936 --> 30:39.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I think she's done a little
bit of shifting.

30:39.971 --> 30:43.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that, when I talk to
a lot of
her supporters, they're kind of
wanting her

30:43.642 --> 30:45.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to go back to hitting Trump
full-time.

30:45.644 --> 30:49.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Donald Trump, on the other
hand, has really,
I think, doubled down this idea
that she's

30:49.815 --> 30:51.450 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
corrupt.

30:51.483 --> 30:54.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Regardless of whether or not the
FBI made
this announcement on Friday, he
would have

30:54.119 --> 30:58.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
continued to say she is someone
who almost
like a Watergate, she has all
these issues

30:58.557 --> 31:00.358 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
around her.

31:00.392 --> 31:03.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was doubling down on the idea
of the Clinton
Foundation being corrupt, on
this idea that

31:03.562 --> 31:06.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she belongs in jail, and that
she really should
not have been allowed to run.

31:06.798 --> 31:11.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, even though this FBI e-mail
-- he's kind
of in some ways seizing on the
opportunity

31:11.670 --> 31:15.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to talk about her e-mails
through the FBI,
he would have been talking about
these e-mails

31:15.307 --> 31:17.042 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
regardless.

31:17.075 --> 31:19.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Amy, you
were telling
us that, with regard to the
e-mails, there

31:19.778 --> 31:22.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are still real questions out
there that have
to be answered.

31:22.514 --> 31:24.282 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

31:24.316 --> 31:26.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, part of the reason that
we don't know
what impact it's going to have
is that we

31:26.351 --> 31:28.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really don't know what's in
there.

31:28.320 --> 31:33.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're only now starting to
get a sense
for whether we're going to get
an actual investigation

31:33.859 --> 31:37.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into them, that the -- the
search warrant
has actually been given.

31:37.095 --> 31:39.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we're going to actually see
some digging
into these e-mails.

31:39.965 --> 31:43.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But you hear reporting
everything from we
could find something out maybe
before the

31:43.802 --> 31:47.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election is over about whether
there is anything
substantive in there to maybe
it's going to

31:47.639 --> 31:49.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be weeks and weeks from now.

31:49.474 --> 31:54.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, the more attention on
a drip, drip,
drip coming out of this, not
good for Hillary

31:54.146 --> 31:55.113 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton.

31:55.147 --> 31:56.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Yamiche is right.

31:56.948 --> 32:00.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is -- the Clinton campaign
wants this
to be ultimately a referendum on
Donald Trump,

32:00.452 --> 32:02.254 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not on e-mails.

32:02.287 --> 32:04.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, meantime,
Yamiche, as
we just said, you were in North
Carolina talking

32:04.890 --> 32:06.691 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to voters.

32:06.725 --> 32:13.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you get the sense that they
are changing,
that it's affecting how they
think about this

32:13.098 --> 32:14.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
race at this point?

32:14.432 --> 32:17.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YAMICHE ALCINDOR: It's not
affecting who people
are choosing.

32:17.669 --> 32:22.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When I was out in North
Carolina, I went to
the city of Charlotte, and I
also went to

32:22.774 --> 32:24.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some suburbs surrounding the
city.

32:24.676 --> 32:27.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And people told me that they
were still going
to go with the person that they
were going

32:27.946 --> 32:29.614 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for.

32:29.648 --> 32:31.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when I talked to Trump
supporters, they
were still very much Trump
supporters.

32:31.783 --> 32:34.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When I talked to Clinton
supporters, they
were very much still in her
camp.

32:34.653 --> 32:36.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this really motivated people
to leave
their houses.

32:36.922 --> 32:41.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was in Charlotte, North
Carolina, at about
7:30 a.m. on a Saturday, and
there were people

32:41.259 --> 32:44.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lined waiting two hours already
to get into
the polls.

32:44.529 --> 32:50.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I talked to a young man who
said: "I saw
the news of the FBI e-mails
flash on my work

32:50.335 --> 32:54.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
computer on Friday and I said,
I'm waking
up at 8:00 to come to the polls
and I want

32:54.072 --> 32:55.207 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to vote early."

32:55.240 --> 32:57.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think that that is what
has been going
on here.

32:57.642 --> 33:02.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not so much changing
people's ideas as
much as it is about this idea
that both people

33:02.314 --> 33:05.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- both sets of supporters think
that the
other supporters are going to be
motivated

33:05.817 --> 33:07.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by this news and, thus, they
want to show
out.

33:07.819 --> 33:09.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Interesting.

33:09.588 --> 33:12.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, Amy, you were also talking
to us about
the so-called down-ballot races,
the Senate

33:13.024 --> 33:16.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
races in particular that may be
affected by
this.

33:16.261 --> 33:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: This was the biggest
concern from
Republicans about a
week-and-a-half ago was

33:20.899 --> 33:26.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Republicans were just so
enthusiastic,
were so depressed by how poorly
Donald Trump

33:26.137 --> 33:30.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had done in the debates, and
that they just
were not going to show up and
vote.

33:30.742 --> 33:34.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This may be something that help
gets them
out to vote, is what they're
hoping right

33:34.379 --> 33:37.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now, again, motivated, oh,
that's right, this
is what don't like about Hillary
Clinton,

33:37.749 --> 33:42.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's why we have to come out and
vote, and
also maybe bolsters the argument
that a lot

33:42.153 --> 33:46.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of down-ballot candidates are
making that
they need to be a check on
Hillary Clinton.

33:46.224 --> 33:48.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe you still think Hillary
Clinton is going
to win the presidency, but don't
you want

33:48.994 --> 33:53.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to have a Republican in office,
given what
we know about Hillary Clinton?

33:53.064 --> 33:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yamiche, what are
you hearing?

33:54.900 --> 33:59.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What do you see in your
reporting about these
Senate races that are still
really close?

33:59.371 --> 34:04.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YAMICHE ALCINDOR: What I'm
hearing from voters
-- and I have heard a little bit
about from

34:04.342 --> 34:08.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans who don't want to
vote for Donald
Trump, because they don't see
him as qualified,

34:08.146 --> 34:11.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but then who then are going to
split their
ticket and go and vote for
Republicans to

34:12.017 --> 34:13.885 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
go down-ballot.

34:13.919 --> 34:16.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The interesting thing, though,
is that a lot
of people for the last eight
years have watched

34:16.588 --> 34:19.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Barack Obama -- or -- excuse me
-- maybe for
the last four years -- have
watched Barack

34:19.658 --> 34:23.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama really struggle with this
idea that
he couldn't get a lot of things
passed because

34:23.461 --> 34:26.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the Republican majorities in
both the House
and the Senate.

34:26.698 --> 34:30.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when I talk to people who
say, I don't
want another four years of that,
I don't want

34:30.669 --> 34:34.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
another Hillary Clinton to have
to face the
same issues that Barack Obama
faced, so even

34:35.006 --> 34:38.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
though there's this idea that
they want to
have a check on Hillary Clinton,
a lot of

34:38.209 --> 34:41.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people say, I actually want her
to be able
to go in there and get things
done.

34:41.346 --> 34:44.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that's, I think, why a lot
of Democrats
are coming out and talking to me
about this

34:44.582 --> 34:48.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
idea of voting down-ballot and
then the importance
of local races.

34:48.687 --> 34:52.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, Republicans are happy
to split
their ticket because they don't
want to see

34:52.824 --> 34:55.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton enact some of
the things that
she has been talking about.

34:56.027 --> 34:58.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Really, one of the most
important things is
immigration reform.

34:58.763 --> 35:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She said in her first 100 days
that she's
going to dealing with that
issue.

35:02.167 --> 35:06.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a lot of Republicans are
really worried
that she might kind of have this
idea of open

35:06.604 --> 35:09.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
borders and really not be as
tough as they
want her to be.

35:09.207 --> 35:10.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The clock is
ticking.

35:11.009 --> 35:13.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's closer than ever, eight
days away.

35:13.078 --> 35:18.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Amy Walter, Yamiche Alcindor,
thank you both.

35:18.550 --> 35:30.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We go now to the
nation of
Colombia, where one of the most
brutal and

35:30.095 --> 35:36.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
long-lasting civil wars in South
America appeared
to be coming to a peaceful end
earlier this

35:36.034 --> 35:37.836 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
month.

35:37.869 --> 35:40.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the landmark peace agreement
between the
government and rebels was
narrowly rejected

35:41.006 --> 35:43.108 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a nationwide referendum.

35:43.141 --> 35:46.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now both sides are struggling to
pick up the
pieces.

35:46.511 --> 35:52.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Nadja
Drost and her
producer, Bruno Federico, have
this report.

35:52.817 --> 36:00.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: It happened barely
more than
a month ago, but it seems like
another age,

36:00.392 --> 36:06.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a moving and hopeful ceremony in
the port
city of Cartagena to mark what
many Colombians

36:06.197 --> 36:11.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
never thought possible: the
armed insurgency
FARC and the government signing
off on a peace

36:11.903 --> 36:15.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agreement to end 52 years of
war.

36:15.507 --> 36:21.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In front of hundreds at the
shore, a women's
choir sings a goodbye to war and
a welcome

36:21.679 --> 36:24.149 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to peace.

36:24.182 --> 36:31.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They brought their traditional
songs of mourning
to the ceremony from here,
Bojaya, a town

36:31.823 --> 36:37.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reached only by river in the
isolated northwest
of Colombia, in a church, where
they commemorate

36:37.462 --> 36:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those who lost their lives in
what has become
a symbol of the war's brutality.

36:41.933 --> 36:49.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on May 2, 2002, hundreds of
residents were
taking shelter in this church
from fighting

36:49.040 --> 36:54.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between paramilitaries and FARC
guerrillas,
when the guerrillas launched a
homemade mortar

36:54.813 --> 36:56.347 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
round.

36:56.381 --> 37:01.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It landed inside the church,
killing 79 people,
over half of them children.

37:01.252 --> 37:06.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Later, thousands fled, tearing
apart the community.

37:06.057 --> 37:11.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since then, the church has been
rebuilt and
maintained in memory of the
victims and survivors

37:11.729 --> 37:13.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like Macaria Allin.

37:13.364 --> 37:17.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MACARIA ALLIN, Survivor (through
translator):
I was here with my three
children.

37:17.302 --> 37:19.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The cylinder bomb fell over
there.

37:19.237 --> 37:22.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This whole area was full of
people.

37:22.107 --> 37:24.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Everyone who was around here
died, everyone.

37:25.009 --> 37:26.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No one was left alive.

37:26.978 --> 37:31.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: The village was
eventually abandoned,
its residents displaced
throughout the region,

37:31.216 --> 37:34.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
until it was relocated a mile
upstream.

37:34.752 --> 37:39.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since the massacre, Bojaya has
continued to
suffer the worst of the
conflict, caught in

37:39.591 --> 37:44.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the crossfire of FARC guerrillas
fighting
the army and paramilitaries, the
river and

37:45.029 --> 37:49.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

Maxima Asprilla is one of the
women who sang
in Cartagena.

37:52.904 --> 37:56.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAXIMA ASPRILLA, Colombia
(through translator):
When I was singing -- and that's
why we sang

37:56.975 --> 38:00.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with such emotion and effort --
the only thing
I was thinking was, we want
peace.

38:01.012 --> 38:07.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Perhaps because of
being so hard-hit
by the conflict, Bojaya
residents voted overwhelmingly,

38:07.185 --> 38:10.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
95 percent, in support of the
peace accords.

38:10.989 --> 38:16.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, with the peace deal
rejected nationally
and mired in uncertainty, many
here fear they

38:16.694 --> 38:21.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may have lost their only and
long-awaited
chance to live in peace.

38:21.332 --> 38:26.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MACARIA ALLIN (through
translator): We feel
abandoned, betrayed.

38:26.070 --> 38:29.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We thought they would support
us, those who
have lived the war.

38:29.140 --> 38:32.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The half-country who voted for
no turned their
back on us.

38:32.644 --> 38:38.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: The peace process,
throughout
its four years of negotiations,
has generated

38:38.216 --> 38:40.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fierce political debate.

38:40.385 --> 38:46.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the criticism by vocal
opponents prompted
President Juan Manuel Santos to
call the referendum,

38:47.025 --> 38:50.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the hope that a show of
public support
could strengthen the deal.

38:50.528 --> 38:56.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS, Colombian
President: Many
people warned me against it, but
I said this

38:56.768 --> 39:03.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is something that I believe will
be positive
for the whole process.

39:03.975 --> 39:07.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The decision backfired because
we lost by
a very small margin.

39:07.912 --> 39:13.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: With only 37
percent of voters
bothering to go to the polls,
and the no side

39:13.751 --> 39:21.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
winning by a mere 53,000 votes
out of 13.5
million, there is perhaps no one
more consumed

39:21.092 --> 39:26.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with why the deal was rejected
than the man
who just won the Nobel Peace
Prize for its

39:26.698 --> 39:28.032 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
signing.

39:28.066 --> 39:32.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why do you think that Colombians
voted against
the peace accords?

39:32.503 --> 39:38.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: Of course,
there's been
a lot of misinformation, a lot
of lack of

39:39.010 --> 39:40.945 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
information.

39:40.979 --> 39:49.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And maybe I'm a bit responsible
for not being
more effective in this process
of telling

39:49.454 --> 39:52.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people what the agreement was
all about.

39:52.490 --> 39:57.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: The peace accords
were defeated
by a no campaign led by Santos
archrival and

39:57.662 --> 40:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
former President Alvaro Uribe
and his Central
Democratic Party.

40:01.699 --> 40:07.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the campaign has been
questioned over
the claims it made to voters:
that the country

40:07.071 --> 40:11.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would become a socialist state
like Venezuela,
or that FARC leaders would
receive impunity

40:12.010 --> 40:13.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for their crimes.

40:13.878 --> 40:19.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Rodrigo Uprimny, a
constitutional law expert
close to the peace talks, says
the no campaign

40:19.484 --> 40:22.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even made claims that had
nothing to do with
the peace accord.

40:22.654 --> 40:25.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RODRIGO UPRIMNY, Constitutional
Law Expert:
They say to them, these peace
accords are

40:25.089 --> 40:32.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to destroy your family
because this
peace accord is in favor of
homosexuality,

40:32.263 --> 40:34.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which quite clearly is not true.

40:34.365 --> 40:40.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Ivan Zuluaga, the
Central Democratic
Party's director and a former
presidential

40:40.738 --> 40:46.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidate who lost to Santos in
the last election,
says the no vote's victory sends
a clear mandate

40:46.911 --> 40:48.680 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to overhaul the agreements.

40:48.713 --> 40:51.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IVAN ZULUAGA, Director, Central
Democratic
Party: They have to recognize
that Colombians

40:51.582 --> 40:58.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vote for it, so they have to
accept not only
the government, but even the
FARC deep changes,

40:59.023 --> 41:00.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fundamental changes.

41:00.858 --> 41:04.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: FARC leaders have
said they are
open to making some changes, but
warn it will

41:04.729 --> 41:07.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be difficult change the
agreement's core.

41:07.899 --> 41:12.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We traveled via river from
Bojaya to visit
a FARC unit.

41:12.303 --> 41:17.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mid-level commanders known as
Pablo Atrato
and Natalie Mistral, a French
citizen, led

41:17.809 --> 41:23.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us to a camp where their troops,
like thousands
of others spread out amongst
jungle enclaves,

41:23.314 --> 41:26.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are waiting amid the
uncertainty.

41:26.217 --> 41:29.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both Mistral and Atrato were at
negotiations
in Havana.

41:29.320 --> 41:32.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PABLO ATRATO, FARC (through
translator): After
years of negotiations, to
resolve all this

41:32.657 --> 41:34.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in two or three months, I don't
think it's
possible.

41:34.992 --> 41:38.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: The peace accords
will grant
immunity to much of the FARC's
rank-and-file,

41:38.963 --> 41:44.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but those accused of crimes
against humanity
will receive alternative
sentences in exchange

41:44.802 --> 41:49.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for confessing the truth, not
jail, but restrictions
on their liberty.

41:49.407 --> 41:51.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But many in the opposition say
that is unacceptable.

41:51.876 --> 41:55.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IVAN ZULUAGA: They have to go to
jail five
years.

41:55.213 --> 42:00.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they are in jail, they are
not able to
be eligible politically.

42:00.351 --> 42:05.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, instead of that, the
treatment says,
and the agreement with the FARC
says, that

42:06.023 --> 42:13.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they aren't going to jail and
they can be
eligible for any major president
or congress,

42:13.765 --> 42:14.832 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for example.

42:14.866 --> 42:16.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RODRIGO UPRIMNY: But that's --
that's the
deal.

42:16.567 --> 42:22.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you want an armed political
-- an armed
political actor like the FARC to
become a

42:22.707 --> 42:27.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
peaceful political actor, then
you can not
block them to make politics.

42:27.578 --> 42:30.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the crucial issue in a
peace accord.

42:30.381 --> 42:35.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATALIE MISTRAL, FARC (through
translator):
I'm not willing to spend time in
jail, and

42:35.920 --> 42:38.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not willing to let my
superiors go to
jail either.

42:38.556 --> 42:41.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
To serve jail time would nullify
us politically.

42:41.759 --> 42:44.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's unacceptable within a peace
negotiation.

42:44.061 --> 42:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: While Santos has
said his government
is trying to satisfy the no
side, he has made

42:49.434 --> 42:53.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clear there will be disagreement
on issues
in reaching a new agreement.

42:53.171 --> 42:59.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Santos' government and the
FARC face an
enormous challenge: making
sufficient changes

42:59.076 --> 43:04.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the peace agreement to gain
broader support
of the public, without making
the tectonic-shifting

43:04.482 --> 43:07.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
changes that could break it
down.

43:07.051 --> 43:13.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PABLO ATRATO (through
translator): The risks
are that this gets drawn out and
we end up

43:13.891 --> 43:15.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
again in a spiral of war.

43:15.927 --> 43:19.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that's how it could end
up, if we're
not capable in the next two or
three months

43:19.530 --> 43:21.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to find a way out of this.

43:21.365 --> 43:26.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: I am
absolutely determined
not to allow the country to go
back to war

43:26.604 --> 43:27.672 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with FARC.

43:27.705 --> 43:29.173 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The FARC doesn't want it.

43:29.207 --> 43:30.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We don't want it.

43:31.008 --> 43:42.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're trying to find the
best and the
most rapid path to get out of
this situation,

43:42.820 --> 43:45.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and that's to have a new
agreement as soon
as possible.

43:45.590 --> 43:49.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Santos told us he
hopes to get
a new peace deal by the end of
the year.

43:49.994 --> 43:52.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But delay could jeopardize the
current cease-fire.

43:52.630 --> 43:58.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bojaya residents like Maxima
Asprilla are
finally feeling peace in their
town, and have

43:58.870 --> 44:00.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
seen changes among the FARC.

44:00.905 --> 44:05.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAXIMA ASPRILLA (through
translator): After
having signed the cease-fire,
they got into

44:05.877 --> 44:08.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a different mode and the tension
went down.

44:08.479 --> 44:13.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NADJA DROST: In fact, the FARC
even apologized
to the community last year.

44:13.518 --> 44:16.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We ask
you to forgive
us.

44:16.087 --> 44:21.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: After so many years
of singing
lamentations for their dead,
these women hope

44:21.125 --> 44:27.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have a reason to compose a
song in celebration
of life, and the peace they so
badly want.

44:27.899 --> 44:40.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"We Colombians," they sing, "ask
that war
not repeat."

44:40.645 --> 44:45.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But whether Bojaya's plea for
peace is answered
is far from certain.

44:45.182 --> 44:51.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From Bojaya, Colombia, reporting
with Bruno
Federico, I'm Nadja Drost for
the "PBS NewsHour."

44:51.122 --> 44:55.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can see
more of Nadja's
interview with the Colombian
president on

44:55.593 --> 45:07.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

45:07.638 --> 45:13.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now a special treat on this
Halloween, a story
about the magic of movies and
zombies.

45:13.778 --> 45:16.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s Mike Melia has
our update.

45:16.681 --> 45:21.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE MELIA: You don't often get
to see someone's
dreams come true, even if they
are the stuff

45:22.019 --> 45:25.222 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of nightmares.

45:25.256 --> 45:29.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We first met Sam Suchmann and
Mattie Zufelt
two years ago, when all they had
was a big

45:29.460 --> 45:32.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
idea and a Kickstarter to make
an epic zombie
movie.

45:32.563 --> 45:36.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTIE ZUFELT, Filmmaker: It's
going to be
like between horror and comedy,
drama, same

45:36.634 --> 45:38.402 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
kind of thing.

45:38.436 --> 45:46.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAM SUCHMANN, Filmmaker: We have
every average,
everyday teen drama, like love
triangles,

45:46.043 --> 45:50.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or like heartbreaks or betrayals
or people
living like...

45:50.247 --> 45:52.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTIE ZUFELT: Or it could be
like teenagers'
secret life.

45:52.149 --> 45:54.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAM SUCHMANN: What I do to
Mattie is, I leave
him behind.

45:54.819 --> 45:55.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATTIE ZUFELT: Yes.

45:55.820 --> 45:57.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAM SUCHMANN: And that is not
cool.

45:57.288 --> 45:58.255 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
So...

45:58.289 --> 45:59.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATTIE ZUFELT: No.

45:59.290 --> 46:01.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You can't leave a friend behind.

46:01.058 --> 46:03.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE MELIA: The best friends --
both have
Down syndrome -- first met at
the Special

46:03.728 --> 46:05.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Olympics in grade school.

46:05.529 --> 46:08.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From his living room in Rhode
Island, Sam
told us a very personal reason
for wanting

46:08.733 --> 46:10.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to make the movie.

46:10.501 --> 46:14.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAM SUCHMANN: My whole life, I
feel like I
never fit in anywhere or had a
voice, but

46:15.006 --> 46:17.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
someday, that will change.

46:17.274 --> 46:19.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I will be somebody.

46:19.110 --> 46:20.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that day is today.

46:20.678 --> 46:23.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE MELIA: In many ways, Sam
was right.

46:23.280 --> 46:26.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their lives were about to change
in dramatic
ways.

46:26.317 --> 46:28.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Their Kickstarter raised nearly
$70,000.

46:28.486 --> 46:34.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They gathered together family,
friends, along
with film industry and special
effects professionals.

46:34.592 --> 46:36.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was all happening.

46:37.028 --> 46:41.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We got invited on set for a day,
when they
were filming a party scene on a
yacht.

46:41.332 --> 46:44.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sam and Mattie originally wanted
a cruise
ship, but this was close.

46:44.669 --> 46:48.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Peter Farrelly, behind hits like
"Dumb and
Dumber" and "Something About
Mary," was also

46:48.439 --> 46:49.674 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on set.

46:49.707 --> 46:52.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was transformed into a zombie
-- but more
on that later.

46:52.510 --> 46:54.779 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The day before, "The Jersey
Shore"'s D.J.

46:54.812 --> 46:56.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Pauly D. was there.

46:56.347 --> 47:00.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had been at the top of Sam
and Mattie's
wish list for celebrity cameos.

47:00.251 --> 47:02.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In some ways, they were becoming
famous.

47:02.219 --> 47:05.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTIE ZUFELT: I want to be
famous because
I want to be a deejay.

47:05.923 --> 47:06.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SAM SUCHMANN: Yes.

47:06.924 --> 47:11.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want to be famous because I
love to sing.

47:11.796 --> 47:13.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATTIE ZUFELT: Yes.

47:13.798 --> 47:17.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He has a good voice.

47:17.134 --> 47:20.438 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAM SUCHMANN: I'm a singer.

47:20.471 --> 47:21.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I can rap, too.

47:21.605 --> 47:23.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm do a little rap.

47:23.040 --> 47:24.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Maybe you want to hear.

47:24.608 --> 47:27.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE MELIA: I would love to hear
it.

47:27.611 --> 47:28.579 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

47:28.612 --> 47:29.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAM SUCHMANN: Right here.

47:29.613 --> 47:30.581 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(RAPPING)

47:30.614 --> 47:32.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATTIE ZUFELT: Yes, that's
really good.

47:32.083 --> 47:33.851 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You're good.

47:33.884 --> 47:37.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE MELIA: There are no record
deals yet,
but since our story first aired,
Sam and Mattie

47:37.722 --> 47:42.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been profiled by "People"
magazine, "The
Today Show," The Huffington
Post, just to

47:42.059 --> 47:45.663 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
name a few.

47:45.696 --> 47:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Microsoft flew them to L.A. as
the official
spokes-dudes for the Special
Olympics World

47:49.533 --> 47:50.568 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Games in 2015.

47:50.601 --> 47:53.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAM SUCHMANN: Stay tuned for
more.

47:53.504 --> 47:56.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE MELIA: And they also made
the movie.

47:56.607 --> 47:59.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Spring Break Zombie Massacre"
premiered in
September in their hometown of
Providence.

47:59.977 --> 48:03.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A week later, they were guests
on Conan O'Brien's
show.

48:03.714 --> 48:05.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CONAN O'BRIEN, Host, "Late Night
With Conan
O'Brien": What I love about what
you guys

48:05.449 --> 48:09.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have done is, you met years ago,
you talked
about this dream, and you made
it happen.

48:09.787 --> 48:14.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here we are, all these years
later, and you
made you made your zombie movie,
and you had

48:14.892 --> 48:17.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a premiere, a premiere that the
press attended.

48:17.628 --> 48:18.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Everyone loves the movie.

48:18.662 --> 48:20.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then you fly out here to
come on our show.

48:20.731 --> 48:21.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is pretty spectacular.

48:21.732 --> 48:23.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MIKE MELIA: It is pretty
spectacular.

48:23.234 --> 48:26.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I caught up with them for the
film's New York
City premiere.

48:26.403 --> 48:33.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They pulled up to the red carpet
in a bloody
SUV, to a long line of fans
waiting outside.

48:33.677 --> 48:34.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Don't be confused.

48:34.678 --> 48:35.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is not a kids' movie.

48:35.980 --> 48:37.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JESSE SUCHMANN, Brother of Sam
Suchmann: This
is a hard R, OK?

48:37.214 --> 48:38.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Like, there is guts.

48:38.215 --> 48:39.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is urinating on guts, OK?

48:39.717 --> 48:41.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE MELIA: Jesse Suchmann is
Sam's brother.

48:41.852 --> 48:45.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He helped put together the
original Kickstarter
and has helped orchestrate
everything since.

48:45.356 --> 48:48.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JESSE SUCHMANN: I have learned
so much from
them.

48:48.225 --> 48:50.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I want to be like them.

48:50.394 --> 48:56.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think that their
confidence in their
ideas and their clarity of
vision and their

48:56.801 --> 49:02.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
confidence in themselves is so
intoxicating
to everyone around, that it
drives everybody

49:02.807 --> 49:04.508 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do better.

49:04.542 --> 49:07.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE MELIA: It's been a wild
ride for me,
too.

49:07.478 --> 49:09.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Remember when I said I became a
zombie?

49:09.780 --> 49:13.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turns out -- and here's a
mini-spoiler -- in
the climatic fight scene, I get
my head split

49:13.651 --> 49:15.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
open by a record thrown by D.J.

49:15.853 --> 49:17.555 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Pauly D.

49:17.588 --> 49:20.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After the New York screening, I
asked Sam
and Mattie what it's been like
for them.

49:20.457 --> 49:22.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATTIE ZUFELT: It is a hell of a
ride.

49:22.860 --> 49:27.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is, never expecting much
people -- never
expecting people to see this
movie.

49:27.932 --> 49:31.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAM SUCHMANN: Chase your dreams,
and always
follow your dreams.

49:31.435 --> 49:33.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Don't let anyone tell you
different.

49:33.571 --> 49:35.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And don't be a victim to
bullies.

49:35.573 --> 49:38.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And do not party like me and
Mattie.

49:38.542 --> 49:42.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm looking forward for having
more Sam and
Mattie adventures on the way.

49:42.246 --> 49:43.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATTIE ZUFELT: Yes, there will.

49:43.480 --> 49:45.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAM SUCHMANN: Yes, there is
Mattie deejaying
and dancing.

49:45.616 --> 49:47.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I can't wait.

49:47.685 --> 49:49.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's going to be fun.

49:49.119 --> 49:51.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE MELIA: Just yesterday, they
were featured
on "CBS Sunday Morning."

49:51.121 --> 49:52.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAM SUCHMANN: I don't do it for
fame.

49:52.690 --> 49:53.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I do it because I love it and
because...

49:53.858 --> 49:54.825 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATTIE ZUFELT: I'm doing it for
the money.

49:54.859 --> 49:56.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: You're doing it for
the money?

49:56.694 --> 49:57.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATTIE ZUFELT: Yes.

49:57.795 --> 49:58.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAM SUCHMANN: Well, I do it
because I love
it.

49:58.863 --> 49:59.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: Have you gotten rich
on this so
far?

49:59.830 --> 50:01.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATTIE ZUFELT: Not yet.

50:01.232 --> 50:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE MELIA: They are also making
a documentary
about their journey.

50:03.434 --> 50:05.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tim Forster is leading that
project.

50:05.202 --> 50:08.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TIM FORSTER, Documentary
Filmmaker: We that
as being kind of the big
culmination of this

50:08.072 --> 50:09.907 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
whole thing.

50:09.940 --> 50:13.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, the movie is --
stands on its own,
and we think professionals are
going to love

50:13.777 --> 50:15.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it, people are going to love it
on its own.

50:15.546 --> 50:20.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But to see the time, the effort,
the patience
involved with making this movie,
that's the

50:20.951 --> 50:22.653 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
real story.

50:22.686 --> 50:26.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE MELIA: On this Halloween,
updating a
feel-good zombie story, I'm Mike
Melia for

50:26.790 --> 50:28.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the "PBS NewsHour."

50:28.826 --> 50:32.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sam and Mattie
have a big future.

50:32.062 --> 50:34.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We want to be there to cover the
whole thing.

50:34.465 --> 50:38.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Finally, we stay in the
Halloween spirit for
our "NewsHour" Shares, something
that caught

50:38.502 --> 50:41.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our eye that we thought would be
of interest
to you, too.

50:41.238 --> 50:46.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It turns out the vampire bat is
hardly the
agent of evil its association
with Dracula

50:46.210 --> 50:47.945 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
would suggest.

50:47.978 --> 50:52.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We asked Smithsonian researcher
and vampire
bat expert Gerry Carter to clear
up some of

50:52.850 --> 50:54.752 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the myths.

50:54.785 --> 50:59.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERRY CARTER, Smithsonian
Researcher: I'm
Gerry Carter, and I study
food-sharing relationships

50:59.456 --> 51:01.091 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in vampire bats.

51:01.125 --> 51:04.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Vampire bats are small,
neotropical bats.

51:04.128 --> 51:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They weigh about 30 grams, and
they drink
nothing but blood.

51:08.799 --> 51:13.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The legend of the vampire
actually came first
before the bat was discovered by
Europeans.

51:13.938 --> 51:17.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the bat is actually named
after the monster,
and not the other way around.

51:17.808 --> 51:22.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One idea about vampire bats
that's very common,
especially in Latin America, is
that most

51:22.780 --> 51:23.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bats are vampire bats.

51:23.781 --> 51:25.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's certainly not true.

51:25.616 --> 51:32.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are only three species of
vampire bats,
and there are roughly 1,300
species of bats.

51:32.389 --> 51:36.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The common vampire bat usually
feeds on mammals
and livestock.

51:36.427 --> 51:40.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The white-winged vampire bat
will often climb
along the underside of a branch
to feed on

51:40.831 --> 51:42.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the toes of a bird.

51:42.666 --> 51:47.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the hairy-legged vampire bat
will actually
land on a bird like a chicken
and hide in

51:47.104 --> 51:48.072 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the feathers.

51:48.105 --> 51:49.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it's like a giant tick.

51:49.907 --> 51:54.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Vampire bats have these
razor-sharp teeth
that they use to make a small
cut, and then

51:54.578 --> 51:56.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they lick the wound.

51:56.447 --> 51:59.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have an anticoagulant
in their saliva
which keeps the blood flowing,
and they will

51:59.883 --> 52:01.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
take about a tablespoon of
blood.

52:02.019 --> 52:06.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if they're successful, then
the animal
is none the wiser, never finds
out that the

52:06.190 --> 52:09.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bat was there until the next
morning maybe.

52:09.426 --> 52:13.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the interesting
things about the
biology of vampire bats is that
they're very

52:13.764 --> 52:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
susceptible to starvation.

52:15.599 --> 52:20.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they don't put on fat, they
don't store
energy, and they can starve if
they miss more

52:20.904 --> 52:22.640 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than two meals.

52:22.673 --> 52:26.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But other bats in their roosts
will often
regurgitate a portion of their
blood meals

52:26.744 --> 52:28.545 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to feed them.

52:28.579 --> 52:31.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you can fast an individual,
and then another

life, essentially.

52:33.450 --> 52:36.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's one of the things
that makes the
vampire case so interesting in
terms of an

52:36.954 --> 52:39.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
example of cooperation in
nature.

52:39.123 --> 52:43.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These vampire bats, they're like
these alien
life forms, and yet there are so
many things

52:43.861 --> 52:49.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they do that seem very
convergent with
what people do, with what
primates do.

52:49.900 --> 52:52.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Vampire bats do things like they
groom each
other.

52:52.136 --> 52:54.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They seem to have these
friendship-like relationships.

52:54.905 --> 52:57.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And yet everything else about
them is so strange.

52:57.741 --> 53:01.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think people should be
scared of vampire
bats.

53:01.178 --> 53:05.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even within bats, I think
vampire bats are
probably the most hated and
feared of all

53:05.149 --> 53:06.984 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the bats.

53:07.017 --> 53:11.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think, the more you learn
about vampire
bats, the more you realize just
how incredible

53:11.221 --> 53:12.423 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they are.
