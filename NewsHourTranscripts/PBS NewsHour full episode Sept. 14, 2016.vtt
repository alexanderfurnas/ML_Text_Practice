GWEN IFILL: Good evening.

00:05.672 --> 00:06.640 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:06.673 --> 00:08.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

00:08.308 --> 00:11.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: reshaping
America's child care policies.

00:11.778 --> 00:17.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Donald Trump lays out his
plan, we take
a look at how the candidates
compare on the

00:17.184 --> 00:18.919 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issue.

00:18.952 --> 00:22.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Wednesday:
endgame strategy -- what the
candidates must

00:22.356 --> 00:26.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do to reach the 270 electoral
votes needed
to win.

00:26.994 --> 00:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And in the first of
our two-part
series, how American women are
falling victim

00:32.766 --> 00:36.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to forced marriage, with no
clear system to
protect them.

00:36.336 --> 00:42.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NINA VAN HARN, Michigan: I do
remember being
very nervous, and yet knowing
that I needed

00:42.042 --> 00:43.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be smiling and I was supposed
to be happy.

00:43.310 --> 00:47.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just looked in the mirror
and I thought,
this is it.

00:47.848 --> 00:52.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus: turning
down the volume
on sound pollution.

00:53.020 --> 00:59.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One company makes strides to
protect marine
life from manmade noise in the
ocean.

00:59.393 --> 01:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:06.300 --> 01:09.036 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:09.069 --> 01:19.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For Donald Trump
and Hillary
Clinton, this day has been all
about health.

01:19.212 --> 01:24.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It included releases of medical
data, to varying
degrees, and a journey to a
Michigan city

01:25.018 --> 01:29.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
beset by a water crisis.

01:29.356 --> 01:35.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was Donald Trump's first trip
to Flint
since the city found lead in its
water in

01:35.395 --> 01:37.030 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2014.

01:37.064 --> 01:42.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republican nominee made a
quick visit
to a water plant and a local
church.

01:42.102 --> 01:46.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But as Trump turned to
criticizing his opponent,
the minister interrupted:

01:46.306 --> 01:51.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Hillary failed on the economy,
just like she

01:51.511 --> 01:53.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has failed on foreign policy.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Everything she touched didn't
work out.

01:54.781 --> 01:55.749 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Nothing.

01:55.782 --> 01:56.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now, Hillary Clinton...

01:57.017 --> 01:58.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Mr. Trump, I invited you
here to thank
us for...

01:58.618 --> 02:00.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Oh, oh, oh, OK,
OK.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Not to give a political
speech.

02:01.655 --> 02:02.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: OK.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.424 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's good.

02:04.458 --> 02:07.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Trump was also
heckled, but
he promised quick relief for
Flint, if he's

02:07.995 --> 02:09.896 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
elected.

02:09.930 --> 02:14.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Word of his coming, though,
wasn't well-received
by Democratic Mayor Karen
Weaver, who backs

02:14.468 --> 02:16.203 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hillary Clinton.

02:16.236 --> 02:21.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She said: "Flint is focused on
fixing the
problems caused by lead
contamination of our

02:21.675 --> 02:24.544 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
drinking water, not photo-ops."

02:24.578 --> 02:30.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Earlier, Trump taped an
interview with "The
Dr. Oz Show," and gave the host
of a one-page

02:30.550 --> 02:34.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
summary of a medical exam he had
last week.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The campaign declined to say
what was in summary.

02:37.024 --> 02:41.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The interview airs tomorrow.

02:41.128 --> 02:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton is expected to resume
campaigning
tomorrow, after a bout with
pneumonia.

02:46.833 --> 02:52.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Late today, her aides released
an overall
medical update from Clinton's
physician.

02:52.305 --> 02:57.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It said she continues taking
medication to
control a previously known
thyroid condition

02:57.911 --> 02:59.279 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and blood clots.

02:59.312 --> 03:02.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Otherwise, the doctor found her
in sound health.

03:02.983 --> 03:08.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, her husband, former
President Bill
Clinton, carried her cause to
Las Vegas.

03:08.555 --> 03:10.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL CLINTON, Former President
of the United
States: We need to get over all
these crazy

03:11.024 --> 03:14.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
divisions and go into the future
together.

03:14.061 --> 03:15.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's Hillary's position.

03:15.162 --> 03:16.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's what stronger together
means.

03:16.763 --> 03:18.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:18.598 --> 03:23.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, both
major party
nominees, especially Trump, came
in for stinging

03:23.937 --> 03:31.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
criticism from former Secretary
of State Colin
Powell in personal e-mails
stolen by hackers

03:31.411 --> 03:33.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and leaked to BuzzFeed.

03:33.947 --> 03:40.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In one, Powell called Trump --
quote -- "a
national disgrace and an
international pariah."

03:40.687 --> 03:48.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And about Hillary Clinton, he
said: "Everything
HRC touches, she kind of screws
up with hubris."

03:48.462 --> 03:54.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on the foundation front,
former President
Clinton and daughter Chelsea
will leave the

03:54.601 --> 04:00.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
board of a health group
connected to the Clinton
Foundation if Hillary Clinton is
elected.

04:00.874 --> 04:06.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the state attorney general
in New York
is now investigating whether
Donald Trump's

04:06.179 --> 04:10.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
foundation violated state laws
on nonprofits.

04:10.050 --> 04:14.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will return to the state of
the presidential
race later in the program.

04:14.454 --> 04:19.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the day's other
news: The U.S.
signed a record aid agreement
with Israel

04:19.192 --> 04:22.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
worth $38 billion over 10 years.

04:22.462 --> 04:25.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The ceremony took place at the
State Department.

04:25.198 --> 04:30.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
National security adviser Susan
Rice called
it a reminder of America's
unshakable commitment

04:30.737 --> 04:32.506 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Israel.

04:32.539 --> 04:34.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN RICE, U.S. National
Security Adviser:
This marks a significant
increase over our

04:34.608 --> 04:40.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
existing funding, and it will
ensure that
Israel has the support it needs
to defend

04:40.413 --> 04:46.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
itself, by itself, and to
preserve its qualitative
military edge.

04:46.786 --> 04:53.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the single largest
pledge of military
assistance to any country in us
history.

04:53.326 --> 04:58.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The agreement came
in spite of
strained relations with Israel
over the Iran

04:58.131 --> 05:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nuclear deal and other issues.

05:00.233 --> 05:06.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Former Israeli
President Shimon
Peres is slightly improved
tonight, 24 hours

05:06.206 --> 05:08.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after a major stroke.

05:08.141 --> 05:13.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His doctor says the Nobel Peace
Prize winner
has regained consciousness, and
reacts to

05:13.647 --> 05:14.614 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stimulation.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Peres is 93 years old.

05:16.416 --> 05:21.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The cease-fire in
Syria still
appears to be holding, but
humanitarian aid

05:21.688 --> 05:23.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is largely stalled.

05:23.456 --> 05:29.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey's ruling party did send a
pair of aid
trucks to a Syrian border town
today.

05:29.229 --> 05:31.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They carried food and children's
toys.

05:32.032 --> 05:38.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But two United Nations convoys
bound for Aleppo
remained stuck, despite pleas
from the secretary-general.

05:38.572 --> 05:45.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BAN KI-MOON, United Nations
Secretary-General:
It is crucially important that
the necessary

05:45.245 --> 05:51.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
arrangements, security
arrangements, should
be given, so that they can be
allowed to cross

05:51.651 --> 05:53.787 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the lines.

05:53.820 --> 05:54.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We are working very hard.

05:54.988 --> 05:56.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We are very much committed.

05:56.890 --> 06:01.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The cease-fire is
due to run through
Sunday, but the U.S. and Russia
agreed today

06:01.628 --> 06:03.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to extend it another two days.

06:04.030 --> 06:08.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In China,
authorities have
cracked down on a village known
for grassroots

06:08.368 --> 06:10.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
public demonstrations.

06:10.270 --> 06:16.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The raids began early Tuesday,
after new protests
in Wukan over the arrest of a
local chief.

06:17.010 --> 06:22.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Residents say police descended
on the village,
firing rubber bullets and tear
gas, as villagers

06:23.016 --> 06:24.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hurled rocks back at them.

06:24.818 --> 06:30.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A supertyphoon
battered Taiwan
today, with winds topping 140
miles an hour.

06:30.890 --> 06:34.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's the strongest storm
anywhere in the world
this year.

06:34.527 --> 06:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The powerful wind and heavy rain
knocked out
power to more than
half-a-million homes and

06:39.899 --> 06:42.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shut down air and train travel.

06:42.736 --> 06:47.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Julia
dumped rain
along the Southeastern U.S.
coast.

06:47.274 --> 06:52.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: U.S. soldier
Chelsea Manning
has ended a hunger strike in
prison, after

06:52.646 --> 06:56.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Army agreed for gender
transition surgery.

06:56.683 --> 07:01.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement, Manning welcomed
the move,
and said -- quote -- "This is
all I wanted,

07:01.121 --> 07:03.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for them to let me be me."

07:03.556 --> 07:10.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2013, then-Private Bradley
Manning got
35 years for passing secrets to
WikiLeaks.

07:10.363 --> 07:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Later, she announced that she
identifies as
a woman.

07:13.466 --> 07:18.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Atlantic Coast

joined the NCAA today in pulling
its championships

07:18.838 --> 07:20.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from North Carolina.

07:20.473 --> 07:25.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It cited a state law limiting
protections
for transgender people and
others.

07:25.312 --> 07:29.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the Republican leader of the
statehouse
insisted he won't back down.

07:29.115 --> 07:32.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A major merger
may be on the
way.

07:32.352 --> 07:39.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Germany's Bayer AG offered $66
billion for
Monsanto today, and the U.S.
seed maker accepted.

07:39.993 --> 07:44.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They would control a quarter of
the world
market for seeds and pesticides.

07:44.097 --> 07:47.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's subject to approval from
shareholders
and regulators.

07:47.400 --> 07:52.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And on Wall Street,
the Dow Jones
industrial average lost nearly
32 points to

07:52.405 --> 07:54.841 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
close at 18034.

07:54.874 --> 08:00.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 18 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
dropped a point.

08:00.046 --> 08:04.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the differences
between Donald Trump and Hillary
Clinton when

08:04.217 --> 08:11.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it comes to child care; the road
to 270, how
each candidate could win the
Electoral College;

08:11.691 --> 08:18.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forced marriage here in the
United States;
and much more.

08:18.531 --> 08:31.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Child care is one
of the biggest
expenses many American families
face, surpassing

08:31.244 --> 08:35.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the cost of college tuition and
rent in more
than 30 states.

08:36.015 --> 08:41.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When it comes to providing paid
family leave,
the U.S. lags behind every other
developed

08:41.521 --> 08:42.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
country in the world.

08:42.922 --> 08:46.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a cause long championed by
Democrats.

08:46.159 --> 08:51.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now the Republican nominee
for president
is out with a new plan that
seems to break

08:51.231 --> 08:53.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with conservative orthodoxy.

08:53.900 --> 08:55.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Correspondent Lisa Desjardins
reports.

08:55.902 --> 09:01.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The two who
would be president
of all are focused on the very
youngest Americans,

09:01.908 --> 09:03.743 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our children.

09:03.777 --> 09:09.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Outside of Philadelphia Tuesday
night, Donald
Trump became the first GOP
nominee to propose

09:09.082 --> 09:11.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
paid family leave and child care
help.

09:11.317 --> 09:14.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
We need working mothers to be
fairly compensated

09:14.821 --> 09:20.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for their work, and have access
to affordable,
quality child care for their
kids.

09:20.994 --> 09:24.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: How would Trump
provide that
access and care?

09:24.464 --> 09:29.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, Trump would push for
mothers, but not
fathers, to receive six weeks of
paid maternity

09:29.936 --> 09:31.704 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
leave.

09:31.738 --> 09:35.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, he proposes that child
care costs be
fully deductible for families
making less

09:35.241 --> 09:37.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than $500,000 a year.

09:37.911 --> 09:42.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Total cost is not clear, but
Trump says he
would pay for this all by
cracking down on

09:42.916 --> 09:45.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
unemployment insurance fraud.

09:45.084 --> 09:48.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The family friendly turn is
family-generated.

09:48.588 --> 09:54.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's daughter Ivanka helped
craft the policy,
and today charged the Democratic
nominee has

09:54.093 --> 09:55.995 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
failed.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IVANKA TRUMP, Daughter of Donald
Trump: Hillary
Clinton has been around for
decades and there's

09:57.530 --> 10:01.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no policy benefiting either
mothers or fathers
in terms of paid leave.

10:01.568 --> 10:04.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Ron Haskins is
director of
the Center on Children and
Families at the

10:04.971 --> 10:06.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Brookings Institution.

10:06.673 --> 10:07.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RON HASKINS, Director, Center on
Children
and Families, Brookings
Institution: I think

10:07.574 --> 10:10.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's quite a big deal for
Republicans.

10:10.710 --> 10:15.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans have not been noted
for making
parental leave proposals.

10:15.415 --> 10:18.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it is at least somewhat
surprising.

10:18.318 --> 10:23.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would even call it quite
surprising that
Trump would make a proposal like
this.

10:23.356 --> 10:27.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It wouldn't get much support, I
think, in
a Republican Congress.

10:27.093 --> 10:32.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Now to Hillary
Clinton, who
has stressed childhood issues
for decades.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What's her plan?

10:34.033 --> 10:37.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All parents would get 12 weeks
of paid leave.

10:37.170 --> 10:41.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Child care costs would be kept
to 10 percent
of the family's income for most
families,

10:41.908 --> 10:45.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
though Clinton hasn't shown
exactly how she'd
achieve that.

10:45.411 --> 10:49.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she'd pay for it all by
raising taxes
on the wealthy.

10:49.148 --> 10:54.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton would also use those
taxes to make
preschool universal starting at
4 years old.

10:54.420 --> 10:57.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
We have to make it easier to be
good workers,

10:57.156 --> 11:00.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
good parents, and good
caregivers, all at
the same time.

11:00.493 --> 11:04.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This is further
than Clinton
went just two years ago on
mandatory paid

11:04.998 --> 11:08.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leave, when she told CNN it was
too soon politically.

11:08.701 --> 11:10.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But now things have changed.

11:10.603 --> 11:15.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both presidential nominees are
pushing for
paid family leave at the same
time, and perhaps

11:15.041 --> 11:16.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with good reason.

11:16.809 --> 11:21.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Polling shows that paid family
leave gets
the support of over 70 percent
of Americans

11:21.414 --> 11:26.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over age 40, and that's the same
group that
has the highest turnout in
elections.

11:26.452 --> 11:31.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

11:31.925 --> 11:42.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The latest national
polls show
a tightening in the race to the
White House,

11:42.869 --> 11:45.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
especially in key states like
Ohio and Florida.

11:45.939 --> 11:50.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when it comes down to it,
winning in November
will depend on which candidate
has a viable

11:50.677 --> 11:53.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
path to 270 electoral votes.

11:53.880 --> 11:59.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more, we're joined by John
Brabender,
Republican strategist and chief
creative officer

11:59.052 --> 12:04.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for BrabenderCox, a political
media firm,
and Bill Burton, former deputy
White House

12:04.390 --> 12:10.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
press secretary under President
Obama and
currently California managing
director for

12:10.897 --> 12:12.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SKDKnickerbocker.

12:12.732 --> 12:17.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Brabender, give us a map,
give us a tour
of what it takes for Donald
Trump to get to

12:17.570 --> 12:19.072 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
270.

12:19.105 --> 12:19.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN BRABENDER, Republican
Strategist: Well,
I'm going to oversimplify it

12:19.572 --> 12:21.007 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: OK.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN BRABENDER: You first start
by winning
every state Mitt Romney won.

12:22.542 --> 12:23.509 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

12:23.543 --> 12:25.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Is that possible?

12:25.345 --> 12:26.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRABENDER: The tough one,
probably, if
there is one, it's probably
North Carolina.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That will be a battleground.

12:28.781 --> 12:32.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That doesn't get you anywhere
near 270, because
Mitt Romney wasn't anywhere near
270.

12:32.318 --> 12:34.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, there's two different paths
you can go.

12:34.887 --> 12:40.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You win a whole bunch of small
states and
cobble them together, which is
almost impossible.

12:40.960 --> 12:45.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To me, the logical path then is
where could
have Romney maybe have won and
didn't?

12:45.298 --> 12:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And you look at Ohio, Florida.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You're still not there.

12:49.936 --> 12:52.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now you have got to win either
Pennsylvania
or Michigan.

12:52.438 --> 12:57.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think Pennsylvania is
probably a little
bit more doable than Michigan,
but, again,

12:57.210 --> 13:00.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
neither one of those states have
the Republicans
won since 1988.

13:00.113 --> 13:04.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Bill Burton, take
that map and
add what you would think that
Hillary Clinton

13:04.550 --> 13:06.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
needs to get to 270.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL BURTON, Former Deputy White
House Press
Secretary: Well, I think you
start in the

13:08.321 --> 13:10.189 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
same place.

13:10.223 --> 13:13.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You look at the states Obama won
and wonder,
well, where would Hillary
Clinton have a problem

13:13.660 --> 13:16.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and where does Donald Trump have
problems?

13:16.262 --> 13:20.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the truth is, Donald Trump
is not showing
strength in any of the big
states that he

13:20.800 --> 13:23.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would need in order to actually
get to 270.

13:23.503 --> 13:26.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Hillary Clinton is showing
herself to
be remarkably stable in all the
states that

13:26.773 --> 13:28.708 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
she needs.

13:28.741 --> 13:31.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think that Florida, Ohio,
Michigan, Pennsylvania,
all those states actually look
pretty good

13:31.778 --> 13:33.613 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for Hillary Clinton right now.

13:33.646 --> 13:38.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while Donald Trump is
showing some strength
in places like Iowa, it's just
not enough

13:38.484 --> 13:42.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get him close to getting the
electoral
votes that he needs to win.

13:42.121 --> 13:46.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: John Brabender, we
know that he
did incredibly well in the
primaries.

13:46.225 --> 13:48.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We didn't expect Donald Trump to
do as well
as he did.

13:49.028 --> 13:52.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can he use that megaphone or
alter it in some
way to have it apply in the
general election?

13:52.999 --> 13:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN BRABENDER: I think to some
degree.

13:54.133 --> 13:55.568 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Pennsylvania is a good example.

13:55.601 --> 13:58.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He won every one of the 67
counties.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Pennsylvania might be a
parochial state, but
it's not a homogeneous state.

14:01.974 --> 14:05.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, even among just Republican
voters, to
be able to pull that off, when
you have very

14:05.511 --> 14:09.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moderate voters on one side of
the state and
more conservative in the middle,
shows that

14:09.115 --> 14:11.184 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he has very, very broad support.

14:11.217 --> 14:14.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second thing, in fairness to
the Trump
people, if you look at the most
recent numbers,

14:15.021 --> 14:19.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're actually doing well in
Ohio, winning,
winning in a lot of polls in
Florida, and

14:19.692 --> 14:22.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now Pennsylvania and Michigan
have both tightened.

14:22.328 --> 14:24.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're not ahead, but they have
tightened.

14:24.630 --> 14:26.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's a good trend.

14:26.432 --> 14:29.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Bill Burton, one of
the things
that Democrats say is that
Donald Trump gets

14:29.435 --> 14:33.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of free media and that
that's a disadvantage
for Hillary Clinton.

14:33.539 --> 14:36.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can the free media lift him to
where he needs
to be?

14:36.309 --> 14:37.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Isn't that a potential threat to
her?

14:37.944 --> 14:41.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BILL BURTON: Well, I do have to
give their
campaign a little bit of credit.

14:41.147 --> 14:44.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Monica Langley has a great piece
in The Wall
Street Journal today about how
they're trying

14:44.851 --> 14:49.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to create different kinds of
moments for Donald
Trump, as opposed to just him
shouting at

14:49.422 --> 14:51.190 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rallies.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're trying to get him in
classrooms, and
in churches, and in diners and
places where

14:53.960 --> 14:56.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he can make a more personal
connection.

14:56.295 --> 15:02.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, obviously, the strategy has
its setbacks,
as you saw today, Donald Trump
in a church

15:02.568 --> 15:06.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
getting interrupted by the
pastor because
he started attacking Hillary
Clinton.

15:06.239 --> 15:10.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that if he does
really want to
make gains, if he does want to
find a path

15:10.777 --> 15:16.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to those voters who are in the
middle, then
he needs to do different things
than just

15:16.215 --> 15:17.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
do these rallies.

15:17.683 --> 15:19.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, I think he's
actually doing
a pretty good job of that.

15:19.852 --> 15:23.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's still pretty limited in the
effect that
he can have because he so
disqualified himself

15:23.790 --> 15:27.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with such a large number of
voters that I
don't think that there is an
actual a path

15:27.493 --> 15:29.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to victory for him.

15:29.328 --> 15:32.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he is at least doing a
better -- engaging
in a better strategy than he had
previously.

15:32.732 --> 15:34.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But, John, isn't
there a reason
for that?

15:34.667 --> 15:39.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That we see him in a church in
Detroit, Michigan
not a state that he's
necessarily competing

15:40.006 --> 15:45.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in, that we see him bring forth
the child
care program, isn't that to try
to address

15:45.411 --> 15:47.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the issues that Bill Burton is
talking about?

15:47.413 --> 15:51.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN BRABENDER: Well, I think
what it's to
do is to make him more likable.

15:51.684 --> 15:54.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here's the biggest problem I
think Donald
Trump has.

15:54.153 --> 15:58.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's not getting enough votes
today of the
people who already say they
don't like Hillary

15:58.858 --> 15:59.826 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton.

15:59.859 --> 16:00.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so I agree with Bill.

16:01.027 --> 16:02.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I agree with the pastor.

16:02.762 --> 16:05.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think Donald Trump has
to be out there
making the case against Hillary
Clinton.

16:05.531 --> 16:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think people have known her 24
years.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How you feel about her, you feel
about her.

16:09.735 --> 16:13.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What they're still unsure about,
particularly
some moderate Republicans, we
know gender

16:13.472 --> 16:17.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is difference, I think
Donald Trump
has to seal the deal by letting
people feel

16:17.243 --> 16:18.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
comfortable to vote for him.

16:18.978 --> 16:22.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Bill, you used to
work with David
Plouffe, who ran the Obama
campaign.

16:22.782 --> 16:28.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said that -- I think it
was yesterday
-- he said this depends on who's
showing up,

16:28.154 --> 16:32.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the composition of the voters
that everyone
is fighting for.

16:33.025 --> 16:36.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What do you think the
composition has to be
in order for Hillary Clinton to
win?

16:36.796 --> 16:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL BURTON: Well, something
that is interesting
about the current polling is
that, as you

16:40.399 --> 16:45.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
watch Hillary's numbers
fluctuate, part of
the reason that they are is
because the Obama

16:45.371 --> 16:52.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coalition, younger voters,
African-American
voters, Latino voters, they're
not showing

16:52.111 --> 16:55.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up in as large a number for her
as they did
for President Obama.

16:56.015 --> 16:59.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for that reason, I actually
think that
her numbers are artificially
low.

16:59.852 --> 17:04.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that, at the end of the
day, those
voters are going to join ranks,
and it is

17:04.590 --> 17:06.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to help propel Hillary
Clinton to victory.

17:06.626 --> 17:09.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We have seen -- I'm
going to stay
with you for a moment, Bill,
because we have

17:09.595 --> 17:14.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seen in the last few days a big
debate over
the deplorables comment that
Hillary Clinton

17:14.767 --> 17:16.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
made the other night.

17:16.202 --> 17:19.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I wonder if part of that
debate isn't
about this very issue.

17:19.872 --> 17:26.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you win over the people
either who
are offended by portions of the
Trump coalition,

17:26.445 --> 17:30.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or how does Trump, in turn, tar
her as being
intolerant?

17:30.983 --> 17:32.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Isn't that about part of this?

17:32.518 --> 17:36.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BILL BURTON: I think that that
conversation
is happening along the edges.

17:36.222 --> 17:39.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think that the folks who
are in the
middle look at the conversation
over whether

17:39.859 --> 17:43.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or not Donald Trump's campaign
is racist or
whether or not Hillary Clinton
should use

17:43.362 --> 17:48.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that term to describe some of
his supporters
made sense, I don't think that
the folks in

17:48.301 --> 17:49.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the middle are looking at that
debate.

17:49.969 --> 17:53.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think they're more looking at
these two
candidates.

17:53.139 --> 17:57.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a band of voters with which
neither candidate
has very high approval ratings.

17:57.443 --> 18:01.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're trying to make up
their mind on
who has a better plan for the
economy, whose

18:01.948 --> 18:04.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
presidency would more positively
impact my
life?

18:04.517 --> 18:09.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that debate happens
sort of among
people who have already made up
their minds.

18:09.155 --> 18:11.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: What do you think
about that,
John Brabender?

18:11.123 --> 18:13.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN BRABENDER: Well, I agree.

18:13.059 --> 18:15.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sometimes, we all go on these
shows and we
have this debate over
deplorable, not deplorable.

18:15.995 --> 18:19.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's not what people
around their dining
room table are talking about at
night.

18:19.732 --> 18:24.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the things Trump has done
is tie into
particularly what would be the
sons and daughters

18:24.503 --> 18:30.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Reagan Democrats in places
like Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Wisconsin, Michigan, who are
voting for him

18:30.376 --> 18:34.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because they feel both parties
left them on
the economic battlefield.

18:34.547 --> 18:38.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They feel Washington doesn't
understand their
lives anymore, and they feel
that even though

18:38.551 --> 18:42.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump might make a
mistake with what
he says from time to time, they
see that as

18:42.521 --> 18:47.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
authenticity and maybe somebody
who will truly
pay attention to them, because
they feel ignored.

18:47.660 --> 18:50.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And there are,
briefly, enough
of those people to get 270 for
Donald Trump?

18:50.963 --> 18:52.732 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN BRABENDER: Well, here's the
thing.

18:52.765 --> 18:56.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a state like Pennsylvania,
the paradox
is, to win, you have to get the
conservative

18:56.402 --> 19:00.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats in the west, but you
still have
to do well with the
collar-county moderates

19:00.673 --> 19:02.108 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the east.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Romney did fine with the
moderates, but not
the conservative Democrats.

19:04.844 --> 19:07.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump is doing well with the
conservative
Democrats.

19:07.546 --> 19:09.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now Trump has to seal the deal
with the moderates
in the east.

19:10.016 --> 19:12.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Fifty-six days,
guys.

19:12.051 --> 19:15.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Brabender, Bill Burton,
thank you both
very much.

19:15.221 --> 19:20.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BILL BURTON: Thank you.

19:20.292 --> 19:25.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN BRABENDER: Thank you.

19:25.364 --> 19:28.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

19:28.768 --> 19:36.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Uber debuts self-driving
cars; manmade noise disturbing
the ocean's

19:36.509 --> 19:41.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wildlife; and restoring federal
education
grants for prisoners.

19:41.580 --> 19:48.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: Today on Capitol
Hill, a Senate
hearing looked into ending the
practice overseas

19:48.120 --> 19:49.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of child marriage.

19:49.955 --> 19:54.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But what wasn't examined
thousands of American
girls and women here in the
United States

19:55.027 --> 19:58.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who are forced into marriage
every year.

19:58.197 --> 20:02.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the first of two parts,
special correspondent
Gayle Tzemach Lemmon reports.

20:02.902 --> 20:08.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: For Nina
Van Harn, raising
her children today is a radical
departure

20:08.974 --> 20:10.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from her own upbringing.

20:10.643 --> 20:14.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NINA VAN HARN, Michigan: My
childhood was
part magical, and part
complicated.

20:14.447 --> 20:18.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: She was
raised in rural
Michigan on a 40-acre farm in a
tight-knit

20:18.984 --> 20:23.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
community that practiced a
conservative form
of evangelical Christianity.

20:23.689 --> 20:28.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Its members largely kept to
themselves, more
"Little House on the Prairie"
than modern-day

20:28.561 --> 20:29.795 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
America.

20:29.829 --> 20:33.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Growing up, she always knew one
day was coming.

20:33.365 --> 20:35.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She recorded its arrival in her
diary.

20:35.601 --> 20:39.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NINA VAN HARN: "Dear Kit (ph)"
-- that was
the name of the girl in the
journal -- "You

20:39.438 --> 20:41.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will never guess what happened
today.

20:41.540 --> 20:45.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This morning after breakfast,
papa sat Naomi
(ph) and I down at the kitchen
table and nailed

20:45.377 --> 20:47.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
us both with a load of bricks.

20:47.446 --> 20:49.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He believes he found husbands
for both of
us."

20:49.415 --> 20:51.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Van Harn
had turned
19.

20:52.017 --> 20:53.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She was legally an adult.

20:53.819 --> 20:57.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was no gun to her head, no
chains around
her wrists.

20:57.690 --> 21:02.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But because of lifelong
pressures from her
family and her upbringing, she
considers herself

21:02.795 --> 21:06.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of thousands of American
women and girls
forced into marriage each year.

21:06.799 --> 21:09.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NINA VAN HARN: I knew that I
wasn't going
to say no.

21:09.735 --> 21:10.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This was God's will.

21:10.836 --> 21:12.638 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
God had spoken.

21:12.671 --> 21:15.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it was just not even an
option.

21:15.307 --> 21:21.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I didn't think consciously in my
head I'm
being forced.

21:21.313 --> 21:25.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRISTINA BICCHIERI, University
of Pennsylvania:
This is part of, if you will,
psychological

21:25.885 --> 21:27.686 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
manipulation.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Cristina
Bicchieri is
a professor of philosophy and
psychology at

21:30.823 --> 21:34.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the University of Pennsylvania
whose work
focuses on social norms.

21:34.693 --> 21:40.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She says these marriage
practices are more
typical of close-knit,
conservative communities,

21:40.132 --> 21:42.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people with little contact to
the outside
world.

21:42.968 --> 21:50.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRISTINA BICCHIERI: Your choices
are much
more restricted, and also it is
the case that

21:50.142 --> 21:58.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even if the girl or the boy give
their consent,
it is force in the sense that
only they don't

21:58.150 --> 22:04.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
know or conceive of an
alternative, but it
is a terrifying thing to abandon
their community.

22:04.657 --> 22:05.624 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's scary.

22:05.658 --> 22:06.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where do they go?

22:07.026 --> 22:08.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Whom do they talk to?

22:09.028 --> 22:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: For Nina
Van Harn, there
was no one and nowhere to go.

22:14.633 --> 22:16.535 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And then it was her wedding day.

22:16.569 --> 22:22.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NINA VAN HARN: I do remember
being very nervous,
and yet knowing that I needed to
be smiling,

22:22.741 --> 22:23.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and I was supposed to be happy.

22:24.009 --> 22:28.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just looked in the mirror
and I thought,
this is it.

22:28.214 --> 22:32.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Nina's
husband wasn't
physically abusive, but
throughout over a

22:32.851 --> 22:38.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decade marriage, she says that
she suffered
psychological abuse, under
severe pressure

22:38.090 --> 22:41.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from her family and community.

22:41.126 --> 22:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every household chore, every
meal she cooked,
every family visit, even sexual
interaction,

22:47.366 --> 22:49.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she said, came to feel like
imprisonment.

22:49.568 --> 23:00.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NINA VAN HARN: When you don't
consent willingly
to be with someone, then
acquiesce their requests,

23:00.112 --> 23:02.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it doesn't make it a yes.

23:02.481 --> 23:04.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It makes it, hey, I want to
survive today.

23:04.950 --> 23:09.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: An
attorney for her
husband after an initial
response to "PBS

23:09.855 --> 23:15.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NewsHour" didn't respond to
further inquiries,
and her father didn't respond to
multiple

23:15.160 --> 23:17.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
contact attempts.

23:17.596 --> 23:19.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Numbers are hard to come by.

23:19.331 --> 23:24.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But one recent study by a group
that works
against forced marriage found as
many 3,000

23:24.103 --> 23:25.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cases in a two-year period.

23:25.904 --> 23:30.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Legally, marriage is between two
adults, age
18 years or older.

23:30.376 --> 23:33.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But every state in the country
allows for
exceptions.

23:33.846 --> 23:37.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Critics say these exceptions
endanger young
people, not help them.

23:38.017 --> 23:43.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Advocates say children as young
as 12 have
been married with the consent of
their parents,

23:43.055 --> 23:45.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
according to state data.

23:45.291 --> 23:50.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ten states also allow underage
girls to be
married if they become pregnant.

23:50.362 --> 23:55.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But critics point out that those
laws may
actually be used to legitimize
other crimes,

23:55.401 --> 23:58.203 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
such as rape.

23:58.237 --> 24:03.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a first-of-its-kind lawsuit,
Nina Van Harn
decided to sue the state of
Michigan for an

24:03.575 --> 24:08.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
annulment on the grounds that
her marriage
wasn't consensual, and was, in
fact, based

24:08.914 --> 24:10.516 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on compulsion.

24:10.549 --> 24:17.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With no legal precedent in the
matter, she
had to build the case from
scratch.

24:17.256 --> 24:22.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She left her husband and moved
to a nearby
city, where she now lives a much
less conservative

24:22.361 --> 24:23.429 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lifestyle.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The rest of her family ceased
all contact.

24:26.465 --> 24:31.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she and her former spouse
share joint
custody of their three children.

24:31.603 --> 24:34.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The case, she said, took on a
deep personal
significance.

24:34.807 --> 24:41.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NINA VAN HARN: I felt just a
sense that I
was going to actually not only
get away from

24:41.647 --> 24:44.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him, but I was going to get
free.

24:44.249 --> 24:46.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: That's
what an annulment
meant to you?

24:46.985 --> 24:47.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NINA VAN HARN: Uh-huh.

24:47.986 --> 24:48.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It meant freedom.

24:48.987 --> 24:51.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it meant a peace in my
conscience.

24:51.457 --> 24:55.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: When you
look at these
pictures, what goes through your
mind?

24:55.294 --> 24:59.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRAIDY REISS, Unchained at Last:
It's like
looking at a different person.

24:59.264 --> 25:00.999 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's like looking at a stranger.

25:01.033 --> 25:05.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Fraidy
Reiss felt similar
pressures in a very different
place.

25:05.070 --> 25:09.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She grew up in an ultra-orthodox
Jewish family
in Brooklyn, and she says that
the pressure

25:09.975 --> 25:13.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she faced to get married was
obvious.

25:13.879 --> 25:19.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even though she was legally an
adult, 19 years
old, she said felt she had no
choice.

25:19.284 --> 25:22.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRAIDY REISS: You have never
been on a date
before.

25:22.888 --> 25:26.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And your whole life, you have
been told, you
need to get married right away.

25:26.558 --> 25:28.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You're terrified.

25:28.293 --> 25:31.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Reiss
Reiss was arranged
to marry a man whom she'd barely
met.

25:31.663 --> 25:36.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She remembers the ceremony as a
joyous time,
but she says her marriage took a
turn for

25:36.835 --> 25:38.170 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the worse.

25:38.203 --> 25:39.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRAIDY REISS: He would describe
to me how
he was going to kill me.

25:40.005 --> 25:41.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: In detail.

25:41.673 --> 25:43.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FRAIDY REISS: In detail.

25:43.475 --> 25:45.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He would describe to me in
detail until my
-- he would explain how I was
going to take

25:45.844 --> 25:47.579 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my last breath.

25:47.613 --> 25:50.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: The
threats prompted
Reiss to seek a restraining
order in a New

25:50.549 --> 25:55.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jersey state court, which was
granted in 2010,
and remains in force.

25:55.788 --> 26:02.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Divorce is considered sinful in
Reiss' community,
and family and friends offered
little sympathy.

26:02.161 --> 26:04.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On her own, she decided to take
action.

26:04.430 --> 26:08.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRAIDY REISS: My first plan was,
I'm just
going to get out of this
marriage, and then

26:09.001 --> 26:10.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it became, I'm going to get out
of this entire
situation.

26:11.003 --> 26:17.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Reiss left
the community,
and set out for what she
considered the unknown.

26:17.709 --> 26:23.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her family felt so betrayed, in
fact, that
they cut off all contact.

26:23.115 --> 26:27.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Professor Bicchieri says Reiss'
decision to
leave puts her in a rare
category.

26:27.319 --> 26:30.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CRISTINA BICCHIERI: Let's call
this woman
a trendsetter.

26:30.989 --> 26:38.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will show to other women --
or it may not
be a woman -- can be a man, et
cetera -- that

26:38.130 --> 26:46.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it is possible to act against
the norm of
the community, is an example.

26:46.839 --> 26:48.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have more propensity to
risk.

26:48.674 --> 26:51.643 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They are more autonomous.

26:51.677 --> 27:00.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And another important element is
that they
must believe that their
rebelling in some

27:00.919 --> 27:04.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sense will be efficacious, that
they will
succeed.

27:04.289 --> 27:07.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Reiss
moved to New Jersey
with her two daughters.

27:07.993 --> 27:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her ex-husband retains some
visitation rights
to the girls.

27:15.167 --> 27:20.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reiss started a nonprofit called
Unchained
at Last that lobbies to enact
tighter legislation

27:20.606 --> 27:23.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
addressing forced marriage
across the United
States.

27:23.475 --> 27:26.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRAIDY REISS: When people hear
about this,
they say, oh, well, that's just
happening

27:26.845 --> 27:30.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this one religion, or that's
just happening
in this one immigrant community.

27:30.682 --> 27:32.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's a way to abdicate
responsibility.

27:32.918 --> 27:37.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's so important to raise
awareness about
this and to talk about this
publicly, because

27:37.723 --> 27:40.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you can't solve a problem that
nobody knows
exists.

27:40.993 --> 27:45.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Back in
Michigan, Nina
Van Harn and her lawyer, Matt
Burns, pushed

27:45.731 --> 27:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ahead with their legal battle.

27:47.766 --> 27:51.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The challenges, they say, are
not just legal,
but cultural.

27:51.436 --> 27:54.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW BURNS, Attorney for Nina
Van Harn:
The goal isn't to eradicate
arranged marriage.

27:54.873 --> 28:00.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In many cultures, that is the
norm, and it's
accepted, and -- but there's, I
think, a fine

28:00.913 --> 28:07.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
line and probably a fair gray
area between
what's arranged and what's
forced.

28:07.953 --> 28:12.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so that's, I think, another
difficulty
that we face here.

28:12.658 --> 28:17.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: While not
confronted
with physical abuse, Van Harn
overcame great

28:17.696 --> 28:20.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
psychological hurdles in
building her case.

28:20.332 --> 28:26.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NINA VAN HARN: When I walked
out, I didn't
just walk out on this person.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I walked out of my whole family.

28:28.674 --> 28:31.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I walked out of my community.

28:31.276 --> 28:35.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I walked out on many parts of
what had been
my faith.

28:35.847 --> 28:41.420 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I had to run very fast.

28:41.453 --> 28:43.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that was heart-wrenching
thing to do.

28:43.522 --> 28:50.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I did it because staying was
more frightening
than leaving.

28:50.929 --> 28:56.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Now she
hopes that this
case will help other women from
all backgrounds

28:56.401 --> 28:58.904 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
escape similar situations.

28:58.937 --> 29:04.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, she has a steady job
in human resources
at an auto dealer.

29:04.109 --> 29:06.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She leads an active, busy
family.

29:06.411 --> 29:11.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she has built a new group of
friends,
many of whom she met at a
support group sponsored

29:11.049 --> 29:12.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by a local women's shelter.

29:12.651 --> 29:14.419 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NINA VAN HARN: It's a community.

29:14.453 --> 29:18.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are a community that works
together to
help each other through life.

29:18.657 --> 29:20.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We are, in some ways,
co-parents.

29:20.892 --> 29:22.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's my family.

29:22.661 --> 29:25.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they mean everything to me.

29:25.130 --> 29:32.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: On August
1, Nina Van
Harn's husband agreed to annul
their marriage.

29:32.204 --> 29:38.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The end of this case, she hopes,
also will
mark a whole new a beginning for
her.

29:38.310 --> 29:42.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Gayle Tzemach
Lemmon in Michigan.

29:42.214 --> 29:48.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tomorrow, part
two of our series,
looking at American girls taken
overseas and

29:48.620 --> 29:50.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
forced into marriage.

29:50.289 --> 29:55.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, online, Gayle Tzemach
Lemmon describes
how she was able to persuade her
subjects

29:55.427 --> 29:56.828 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to come forward.

29:56.862 --> 30:01.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's on our Web site,

GWEN IFILL: Now: The Jetsons
future may be
arriving sooner than you think,
for better

30:14.446 --> 30:15.914 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or for worse.

30:15.947 --> 30:19.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Uber is experimenting with
self-driving cars.

30:19.384 --> 30:23.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Pittsburgh today, the company
began deploying
a small test fleet of the
vehicles around

30:24.022 --> 30:25.123 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the city.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has the story.

30:26.992 --> 30:30.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK, the first
thing to know,
Uber tried this with several
journalists this

30:31.029 --> 30:32.664 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
week.

30:32.698 --> 30:36.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Each self-driving car was
accompanied by a
human operator, who loosely kept
hands on

30:36.568 --> 30:37.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the steering wheel.

30:38.003 --> 30:41.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The cars are equipped with
sensors, radars
and light-mapping systems.

30:41.873 --> 30:46.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Select Uber customers in
Pittsburgh will be
able to opt into a driverless
car pickup.

Alex Davies writes about all
things transportation
for "Wired" magazine, and took a
ride in one

30:50.248 --> 30:51.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of Uber's self-driving cars.

30:51.917 --> 30:53.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He joins me now from San
Francisco.

30:53.785 --> 30:58.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Alex, unless you were a
friend of a Tesla
driver or a Google engineer,
you're one of

30:58.090 --> 31:00.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the first people to sit in the
back of one
of these cars.

31:00.192 --> 31:01.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What was the experience like?

31:02.027 --> 31:04.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX DAVIES, "Wired": So, for
the most part,
it was actually kind of just
like a regular

31:04.996 --> 31:11.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Uber ride, minus the fact that
it was clearly
a kind of carefully orchestrated
media preview.

31:11.236 --> 31:13.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's same way most Uber rides
start.

31:13.071 --> 31:17.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You pull out your phone, you
open up the Uber
app, and you hit -- enter your
destination.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Then you call up the car.

31:19.511 --> 31:23.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then what's going to happen
from now on
for some select customers in
Pittsburgh is,

31:23.949 --> 31:28.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it will say, hey, would you like
a self-driving
car, instead of some guy driving
in the street

31:28.820 --> 31:30.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who's trying to make extra
money?

31:30.122 --> 31:32.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you hit yes, then that's
what shows
up.

31:33.024 --> 31:38.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And basically a car -- right
now, they're
now using Ford Fusions covered
in this enormous

31:38.196 --> 31:44.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pile of sensors on the roof,
spinning light
scanners, radars, cameras.

31:44.302 --> 31:45.704 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That pulls up.

31:45.737 --> 31:48.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But after that, once you get in,
it works
more or less like a normal Uber.

31:48.807 --> 31:53.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You relax in the back seat and
the car drives
you exactly where you're going.

31:53.178 --> 31:56.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, we
mentioned the biggest
safety precaution, which has
been a human,

31:56.782 --> 31:59.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an engineer, a driver in the
car.

31:59.317 --> 32:03.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But what other kinds of
precautions has Uber
taken to roll this test out?

32:03.855 --> 32:09.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX DAVIES: So, first of all,
they're only
operating within a small select
area of downtown

32:09.361 --> 32:10.428 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Pittsburgh.

32:10.462 --> 32:13.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're open to about 12 square
miles right
now.

32:13.698 --> 32:18.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the reason they're limited
to that space
is that they will only send
their cars out

32:18.770 --> 32:22.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to areas that they have mapped
in extreme
detail.

32:22.407 --> 32:26.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That means that the car already
knows exactly
where every traffic light is.

32:26.778 --> 32:31.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It knows which lanes are
right-turn-only lanes,
which -- where it's allowed to
make a U-turn

32:31.416 --> 32:35.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or where it can't, what the
speed limit is
everywhere, and where
pedestrians are likely

32:36.021 --> 32:40.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to cross, where cars are usually
driving if
the lane lanes aren't super
well-marked.

32:40.625 --> 32:48.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, basically, it's kind of
slicing off the
riskier areas by only operating
in places

32:48.133 --> 32:50.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
where it knows what the
conditions are going
to be like.

32:50.435 --> 32:52.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, why
Pittsburgh?

32:52.304 --> 32:54.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALEX DAVIES: A couple of
reasons.

32:54.472 --> 32:59.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The biggest one is that
Pittsburgh is home
to Carnegie Mellon, which has --
Carnegie

32:59.945 --> 33:05.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mellon has one of the best
robotics programs
in the country and probably in
the world.

33:05.350 --> 33:09.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some of their engineers have
been studying
self-driving cars for 15 years
now, well before

33:09.721 --> 33:12.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anybody imagined that this could
really be
a thing.

33:12.824 --> 33:17.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, a lot of those guys and
women are now
working for Uber at its Advanced
Technology

33:17.762 --> 33:19.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Center in the city.

33:19.598 --> 33:25.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second reason is that Uber
has -- sorry
-- Pittsburgh has a lot of
different weather

33:25.170 --> 33:28.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conditions, unlike Silicon
Valley, which is
pretty much always sunny.

33:28.540 --> 33:33.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pittsburgh, you're going to have
to face snow
and rain and different weather
problems.

33:33.111 --> 33:36.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's a good challenge for
the cars to
learn how to solve.

33:36.081 --> 33:38.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the street grid isn't the
easiest to navigate.

33:38.617 --> 33:43.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, again, it's training cars to
take on more
complicated situations.

33:43.121 --> 33:47.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The third advantage to
Pittsburgh is that
Pennsylvania hasn't really
regulated this

33:47.692 --> 33:50.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
space yet, so Uber is free to do
pretty much
what it wants.

33:50.128 --> 33:56.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What is the
safety record
of autonomous vehicles to date,
and how is

33:56.201 --> 33:58.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Uber factoring that in to these
tests?

33:58.236 --> 34:03.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX DAVIES: So, overall, the
safety record
is excellent, because, for the
most part,

34:03.341 --> 34:08.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at least when you're talking
about fully autonomous
vehicles, they have always got a
man -- a

34:08.947 --> 34:13.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trained operator at the wheel
ready to take
over in any situation.

34:13.385 --> 34:20.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for example, Google, which
tests constantly
in Mountain View and in Austin
and a few other

34:20.125 --> 34:24.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
places, has had a few minor
accidents, but
nothing serious, nothing where
anyone's ever

34:24.896 --> 34:26.631 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been injured.

34:26.665 --> 34:30.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the same thing with Uber, at
least in
California, where it's required
to report

34:30.869 --> 34:33.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
any accidents, as are all
autonomous car operators.

34:33.972 --> 34:37.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Pennsylvania, it's not
exactly clear what
the record is, though they say
they haven't

34:37.676 --> 34:41.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had any accidents, just because
there are
no rules saying they have to
tell you if there

34:41.880 --> 34:42.847 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is one.

34:42.881 --> 34:43.848 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right.

34:43.882 --> 34:44.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, also, put this into
perspective.

34:45.016 --> 34:46.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why is Uber doing this?

34:46.318 --> 34:47.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have heard about Google.

34:47.319 --> 34:48.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have heard about Tesla.

34:48.586 --> 34:50.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have heard about auto
manufacturers.

34:50.956 --> 34:53.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's Uber's interest in having
autonomous
vehicles?

34:53.325 --> 34:58.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX DAVIES: So, Uber's interest
is natural,
because when you ask automakers,
for example,

34:58.663 --> 35:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well, when you think about an
autonomous fleet
of cars, what does that look
like, they will

35:02.033 --> 35:04.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tell you, well, it looks like
Uber.

35:04.135 --> 35:08.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a car that you don't have
to own or deal
with parking or maintenance that
shows up,

35:08.940 --> 35:11.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
picks you up and takes you where
you want
to go.

35:11.710 --> 35:17.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So if Uber can take its model,
which is already
enormously successful and
rapidly spreading

35:17.549 --> 35:21.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around the world, and it can
take out the
single most expensive part of
that, which

35:21.353 --> 35:27.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a human driver who takes half
or three-quarters
of every customer's fare, and
they can remove

35:27.359 --> 35:31.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that person from the equation,
then, all of
a sudden, the business gets a
lot more efficient

35:31.997 --> 35:33.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and a lot more profitable.

35:33.198 --> 35:34.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK.

35:34.799 --> 35:37.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And how far out is that future?

35:37.068 --> 35:40.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX DAVIES: So, Uber right now,
if you say,
well, when are you going to be
able to take

35:41.006 --> 35:44.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the engineers out of the cars,
they will say,
when it's safe, which is not a
particularly

35:44.309 --> 35:46.111 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
helpful answer.

35:46.144 --> 35:50.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you look at the timelines
other players
have put out, Baidu, which is
kind of the

35:50.382 --> 35:55.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chinese equivalent of Google,
says it wants
self-driving cars on streets in
2019.

35:55.253 --> 35:56.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Ford is targeting 2021.

35:57.022 --> 36:01.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think it's safe to say
that Uber will
be more or less on that
timeline, so three

36:01.993 --> 36:03.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to five years out.

36:03.862 --> 36:11.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Alex Davies from
"Wired" joining us from San
Francisco tonight,

36:11.136 --> 36:13.605 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thanks so much.

36:13.638 --> 36:16.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALEX DAVIES: Thank you.

36:16.975 --> 36:23.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There's a growing
problem for
marine life in the world's
oceans and waterways,

36:23.581 --> 36:25.383 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
manmade noise.

36:25.417 --> 36:30.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week, the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric
Administration released a new
decade-long

36:30.422 --> 36:34.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plan to try to deal with the way
it's affecting
life underwater.

36:34.826 --> 36:37.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Special correspondent Cat Wise
has our report.

36:37.429 --> 36:41.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of our weekly series
covering the
Leading Edge of science and
technology.

36:41.733 --> 36:47.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Beachgoers are drawn
to the water
this time of year to relax and
enjoy some

36:47.439 --> 36:48.973 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
peace and calm.

36:49.007 --> 36:51.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's what many describe
it's like under
the water, too.

36:51.743 --> 36:54.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: I would say it sounds
beautiful, relaxing.

36:54.779 --> 36:59.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: I think it sounds, like,
so peaceful,
like, I mean, just calm.

36:59.717 --> 37:04.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: But the calm near the
surface often
belies what it actually sounds
like deep beneath

37:04.622 --> 37:14.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the waves, especially if that's
where you
live.

37:14.065 --> 37:18.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over the last hundred years, as
humans have
increasingly used the world's
waterways for

37:18.603 --> 37:23.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shipping, defense, and natural
resources,
among other things, the level
and the amount

37:23.575 --> 37:28.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of manmade noises in marine
environments has
increased.

37:28.546 --> 37:33.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But many species of mammals,
fish, and even
invertebrates rely on sound to
communicate

37:33.251 --> 37:36.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
under the water to find food,
mates, and stay
safe.

37:36.721 --> 37:40.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And those vital communications,
in some areas,
are being drowned out.

37:40.391 --> 37:42.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARLA HOLT, National Oceanic and
Atmospheric
Administration: People don't
really realize

37:42.527 --> 37:44.195 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
how noisy it is.

37:44.229 --> 37:46.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Sound travels very well
underwater compared
to air.

37:46.798 --> 37:49.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So it can travel very long
distances.

37:49.501 --> 37:54.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Marla Holt is a
wildlife biologist
for the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration

37:54.539 --> 37:56.908 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Seattle.

37:56.941 --> 38:01.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She and other NOAA scientists
have been studying
the impacts of noise pollution
on marine life

38:01.212 --> 38:03.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from big to small.

38:03.047 --> 38:07.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been shown that noise can
cause behavior
changes, hearing loss, and it
can even be

38:07.218 --> 38:09.053 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fatal.

38:09.087 --> 38:15.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Holt's research focuses on
orcas, also known
as killer whales, and how they
amplify their

38:15.260 --> 38:18.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
calls when they are in noisy
waters, especially
around container ships.

38:18.930 --> 38:28.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARLA HOLT: OK, so here are orca
calls with
minimal boat noise.

38:28.072 --> 38:34.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And here are their calls with
lots of boat
noise.

38:34.612 --> 38:42.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: There's quite a
difference, and
you see it visually here too.

38:42.921 --> 38:46.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARLA HOLT: Yes, so, they really
have to pump
up the volume of their calls in
order to hear

38:46.891 --> 38:48.660 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
each other.

38:48.693 --> 38:52.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Many of the orcas Holt
studies spend
a lot of their time in
Washington state's

38:52.764 --> 38:54.465 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Puget Sound.

38:54.499 --> 38:57.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They and hundreds of other
marine species
have a lot more than just
container ships

38:57.735 --> 38:59.070 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to contend with.

38:59.103 --> 39:02.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than four million people
live around
the Sound.

39:02.340 --> 39:07.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The beautiful waterways of Puget
Sound are
what draw so many people to this
area, but

39:07.178 --> 39:11.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all the boating and shoreline
development
make this a very noisy place to
be for marine

39:11.749 --> 39:13.451 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

39:13.484 --> 39:16.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an issue that the state of
Washington
has been trying to deal with for
quite some

time.

39:18.122 --> 39:19.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RHONDA BROOKS, Washington State
Department
of Transportation: Any time we
touch anything

39:19.390 --> 39:24.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with water, we try to deploy
practices that
aren't harmful.

39:24.395 --> 39:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Rhonda Brooks is works
for the Washington
State Department of
Transportation.

39:28.766 --> 39:32.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She says the state's many ferry
terminals
and bridges require a lot of
work that is

39:32.470 --> 39:36.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
often quite noisy, especially
when it comes
to driving foundation piles in
the water.

39:36.808 --> 39:40.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RHONDA BROOKS: I think it's only
really been
in the last decade or so that we
have become

39:40.245 --> 39:47.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concerned about the sound that
it makes underwater
as it's being struck from above
the water,

39:47.552 --> 39:53.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and what that sound does to the
species that
are not only in the vicinity of
the pile,

39:53.825 --> 39:55.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but also miles and miles away.

39:55.727 --> 40:00.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: While marine pile
driving is a relatively
small slice of the overall noise
pollution

40:00.999 --> 40:06.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problem, it is one of the
loudest and most
distressful manmade noises for
marine life.

40:06.037 --> 40:11.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Documented fish kills around
marine pile driving
projects in the early 2000s led
to more state

40:11.142 --> 40:14.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and federal noise mitigation
requirements.

40:14.412 --> 40:18.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the main ways to reduce
the noise with
pile driving has been through
the use of bubble

40:18.449 --> 40:21.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
curtains, which are large rings
that surround
the pile, and the bubbles that
are pumped

40:21.953 --> 40:26.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out reduce the sound waves, but
sometimes
not very much, as little as 30
percent.

40:27.025 --> 40:29.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They also can cause construction
delays, according
to Brooks.

40:29.861 --> 40:32.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RHONDA BROOKS: As we know, time
is money in
construction.

40:32.463 --> 40:36.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we began to look at
practical, innovative
ways to attenuate that sound.

40:36.167 --> 40:40.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: So Brooks and other
transportation
officials sought help from
engineers around

40:40.371 --> 40:41.439 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the state.

40:41.472 --> 40:43.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they eventually got that
help from this
man.

40:43.541 --> 40:47.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PER REINHALL, University of
Washington: Once
we understood the principles of
how sound

40:47.979 --> 40:51.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was created, then the solution
was pretty
simple.

40:51.482 --> 40:55.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Per Reinhall is the
chair of the
mechanical engineering
department at the University

40:55.420 --> 40:57.121 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Washington.

40:57.155 --> 41:01.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over the years, he has developed
a number
of products, including a
next-generation football

41:01.159 --> 41:03.094 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
helmet.

41:03.127 --> 41:07.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this was his first foray in
marine construction,
and what he came up with was a
double-walled

41:07.332 --> 41:08.399 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pile.

41:08.433 --> 41:10.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reinhall showed me how the
system works on
a model.

41:10.835 --> 41:16.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PER REINHALL: So, what we have
done is, we
have taken the ordinary pile and
then we have

41:16.808 --> 41:18.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
put another pile inside it.

41:18.976 --> 41:25.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as you can see here,
there's an airspace
in between where the water can
not get to.

41:25.216 --> 41:29.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what we do is, we strike the
inside pile.

41:29.053 --> 41:30.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now we have a bulge going down.

41:30.455 --> 41:33.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But now it's acting against the
air, not the
water.

41:33.725 --> 41:37.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, essentially, no sound, or
very little
sound gets developed.

41:37.929 --> 41:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The other key part of
the design
is the connection at the bottom
of the two

41:41.966 --> 41:46.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
piles, seen in this testing
prototype, which
prevents the sound from
traveling into the

41:46.371 --> 41:48.206 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
seafloor.

41:48.239 --> 41:51.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PER REINHALL: And that's really
the secret
sauce of this concept, is the
flexible coupling

41:51.843 --> 41:53.578 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at the bottom.

41:53.611 --> 41:58.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
See, it's essentially a spring,
a very, very
stiff spring, between the
outside pile and

41:58.049 --> 41:59.417 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the inside pile.

41:59.450 --> 42:02.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Reinhall has turned
his innovation
into small start-up.

42:02.887 --> 42:07.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The company, called Marine
Construction Technologies,
has done several tests with the
state Department

42:07.458 --> 42:08.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Transportation.

42:08.826 --> 42:12.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the results, says Reinhall,
have confirmed
the design works.

42:12.864 --> 42:17.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At this test, done in 2014,
there was a 21-decibel
noise reduction.

42:17.835 --> 42:21.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To understand what that means,
you really
need to hear it.

42:21.606 --> 42:28.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PER REINHALL: So, this is a
regular pile.

42:28.913 --> 42:32.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this is our new pile.

42:32.917 --> 42:35.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it's a dramatic difference.

42:35.820 --> 42:36.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: It is a big
difference.

42:36.854 --> 42:38.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How much of a difference?

42:38.256 --> 42:42.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PER REINHALL: It's a reduction
of about 90
percent of the volume.

42:42.293 --> 42:44.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: Ninety?

42:44.095 --> 42:46.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PER REINHALL: Ninety percent of
the volume,
so, yes, it's a big deal if
you're a fish.

42:46.297 --> 42:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAT WISE: One hurdle, though, is
the cost.

42:48.666 --> 42:52.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The double-walled piles are
about 20 percent
more than a standard single
pile.

42:52.570 --> 42:56.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Reinhall says those costs
should be mitigated
by the effectiveness of the
technology.

42:56.674 --> 43:01.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PER REINHALL: The goal of this
is to actually
save money, if you include
everything, if

43:01.112 --> 43:06.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you include monitoring, the time
of the projects,
permitting, et cetera, et
cetera.

43:06.818 --> 43:09.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, overall, the projects should
be cheaper
with this technology.

43:09.921 --> 43:14.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The Reinhall piles
have yet to be
used commercially, but the state
is now evaluating

43:14.992 --> 43:17.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them now for future projects.

43:17.929 --> 43:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As for the marine life in Puget
Sound, there
was no comment, but we expect
any noise reductions

43:22.767 --> 43:24.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in their waters would be a
welcome development.

43:24.869 --> 43:28.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Cat

HARI SREENIVASAN: Jermaine Isaac
(ph) killed
a man when he was 15.

44:02.306 --> 44:06.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He's been in prison for
second-degree murder
11 years.

44:06.477 --> 44:10.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
During his punishment, he is
trying to make
something better of himself.

44:10.948 --> 44:14.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the past two years, he has
been attending

JERMAINE ISAAC, Inmate: Going to
college gave
me tools.

44:17.555 --> 44:18.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's taught me patience.

44:18.556 --> 44:19.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's taught me hard work.

44:19.724 --> 44:23.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It taught me that more things
are possible.

44:23.995 --> 44:31.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Isaac is one

prisoners studying for a degree
as part of

44:31.035 --> 44:37.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a partnership with Goucher
College, a private
liberal arts school in
Baltimore.

44:37.675 --> 44:42.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Goucher provides the professors
and pays for
the education with private
donations.

44:44.148 --> 44:46.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY ROZA, Director, Goucher
Prison Education
Partnership: We have a chance to
change the

44:46.551 --> 44:51.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way we do criminal justice in
the United States,
if we invest in the root causes
of what brings

44:51.389 --> 44:53.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people to prison.

44:53.157 --> 44:57.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: When Jermaine
Isaac came
to the Maryland correctional
institution in

44:57.495 --> 44:59.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jessup, he could barely read.

44:59.130 --> 45:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JERMAINE ISAAC: College was
never in a realm
for me.

45:02.433 --> 45:04.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was never in sight.

45:04.302 --> 45:09.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, with a
GED and 16 college
credits, Isaac feels he's
getting a second

45:09.273 --> 45:10.241 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
chance.

45:10.274 --> 45:12.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
In January, he will be released.

45:12.743 --> 45:19.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's going to be people
watching, thinking,
why are we giving a guy who took
somebody

45:19.984 --> 45:23.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
else's life an opportunity and
an education?

45:23.721 --> 45:25.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Shouldn't he be punished in
prison?

45:25.356 --> 45:28.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JERMAINE ISAAC: We are the
people who are
coming back into society.

45:28.092 --> 45:30.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whether they like it or not,
we're coming
back to society.

45:30.962 --> 45:37.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're trying to come back
prepared to
be citizens, and give back to
where we took

45:37.668 --> 45:39.570 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
from.

45:39.604 --> 45:41.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This summer,
the Obama administration
said it will extend that second
chance to

45:41.839 --> 45:44.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
12,000 inmates across the
country.

45:44.709 --> 45:51.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As a pilot project, the
Department of Education
will partner with 67 colleges,
including Goucher,

45:51.082 --> 45:54.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to provide higher education to
prisoners who
can't afford it.

45:54.986 --> 46:00.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Called Second Chance Pell Pilot,
eligible
inmates will be able to apply
for federal

46:00.091 --> 46:01.058 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
grants.

Education Secretary John King:

46:02.960 --> 46:05.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KING, U.S. Education
Secretary: Students
who have the opportunity to
pursue education

46:05.196 --> 46:10.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
while they're incarcerated are
dramatically
less likely to return to prison,
42 percent

46:10.167 --> 46:15.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reduction in recidivism from
students just
having exposure to education; 98
percent of

46:15.439 --> 46:18.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the folks who earn a bachelor's
degree don't
end up back in prison.

46:18.876 --> 46:24.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Advocates for
college in
prison say those statistics can
break the

46:24.815 --> 46:26.684 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
link between poverty and crime.

46:26.717 --> 46:31.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY ROZA: We see huge changes in
lifetime
earnings, $8,000 more a year for
a student

46:31.555 --> 46:36.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who has access to some college,
$22,000 more
a year for a student who has
access to a bachelor's

46:36.360 --> 46:37.495 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
degree.

46:37.528 --> 46:39.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of those impacts have a deep
impact on
children.

46:39.697 --> 46:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And more than half the people we
incarcerate
in the U.S. are parents of
school-age children.

This case was a consolidation of
two cases.

46:47.171 --> 46:51.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But is the
education that
these prisoners receive
comparable to college

46:51.342 --> 46:53.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

BRAD STODDARD: It is the exact
same curriculum
that I do for my general
population students.

47:03.654 --> 47:05.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We use the same reading
material.

47:05.489 --> 47:08.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We use the same primary sources,
the same
secondary sources.

47:08.459 --> 47:13.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Until the
mid-'90s, inmates
of state and federal prisons
were allowed

47:13.330 --> 47:18.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to apply for Pell Grants, money
offered to
any low-income college student
in the nation.

47:18.235 --> 47:24.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as part of the 1994 crime
bill, Congress
took away grant money for the
incarcerated.

47:24.208 --> 47:28.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Critics of Second Chance Pell
Grants say the
Department of Education is now
overstepping

47:28.512 --> 47:29.847 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
its authority.

47:29.880 --> 47:30.848 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Congressman Chris Collins:

47:30.881 --> 47:32.683 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

47:32.717 --> 47:35.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS COLLINS (R), New York:
There is a law
on the books that there is no
ambiguity in.

47:35.219 --> 47:40.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pell Grants shall not be allowed
for prisoners,
period, end of discussion.

47:40.357 --> 47:44.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: By designating
the program
an experiment, education
officials say they

47:44.829 --> 47:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can access the money and help
prisoners get
jobs upon release.

47:49.233 --> 47:51.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN KING: We need them to come
back prepared
to be successful.

47:51.936 --> 47:56.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Otherwise, they will end up back
in jail,
which is a cost to -- not only
to them and

47:56.941 --> 47:58.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their families, but to the to
the country.

47:58.843 --> 48:02.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Collins says
inmates should
be trained in the trades and
helped to complete

48:02.246 --> 48:05.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a GED, but he stops short of
money for college.

48:05.916 --> 48:06.884 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

48:06.917 --> 48:08.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRIS COLLINS: We have no
surplus.

48:08.319 --> 48:11.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's no extra money anywhere
in the federal
government.

48:11.355 --> 48:18.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I do not believe our
children and grandchildren
should be paying off in the
future with interest

48:18.896 --> 48:25.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
moneys so a criminal behind bars
can take
a few random college courses.

48:25.069 --> 48:30.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: James Flood,
the director
of security operations for
Maryland's Department

48:30.341 --> 48:34.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Correctional Services, says
classes do
more than help the individual.

48:34.512 --> 48:36.213 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They improve the environment.

48:36.247 --> 48:38.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES FLOOD, Maryland Department
of Correctional
Services: You don't have time to
dwell on

48:38.716 --> 48:39.683 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
negative things.

48:39.717 --> 48:40.684 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You're working.

48:40.718 --> 48:43.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're going to school and
you're studying.

48:43.053 --> 48:45.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're concentrating on positive
things.

48:45.055 --> 48:48.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so we benefit as an
institution, and it
makes the facility safer.

48:48.893 --> 48:52.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And he says
other inmates
view those enrolled in classes
differently.

48:52.663 --> 48:56.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES FLOOD: This is positive
peer pressure,
because it fuels admiration and
respect.

48:56.967 --> 49:02.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEVAL WALLACE, Inmate: I started
college here
because I needed a change, man,
something

49:02.540 --> 49:04.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
positive, something productive.

49:04.441 --> 49:08.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was a search for achievement,
something
to better myself.

49:08.112 --> 49:11.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Deval Wallace
is incarcerated
for attempted murder.

49:11.715 --> 49:15.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He will not be eligible for
parole for another
six years.

49:15.119 --> 49:18.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, he is enrolled in Goucher
classes and
hopes to get a degree in
psychology.

49:19.023 --> 49:20.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEVAL WALLACE: It still benefits
me.

49:20.624 --> 49:22.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How?

49:22.459 --> 49:27.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEVAL WALLACE: Even though I'm
not able to
go out and use a degree, just
being -- having

49:27.131 --> 49:31.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that knowledge and having to --
I can help
the next person that's in here
that might

49:31.402 --> 49:37.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a chance of going home,
help steer him
in the right direction, give him
positive

49:37.241 --> 49:39.009 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
information.

49:39.043 --> 49:41.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What's your
guarantee to
me that, five years from now,
when I catch

49:41.846 --> 49:44.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up with you, it's not going to
be in a room
like this?

49:44.248 --> 49:47.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JERMAINE ISAAC: I can guarantee
that because
I hate prison.

49:47.685 --> 49:49.386 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I can't be here.

49:49.420 --> 49:51.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Like, this is not a place for
me.

49:51.388 --> 49:53.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's no way I will return
here, no way.

49:53.257 --> 49:57.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Department
of Education
estimates 100 correctional
institutions across

49:57.161 --> 50:03.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the country will take part in
the Second Chance
Pell Pilot program.

50:03.734 --> 50:07.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In Maryland for the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

50:07.338 --> 50:20.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to our
"NewsHour" shares,
Something that caught our eye
that might be

50:20.284 --> 50:22.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of interest to you, too.

50:22.186 --> 50:28.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We visit the nation's first
lighthouse just
off Boston, which celebrates its
300th anniversary

50:28.759 --> 50:30.060 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

50:30.094 --> 50:31.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SALLY SNOWMAN, Boston Light
Keeper: My name
is Sally Snowman.

50:31.662 --> 50:35.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I'm the Coast Guard
lighthouse keeper
of Boston Light.

50:35.966 --> 50:42.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Boston Light is the last manned
Coast Guard
life station in the entire
country.

50:42.106 --> 50:47.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is located on Little Brewster
Island at
the entrance of Boston Harbor.

50:47.711 --> 50:53.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In 1716, there were many
shipwrecks here in
the outer harbor of Boston, and
they wanted

50:53.684 --> 51:00.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to have a major aid to
navigation to show
the ships safe passage into the
harbor.

51:00.457 --> 51:04.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so, in 1716, Boston Light
was erected.

51:04.261 --> 51:12.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then it had an incident in
1776 in the
Revolutionary War where the
tower was blown

51:12.169 --> 51:13.470 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

51:13.504 --> 51:17.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was rebuilt in 1783, and that
is the tower
that exists today.

51:17.708 --> 51:23.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, today, 300 years later, the
lighthouse
is doing exactly what it was
intended to do

51:23.514 --> 51:28.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in 1716, which was showing a
safe way into
Boston Harbor.

51:28.986 --> 51:35.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, now I am the 70th keeper of
Boston Light,
with the first 69 having been
all men.

51:35.259 --> 51:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I was hired in 2003, I was
a Coast Guard
auxiliary person that
volunteered out here

51:42.566 --> 51:44.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and wore a uniform.

51:44.601 --> 51:50.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, being on the payroll
for the Coast
Guard as a civilian employee, I
wasn't allowed

51:50.507 --> 51:55.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to wear the uniform, and I was
asked to come
up with something that would
help me stand

51:55.679 --> 51:57.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out from the crowd.

51:57.448 --> 52:03.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I came up with the idea of
this costume
from the late 1700s to help tell
the story,

52:03.988 --> 52:07.191 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that it's not the original tower
of 1716.

52:07.224 --> 52:08.759 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's 1783.

52:08.792 --> 52:13.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is what the keeper's
wife would have
worn during that period of time.

52:13.597 --> 52:15.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We are a living museum.

52:15.466 --> 52:22.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Visitors get to come out, climb
the 76 spiral
stairs, two ladders into the
lantern room,

52:22.206 --> 52:27.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and stand by an 11-foot crystal
made up of
336 individual prisms.

52:27.277 --> 52:30.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many of them are local, many of
them from
Boston.

52:30.381 --> 52:34.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so many of them say, oh, I
have lived
in Boston all of my life, I have
looked at

52:34.818 --> 52:37.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Boston Light, and never came
out.

52:37.287 --> 52:40.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And why did it take me so long
to come out
here?

52:40.624 --> 52:43.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Because it is a jewel.

52:43.794 --> 52:46.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a jewel of the harbor.

52:46.730 --> 52:50.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tonight, as of PBS
Spotlight Education
Week, "NOVA" takes a look at the
divides in

52:50.534 --> 52:53.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
education across America and
potential solutions.

52:53.971 --> 52:59.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"School of the Future" examines
how education
could be redesigned to help
narrow the gaps

52:59.743 --> 53:01.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in opportunities and
achievement.

53:01.779 --> 53:04.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"NOVA" airs tonight on most PBS
stations.

53:04.615 --> 53:06.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's the
"NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:06.884 --> 53:12.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Thursday, correspondent John
Yang checks
in from Ohio with the first of
two reports

53:12.856 --> 53:14.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from that battleground state.

53:14.558 --> 53:15.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:15.559 --> 53:16.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

53:16.794 --> 53:19.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening.

53:19.963 --> 53:33.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us here at the "PBS
NewsHour,"
thank you, and good night.
