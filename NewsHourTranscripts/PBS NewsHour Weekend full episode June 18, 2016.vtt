SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

04:03.944 --> 04:04.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:04.744 --> 04:06.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:42.415 --> 04:43.783 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE LOST A

REASONS PEOPLE WANT TO LEAVE THE

GOING TO RESIGN, AND THAT LOOKS

06:19.512 --> 06:20.614 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKELY SINCE HE SAID HE WOULD
