JUDY WOODRUFF: And for more
on the attorney general's
testimony, I'm now joined by the

00:04.233 --> 00:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
top Democrat on the House
Intelligence Committee.

00:07.333 --> 00:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is Representative Adam
Schiff of California.

00:10.100 --> 00:12.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Congressman Schiff,
thank you for joining us.

00:12.266 --> 00:17.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know you paid close
attention to what was said
today by the attorney general.

00:17.066 --> 00:22.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Did you come away with a better
understanding of what has
happened over the last year?

00:22.566 --> 00:23.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ADAM SCHIFF (D),
California: I did.

00:25.833 --> 00:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what was notable to me was
the degree to which the attorney
general really corroborated

00:31.600 --> 00:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what is, I think, the most
significant of the meetings
that James Comey testified.

00:33.700 --> 00:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is, he did corroborate
that there was a meeting of
many people in the Oval Office.

00:41.266 --> 00:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And although he didn't say
it was at the president's
instruction, it was
pretty clear that it was.

00:44.333 --> 00:48.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Everyone left the room,
except for James Comey
and the president.

00:48.233 --> 00:52.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the attorney general
acknowledged that he did linger,
that he was one of the last,

00:52.366 --> 00:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if not the last, to leave the
room, and also corroborated
the fact that, the following

00:56.533 --> 01:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
day, Director Comey told him he
was essentially uncomfortable
with something that took place

01:02.133 --> 01:04.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in that meeting.

01:04.100 --> 01:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That tells me that James Comey's
testimony about that meeting
is far more accurate than

01:10.266 --> 01:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president's statements about
that meeting, because, if there
wasn't something uncomfortable

01:15.800 --> 01:18.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about it, then why did the
director go the next day to
the attorney general and say,

01:18.300 --> 01:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't leave me alone
again with the president?

01:21.066 --> 01:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other point I would
make, Judy, is the one that
you have been discussing.

01:23.733 --> 01:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is, we cannot
accept this non-invocation
of privilege as a reason
to prohibit the Congress

01:32.033 --> 01:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from finding out whether the
attorney general wrote a memo
or wrote a letter along with

01:39.066 --> 01:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the deputy attorney general to
provide cover or pretext for
a decision they knew was made

01:43.200 --> 01:45.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on other grounds.

01:45.333 --> 01:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, I don't know if that's
the case, because he wouldn't
answer, but as it goes to the

01:48.266 --> 01:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very heart of whether
the president sought to
interfere or obstruct
the Russia investigation,

01:53.033 --> 01:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we need to use whatever
compulsory process is
necessary to get those answers.

01:57.433 --> 02:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we heard
at the end of the meeting --
of the hearing, rather, the

02:01.233 --> 02:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chairman, Richard Burr, Senator
Burr, asked the attorney
general to go back to the White

02:08.200 --> 02:11.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House to see if there's more
of his communications with the
president and with anyone in the

02:12.866 --> 02:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
White House that they can share.

02:16.733 --> 02:19.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Is that something that
you think is likely to
produce some answers?

02:19.533 --> 02:20.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:20.533 --> 02:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I don't know.

02:21.533 --> 02:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I would certainly hope so.

02:23.633 --> 02:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will say this, in light of
the conversation that you just
had with Walter Dellinger and

02:26.666 --> 02:28.800 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Mr. Terwilliger,
a couple things.

02:28.800 --> 02:33.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
First is, the questions
that were asked of the
attorney general were
all easily anticipated,

02:34.800 --> 02:36.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so there were no
surprise questions here.

02:36.966 --> 02:40.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There was no reason why
the White House could
not have instructed the
attorney general whether

02:40.033 --> 02:42.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they were going to
invoke privilege or not.

02:42.066 --> 02:45.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I don't buy the idea that
the attorney general couldn't
know in advance whether he

02:45.600 --> 02:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
needed to invoke the privilege.

02:47.233 --> 02:48.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They didn't want him to.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.166 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
They didn't want
the optic of it.

02:50.166 --> 02:53.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that's not a good
reason for refusing to
answer the questions.

02:53.533 --> 02:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, more than that, if the
attorney general allowed himself
to be used as a pretext to

03:01.066 --> 03:06.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
give justification for a firing
that was made on other grounds,
that not only violates his

03:06.033 --> 03:07.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
recusal.

03:07.966 --> 03:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It also potentially violates
the law or is a highly unethical
practice, and we need to

03:14.500 --> 03:16.466 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
find out whether
that's the case.

03:16.466 --> 03:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't know, but we have an
obligation in our investigation,
Bob Mueller will in his,

03:21.966 --> 03:24.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to get the answer.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, how
do you get beyond his
refusal to answer, though?

03:26.966 --> 03:31.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he's saying these were
privileged communications
that I had that stand
on precedent at the

03:33.966 --> 03:37.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Department of Justice, whether
they're written down or not,
how do you get through that?

03:37.966 --> 03:40.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:40.033 --> 03:42.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I think
the process, if we're going to
live up with our institutional

03:42.166 --> 03:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
responsibility in Congress,
is to go back to the White
House and say, we want answers

03:46.733 --> 03:48.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to these questions.

03:48.466 --> 03:50.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Are you invoking the privilege?

03:50.500 --> 03:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, if they're not, we need
to bring the attorney general
back before either our committee

03:54.133 --> 03:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the House or before the
Senate committee and demand
answers to those questions.

04:01.133 --> 04:03.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they do invoke privilege,
then we may need to litigate
the contours of that privilege.

04:03.866 --> 04:08.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The privilege cannot
be used as a shield to
protect or hide potential
impropriety or illegality.

04:11.100 --> 04:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we may have to go to court
to pierce that privilege, but
we do need to get to the bottom

04:17.066 --> 04:19.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of this.

04:19.233 --> 04:22.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have the powers and
institution to do it,
and I think we have
an ethical obligation

04:22.300 --> 04:24.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and a responsibility to
the country to do it.

04:24.700 --> 04:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman,
were you struck by,
were you surprised when
the attorney general

04:28.266 --> 04:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said that he had not had, had
not sought any sort of briefing
on attempts by the Russians

04:34.866 --> 04:36.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to interfere in the
election last year?

04:36.566 --> 04:37.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

04:37.566 --> 04:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: I was struck by it.

04:39.700 --> 04:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Certainly, during his time in
the Senate and as a member of
the Armed Services Committee,

04:43.333 --> 04:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when we have a hostile
power, Russia, interfering
in our internal affairs,
you would think he

04:47.766 --> 04:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
would have an interest in that.

04:49.833 --> 04:54.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, more than that, it
was an echo of Director
Comey's testimony also
that the president

04:56.166 --> 05:00.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
showed no curiosity,
no interest, no concern
over the Russia hack.

05:02.600 --> 05:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The only element of it that
concerned him was how it
might impact him personally.

05:07.566 --> 05:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That says, I think, a lot
about where the president is
coming from, but it was quite

05:10.400 --> 05:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
jarring given this was an
attack on our democracy
by a foreign power.

05:14.800 --> 05:19.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman,
another thing I saw late this
afternoon after the hearing

05:19.066 --> 05:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concluded that the --
that Senator Dick Durbin,
who, of course, is in
the leadership among

05:23.533 --> 05:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats in the Senate, was
saying that the attorney general
should step down based on

05:29.966 --> 05:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his testimony today, his --
and his performance in office.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.033 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Are you -- would
you go that far?

05:35.033 --> 05:37.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I would want
to pursue two things before
I would be prepared to go

05:39.366 --> 05:41.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that far.

05:41.433 --> 05:44.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the first is to do whatever
investigation we need to do to
find out whether his testimony

05:44.866 --> 05:49.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today about what happened
or didn't happen at the
Mayflower is accurate
and can be corroborated,

05:51.866 --> 05:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or wasn't accurate, in which
case, we do need to consider
the remedies that Dick Durbin

05:56.800 --> 05:59.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
talked about.

05:59.333 --> 06:02.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, also, we need to get
answers to the questions
about what went into
the firing of Director

06:04.333 --> 06:06.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Comey.

06:06.400 --> 06:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if he refuses and doesn't
have a legal basis to do so,
then, again, I think we may

06:10.233 --> 06:12.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
end up where Senator Durbin is.

06:12.366 --> 06:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At this point,
just quickly, Congressman, are
you optimistic that Congress,

06:19.166 --> 06:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that your committee, the Senate
committee, are eventually
going to get to the bottom

06:21.566 --> 06:22.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of this?

06:22.566 --> 06:24.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

06:24.033 --> 06:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: Well, you
know, I certainly hope so.

06:26.100 --> 06:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we have the look at
this in a very nonpartisan way
and try to, as best we can,

06:30.866 --> 06:32.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
divorce ourselves
of the consequences.

06:32.933 --> 06:36.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what is at stake here is
really our system of checks and
balances and whether we're going

06:36.766 --> 06:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to allow an administration not
to invoke privilege, but just to
say it's inconvenient for us to

06:41.633 --> 06:43.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tell you the answers.

06:43.733 --> 06:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It wouldn't reflect well on us,
so we're going to invoke some
inchoate privilege that doesn't

06:49.433 --> 06:50.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
exist.

06:50.666 --> 06:52.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We can't tolerate that.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We can't stand for that.

06:54.100 --> 06:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at the end of the day, I
don't think Bob Mueller will,
and Congress shouldn't either.

07:00.100 --> 07:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman
Adam Schiff of California, the
ranking Democrat on the House

07:02.533 --> 07:04.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Intelligence Committee,
thank you very much.

07:04.266 --> 07:05.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

07:05.266 --> 07:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: Thank you, Judy.
