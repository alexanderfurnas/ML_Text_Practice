JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.506 --> 00:08.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.
Gwen Ifill is away this week.

00:08.242 --> 00:13.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
contraception coverage and
online privacy

00:13.213 --> 00:17.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the high court. We break down
today's Supreme
Court rulings.

00:17.384 --> 00:20.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Monday:
Bernie Sanders and Hillary
Clinton prepare

00:20.988 --> 00:26.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for two state primaries
tomorrow, while Donald
Trump faces his own battles as
the sole Republican

00:26.994 --> 00:28.695 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
candidate.

00:28.729 --> 00:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And decades after
war, the
Balkans struggle with differing
forms of Islam

00:33.233 --> 00:38.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and fight to shut down radical
mosques some
say are breeding terrorist
fighters.

00:38.138 --> 00:41.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAZIM COLIC, Bosnian Islamic
Community: A
number of them, they have been
in contact

00:41.341 --> 00:45.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with some people outside
Bosnia-Herzegovina,
because this is not from Bosnia.
This has

00:45.746 --> 00:47.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been imported from somewhere
else.

00:47.848 --> 00:50.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:50.651 --> 00:53.787 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:53.820 --> 01:07.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It is primary eve
for two more
states, and the Democratic
campaign in one

01:07.734 --> 01:13.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of them has heated up. That has
party divisions
on display again, and it leaves
the front-runner

01:13.607 --> 01:15.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fighting a two-front war.

01:15.542 --> 01:20.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Let's do everything we can to
win Kentucky

01:20.514 --> 01:22.382 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in November!

01:22.416 --> 01:26.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Hillary Clinton
blitzed the Bluegrass
State today, her sights on a
fall campaign

01:26.553 --> 01:28.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
against Donald Trump.

01:28.455 --> 01:32.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Now,
some people might
say, oh, all anybody wants to
hear is just,

01:32.626 --> 01:35.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm going to do it, but I'm not
telling you
what I'm going to do.

01:35.429 --> 01:40.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
See, I don't believe that.
Americans take
their vote for president
seriously. And they're

01:41.001 --> 01:45.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be looking at that TV
screen and
saying, he still doesn't have
anything to

01:45.238 --> 01:47.007 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tell us?

01:47.040 --> 01:51.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: She's also trying to
break her
primary losing streak against
Democratic rival

01:51.111 --> 01:52.379 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Bernie Sanders.

01:52.412 --> 01:55.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: And she is the one who
will make
a real difference.

01:55.148 --> 01:59.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Clinton is running
her first TV
ads in weeks, and says she will
put her husband,

01:59.553 --> 02:04.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who won Kentucky twice, in
charge of revitalizing
the economy.

02:04.524 --> 02:07.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sanders moved on to Puerto Rico
today, where
Democrats vote on June 5.

02:07.828 --> 02:12.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
It is unacceptable to me for the
United States

02:12.532 --> 02:18.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government to treat Puerto Rico
like a colony
during a time when its people
are facing the

02:18.905 --> 02:22.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
worst fiscal and economic crisis
in its history.

02:22.476 --> 02:26.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The Clinton campaign
has written
off Oregon, which also votes
tomorrow, but

02:26.880 --> 02:32.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is competing hard in Kentucky.
She won the
state easily in 2008, but recent
comments

02:32.919 --> 02:38.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about putting coal miners out of
work have
hurt her. And so she wants to
avoid losing

02:38.225 --> 02:40.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
twice on Tuesday.

02:40.727 --> 02:45.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump had a different target
today, British
Prime Minister David Cameron,
who called Trump's

02:45.599 --> 02:50.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
plan to ban Muslims divisive,
stupid and wrong.

02:50.103 --> 02:53.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
On Britain's Independent
Television News,
Trump fired back.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: If you're president,
and he's the
British prime minister...

02:55.475 --> 02:57.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
It looks like we're not going to
have a very

02:57.310 --> 03:01.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
good relationship. Who knows? I
hope to have
a good relationship with him,
but it sounds

03:01.281 --> 03:03.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like he's not willing to address
the problem,
either.

03:03.717 --> 03:08.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Trump also blasted a
New York Times
story examining how he treats
women. A former

03:08.955 --> 03:14.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
model who dated the New York
billionaire and
was quoted in the story says the
paper twisted

03:14.327 --> 03:16.096 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
her words.

03:16.129 --> 03:17.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROWANNE BREWER LANE, Once Dated
Donald Trump:
They spun it to where it
appeared negative.

03:17.964 --> 03:23.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I didn't have a negative
experience with Donald
Trump, and I don't appreciate
them making

03:23.570 --> 03:26.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it look like that I was saying
that it was
a negative experience.

03:26.740 --> 03:33.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Trump tweeted his own
take: "False
reporting, and plenty of it, but
we will prevail."

03:33.713 --> 03:36.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

03:36.116 --> 03:40.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will talk with
supporters
on both sides of the Democratic
race right

03:41.021 --> 03:42.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after the news summary.

03:42.789 --> 03:45.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the day's
other news:
The U.S. and other world powers
announced

03:45.859 --> 03:50.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they're ready to arm the
internationally recognized
government of Libya. They want
an exemption

03:50.964 --> 03:55.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a U.N. arms embargo to supply
weapons to
fight Islamic State forces.
Officials from

03:55.602 --> 03:57.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the U.S. and 20 other countries
met in Vienna.

03:57.938 --> 04:01.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of State John Kerry
said they want
to help Libya fight ISIS and
other militants.

04:01.842 --> 04:05.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: There
has been no request otherwise at
this point

04:05.045 --> 04:09.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in time for some other kind of
intervention.
We are simply in a mode of
trying to help

04:09.316 --> 04:15.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and assist and develop a Libyan
capacity to
be able to respond to the
challenge of security

04:15.489 --> 04:17.257 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
within Libya.

04:17.290 --> 04:21.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Pentagon
confirmed today
that small teams of U.S. troops
are on the

04:21.094 --> 04:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ground assessing the situation.
The Washington
Post reported last week that
they're special

04:26.166 --> 04:28.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
operations forces deployed at
two outposts.

04:28.668 --> 04:34.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The capital of
Afghanistan
was on lockdown today as tens of
thousands

04:34.141 --> 04:40.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of minority Hazara sect
protested. They marched
in Kabul, demanding that a
planned multinational

04:40.747 --> 04:46.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
power line be routed through
their province.
They argue it would will lift
the area out

04:46.186 --> 04:51.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of poverty. Police blocked off
roads in the
city, fearing possible violence.

04:51.158 --> 04:54.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The 50th
anniversary of
China's cultural revolution came
and went

04:54.828 --> 05:00.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with little official recognition
today. State
media were mostly silent on the
violent campaign

05:00.066 --> 05:07.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to revive communist goals that
began on May
16, 1966. Mao Zedong rallied the
youthful

05:07.073 --> 05:09.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Red Guard to persecute millions.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, many criticize the brutal
campaign.

05:11.845 --> 05:16.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZAHO SHUNLI, Retired Red Guard
Member (through
translator): The 30 years after
the reforms

05:16.583 --> 05:21.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
show that this was totally
wrong. The reforms
didn't bring any benefit to our
country, to

05:21.154 --> 05:24.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our lives. They didn't bring any
development
to our economy and our industry.

05:24.991 --> 05:29.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The cultural
revolution
officially ended with Mao's
death in 1976.

05:29.095 --> 05:32.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The ruling Communist Party
formally condemned
the movement in 1981.

05:32.399 --> 05:37.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, thousands
of low-income students will soon
be eligible

05:37.137 --> 05:42.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for federal Pell Grants to take
college courses
in high school. The Education
Department said

05:42.676 --> 05:49.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today it's earmarking about $20
million for
the next school year to help
about 10,000

05:49.249 --> 05:54.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
students; 44 institutions, most
of them community
colleges, are expected to
participate.

05:54.521 --> 05:59.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And Wall
Street rallied,
as rising oil prices pushed
energy stocks

05:59.226 --> 06:05.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
higher. The Dow Jones industrial
average gained
175 points to close at 17710.
The Nasdaq rose

06:05.599 --> 06:08.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
57 points, and the S&amp;P 500 added
20.

06:08.868 --> 06:13.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Hillary Clinton's
last-minute push for votes in
Kentucky; the

06:13.840 --> 06:20.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Supreme Court sidesteps a key
contraceptive
ruling; Bosnian Muslims crack
down on allegedly

06:20.380 --> 06:26.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
radical mosques; and much more.

06:26.152 --> 06:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We look ahead to
tomorrow's
primaries and divisions within
the Democratic

06:39.399 --> 06:41.901 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Party starting with Oregon.

06:41.935 --> 06:46.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's junior U.S. Senator Jeff
Merkley is the
only member of the Senate to
endorse Bernie

06:46.840 --> 06:48.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Sanders for president.

06:48.608 --> 06:51.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, Senator Merkley, we welcome
you to the
program.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I want to say, all the...

06:53.346 --> 06:53.947 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

06:53.980 --> 06:55.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

06:55.815 --> 07:00.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of the delegate projections
we see show
that it's all but impossible for
Bernie Sanders

07:00.687 --> 07:06.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have enough delegates to win
this nomination.
So, what do you know that they
don't show?

07:06.259 --> 07:09.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. JEFF MERKLEY (D), Oregon:
Well, it's
certainly is uphill. And it
would take two-thirds

07:09.262 --> 07:15.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the delegates or the votes
for him to tie
Secretary Clinton.

07:15.035 --> 07:20.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But here's the thing. This is
such an important
conversation. Bernie is
mobilizing the grassroots.

07:20.273 --> 07:24.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's exciting the base because
of his clear
vision that America is very much
off-track

07:24.778 --> 07:30.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and has to change in substantial
ways to address
the challenges for working
Americans.

07:30.417 --> 07:34.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it needs to be possible for
the citizens
of Oregon and Kentucky and
California and

07:34.888 --> 07:39.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Dakotas and New Jersey to
weigh in and
make their voices heard. If the
party is going

07:39.292 --> 07:45.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to come together, then it needs
to respect
everyone's opportunity to
participate in the

07:45.165 --> 07:46.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
primaries.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these issues are going to
continue to
reverberate, because,
fundamentally, America

07:50.737 --> 07:52.505 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is off-track.

07:52.539 --> 07:56.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I'm sure --
and I have
heard you say just, not just --
well, as long

07:56.343 --> 08:00.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as you have been supporting
Senator Sanders,
you said there is urgency to all
this. You

08:00.480 --> 08:02.449 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
said we need big ideas.

08:02.482 --> 08:07.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm sure that Secretary Clinton
thinks she
has got big ideas, too, and she
agrees there

08:07.287 --> 08:08.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is urgency about all this.

08:09.022 --> 08:12.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. JEFF MERKLEY: Well, she has
somewhat
criticized Bernie for his big
ideas, saying

08:12.492 --> 08:19.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
let's move in little pieces. And
that -- we
are blessed with two terrific
candidates on

08:19.733 --> 08:21.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Democratic side.

08:21.668 --> 08:25.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have good hearts and
good minds.
And we're going to unify going
into the convention

08:25.372 --> 08:30.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then going into November.
But it's Bernie
who's saying small changes don't
address the

08:30.910 --> 08:35.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
fact that nine out of 10
Americans have not
participated in the growing
prosperity of

08:35.315 --> 08:39.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America over the last four
decades, that huge
amounts of campaign cash are
unacceptable,

08:39.753 --> 08:45.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and we must radically change the
corruption
that has been enabled by
Citizens United in

08:45.925 --> 08:47.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our campaign system.

08:47.694 --> 08:51.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's Bernie who came out and
said, Keep It
in the Ground bill is essential.
We have to

08:51.564 --> 08:56.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quit doing contracts to sell off
our fossil
fuels that you and I own, as
citizens. our

08:56.369 --> 09:00.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
citizen-owned fossil fuels can
no longer be
leased out for pennies on the
acre.

09:00.774 --> 09:04.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we're going to help lead the
world, we
have to change direction and we
have to change

09:04.811 --> 09:07.046 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quickly to address this threat
to our planet.

09:07.080 --> 09:12.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, how far,
though, does
Senator Sanders want to push
this? I mean,

09:12.218 --> 09:16.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know that a number of
Democrats, more
and more of them, are saying,
the longer he

09:16.322 --> 09:19.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stays in, the more it hurts
Secretary Clinton's
chances in the fall.

09:19.993 --> 09:22.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. JEFF MERKLEY: Well, they're
really completely
wrong.

09:22.695 --> 09:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's Bernie's campaign that is
generating
the grassroots network, the
passion. That

09:26.966 --> 09:31.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
network is going to be very
important to the
victor in the Democratic
primary. It's why

09:31.371 --> 09:36.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everyone has to respect the
other side. But
after a week from Tuesday, when
virtually

09:36.643 --> 09:41.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every state will have weighed
in, we will
see a parallel to eight years
ago.

09:41.147 --> 09:48.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is June 7 or 8 that then
Senator Clinton
said, I understand that I am not
going to

09:48.121 --> 09:52.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
win this, we need to start
bringing the two
sides together. And they worked
on doing that

09:52.425 --> 09:57.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to set the stage for the
convention. And I
anticipate -- I can't speak
directly for the

09:57.697 --> 10:01.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie campaign on this, but I
anticipate
something similar, should
Secretary Clinton

10:02.001 --> 10:04.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have the majority of pledge
delegates a week
from Tuesday.

10:04.838 --> 10:10.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you're saying
you expect
Senator Sanders to work with
Senator Clinton

10:10.043 --> 10:11.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by the end of these primaries?

10:11.711 --> 10:16.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. JEFF MERKLEY: Yes, by the
end of eight
days from now.

10:16.382 --> 10:20.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it isn't that they will
instantly come
together. There is a negotiation
that needs

10:20.954 --> 10:27.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to take place. People who are
part of the
Bernie Sanders camp, should
Clinton prevail,

10:27.494 --> 10:31.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are going to need to know that
she has heard
them, she has listened to them,
that she understands

10:31.397 --> 10:36.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their frustration and shares in
their desire
to make some substantial changes
in the direction

10:36.135 --> 10:37.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our nation is going.

10:38.004 --> 10:42.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what does he
do about those
voters who have supported him
who are telling

10:42.775 --> 10:46.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pollsters they're going to look
at Donald
Trump in November?

10:46.145 --> 10:50.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. JEFF MERKLEY: He can be the
single most
important voice in that regard,
helping to

10:50.984 --> 10:53.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bring folks together, if he is
not the nominee.

10:53.586 --> 10:55.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you mean?

10:55.355 --> 10:59.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. JEFF MERKLEY: Well, if he
doesn't win
the nomination, those folks who
have been

10:59.359 --> 11:04.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supporting him are going to turn
to him to
see his insight on the
partnership that's

11:04.964 --> 11:12.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being crafted with Secretary
Clinton's team,
and that for him to vouch for
that partnership

11:12.539 --> 11:15.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would be the most essential
element in bringing
the two sides together.

11:15.875 --> 11:20.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are others of us who will
work very
hard to bring the two sides
together, but

11:20.046 --> 11:25.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the responsibility first and
foremost will
come with Secretary Clinton and
with Senator

11:25.151 --> 11:26.853 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sanders.

11:26.886 --> 11:28.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are you confident
that they
can come together before the
convention?

11:28.688 --> 11:32.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. JEFF MERKLEY: I am, because
I know that,
from the very beginning, Bernie
Sanders has

11:32.959 --> 11:37.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said, if he's not the nominee,
he's going
to make absolutely sure we don't
end up with

11:37.697 --> 11:44.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the situation like we did with
Ralph Nader,
where, essentially, we handed
over an election

11:44.304 --> 11:49.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a Republican, a Republican
who put our
nation way off-track, that the
nation can't

11:49.876 --> 11:51.644 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
afford that.

11:51.678 --> 11:54.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, certainly, all the goals
that Senator
Sanders has for improving our
nation would

11:54.280 --> 11:55.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not be served by that outcome.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Jeff
Merkley of Oregon,
we thank you.

11:58.785 --> 12:01.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. JEFF MERKLEY: You're
welcome. And thank
you.

12:01.654 --> 12:05.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now we turn
to Kentucky,
where Hillary Clinton has been
campaigning

12:05.291 --> 12:09.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aggressively in recent days,
hoping, of course,
for a win there.

12:09.629 --> 12:16.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congressman John Yarmuth is
backing Secretary
Clinton. He's the lone Democrat
in the Bluegrass

12:16.035 --> 12:18.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
State's congressional
delegation.

12:18.204 --> 12:20.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congressman Yarmuth, good to see
you. Thank
you for being with us.

12:20.506 --> 12:22.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. JOHN YARMUTH (D), Kentucky:
Sure, Judy.
Good to be with you.

12:22.375 --> 12:28.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I don't know if
you just heard
Senator Merkley say that, yes,
it looks like

12:28.715 --> 12:31.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Sanders will be able to
sit down and
work with Secretary Clinton if
she has the

12:31.985 --> 12:37.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most delegates after the end of
these primaries,
but he also said that Senator
Sanders is going

12:37.357 --> 12:40.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to fight for every vote he can
until the end
of this primary process.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. JOHN YARMUTH: Yes, well, I
think that's
fine.

12:43.062 --> 12:49.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, ultimately, the real
critical factor
will be what they do after it is
clear that

12:49.202 --> 12:55.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary Clinton will be the
nominee and
has won enough delegates. I
don't really worry

12:55.575 --> 13:00.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
too much about the campaign
rhetoric. I mean,
nobody has said meaner things
about a candidate

13:01.014 --> 13:06.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in their own party than
Republicans have done,
and now they seem to be doing
some kind of

13:06.085 --> 13:08.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a marital ritual going on now.

13:08.988 --> 13:14.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think, ultimately, what
happens after
Hillary reaches that threshold
of delegates

13:14.694 --> 13:19.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the most important thing. And
then it will
be -- I think it will be truly
up to Bernie

13:19.966 --> 13:24.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders to prove that this whole
thing with
the Democratic Party wasn't just
a charade,

13:24.837 --> 13:28.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he actually wants to see
Democratic values
advanced in the fall.

13:28.775 --> 13:33.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you say
it's up to Senator
Sanders. We just heard Senator
Merkley say

13:33.513 --> 13:39.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's going to be up to Secretary
Clinton to
show that she cares about these
issues, like

13:39.619 --> 13:46.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
big money in American politics,
like too many
Americans not benefiting from
the economic

13:47.026 --> 13:48.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
growth we have seen.

13:48.895 --> 13:51.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. JOHN YARMUTH: You know, I
was with her
for five hours yesterday in
Louisville. That's

13:51.631 --> 13:53.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all she talked about.

13:53.433 --> 13:59.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there is no question
that she has
met that test. She is clearly
concerned about

13:59.906 --> 14:09.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
economic parity in the
workplace, about minimizing
the income and the wealth gap in
this country.

14:09.982 --> 14:17.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has detailed policies on
things like workplace
fairness, paid medical leave,
early childhood

14:17.957 --> 14:23.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
education, all the free
community college
education, debt-free college
education.

14:23.529 --> 14:27.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are things that are
clearly on her platform,
and she talks about them every
day. So, I

14:27.867 --> 14:33.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't think there is going to be
much distance
between Hillary Clinton and
Bernie Sanders

14:33.873 --> 14:35.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
once the rhetoric stops.

14:35.641 --> 14:38.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What --
Congressman Yarmuth,
what does Secretary Clinton,
though, need

14:38.244 --> 14:42.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do to appeal to the voters
she's been struggling
to win over a majority of? And
I'm talking

14:42.615 --> 14:45.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about the millennials, the
younger voters.

14:45.985 --> 14:50.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those voters, it's remarkable,
when you look
at the exit polls of voters in
the last few

14:50.556 --> 14:56.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states that have held their
primary votes,
West Virginia, Indiana,
Wisconsin, New York,

14:56.395 --> 15:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the percentage of voters who say
they don't
consider Secretary Clinton
trustworthy. What

15:00.199 --> 15:02.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
does she need to do to turn that
around?

15:02.034 --> 15:07.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. JOHN YARMUTH: Well, she
just needs to
keep speaking frankly about her
record, about

15:07.507 --> 15:09.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the things that she cares about.

15:09.475 --> 15:14.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, ultimately, you know, we
have got so
much noise in this campaign. And
I think the

15:14.881 --> 15:18.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who are listening to
Bernie Sanders
aren't listening to much else,
just like the

15:18.885 --> 15:22.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people who are listening to
Donald Trump aren't
listening to much else.

15:22.355 --> 15:28.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, once it's a one-on-one
race, you
have the comparison of somebody
who has basically

15:28.661 --> 15:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
double-crossed everybody he's
come in contact
with during his business career,
and you have

15:34.467 --> 15:40.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
somebody who has worked steadily
for four
decades now to help the middle
class and to

15:41.007 --> 15:46.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
help people get into the middle
class, I think
the choice will be very, very
clear for all

15:46.379 --> 15:49.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those people who are now so
enthusiastic about
Bernie.

15:49.215 --> 15:53.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But don't you
still have a
pretty considerable amount of
repair work

15:53.920 --> 15:59.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do between Secretary Clinton
and Senator
Sanders? I read just today a
release from

15:59.058 --> 16:05.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the senator's press office
saying, we call
on Secretary Clinton to some
distorting the

16:05.298 --> 16:11.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
truth about Senator Sanders'
record on supporting
the automakers, people who work
in the auto

16:11.604 --> 16:13.039 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
industry.

16:13.072 --> 16:15.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. JOHN YARMUTH: Well, again,
this is the
normal campaign rhetoric.

16:15.608 --> 16:20.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think every candidate on
both sides
of the partisan divide are
guilty of some

16:20.446 --> 16:27.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exaggeration and stretching
voting records
and characterizing the other
opponent. That's

16:27.253 --> 16:29.055 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going to happen.

16:29.088 --> 16:36.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, again, the proof will be,
once it's one
on one, and Bernie Sanders faces
that choice,

16:36.596 --> 16:42.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and his supporters do, of
whether Hillary
Clinton or Donald Trump will be
a better commander

16:42.101 --> 16:46.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in chief, will be a better
leader for working
Americans, I don't think there
is any question

16:46.572 --> 16:48.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who they are going to be for.

16:48.541 --> 16:51.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, very
quickly, Congressman,
do you think Secretary Clinton
will win your

16:51.978 --> 16:54.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
state, Kentucky, tomorrow, and
do you think
she can win it in the fall?

16:54.380 --> 16:58.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. JOHN YARMUTH: Well, I think
she will
win tomorrow. She's won I think
virtually

16:58.417 --> 17:02.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every state where there has been
a closed
primary, where only Democrats
can vote.

17:02.889 --> 17:07.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even in West Virginia, she
carried the majority
of Democrats who voted. Forty
percent of the

17:07.727 --> 17:11.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
people who voted in the
Democratic primary
there weren't Democrats. In
Kentucky, Democrats

17:11.631 --> 17:16.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only can vote. She is very, very
popular,
she and her husband, in
Kentucky. He carried

17:16.636 --> 17:18.371 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the state twice.

17:18.404 --> 17:21.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think she can make it
competitive in the
fall. Clearly, it is going to be
tough, tough

17:21.908 --> 17:28.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sled for a Democratic candidate
to win the
electoral votes of Kentucky. But
she has promised

17:28.114 --> 17:31.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me she's going to try. She
thinks she can
make it competitive. And I'm
going to be there

17:31.584 --> 17:33.085 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
helping her.

17:33.119 --> 17:35.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman John
Yarmuth, it's
good to see you. Thank you.

17:35.354 --> 17:36.989 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REP. JOHN YARMUTH: Thanks, Judy.

17:37.023 --> 17:41.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we break down
the math
and the movement for the
Democrats and for

17:41.294 --> 17:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans facing the reality
of Donald Trump
at the top of their ticket with
our Politics

17:46.966 --> 17:53.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Monday team, Amy Walter of The
Cook Political
Report and Tamara Keith of NPR.

17:53.506 --> 17:56.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And welcome back to both of you.
It is Monday.

17:56.142 --> 17:59.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Amy Walter, you just heard
from Senator
Merkley. You heard from
Congressman Yarmuth.

17:59.879 --> 18:02.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is the state of this
Democratic contest
right now?

18:02.415 --> 18:04.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Well,
I think they summed it up pretty
well, which

18:04.417 --> 18:09.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, there have been skirmishes
in this race,
but there is not a big, gaping
wound here

18:09.889 --> 18:13.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Democrats or the Democratic
nominee,
specifically Hillary Clinton, is
going to

18:13.626 --> 18:15.361 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have to heal.

18:15.394 --> 18:18.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have talked about this
before, but
the real challenge for the
Democrats going

18:18.731 --> 18:22.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forward -- and I think you have
pointed this
out, too -- is more generational
than it is

18:22.301 --> 18:27.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anything else, but that Donald
Trump helps
to generate enthusiasm where
Hillary Clinton

18:27.807 --> 18:29.542 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cannot.

18:29.575 --> 18:31.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so where she may have
trouble getting
those young voters who have been
turning out

18:31.677 --> 18:36.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Bernie Sanders, it is very
hard to believe
that those voters are going to
go to Donald

18:36.382 --> 18:41.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump. And, in fact, what may be
getting them
out to vote is going to be
Donald Trump, enthusiastically

18:41.787 --> 18:43.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
voting against him.

18:43.656 --> 18:47.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tamara, you have
been talking,
I think, to the Clinton people
today. Do they

18:47.593 --> 18:51.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
think it is going to be
relatively easy to
come together with Senator
Sanders when all

18:51.764 --> 18:53.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this is over?

18:53.599 --> 18:57.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: They
are not entirely clear on that.
Senator Sanders

18:57.536 --> 19:05.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, you know, doing the process
that Senator
Sanders needs to do to get to
where he is

19:05.378 --> 19:08.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
comfortable and where he can get
his voters
to come along.

19:08.914 --> 19:14.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that, if Bernie Sanders,
the day after
voting in Washington, D.C.,
flipped a switch

19:14.887 --> 19:20.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and said, I endorse Hillary
Clinton, I don't
know his supporters would buy
it. So I think

19:20.526 --> 19:25.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Bernie Sanders is in a
process and the
Clinton people are -- in some
ways are just

19:25.064 --> 19:29.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
watching it of figuring out how
he does move
forward. And Senator Merkley
talked about

19:29.335 --> 19:30.836 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
some of that.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And I think they
have surrogates
that can help to do that, too.

19:33.406 --> 19:37.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I totally agree with Tamara that
Bernie Sanders
going out and saying to
supporters, OK, it's

19:37.510 --> 19:40.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time to go and support Hillary
Clinton, I
don't know if they would
actually believe

19:40.479 --> 19:42.281 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

19:42.314 --> 19:44.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, right now, you're already
starting to
see two of the most important
people on the

19:44.517 --> 19:50.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democratic side, President Obama
and Senator
Elizabeth Warren, both taking
aim at Donald

19:50.256 --> 19:54.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump, basically saying to
Democrats, even
though they haven't formally
endorsed Hillary

19:54.293 --> 19:57.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton, you guys, it's time to
get serious
about the general election. We
know who we're

19:57.930 --> 20:02.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up against. It's Donald Trump.
Let's focus
our attention on him, get away
from the fighting.

20:02.935 --> 20:07.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think you will also see
President Obama
playing a very big role in the
November campaign.

20:07.640 --> 20:12.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking of
Donald Trump,
Tamara, today and over the
weekend, there

20:12.912 --> 20:18.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was a lot of reaction to several
news stories
about the presumptive Republican
nominee,

20:18.050 --> 20:23.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the one that we just heard in
John Yang's
report about his encounters with
a number

20:23.122 --> 20:26.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of different women over the
years, over the
past few decades.

20:26.459 --> 20:33.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of them, he dated. Some of
them worked
for him. Some of them, he knew
in beauty contests.

20:33.632 --> 20:40.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we also saw, one of the women
who was described
as being critical of him in that
New York

20:40.639 --> 20:43.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Times story is now saying she
was taken out
of context.

20:43.876 --> 20:49.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where does this all come down?
Is he affected
by this in a serious way?

20:49.648 --> 20:54.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And I will say
that, in the
time that you have been on the
air, Donald

20:54.420 --> 20:58.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump has been on yet another
tweet storm
about this story.

20:58.257 --> 21:02.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Twitter, he just tweeted
that The New
York Times interviewed 50 women,
and they

21:02.161 --> 21:05.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only used six of them, and those
six were
the ones that didn't fit their
narrative.

21:05.764 --> 21:11.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Donald Trump is on a rail
about this,
which is interesting.

21:11.437 --> 21:17.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This article is not necessarily
his biggest
problem when it comes to female
voters. He

21:17.977 --> 21:24.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has a challenge with female
voters as it is.
There is a treasure trove for
opposition researchers

21:24.683 --> 21:30.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of interviews that he has done
over the years
with Donald Stern, for instance
-- or with

21:30.256 --> 21:35.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Howard Stern, where he said some
pretty crude
things over the years, because
that's the

21:35.394 --> 21:37.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
format of that show.

21:37.329 --> 21:42.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So this is probably not the last
time we are
going to hear these kinds of
things.

21:42.568 --> 21:44.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is it a problem,
Amy, for him?

21:44.403 --> 21:49.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You know, I think
the challenge
right now for Democrats and for
anybody else

21:49.308 --> 21:54.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who doesn't want to see Donald
Trump elected
is that voters are willing to
forgive a certain

21:54.580 --> 21:58.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amount about Donald Trump,
especially the
Donald Trump of the '80s and
'90s, who was

21:58.417 --> 22:02.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an entertainer, who wasn't
running for president.

22:02.421 --> 22:07.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the challenge will
be for them
to focus on what his policies
and positions

22:07.960 --> 22:13.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mean for people as president,
rather than
what he's done in his time in
the '80s and

22:13.532 --> 22:17.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
'90s. I don't think it helps
Democrats to
focus on that, just as I don't
think it helps

22:17.036 --> 22:23.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans to rehash the '90s
and Bill Clinton
and his problems with women.

22:23.075 --> 22:29.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But we know that
-- Amy and
Tam, we know that a number of
news media organizations,

22:29.315 --> 22:33.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
certainly The Washington Post,
has said that
they are assigning a large
number of reporters

22:33.219 --> 22:38.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to look into Donald Trump's
history. They
said they're doing the same
thing about Hillary

22:38.624 --> 22:40.459 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton.

22:40.492 --> 22:45.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet we're already seeing the
difficulty
in this, I guess you would call
it a relationship

22:45.064 --> 22:51.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between the news media and
Donald Trump's
candidacy. It's already
incredibly prickly.

22:51.170 --> 22:58.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, and it's a
real challenge
for the news media, a challenge
that we in

22:58.043 --> 23:01.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the media haven't always met
particularly
well.

23:01.380 --> 23:08.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump, if you just want
to focus on
policy, he, at times, seems to
be saying different

23:08.120 --> 23:13.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things on the same policy in the
same interview,
and it presents a real
challenge.

23:13.993 --> 23:19.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, for him, that's totally --
that's part
of his brand. Donald Trump's
brand has been

23:19.798 --> 23:25.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he shoots from the hip,
that he's the
guy who says it like it is. And
all of that

23:25.170 --> 23:26.872 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fits for him.

23:26.905 --> 23:30.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think that the Clinton
campaign and
Democrats are going to have this
challenge

23:30.676 --> 23:35.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of how they figure out -- you
know, calling
him a flip-flopper isn't going
to really be

23:35.314 --> 23:36.715 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a problem for Donald Trump.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It is a
challenge.

23:38.350 --> 23:40.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That is the biggest
challenge.

23:40.085 --> 23:44.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think those of us in the
media and those
of us inside Washington, we hear
somebody

23:44.456 --> 23:47.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that talks about being flexible
on issues,
and we say, as Tam pointed out,
they're a

23:47.660 --> 23:50.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
flip-flopper or they don't have
an ideological
core.

23:50.229 --> 23:53.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a lot of voters look at that
and go, well,
of course he should be flexible.
If you're

23:53.799 --> 23:57.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to get real stuff done, if
you're going
to compromise, if you're going
to make deals,

23:57.369 --> 24:00.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you have got to be flexible
around the edges.

24:00.372 --> 24:06.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, you know, going in and
talking about
Donald Trump's positions
specifically are

24:06.612 --> 24:10.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be difficult, which I
think is why
you're going to hear a lot about
his judgment.

24:10.916 --> 24:16.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this the kind of person who
has the judgment
and the temperament to do the
job as president?

24:16.121 --> 24:21.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, look, they are going to
talk about his
relationships with women and
what it would

24:21.126 --> 24:23.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mean in terms of his judgment
and his temperament
going forward.

24:23.796 --> 24:27.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's pretty
clear that
the Trump campaign trying to
change the subject.

24:27.166 --> 24:30.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm just being told by our
producer that the
Trump campaign has just
announced that he

24:30.736 --> 24:34.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is going to be meeting with
former Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger...

24:34.440 --> 24:35.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Of course.

24:35.407 --> 24:37.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... later --
later this week.

24:37.343 --> 24:41.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Much more to talk about. Hoping
to get to
what is happening to this effort
to find an

24:41.714 --> 24:44.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alternative in the Republican
Party to Donald
Trump.

24:44.717 --> 24:47.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does either one of you want to
say that that
is going to go anywhere right
now?

24:47.986 --> 24:49.722 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Tam?

24:49.755 --> 24:53.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: I would like to
say that it
is probably not going anywhere.
It's late

24:53.125 --> 24:55.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the game, very late in the
game.

24:56.028 --> 25:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And experts who have looked at
this thing
-- the person looking who was at
it for Michael

25:00.399 --> 25:04.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bloomberg to see if it would be
possible for
him to jump in, they felt like
they were late,

25:04.803 --> 25:06.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and that was months ago.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Concur. It should
have -- if they
wanted to have an alternative,
it should have

25:08.974 --> 25:11.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happened about six to eight
months ago.

25:11.243 --> 25:14.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter,
Tamara Keith, thank
you.

25:14.246 --> 25:18.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

25:18.384 --> 25:22.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

25:22.488 --> 25:27.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It was a busy
day at the
Supreme Court. The justices
weighed in on

25:27.626 --> 25:33.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a handful of cases, including
what was supposed
to be one of this term's
blockbusters: a dispute

25:33.165 --> 25:37.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pitting religious freedom
against mandate
to cover contraception under the
Affordable

25:37.803 --> 25:39.705 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Care Act.

25:39.738 --> 25:44.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the eight justices failed to
offer a definitive
decision, sending the case back
down to lower

25:44.376 --> 25:46.178 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
federal courts.

25:46.211 --> 25:48.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama addressed the
decision, and
speculated there might have been
a different

25:48.947 --> 25:55.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outcome if the vacancy left by
the late Justice
Scalia had been filled. He spoke
with BuzzFeed

25:55.220 --> 25:57.022 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
News.

25:57.055 --> 25:59.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Women will still continue to be
able to get

25:59.858 --> 26:05.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
contraception if they are
getting health insurance.

26:05.497 --> 26:14.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we are properly
accommodating religious
institutions who have objections
to contraception.

26:14.640 --> 26:22.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I won't speculate as to why they
punted, but
my suspicion is, if we had nine
Supreme Court

26:22.581 --> 26:24.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
justices, instead of eight,
there might have
been a different outcome.

26:24.983 --> 26:29.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We break down
the short-handed
court and its rulings today with
chief Washington

26:29.054 --> 26:32.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
correspondent for "The National
Law Journal"
and "NewsHour" regular Marcia
Coyle.

26:32.758 --> 26:37.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marcia, we spoke about this when
the justices
seemed to ask for more
information from everyone,

26:37.463 --> 26:42.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to figure out a third
way. So here
was a decision without really a
decision.

26:42.167 --> 26:45.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, "The National Law
Journal":
Well, actually, that third way
was sort of

26:45.404 --> 26:47.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an opening for the court.

26:47.406 --> 26:52.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right after oral arguments, when
it looked
like the court was going to
divide 4-4, they

26:52.578 --> 26:58.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issued a special order telling
the parties,
the government and the nonprofit
employers,

26:58.283 --> 27:03.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to brief their own suggested
compromise, a
compromise offered by the court
itself.

27:03.755 --> 27:08.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, when the brief came back,
Hari, it really
didn't look like there was a lot
of room for

27:08.126 --> 27:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
compromise there. But there was
enough there
that the court, in its opinion
today, which

27:14.533 --> 27:20.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was an unsigned opinion read by
the chief
justice from the bench, the
court said, look,

27:20.772 --> 27:26.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it looks as though there's been
movement on
both sides here. Let's give the
parties the

27:26.612 --> 27:32.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opportunity in the lower courts
to develop
it before we, as the Supreme
Court, would

27:32.484 --> 27:34.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
get involved in it.

27:34.386 --> 27:38.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's what they did. They
said specifically
they wouldn't decide whether the
government's

27:38.457 --> 27:46.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
plan in practice now to
accommodate religious
objections substantially
burdened these employers'

27:46.164 --> 27:51.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exercise of religion or whether
the government
had a compelling interest here
or was choosing

27:51.603 --> 27:57.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the least restrictive means to
achieve that
interest, which is the test
under the federal

27:57.276 --> 27:59.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Religious Freedom Restoration
Act.

27:59.778 --> 28:06.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they vacated the lower court
decisions
in the seven cases that they had
before them,

28:06.718 --> 28:12.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then they also had an
additional six cases
that were awaiting the outcome
in today's

28:12.591 --> 28:18.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decision. They vacated the lower
court rulings
in those cases, overwhelmingly
had been in

28:18.297 --> 28:20.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
favor of the government.

28:20.165 --> 28:25.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, basically, those federal
appellate courts
will be starting now from
scratch to see if

28:25.737 --> 28:28.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there really is an opening for a
compromise
here.

28:28.373 --> 28:31.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, if you're
starting over
from scratch, doesn't that mean
that they

28:31.176 --> 28:36.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could come either back to the
same conclusion
or, if you have got a number of
courts, perhaps

28:36.582 --> 28:40.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there will be a disagreement and
then this
-- the merits of the case come
back in front

28:40.719 --> 28:41.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the Supreme Court?

28:41.353 --> 28:43.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Absolutely.

28:43.188 --> 28:47.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If either side is unhappy with
the result,
they can come back to the
Supreme Court. In

28:47.392 --> 28:52.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fact, there was a separate
concurrence by
Justice Sotomayor joined by
Justice Ginsburg

28:52.631 --> 28:58.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in which they said, the court is
not ruling
on the merits here, so if the
lower courts

28:58.103 --> 29:03.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
end up reaching the same legal
results they
did before, that's what happens,
and then

29:03.742 --> 29:05.711 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the next step will follow.

29:05.744 --> 29:13.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they also said that the
nonprofit employers'
suggestion that there should be
contraceptive-only

29:13.318 --> 29:20.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
insurance policies was not
workable. Those
policies did not exist,
according to the government,

29:20.359 --> 29:25.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and would not provide the
seamless health
insurance coverage that Congress
intended

29:25.364 --> 29:27.232 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
under the act.

29:27.265 --> 29:32.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they sort -- those two
justices, at least,
have drawn a line in terms of
what they might

29:32.738 --> 29:34.506 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
accept.

29:34.539 --> 29:36.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
let's talk of
the second case that kind of
came out today

29:36.141 --> 29:38.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was, again, another non-decision
to kick it
down.

29:38.577 --> 29:44.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Spokeo, this was the online
search engine
and the type of results someone
could get

29:44.049 --> 29:46.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and whether, I guess, they have
standing or
not to sue for it.

29:46.585 --> 29:48.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Right.

29:48.487 --> 29:53.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Spokeo, as you said, is an
Internet search
engine. And it had put up online
certain information

29:53.325 --> 29:59.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about a man named Tom Robins.
And that information
was largely incorrect. And he
claimed that

29:59.765 --> 30:03.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that injured him in a number of
ways, including
his job prospects.

30:03.835 --> 30:08.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was looking for a new job at
the time.
Credit information was wrong
about him. So,

30:08.807 --> 30:16.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he sued, saying that Spokeo's
procedural violations
under the federal Credit -- Fair
Credit Reporting

30:17.015 --> 30:18.050 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Act harmed him.

30:18.083 --> 30:19.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Right.

30:19.851 --> 30:24.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: And the question
before the
court was basically, can just
saying that

30:25.023 --> 30:31.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a violation of that act alone
give you the
legal right or standing to sue?

30:31.129 --> 30:37.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the court today sent the
case back to
the lower federal appellate
courts, saying,

30:37.202 --> 30:42.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
basically, what you said here
is, you only
did half the analysis for
standing. You found

30:42.641 --> 30:48.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that there was a particularized
injury to
Mr. Robins, but the other half
is, it has

30:48.613 --> 30:51.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be a concrete injury.

30:51.149 --> 30:56.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so Spokeo will now get
another chance
at defending itself. The
standard is clear

30:56.688 --> 31:01.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and tightened. On the other
hand, the court
gave something to Mr. Robins,
saying that

31:01.393 --> 31:06.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some injuries aren't tangible,
they can be
intangible, and you can use that
under this

31:06.598 --> 31:08.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
act.

31:08.266 --> 31:13.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it was probably not a very
satisfying
decision to either side. And big
business

31:13.739 --> 31:19.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had watched this case closely,
because it
felt that it's too easy to sue
under the Fair

31:19.578 --> 31:26.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Credit Reporting Act, another
act, at least
three other federal laws
involving consumers,

31:26.384 --> 31:28.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they were hoping for a
definitive answer
today.

31:28.520 --> 31:33.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Does this
narrow then the
scope of which -- what is the
sort of threshold

31:33.391 --> 31:35.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where somebody could bring a
lawsuit? Is that
a win for big business?

31:35.794 --> 31:40.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: It tightens it up
a little bit,
but it's a narrow decision, and
I think it's

31:40.899 --> 31:47.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a narrow decision because the
court, again,
is striving to find consensus in
these cases,

31:47.639 --> 31:49.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
since it's missing a ninth
justice.

31:49.508 --> 31:53.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Let's talk a
bit about this.
Are we seeing a pattern of 4-4
decisions here

31:53.445 --> 31:56.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that would be different, as the
president
said, if there was a fifth
justice -- or a

31:56.748 --> 31:58.617 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ninth justice?

31:58.650 --> 32:03.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Well, I think,
Hari, we're seeing
more of those decisions without
a ninth justice.

32:03.054 --> 32:07.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clearly, the court is struggling
to reach
some kind of a consensus and
trying to avoid

32:07.993 --> 32:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those 4-4 splits. The court has
already decided
the big union case involving
fair share fees

32:14.699 --> 32:20.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by non-union members paid to
public employee
unions. There, they divided 4-4.

32:20.772 --> 32:27.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They divided 4-4 in an Equal
Opportunity Act
case earlier in the term. And
just last week,

32:27.345 --> 32:34.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a death penalty case, the
justices split
4-4 on a request by Alabama to
block a lower

32:34.653 --> 32:40.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
federal appellate court's order
temporarily
delaying the execution of an
Alabama death

32:40.759 --> 32:42.627 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
row inmate.

32:42.661 --> 32:47.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are going to have to wait
now, I think,
Hari, to see how the court
resolves the remaining

32:47.232 --> 32:52.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cases. There are still a few
very big cases
with very difficult issues
facing them.

32:52.437 --> 32:53.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Marcia Coyle,
thanks.

32:53.605 --> 32:54.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: My pleasure, Hari.

32:54.739 --> 33:07.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

33:07.519 --> 33:13.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
black hole blues,
recording the soundtrack of
outer space.

33:13.558 --> 33:19.965 align:left position:25%,start line:66.67% size:75%
But, first, in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the
country's
reputedly moderate ruling
Islamic community

33:19.998 --> 33:23.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is cracking down on dozens of
radical mosques.

33:23.468 --> 33:29.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The head of that community is on
guard after
his life was threatened by
extremists. The

33:29.040 --> 33:33.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
radical mosques will be shut
down unless they
come under the council's
control. But there

33:33.845 --> 33:38.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are doubts whether these small,
mainly rural
mosques pose the greatest threat
in terms

33:38.950 --> 33:40.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of radicalization.

33:40.785 --> 33:44.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A former Bosnian intelligence
officer has
told the "NewsHour" that Western
allies should

33:45.023 --> 33:51.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be more concerned about the risk
from a huge
Saudi-sponsored mosque in the
capital, Sarajevo.

34:00.906 --> 34:05.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm heading up to a remote

called Osve, which is a place
where, supposedly,

34:05.977 --> 34:11.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are some supporters of the
so-called
Islamic State. There have been
people who've

34:11.416 --> 34:17.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gone from this village to fight
in Syria.
Some have reportedly been
killed. And we're

34:17.122 --> 34:23.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to meet somebody who used
to play rock
'n' roll, but is now labeled by
the head of

34:23.995 --> 34:29.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Islamic community in Bosnia
as someone
who is a terrorist.

34:30.001 --> 34:37.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Izet Hadzic used to be lead
guitarist in a
band called Black Lady. After
fighting in

34:37.542 --> 34:42.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Bosnian War, he abandoned
what he thought
was a decadent lifestyle and
sought peace

34:42.147 --> 34:46.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in religion. He leads one of
these so-called
radical mosques. While he's in
dispute with

34:46.952 --> 34:50.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Islamic establishment, he
insists he's
no terrorist.

34:50.088 --> 34:55.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IZET HADZIC, Mosque Leader
(through translator):
Where does it come from to call
us terrorists?

34:55.060 --> 35:00.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is because that people who
look like us,
have these beards, are doing
such acts in

35:00.398 --> 35:03.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the world, specifically ISIS and
this cretin
Baghdadi.

35:03.568 --> 35:07.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Two doors away
from Hadzic's
small holding is the father of a
young man

35:07.772 --> 35:14.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
killed in Syria. Next door is a
family Hadzic
regards as extreme. Bosnian
intelligence officers

35:14.179 --> 35:15.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are frequent visitors.

35:15.914 --> 35:18.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hadzic unequivocally condemns
Islamic State.

35:18.917 --> 35:24.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
IZET HADZIC (through
translator): You can't
call this jihad. To take a gun
while someone

35:24.155 --> 35:29.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is walking down the street with
his family
and begin to shoot? Can you
imagine soldier

35:29.394 --> 35:33.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doing this? These people are
equal to cowards.

35:33.064 --> 35:40.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: We had a
polite, but frosty
reception in Bocinje, a nearby
village that

35:40.538 --> 35:46.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was a stronghold of foreign
mujahideen during
the Bosnian War. We hoped to
interview a man

35:46.044 --> 35:51.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who returned from Syria in 2014,
but he didn't
want to be filmed because of an
impending

35:51.616 --> 35:55.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
court case. His name is Ibrahim
Delic.

35:55.553 --> 35:59.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dozens of other Bosnians now in
Syria are
said to want to return because
they are horrified

35:59.991 --> 36:06.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by ISIS atrocities. Crippled and
radicalized
during the Bosnian War, Delic
recently talked

36:06.064 --> 36:11.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the Balkan Investigative
Reporting Network.
Significantly, he criticized the
Free Syrian

36:11.703 --> 36:13.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Army, who are enemies of ISIS.

36:13.972 --> 36:19.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IBRAHIM DELIC, Fought in Bosnian
War (through
translator): That Free Syrian
Army, that is

36:19.444 --> 36:25.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one scum army. Sometimes, they
picked a girl,
took her, raped a girl, gave her
back home,

36:25.617 --> 36:27.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or they killed her.

36:27.419 --> 36:32.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The flag in
this video shot
in Syria is not that of Islamic
State. Delic

36:32.457 --> 36:37.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is telling a crowd to fight for
Islam. He
insists he didn't commit any
crimes.

36:37.095 --> 36:39.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
IBRAHIM DELIC (through
translator): When I
saw that, at the checkpoints,
they started

36:39.964 --> 36:44.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to stop foreigners who came to
fight, when
I saw Free Syrian Army soldiers
taking guns

36:44.169 --> 36:48.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
away from them and killing them
for the gun
or for the little money they
had, these foreign

36:48.473 --> 36:52.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
guys started to attack back. And
at that moment,
I knew that a big conflict among
them is going

36:52.911 --> 36:54.145 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to happen.

36:54.179 --> 36:56.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I asked some people to help get
me back across
the border.

36:56.381 --> 37:01.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This poor rural
village contains
several Serb families, once the
sworn enemies

37:01.352 --> 37:06.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Islamists. But subsistence
farmer Milan
Petrovic insists he's happy to
live here.

37:06.958 --> 37:10.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILAN PETROVIC, Farmer (through
translator):
To tell you the truth, they are
our good neighbors.

37:10.695 --> 37:14.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have no problems. They greet
us, we greet
them. We don't have any
problems.

37:14.132 --> 37:18.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: To get an
assessment of the
risk posed by radical Islamists
in Bosnia,

37:18.436 --> 37:23.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we visited a murder scene, in
truth, a mocked-up
murder scene used for training
students at

37:23.741 --> 37:27.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Department of Criminology at
Sarajevo
University.

37:27.312 --> 37:32.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Professor Goran Kovacevic, a
Serb, is an expert
on Islamic radicals and spent
seven years

37:32.550 --> 37:34.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as an agent with Bosnian
intelligence.

37:34.486 --> 37:38.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GORAN KOVACEVIC, Professor,
Sarajevo University:
They are not radicals like they
are presented

37:38.857 --> 37:45.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the media. For example, you
have in the
United States Amish groups
behaving in a similar

37:45.363 --> 37:47.098 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
manner.

37:47.132 --> 37:50.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The big
difference is that
the Amish are avowed pacifists.
The radicals

37:50.668 --> 37:54.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are total opposites, according
to officials
of Bosnia's Islamic community.

37:54.639 --> 38:00.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The organization claims it is
trying to preserve
moderate Koranic principles
practiced in Bosnia

38:00.645 --> 38:05.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since the country was conquered
by the Ottoman
Empire in the 15th century.

38:05.783 --> 38:10.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
International relations director
Razim Colic
says hard-line mosques are the
product of

38:10.355 --> 38:12.223 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
extreme foreign influence.

38:12.257 --> 38:17.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAZIM COLIC, Bosnian Islamic
Community: As
the passage of time, these
people got radicalized.

38:17.896 --> 38:21.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A number of them, they have been
in contact
with some people outside
Bosnia-Herzegovina,

38:21.733 --> 38:26.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because this is not from Bosnia.
It has been
imported from somewhere else.

38:26.237 --> 38:31.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Since issuing
an edict effectively
outlawing the radical mosques,
Bosnia's Muslim

38:31.075 --> 38:36.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
spiritual leader, Husein
Kavazovic, seen here
at an inauguration ceremony, has
required

38:36.447 --> 38:38.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
additional security.

38:38.216 --> 38:41.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAZIM COLIC: They told that they
are -- when
they come here, they will
slaughter him in

38:41.085 --> 38:48.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the middle of Sarajevo. So, we
are probably
the first target, because they
take us as

38:48.860 --> 38:50.662 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
infidels.

38:50.695 --> 38:57.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But concerns
have been raised
about the huge Saudi-funded King
Fahd Mosque,

38:57.535 --> 39:02.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of several that have changed
not just
Sarajevo's skyline, but also
allegedly the

39:02.340 --> 39:03.675 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
way of thinking.

39:03.708 --> 39:06.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yet, nominally, it's controlled
by the Bosnian
Islamic community.

39:06.844 --> 39:11.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GORAN KOVACEVIC: People should
be worried
about this mosque. They will
have a lot of

39:11.716 --> 39:17.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
money. That's the most radical
mosque in the
whole Bosnia-Herzegovina. But
it's under formal

39:17.655 --> 39:25.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Islamic community. And it's not
ever mentioned
as a part about this story of
these illegal

39:25.330 --> 39:27.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
religious communities.

39:27.165 --> 39:32.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's the most radical. All
those guys
that actually performed some
kind of terrorist

39:32.537 --> 39:37.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
activity in Bosnia-Herzegovina
were part of
that mosque, and nobody is
mentioning that.

39:37.909 --> 39:42.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Certainly, the
King Fahd
Mosque doesn't welcome scrutiny.
We were some

39:43.014 --> 39:47.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
distance away because of a sign
at the entrance
banning filming. Just a few
moments after

39:47.252 --> 39:49.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the call to prayer began, the
police arrived.

39:49.721 --> 39:56.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: The King Fahd guys were
calling because
they saw us filming. So I said,
we are doing

39:56.094 --> 40:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nothing wrong. What you can do,
you can write
our names and let it be, let us
be.

40:01.699 --> 40:06.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: I'm sorry.
Yesterday, we
were talking to the foreign
relations guy

40:06.271 --> 40:13.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in charge of the Islamic
council, and we were
told that there's absolutely no
problem, they

40:13.811 --> 40:16.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can be perfectly open about it,
so what's
the problem?

40:16.948 --> 40:20.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Via text messages, we complained
about our
half-hour encounter with the
police to Colic

40:20.852 --> 40:25.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Islamic community, who,
despite his
position, had been unable to
allow us to film

40:25.957 --> 40:31.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inside the mosque. He dismissed
our complaints
and also rejected the concerns
of the former

40:31.429 --> 40:32.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
intelligence agent.

40:32.563 --> 40:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAZIM COLIC: I simply don't
agree with the
officer.

40:34.699 --> 40:38.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: So, what is the
-- the sort
of message that is coming out
those mosques

40:38.603 --> 40:39.937 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
then?

40:39.971 --> 40:42.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAZIM COLIC: I don't know that
we don't have
-- the message...

40:42.473 --> 40:43.408 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

40:43.441 --> 40:43.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Do you monitor
the mosques?

40:43.975 --> 40:45.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RAZIM COLIC: Sorry?

40:45.476 --> 40:46.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Do you monitor
the mosques
to hear what they're saying?

40:46.477 --> 40:47.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RAZIM COLIC: Yes, yes, yes, of
course.

40:47.578 --> 40:49.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: How frequently
do you do
that?

40:49.414 --> 40:52.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAZIM COLIC: On a daily basis,
because we
have five times a day prayer
there. Our imams,

40:52.884 --> 40:54.752 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the three of them are there.

40:54.786 --> 40:59.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Late last
month, Margaret
Cormack, the piano-playing U.S.
ambassador,

40:59.991 --> 41:05.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hosted CIA Director John Brennan
when he made
a surprise visit to Sarajevo to
discuss the

41:05.296 --> 41:07.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country's counterterrorism
efforts.

41:07.832 --> 41:12.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ambassador Cormack regards the
Bosnian Islamic
community as a crucial partner
in the battle

41:12.837 --> 41:17.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against radicalization. But she
had a clear
message for Muslim nations and
their vested

41:17.575 --> 41:19.610 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
interests.

41:19.644 --> 41:21.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:66.67% size:87.5%
MARGARET CORMACK, U.S.
Ambassador to
Bosnia-Herzegovina:
We need these countries to allow
Bosnia and

41:21.346 --> 41:25.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Herzegovina to maintain its
traditional moderate
version of Islam.

41:25.483 --> 41:29.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Given the
uncertainty about
which Muslims potentially pose
the greatest

41:29.787 --> 41:34.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
risk, can she be certain that
the U.S. and
its allies are getting the right
information

41:34.525 --> 41:36.227 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from Sarajevo?

41:36.260 --> 41:39.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET CORMACK: Certainly, all
the U.S.
security teams who either work
inside of our

41:39.464 --> 41:45.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
embassy or who have visited from
Washington
feel that we have a really
positive, open

41:45.136 --> 41:49.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
information-sharing with our
colleagues, our
counterparts in Bosnia and
Herzegovina.

41:49.841 --> 41:54.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't have a sense that there
are blockages
in that. What we have worked
with them on

41:54.278 --> 41:59.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is establishing better
information-sharing
between the services here in the
country,

41:59.217 --> 42:01.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I think that they're making
progress in
that regard as well.

42:01.786 --> 42:06.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Analysts like
Dino Abazovic,
a specialist in conflict and its
aftermath,

42:06.858 --> 42:10.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are certain that poverty is also
a precursor
for radicalization.

42:10.428 --> 42:14.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DINO ABAZOVIC, University of
Sarajevo: A number
of people, particularly
youngsters, younger

42:14.132 --> 42:18.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
generation are seeing no future
in the way
of their prospects for
employment and all

42:18.403 --> 42:21.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these things. More than 40
percent of Bosnia
population is officially
unemployed.

42:21.806 --> 42:28.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In that respect, I would say is
the kind of
circumstances that are
fertilizing a fertile

42:28.379 --> 42:34.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ground for different kinds of
radicalization.
So, unfortunately, anyone who
neglects social

42:34.118 --> 42:38.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and economic situation that
these people are
living in are -- I think is
wrong.

42:38.990 --> 42:44.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Bosnia's
enduring economic
crisis requires members of the
country's top

42:44.095 --> 42:50.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rock band, Konvoj, to take
second jobs to
support their music careers.
They are advocates

42:50.034 --> 42:55.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the ideal of Sarajevo as a
multicultural
city and are horrified by
increasing international

42:55.640 --> 42:57.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hostility towards Muslims.

42:57.542 --> 43:00.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: It's pretty -- wow, what's
happening
now in the world?

43:00.311 --> 43:03.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOJAN CRNOGORAC, Konvoj: I have
been with
these people all of my life. My
best friend

43:03.881 --> 43:11.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a Muslim. He was the best man
at my wedding.
I was the best man at his
wedding. My parents

43:11.489 --> 43:17.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
told me not to divide people
according to
nationality or ethnic.

43:17.195 --> 43:23.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People here are normal. I think
that's the
kind of media stuff that's
pumping all this

43:23.468 --> 43:25.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
situation in Bosnia.

43:25.903 --> 43:31.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: International
officials are
convinced that Bosnia's
European, Westernized

43:31.542 --> 43:37.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moderate Muslims are the best
possible bulwark
against radicalization. But in a
country awash

43:37.615 --> 43:42.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with weapons left over from the
war, the need
for enhanced vigilance is
paramount.

43:42.720 --> 43:49.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Sarajevo.

43:49.260 --> 44:00.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It was big
news in February
when scientists announced they
had at long

44:00.905 --> 44:06.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last detected gravitational
waves from space.
Albert Einstein had predicted
the existence

44:06.811 --> 44:11.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of these waves in his general
theory of relativity,
but they're rather hard to see
or, as we learn

44:11.716 --> 44:15.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in our latest "NewsHour"
Bookshelf conversation,
to hear.

44:15.186 --> 44:17.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has that.

44:17.054 --> 44:26.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The sound lasted
about a fifth
of a second, but it represented
gravitational

44:26.497 --> 44:31.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
waves created by the collision
of two black
holes with the combined mass of
about 62 of

44:31.702 --> 44:34.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our suns a billion light years
away.

44:34.338 --> 44:38.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Black Hole Blues and Other
Songs from Outer
Space" is a story of things
extraordinarily

44:38.809 --> 44:44.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
small and hard-to-comprehend
large, and of
the human drama in discovering
them.

44:44.115 --> 44:48.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Author Janna Levin is a
physicist and astronomer
at Barnard College. She's also
author of a

44:49.020 --> 44:52.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
novel, "A Madman Dreams of
Turing Machines."

44:52.156 --> 44:56.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the blues, we're sort of in
the realm
of metaphor here, but the idea
is to hear

44:56.594 --> 44:59.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the universe, at least as
aspects that we
can't possibly see.

45:00.031 --> 45:01.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANNA LEVIN, Author, "Black Hole
Blues and
Other Songs from Outer Space":
Yes, most of

45:01.432 --> 45:04.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what we know about the universe
really does
come to us from light.

45:04.535 --> 45:08.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have telescopes that span
the range
of light to take pictures of the
sky. This

45:08.806 --> 45:12.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is utterly different. This is
not a form of
light. So when the black holes
collided, they

45:12.944 --> 45:16.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were like mallets on the drum.
They rang space-time
itself.

45:16.247 --> 45:17.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But you have got
to be able
to hear them.

45:17.748 --> 45:20.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANNA LEVIN: Right. So, you have
to be able
to record the shape of the drum.

45:21.018 --> 45:24.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's basically what this
experiment
did. It recorded the shape of
the ringing

45:24.522 --> 45:28.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drum from two black holes that
collided 1.3
billion years ago.

45:28.259 --> 45:31.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, so
step back and
explain to us as simply as you
can, what is

45:31.629 --> 45:36.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a gravitational wave? And why is
it important
to our understanding of things?

45:36.500 --> 45:38.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JANNA LEVIN: Yes. Yes.

45:38.302 --> 45:40.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, a gravitational wave is
really a ripple
or a change in the shape of
space and time

45:40.504 --> 45:44.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
itself. So, if you were floating
near these
colliding black holes, you would
literally

45:44.308 --> 45:49.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be squeezed and stretched. And
you would experience
this squeezing and stretching.
It emanates

45:49.447 --> 45:53.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from this collision. It causes
these ripples
in space, kind of like fish
swirling in a

45:53.618 --> 45:55.620 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pond causing water waves.

45:55.653 --> 45:58.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then they emanate out. They
travel at
the speed of light, even though
they are not

45:58.990 --> 46:02.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
light. And eventually they make
it here to
the Earth. If you were floating
nearby, you

46:02.293 --> 46:05.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
might even literally hear the
wave, because
your ear could respond to the
vibrations.

46:06.030 --> 46:09.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But you're
telling it through
the human drama. You have got
some really

46:09.867 --> 46:14.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
incredible characters, three of
them most
of all, who are at the
beginning. Tell us

46:14.538 --> 46:16.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a little bit about that.

46:16.273 --> 46:18.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANNA LEVIN: So, I really do
think it was
kind of a climbing Mount Everest
story, an

46:18.976 --> 46:20.711 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
adventure story.

46:20.745 --> 46:24.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People like Rai Weiss, who just
dreamed up
this idea of, how could you
record the shape

46:24.382 --> 46:28.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of space-time ringing? And it
was sort of
what he called a haiku, didn't
even believe

46:28.719 --> 46:31.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anything real could come of it.
He started
this in the late '60s.

46:31.822 --> 46:36.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later comes Kip Thorne, who is a
brilliant
theoretical astrophysicist. And
they kind

46:36.260 --> 46:41.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of pull resources. And
eventually Ron Drever
comes in. And now, after 50
years, there's

46:41.165 --> 46:43.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
800, 1,000 people working on
this campaign.

46:43.534 --> 46:46.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And they in a
sense sort of
bet their careers, right?

46:46.303 --> 46:50.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANNA LEVIN: At the time that
when people
like Rai and Kip were dreaming
about these

46:50.341 --> 46:53.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things, people were not even
sure that black
holes were real.

46:53.878 --> 46:57.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there was a lot of argument
in the astrophysics
community even about
gravitational waves themselves,

46:58.015 --> 47:03.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if they were real. So, they were
doing this
almost out of a compulsion. It
really is like

47:03.320 --> 47:07.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
climbing a mountain. They just
couldn't stop.
And the whole community was not
in favor of

47:07.792 --> 47:11.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this experiment. I think that is
not as widely
know when we celebrated the
discovery, that

47:11.829 --> 47:14.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there were a lot of people that
were not in
favor of building this machine.

47:14.965 --> 47:18.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In telling the
story of the
human drama, inevitably, you get
into jealousies,

47:18.836 --> 47:24.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you get into failures, you get
into all kinds
of human dramas.

47:24.709 --> 47:25.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JANNA LEVIN: Yes. Yes.

47:25.876 --> 47:27.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But that is part
of the story.

47:27.878 --> 47:30.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANNA LEVIN: Well, I think what
people don't
appreciate is, that's really how
science is

47:30.915 --> 47:32.750 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
done.

47:32.783 --> 47:35.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People think that we just come
down with these
answers. As scientists, we are
full of answers.

47:35.386 --> 47:38.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's really not what it is
like. Scientists
are full of questions.
Sometimes, the questions

47:38.956 --> 47:42.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't lead you to the answer,
but, sometimes,
they do, and there is this great
discovery.

47:42.827 --> 47:46.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, yes, there is fighting
along the way.
There is competition. There are
failures and

47:46.997 --> 47:50.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
successes. And at the end of the
climb, some
people made it to the summit,
and some people

47:50.868 --> 47:52.570 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
didn't.

47:52.603 --> 47:54.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Tell me about
your own way
into this. You write. You study
this. You

47:54.638 --> 47:55.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
write about black holes.

47:55.539 --> 47:56.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JANNA LEVIN: Yes.

47:56.741 --> 47:58.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have spent a lot of time
thinking about
black holes.

47:58.042 --> 47:59.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

47:59.677 --> 48:01.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JANNA LEVIN: And I'm a
theoretical astrophysicist.
So I work on pen and paper.

48:01.445 --> 48:06.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is very abstract. It is kind
of solitary.
And I originally wanted just to
write kind

48:06.083 --> 48:11.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of abstract treaties about black
holes, but
I got lost into this LIGO story
in part because

48:11.622 --> 48:16.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I became so enamored of the
physicality of
the experiment. I went out to
the sites, these

48:16.627 --> 48:17.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
four-kilometer-long machines.

48:17.895 --> 48:19.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, we should
say LIGO is
the name of...

48:19.830 --> 48:25.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANNA LEVIN: LIGO is the name of
the two machines
that together form this network
of observatories.

48:25.069 --> 48:28.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I just couldn't believe that
they were
pulling it off, and I just loved
going to

48:28.472 --> 48:33.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the sites and watching people
install the
components and make this real,
make it physical,

48:33.177 --> 48:35.045 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
metal and glass.

48:35.079 --> 48:36.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That side of you
that is a
writer as well -- I mentioned
you are a novelist.

48:36.714 --> 48:38.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JANNA LEVIN: Yes.

48:38.149 --> 48:40.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So you like
combining the storytelling
of the science.

48:40.751 --> 48:42.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JANNA LEVIN: Right.

48:42.586 --> 48:45.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I would be talking to Rai
Weiss, who was
one of the original architects.
And the way

48:45.055 --> 48:50.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he spoke about some of his
original ambitions
and how he couldn't stop, and
even a month

48:50.494 --> 48:54.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before the discovery would say
things to me
like, if we don't discover black
holes, this

48:54.665 --> 48:56.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thing is a failure.

48:56.500 --> 49:01.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I became so sort of caught
up in that,
I realized that this could
actually read like

49:01.172 --> 49:06.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a novel. And if you followed
these characters,
you could understand not only
the process

49:06.310 --> 49:09.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of science, but the internal
ambitions and
the drives.

49:09.713 --> 49:13.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So you are doing
all this work
for the book. In the meantime,
the work is

49:13.617 --> 49:14.952 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going on.

49:14.985 --> 49:17.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And then there is this
announcement that we
all get in February.

49:17.388 --> 49:18.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JANNA LEVIN: Yes. Yes.

49:18.756 --> 49:21.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It was a shock
that it came
that quickly, right?

49:21.091 --> 49:24.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANNA LEVIN: Whenever I asked
people, will
you make a discovery in the
science round

49:24.962 --> 49:30.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- this was September of 2015 --
everyone
said, there is no way. There is
no way. They

49:30.201 --> 49:32.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said, it will be 2018 at the
earliest.

49:32.970 --> 49:37.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then it struck, and it
caught everybody
off-guard. They actually weren't
really ready

49:37.141 --> 49:41.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make the detection. They were
still kind
of testing the machine and
banging on it.

49:41.478 --> 49:43.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And then?

49:43.247 --> 49:47.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANNA LEVIN: And then it struck.
It came from
1.3 billion years ago. It struck
Louisiana.

49:47.885 --> 49:53.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
About 10 milliseconds later, it
crosses the
continent and hits Washington
state and rings

49:53.123 --> 49:53.891 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that machine.

49:53.924 --> 49:55.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is a spectacular detection.

49:55.759 --> 49:59.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And let me ask
you finally,
Kip Thorne, one of the
scientists behind all

49:59.730 --> 50:04.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this, you quote him as saying
that our ability
to measure gravitational waves
will -- quote

50:04.802 --> 50:07.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- "open a new window on the
universe."

50:07.071 --> 50:08.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JANNA LEVIN: Yes. Yes.

50:08.939 --> 50:11.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So when you look
at what comes
from this, give us some sense of
what it might

50:11.075 --> 50:12.877 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mean.

50:12.910 --> 50:15.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANNA LEVIN: So, I remember when
I was a young
student listening to Kip talk
about this,

50:15.813 --> 50:20.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before LIGO was even built, and
just before
2000, he always talked about a
new window.

50:20.918 --> 50:25.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we liken it to maybe the
first that anyone
pointed a telescope at the sky.
You know,

50:25.789 --> 50:30.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Galileo was just looking at the
moon and Saturn.
He didn't foresee that there
were hundreds

50:30.828 --> 50:35.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of billions of stars in
collections called
galaxies, or that there were
quasars powered

50:35.599 --> 50:37.368 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by black holes.

50:37.401 --> 50:41.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These were things you couldn't
foresee. And
I think what Kip hopes and what
a lot of us

50:41.939 --> 50:48.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hope is that the future will be
so vast, beyond
what we have even imagined, that
there are

50:48.846 --> 50:53.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dark sources out there that will
ring these
detectors, they will record the
sounds of

50:53.651 --> 50:56.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
space, and there will be things
we have never
even predicted before.

50:56.120 --> 50:58.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, the
new book is
"Black Hole Blues."

50:59.023 --> 51:02.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Janna Levin, thanks so much.

51:02.559 --> 51:06.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JANNA LEVIN: Thanks so much.

51:07.031 --> 51:11.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And finally
tonight, our
"NewsHour" Shares, something
that caught our

51:11.669 --> 51:14.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
eye that might be of interest to
you, too.

51:14.638 --> 51:18.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama honored 13 law
enforcement
officers at the White House
today with the

51:18.709 --> 51:23.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Medal of Valor. The award
recognizes those
who exhibited exceptional
courage in the face

51:23.714 --> 51:26.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of great danger to protect
others.

51:26.951 --> 51:31.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One by one, President Obama
bestowed the day's
medals on those whose acts where
not only

51:31.689 --> 51:36.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
brave, but instinctive. Los
Angeles police
officer Donald Thompson suffered
first- and

51:36.827 --> 51:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
second-degree burns pulling an
unconscious
victim from a burning car.
Officers Jason

51:42.666 --> 51:47.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Salas and Robert Sparks and
Captain Raymond
Bottenfield ended a deadly
shooting rampage

51:47.671 --> 51:49.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at Santa Monica College.

51:49.773 --> 51:54.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Philadelphia Police Sergeant
Robert Wilson
III gave his life to protect
innocent customers

51:54.979 --> 52:01.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and employees during a video
store robbery.
His wife accepted the medal on
his behalf.

52:01.485 --> 52:05.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But all 13, the president said,
went above
and beyond the call of duty.

52:05.756 --> 52:09.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
In all of these places in each
of these moments,

52:09.326 --> 52:13.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these officers were true to
their oaths.

52:13.464 --> 52:18.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To a person, each of these
honorees acted
without regard for their own
safety. They

52:18.369 --> 52:23.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
stood up to dangerous
individuals brandishing
assault rifles, handguns and
knives. Each

52:23.674 --> 52:28.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of them will tell you very
humbly the same
thing: They were just doing
their jobs. They

52:28.879 --> 52:34.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were doing what they had to do,
what they
were trained to do, like on any
other day.

52:34.084 --> 52:39.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want you to know we could not
be prouder
of you and we couldn't be
prouder of your

52:39.390 --> 52:42.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
families for all the
contributions that you
make.

52:42.593 --> 52:46.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: President
Obama signed a
package of bills aimed at
protecting and honoring

52:46.530 --> 52:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
public safety officers into law
shortly before
the ceremony.

52:50.034 --> 52:51.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

52:51.769 --> 52:55.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Tuesday, we explore the
growing problem
of harassment of Muslim-American
students

52:55.973 --> 52:57.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in U.S. public schools.

52:57.274 --> 52:58.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan

52:58.175 --> 53:00.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

53:00.044 --> 53:04.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening. For all of us at the
"PBS NewsHour,"

53:04.782 --> 53:14.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.

53:14.825 --> 53:28.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.
