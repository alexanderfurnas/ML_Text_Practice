HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.

00:05.472 --> 00:06.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

00:06.473 --> 00:08.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Judy Woodruff is away.

00:08.342 --> 00:13.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On tonight's "PBS NewsHour": the
first hurricane
to hit the U.S. mainland in more
than a decade

00:13.247 --> 00:14.848 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
makes landfall.

00:14.882 --> 00:19.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Florida recovers, the East
Coast braces
for the storm's remaining
impact.

00:19.219 --> 00:24.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead: The FBI releases
excerpts of its
interview with Hillary Clinton,
what's in

00:24.224 --> 00:27.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the documents, and how could it
impact the
election.

00:27.294 --> 00:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: Five years later, a
Missouri city hit
by a devastating tornado is
rebuilt from the

00:32.666 --> 00:34.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ruin, physically and
emotionally.

00:34.568 --> 00:39.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAURICE AUBREY, Student: Now we
have this
single past experience that
links us all together,

00:39.439 --> 00:40.674 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as before.

00:40.707 --> 00:43.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it just makes it -- it's
made it so much
better, I think.

00:43.810 --> 00:45.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And it's
Friday.

00:45.345 --> 00:48.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks
are here to
analyze the full week of news.

00:48.315 --> 00:52.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:52.386 --> 00:54.121 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:54.154 --> 01:05.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It has been a
rough day
across Northern Florida, thanks
to Hurricane

01:05.933 --> 01:07.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Hermine.

01:07.134 --> 01:10.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now much of the Atlantic
Seaboard is under
threat.

01:10.137 --> 01:11.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham begins our
coverage.

01:11.939 --> 01:17.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Hermine
barreled ashore
in Florida's Big Bend region on
the Gulf Coast

01:17.277 --> 01:19.046 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
around 1:30 this morning.

01:19.079 --> 01:23.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It battered beaches with winds
of 80 miles
an hour and flooded towns with
storm surge

01:23.583 --> 01:25.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and heavy downpours.

01:25.185 --> 01:30.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: We get out of bed, the
water is ankle-deep,
and go and open the door.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.359 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Floodwaters come rushing in.

01:32.392 --> 01:35.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now the water inside the house
is knee-deep.

01:35.862 --> 01:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Adding to the
mess, the
storm tore up trees and snapped
power lines,

01:40.634 --> 01:42.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
affecting thousands of people.

01:42.869 --> 01:45.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Governor Rick Scott declared a
state of emergency
for more than 50 counties.

01:45.739 --> 01:46.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: And evacuate immediately.

01:46.740 --> 01:47.975 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

01:48.008 --> 01:50.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICK SCOTT (R), Florida: The
number one thing
is to stay safe.

01:50.043 --> 01:52.245 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do not drive in standing water.

01:52.279 --> 01:55.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Stay away from downed power
lines.

01:55.382 --> 01:57.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just because it's clear outside
doesn't mean
it's safe.

01:57.951 --> 02:01.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: From the Gulf
Coast, the
storm moved inland and weakened
as it pushed

02:01.621 --> 02:04.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
across Southern Georgia and the
Carolinas.

02:04.291 --> 02:08.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's expected to regain some of
its power
if the storm moves out over
warmer water in

02:08.729 --> 02:10.230 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Atlantic.

02:10.263 --> 02:13.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That had North Carolina Governor
Pat McCrory
and others waiting and hoping.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.602 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

02:15.635 --> 02:16.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAT MCCRORY (R), North Carolina:
We're going
to see who gets hit the hardest,
and hopefully

02:16.737 --> 02:18.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
no one will get hard hit at all.

02:18.939 --> 02:24.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Again, our goal is to be
overprepared and
underwhelmed when it comes to
this storm.

02:24.311 --> 02:27.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
Mid-Atlantic states
may face the worst of Hermine.

02:27.514 --> 02:32.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's projected to stall offshore
this weekend,
with the potential for historic
levels of

02:32.152 --> 02:34.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
beach erosion and coastal
flooding.

02:34.221 --> 02:39.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Already, Labor Day weekend
events up and down
the coast were being canceled or
delayed.

02:39.159 --> 02:44.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, today, at least, officials
in Georgia
said the effects were less
damaging than feared,

02:44.598 --> 02:49.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and surfers even took advantage
of big waves
near Savannah.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Back in Florida, there were
other concerns.

02:51.705 --> 02:56.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The state has already reported
dozens of cases
of Zika virus, and the storm's
passage will

02:56.243 --> 03:00.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now leave countless pools of
standing water,
ideal breeding grounds for the
mosquitoes

03:01.014 --> 03:02.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that transmit Zika.

03:02.849 --> 03:06.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: William will
be back with
what's behind the recent absence
of hurricanes

03:06.219 --> 03:09.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hitting the U.S. mainland after
the news summary.

03:09.556 --> 03:13.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the day's other news: Job
creation in August
came in lighter than expected.

03:13.760 --> 03:19.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Labor Department reports a
net gain of
151,000 positions, far below the
gains of

03:19.132 --> 03:20.834 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
recent months.

03:20.867 --> 03:25.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The unemployment rate for August
stayed at
4.9 percent for the third month
in a row.

03:25.439 --> 03:30.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The weaker numbers could
influence the Federal
Reserve to wait until year's end
before raising

03:30.811 --> 03:32.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
interest rates again.

03:32.579 --> 03:36.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The man who ruled Uzbekistan
with an iron
hand, Islam Karimov, has died of
a stroke.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His government confirmed it
today.

03:38.785 --> 03:44.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Karimov took power in the
Central Asian nation
in 1989, and was widely
condemned for brutally

03:44.491 --> 03:46.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
repressing all dissent.

03:46.593 --> 03:52.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even so, after 9/11, the U.S.
used an Uzbek
air base for airstrikes on
Afghanistan.

03:52.566 --> 03:59.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The deal collapsed when
Karimov's troops machine-gunned
700 protesters in 2005.

03:59.573 --> 04:03.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian President Vladimir Putin
said today
he doesn't know who hacked
Democratic Party

04:03.710 --> 04:05.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
organizations in the U.S.

04:05.712 --> 04:10.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The cyber-attack led to the
release of thousands
of e-mails and documents, and
U.S. intelligence

04:10.250 --> 04:13.120 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agencies have pointed to Russian
hackers.

04:13.153 --> 04:17.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in a new interview with
Bloomberg News,
Putin says the culprits could be
from anywhere.

04:17.157 --> 04:21.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through
translator): There are so many
hackers nowadays,

04:21.795 --> 04:24.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and they act so meticulously and
so precisely.

04:24.364 --> 04:28.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They camouflage their activity
to pretend
that they were some other
hackers from other

04:28.034 --> 04:29.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
territories or others countries.

04:29.736 --> 04:33.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At a state level, Russia is
definitely not
involved in this.

04:33.106 --> 04:37.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Putin also
said Moscow has
no intention of trying to
interfere in the

04:37.777 --> 04:39.579 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
U.S. election.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A gunman who killed a security
agent at Los
Angeles International Airport
will avoid the

04:42.849 --> 04:44.618 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
death penalty.

04:44.651 --> 04:49.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, Paul Ciancia gets life
in prison,
under a plea deal on murder and
other charges.

04:49.055 --> 04:54.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2013, he shot a federal
screening officer
a dozen times, and wounded three
others.

04:54.861 --> 04:59.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A former Stanford University
swimmer walked
out of jail today in a sexual
assault case

04:59.466 --> 05:01.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that caused a national outcry.

05:01.434 --> 05:07.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brock Turner served half of a
six-month sentence
for attacking an unconscious
woman after heavy

05:07.040 --> 05:08.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
drinking at a party.

05:08.241 --> 05:11.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The victim complained the
sentence was far
too lenient.

05:11.378 --> 05:16.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That sparked widespread
criticism of the judge
and the system, and, this week,
state lawmakers

05:16.082 --> 05:20.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
approved mandatory prison terms
for what Turner
did.

05:20.153 --> 05:25.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Samsung is recalling its
brand-new Galaxy
Note 7 smartphones because the
batteries can

05:25.392 --> 05:27.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
explode or catch fire.

05:27.727 --> 05:30.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today's announcement came just
two weeks after
the product's launch.

05:30.764 --> 05:37.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Samsung says there have been 35
cases of Note
7s burning or exploding out of
2.5 million

05:38.004 --> 05:39.839 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sold worldwide.

05:39.873 --> 05:44.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial
average gained 72 points to
close near 18492.

05:44.411 --> 05:48.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 22 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added nine.

05:48.582 --> 05:51.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the week, all three indexes
gained about
half-a-percent.

05:51.952 --> 05:56.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what Hermine
tells us about weather patterns;
rebuilding

05:56.389 --> 06:01.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joplin, Missouri, five years
after a tornado
flattened much of the city;
delving into the

06:01.695 --> 06:11.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
FBI's report on Hillary
Clinton's e-mails;
and much more.

06:11.738 --> 06:17.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
FBI's report on Hillary
Clinton's e-mails;
and much more.

06:17.577 --> 06:21.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With Hermine heading up the East
Coast of
the U.S., we take a closer look
at the science

06:21.615 --> 06:23.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and frequency of these
hurricanes.

06:23.850 --> 06:25.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham is back with
more.

06:25.685 --> 06:29.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Hurricane
Hermine is the
first major hurricane to hit the
United States

06:29.289 --> 06:30.957 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in 10 years.

06:30.991 --> 06:35.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sandy, which did tremendous
damage in 2012,
wasn't a hurricane when it came
ashore.

06:35.228 --> 06:38.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, why such a long period of
time since the
last major hurricane?

06:38.832 --> 06:40.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
To help answer that, I'm joined
by Sean Sublette.

06:40.700 --> 06:43.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is a meteorologist with the
research group
Climate Central.

06:43.770 --> 06:45.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Sean, just take on this
question.

06:45.939 --> 06:50.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not that anyone is really
complaining about
this, but why have we gone 10
years since

06:50.910 --> 06:52.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the last major storm hit the
U.S.?

06:52.646 --> 06:56.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SUBLETTE, Climate Central:
We really
have been lucky at this point.

06:56.149 --> 07:01.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Weather patterns change from
year to year,
and the Atlantic Basin has been
active over

07:01.421 --> 07:06.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the past decade or so, but the
steering winds
at any given time have largely
directed the

07:06.960 --> 07:10.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
major hurricanes away from the
continental
United States.

07:10.430 --> 07:18.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, to remember, a major
hurricane, by definition,
is a Category 3 or greater
storm, a 3, 4 or

07:18.104 --> 07:19.873 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
5.

07:19.906 --> 07:23.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hermine was a Category 1 storm,
and, like
Sandy, certainly doing a lot of
flood damage,

07:23.143 --> 07:27.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but did not really attain what
we technically
define as a major hurricane.

07:27.447 --> 07:31.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: One of the
things I know
is that a lot of the climate
models initially

07:31.084 --> 07:36.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had predicted that if the
temperature globally
goes up, which it has, and
oceans have gotten

07:36.823 --> 07:41.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
warmer, which they also have,
that we would
see more of these storms and a
greater frequency

07:41.227 --> 07:42.529 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the storms.

07:42.562 --> 07:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, are these models somehow
contradicted
by this last decade?

07:46.966 --> 07:49.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEAN SUBLETTE: Not necessarily.

07:49.135 --> 07:53.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what most of them have
begun to indicate,
really, if you go back to the
most recent

07:53.273 --> 07:59.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
IPCC analysis, or the
consolidation of the
research, is that they're not
necessarily

07:59.479 --> 08:04.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to become more frequent,
but there is
going to be the tendency or at
least likelihood

08:04.951 --> 08:10.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the ones that do form are
going to have
more intense rain and very
likely stronger

08:10.223 --> 08:14.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
winds, so that the ones that do
manage to
develop will likely be stronger.

08:14.527 --> 08:18.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the fact that sea level has
continued
to rise, as a lot of the polar
regions have

08:18.998 --> 08:24.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seen the glacial ice melt, that
will compound
any kind of storm surge flooding
that comes

08:24.537 --> 08:26.339 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from hurricanes.

08:26.373 --> 08:30.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, this last
10 years and
the models that you're
describing, they don't

08:30.143 --> 08:33.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really help us understand what
the next 10
years could look like for the
U.S.?

08:33.947 --> 08:38.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SUBLETTE: Yes, for the very
short term,
there is not an awful lot of
skill with those

08:38.885 --> 08:41.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
particular batches of climate
models.

08:41.654 --> 08:46.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The shorter term is really kind
of an area
that most of the work needs to
be done, but

08:46.559 --> 08:50.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we do look for the longer-term
trends when
we think about climate change,
as climate

08:50.530 --> 08:55.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
change is a longer-term
phenomenon, on the
order of decades to a century,
vs. so much

08:55.702 --> 08:57.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
several years to a decade.

08:57.604 --> 09:01.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, let's go
back to Hermine,
which is now threatening the
Atlantic Seaboard.

09:01.207 --> 09:06.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have got something like 30
million people
up and down the coast that might
be looking

09:06.079 --> 09:08.281 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at some glimpse of the storm.

09:08.314 --> 09:11.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are we likely to see this
weekend and
into next week?

09:11.518 --> 09:16.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SUBLETTE: What we're really
concerned
about going forward into
tomorrow, as the

09:16.356 --> 09:21.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
center of storm goes up the
southeastern coast,
affects Hampton Roads, Virginia,
and then,

09:21.261 --> 09:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as we alluded to earlier on in
the broadcast,
going off New Jersey or Delmarva
Peninsula,

09:26.666 --> 09:31.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and likely just stalling for two
or three
days, and may attain hurricane
status once

09:31.404 --> 09:33.072 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
again.

09:33.106 --> 09:36.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, really, the biggest story
is going to
be the tremendous coastal
flooding.

09:36.209 --> 09:40.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If this system just hangs off
the New Jersey
or Delmarva Peninsula and spins
for two or

09:40.914 --> 09:44.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
three days, you will have a
broad area of
winds coming onshore.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That will likely lead to some
serious coastal
flooding.

09:47.053 --> 09:48.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, why is the
stalling
important?

09:48.955 --> 09:53.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I take it you're saying, we
would prefer it
to just rush through more
quickly?

09:53.426 --> 09:55.595 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEAN SUBLETTE: Absolutely.

09:55.628 --> 10:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most of the time, once these
systems push
northward, they begin to
accelerate back out

10:00.366 --> 10:02.202 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to sea.

10:02.235 --> 10:05.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The steering winds, however,
with this particular
system look like they are going
to set up

10:05.305 --> 10:10.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so that it's going to stall once
it clears
off the Virginia Capes and just
offshore,

10:10.210 --> 10:12.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
only 100 miles or.

10:12.078 --> 10:18.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if it just sits and spins in
that counterclockwise
direction, you have a continuous
fetch of

10:18.585 --> 10:22.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
water onto shore from those
strong northeasterly
winds.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's what's going to pile
up the water
along the coast.

10:24.424 --> 10:29.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Sean Sublette
from Climate Central, thanks
very much.

10:29.562 --> 10:38.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEAN SUBLETTE: Thank you.

10:38.905 --> 10:49.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Storms,
hurricanes and natural
disasters clearly test the
fortitude of any

10:49.115 --> 10:53.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
area, as we're seeing this
weekend with Hermine,
and just recently with the rains
and flooding

10:53.386 --> 10:55.154 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Louisiana.

10:55.188 --> 10:59.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We tend to focus on the
immediate aftermath
and relief, but the devastation
can last for

10:59.726 --> 11:01.461 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

11:01.494 --> 11:05.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have the story of how one
city leveled
by a tornado has spent years
rebuilding, and

11:05.231 --> 11:08.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in some ways is better and
stronger for the
future.

11:08.568 --> 11:15.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The tornado that struck Joplin,
Missouri,
on May 22, 2011 was one of the
most destructive

11:15.241 --> 11:22.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ever in U.S. history; 161 people
were killed,
1,000 were injured, and more
than 7,000 homes

11:22.582 --> 11:24.384 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were damaged.

11:24.417 --> 11:27.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the "NewsHour" visited four
months later,
people were still literally
picking up the

11:27.921 --> 11:29.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
pieces of their lives.

11:29.722 --> 11:31.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JANE CAGE, Former Chair,
Citizens Advisory
Council: It is certainly clean,
compared with

11:31.424 --> 11:33.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what it used to be.

11:33.159 --> 11:35.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jane Cage, a
businesswoman
who chaired the Citizens
Advisory Council

11:35.628 --> 11:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to rebuild Joplin, told us back
then she was
worried people wouldn't come
back to the destroyed

11:40.867 --> 11:42.502 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
areas.

11:42.535 --> 11:46.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE CAGE: In the beginning, I
think everyone
said, I want to rebuild my
house.

11:46.606 --> 11:51.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now I think people are faced
with the
reality that what they wanted,
their neighborhood

11:51.311 --> 11:54.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and their friends may not be in
that same
spot.

11:54.180 --> 11:57.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Five years
later, Cage took
us on a tour of the same
neighborhood.

11:58.017 --> 12:02.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE CAGE: I think this is, in
some ways,
one of the best recovered
neighborhoods.

12:02.255 --> 12:04.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're nicer houses and larger
houses overall.

12:04.457 --> 12:08.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: She says one
of the main
things that Joplin got right in
the aftermath

12:08.328 --> 12:10.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was encouraging residents to
stay.

12:10.296 --> 12:16.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE CAGE: We concentrated on
keeping our
population in Joplin, because we
saw what

12:16.235 --> 12:20.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happened in other cities that
experienced
disasters.

12:20.707 --> 12:25.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think one of the first
things that we
did to make that happen was, our
school superintendent

12:25.378 --> 12:28.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made the promise that we would
start school
on time.

12:28.047 --> 12:32.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Five schools
were completely
wiped out in the storm,
including Joplin High

12:32.986 --> 12:34.554 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
School.

12:34.587 --> 12:39.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we visited in 2011, classes
had just
begun in an abandoned shopping
mall.

12:39.826 --> 12:44.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now a brand-new state-of-the-art
high school
has opened on the original site.

12:44.530 --> 12:49.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's just across the street from
where sophomore
Blake Dean's house was
flattened.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dean described how he rode out
the storm in
a backyard shelter.

12:51.771 --> 12:55.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BLAKE DEAN, Student: Sure
enough, we start
hearing a kind of freight train
noise.

12:55.174 --> 12:59.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it just starts getting
really loud and
the pressure starts building.

12:59.545 --> 13:03.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we all kind of just
huddled up in
the shelter, and it just blew
over it.

13:04.017 --> 13:08.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: His family
chose to rebuild
on the same lot a bigger and
better house.

13:08.821 --> 13:11.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he says the school is also
bigger and
better.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BLAKE DEAN: Oh, it's just
awesome.

13:13.026 --> 13:16.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's so -- I mean, it's so much
bigger than
the last one and there's so much
more opportunity.

13:16.429 --> 13:21.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In fact,
bigger and better
is how many in Joplin now
describe the city

13:21.100 --> 13:22.602 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as a whole.

13:22.635 --> 13:26.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The population has actually
grown by 1,000
people over the last five years.

13:26.606 --> 13:30.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And fellow high school football
player Maurice
Aubrey says the sense of
community has become

13:30.910 --> 13:32.779 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stronger too.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAURICE AUBREY, Student: Now we
have this
single past experience that
links us all together,

13:35.948 --> 13:37.183 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as before.

13:37.216 --> 13:40.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it just makes it -- it's
made it so much
better, I think.

13:40.386 --> 13:44.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARCINDA HEMPEN, Joplin,
Missouri: My complex
was this portion right here, and
my apartment

13:44.257 --> 13:45.992 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was right here.

13:46.025 --> 13:48.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Marcinda
Hempen is one of
those people who took advantage
of those new

13:48.861 --> 13:50.663 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
opportunities.

13:50.697 --> 13:53.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was living in an apartment
and huddled
in the bathtub when the storm
passed through.

13:53.533 --> 13:58.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCINDA HEMPEN: The weirdest
thing was, after
it was all done, it was so quiet
that I thought,

13:58.438 --> 14:00.807 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
am I dead?

14:00.840 --> 14:01.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Did I not make it?

14:01.908 --> 14:03.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is this what it's like to be
dead?

14:03.743 --> 14:07.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Hempen, a
single mom of
two now-grown boys, said, prior
to the storm,

14:07.780 --> 14:12.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she couldn't afford to buy a
house, but thanks
to a $20 million federal loan
program which

14:12.418 --> 14:16.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
helped her with a down-payment,
she owns a
home in one of the hardest-hit
areas.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCINDA HEMPEN: It's still a
little unreal.

14:18.791 --> 14:20.059 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I own this.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.060 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is all mine.

14:21.094 --> 14:22.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I can paint a wall.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can do whatever I want to do,
and nobody
can tell me different.

14:25.031 --> 14:29.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
community-wide effort,
along with help from all levels
of government

14:29.569 --> 14:34.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and hundreds of volunteer
organizations from
around the country, has changed
the face of

14:34.273 --> 14:35.708 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the city.

14:35.742 --> 14:39.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nearly 2,000 new homes have been
built; 300
new businesses have opened.

14:39.712 --> 14:44.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And thanks to $30 million from
the federal
government, the city has a new
sewer system,

14:44.450 --> 14:50.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new electrical grid, and new
storm shelters
in every school and public
building.

14:50.123 --> 14:55.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are also new parks,
complete with basketball
courts, playgrounds and water
features.

14:55.595 --> 15:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
St. John's Mercy Hospital, which
was completely
destroyed, has been rebuilt on a
new site,

15:01.434 --> 15:07.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and has $11 million worth of
upgrades to protect
from future tornadoes, including
windows that

15:07.140 --> 15:14.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can sustain winds up to 250
miles an hour,
fortified safe zones on every
floor, and a

15:14.914 --> 15:19.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
450-foot reinforced tunnel,
which houses generators,
water and data communications.

15:19.986 --> 15:24.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for all of the signs of new
growth in
Joplin, there is one area where
the healing

15:24.190 --> 15:26.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has been more difficult.

15:26.092 --> 15:31.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cases of mental distress and
trauma have more
than doubled over the past five
years, affecting

15:31.063 --> 15:35.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people like Marian Kelly, who
showed us the
crawl space where she rode out
thee storm.

15:35.201 --> 15:38.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIAN KELLY, Joplin, Missouri:
But, at some
point I felt the air getting
sucked out of

15:38.671 --> 15:40.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the crawl space around me.

15:40.306 --> 15:42.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I thought, this is how I'm
going to die.

15:42.975 --> 15:45.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: She was
relatively lucky.

15:45.178 --> 15:50.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her house was damaged, but not
destroyed,
and she emerged with just some
cuts and bruises.

15:50.516 --> 15:52.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the emotional scars have
been much deeper.

15:52.785 --> 15:59.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIAN KELLY: For me, the
post-traumatic stress
disorder has manifested itself
mostly in a

15:59.292 --> 16:03.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
heightened emotional response to
things.

16:03.262 --> 16:10.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I get anxious or upset in ways
that I wouldn't
have before.

16:10.102 --> 16:13.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Also, the concentration issues
are there.

16:13.139 --> 16:15.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why there's alarms for
everything on
my phone.

16:15.141 --> 16:18.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's why everything has to be
written down.

16:18.044 --> 16:22.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: She has been
able to hold
down a job, but she says that's
thanks to

16:22.148 --> 16:25.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
medication and regular
counseling sessions.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's not sure she will ever
fully recover.

16:27.253 --> 16:31.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARIAN KELLY: It's been
difficult for me to
accept that I might not get all
of this back,

16:31.490 --> 16:32.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the things that I have lost.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.894 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have shaved off a few I.Q.
points, you know?

16:34.927 --> 16:37.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't know if I can expect
there -- to
get them back.

16:37.830 --> 16:41.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: While Kelly
still struggles
with her memories of that
terrible day, she

16:41.734 --> 16:45.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is proud of the city for showing
such resilience
in the aftermath.

16:45.071 --> 16:50.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is also hopeful that the
many young people
who have moved to Joplin since
the storm will

16:50.810 --> 16:54.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bring new energy and life to the
community.

16:54.046 --> 16:58.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That new life is evident in the
downtown,
which had been largely abandoned
before the

16:58.150 --> 16:59.318 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tornado hit.

16:59.352 --> 17:03.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Now it's dotted with hip
restaurants, bars
and lofts.

17:03.890 --> 17:07.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rachel Grindle, who just moved
to Joplin from
Long Beach, California, is
impressed.

17:07.260 --> 17:10.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RACHEL GRINDLE, Joplin,
Missouri: Our first
week living in Joplin, we were
invited to

17:10.229 --> 17:18.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Friday night wine share, which
is this networking
group for people our age who are
career-minded

17:18.104 --> 17:20.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and city-focused.

17:20.606 --> 17:23.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And after that, everybody came
here to Infuxn
afterwards.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we went out to dinner after
that.

17:25.578 --> 17:33.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I looked at my husband, and
I was like,
I feel like we're living more of
the L.A.

17:34.020 --> 17:35.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lifestyle in Joplin than we ever
did in Long
Beach.

17:35.855 --> 17:39.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Reminders of
the storm can
still be found everywhere in
Joplin, whether

17:39.058 --> 17:43.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's the memorials to the people
who lost
their lives, or to the miles and
miles of

17:43.729 --> 17:45.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
treeless neighborhoods.

17:45.631 --> 17:49.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But five years later, the signs
of progress
that have emerged from that
tragic day have

17:49.669 --> 17:54.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
become a model for other
communities who have
suffered catastrophic disasters.

17:54.840 --> 18:00.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

18:00.746 --> 18:09.889 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

18:09.922 --> 18:14.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
controversy
over an NFL quarterback refusing
to stand

18:14.527 --> 18:19.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the national anthem; and
Mark Shields
and David Brooks take on the
week's news.

18:19.298 --> 18:24.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: Today, the FBI
released two key
documents about its
investigation into the

18:24.337 --> 18:28.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
private e-mail server Hillary
Clinton used
when she was secretary of state.

18:28.841 --> 18:34.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One contains the agency's notes
from Clinton's
FBI interview, and the other is
a 47-page

18:34.780 --> 18:37.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
summary of the FBI's findings.

18:37.583 --> 18:40.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NPR's Carrie Johnson is covering
the story
and joins me now.

18:40.152 --> 18:42.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, what's new about the
documents that were
released today?

18:42.888 --> 18:48.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON, NPR: There are
several new
details, including really a
sense of what

18:48.327 --> 18:53.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Hillary Clinton told FBI
investigators in
that three-and-a-half-hour
interview at FBI

18:53.199 --> 18:54.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
headquarters on July 2.

18:54.700 --> 18:59.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hari, she said she used this
personal server
as a matter of convenience.

18:59.438 --> 19:06.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She never had a concern that she
or anybody
close to her was mishandling
classified information,

19:06.112 --> 19:11.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that she actually doesn't
recall attending
a security briefing or any kind
of training

19:11.917 --> 19:17.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about open records lawsuits or
open records
laws, which is interesting,
because these

19:17.890 --> 19:22.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
materials only came out after a
host of FOIA
requests from news organizations
and calls

19:23.029 --> 19:24.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from Republicans in Congress.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And there was
-- one of
the e-mails -- or at least one
of the quotes

19:27.299 --> 19:29.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that we have is about a drone
program.

19:29.735 --> 19:31.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think we can put that up.

19:31.504 --> 19:35.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It says, "Clinton stated" --
this is the FBI
saying: "Clinton stated
deliberation over

19:35.941 --> 19:41.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a future drone strike didn't
give her cause
for concern regarding
classification."

19:41.614 --> 19:44.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is this willful oversight,
ignorance?

19:44.216 --> 19:45.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Was she too busy?

19:45.985 --> 19:47.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What were the reasons that they
gave?

19:47.787 --> 19:52.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: Recall, Hari,
that the FBI
director, James Comey, has said
that Hillary

19:52.958 --> 19:58.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton and closest aides were
extremely careless
with government secrets, but he
didn't find

19:58.731 --> 20:02.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
enough evidence to prosecute
anyone for wrongdoing.

20:02.601 --> 20:07.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That said, these new documents
today include
more information about what was
going through

20:07.773 --> 20:13.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her own e-mail server, a lot of
documents,
a lot of e-mails about the drone
program,

20:13.379 --> 20:20.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of the government's most
secret tools
in the national security space,
to allow officials

20:20.419 --> 20:26.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the CIA and the Pentagon to
engage in extrajudicial
killing of terrorists or
would-be terrorists

20:26.992 --> 20:28.794 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
overseas.

20:28.828 --> 20:33.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what Hillary Clinton was
asked about by
the FBI were a number of e-mails
about targeted

20:33.566 --> 20:38.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
killings about to happen,
disputes between
different government agencies
about who should

20:38.537 --> 20:43.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be targeted for those kinds of
drone strikes
and other things.

20:43.042 --> 20:48.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What Hillary Clinton said in
response to FBI
questions was mainly, listen, I
relied on

20:48.948 --> 20:53.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
career State Department
officials to make
determinations about what should
be classified

20:53.419 --> 20:55.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and what shouldn't.

20:55.354 --> 21:02.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She also said that these
programs were the
subject of multiple debates in
media, in newspapers,

21:02.228 --> 21:03.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on television and the like.

21:04.029 --> 21:08.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, often, her aides were
passing around
articles from newspapers about
drone strikes.

21:08.767 --> 21:11.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, she thought it was OK to
write about that.

21:11.770 --> 21:16.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: At one point,
I remember
FBI Director Comey saying that
no reasonable

21:16.208 --> 21:18.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
prosecutor would take this case.

21:18.210 --> 21:21.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, there's also a little
bit of controversy
on just the releasing of these
notes from

21:21.914 --> 21:24.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an interview or this sort of a
summary finding.

21:24.383 --> 21:32.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: Hari, it's
enormously controversial
among Democrats, who believe
that this could

21:32.291 --> 21:38.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
further cement a sense in the
political campaign
that Hillary Clinton is
secretive or may have

21:38.864 --> 21:40.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
character problems.

21:40.733 --> 21:44.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it's enormously
controversial among some
senior Justice Department
officials from past

21:44.970 --> 21:46.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
administrations, with whom I
spoke today.

21:46.972 --> 21:52.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said, when you decide not
to bring charges
against somebody, you shouldn't
dump all kinds

21:52.144 --> 21:56.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of derogatory information about
them out into
the public space.

21:56.081 --> 22:00.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, one of them e-mailed me
this afternoon
saying, can you imagine the
political careers

22:00.853 --> 22:06.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that would be ended if the
Justice Department
decided to release these
sensitive case materials

22:06.292 --> 22:10.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in all the matters in which we
decline to
prosecute people?

22:10.062 --> 22:11.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where to draw the line here?

22:11.797 --> 22:16.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there is some sense that this
could set
a precedent for demands from
Congress and

22:16.235 --> 22:21.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reporters for a lot of sensitive
information
on closed cases on national
security and public

22:21.340 --> 22:22.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
corruption moving forward.

22:23.008 --> 22:27.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Carrie Johnson
of NPR joining us, thanks so
much.

22:27.279 --> 22:34.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARRIE JOHNSON: Thank you.

22:34.053 --> 22:43.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But, first:
Athletes have
had a long tradition of being
activists with

22:43.195 --> 22:44.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their political protests.

22:44.930 --> 22:48.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The latest case is of San
Francisco 49ers
quarterbacks Colin Kaepernick's
refusal to

22:48.934 --> 22:51.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stand for the national anthem at
football
games.

23:08.520 --> 23:09.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Kaepernick
also said he
would donate $1 million in
charity to some

23:09.521 --> 23:11.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the causes he believes in.

23:11.323 --> 23:13.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on the Kaepernick
controversy and
the broader context, we turn to
William Rhoden,

23:13.125 --> 23:14.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a former sports columnist for
The New York
Times who has long written on
the subject.

23:14.426 --> 23:16.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, your thoughts on what's
been happening
this past week.

23:16.362 --> 23:18.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM C. RHODEN, The New York
Times: Well,
you know, it's pretty
phenomenal, the controversy,

23:18.097 --> 23:19.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but, in a way, I think we should
probably
thank Kaepernick, because he's
really gotten

23:19.932 --> 23:26.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this into a deeper history of
the anthem,
of the author of the anthem, of
the background

23:26.238 --> 23:31.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the author of the anthem, of
Francis Scott
Key slaves.

23:31.877 --> 23:39.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there was this very
controversial third
stanza of the national anthem,
which, you

23:39.285 --> 23:43.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know, maybe talks about being
very kind of
unsympathetic to slaves.

23:43.455 --> 23:52.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think that it has been
good in one sense,
in that it's gotten the country
to really

23:52.665 --> 23:59.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think a lot more deeply about
who we are as
a nation and a lot of our
hypocrisy.

23:59.505 --> 24:10.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, in terms of Kaepernick,
I think it
has also once again made us
realize the power

24:10.316 --> 24:16.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of athletes, of these people who
are in these
very prominent positions
because, you know,

24:16.655 --> 24:24.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sports is sort of the cultural
-- has become
maybe one of the primary
cultural foundations

24:24.163 --> 24:26.065 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of this country.

24:26.098 --> 24:31.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now that you're having
especially, particularly
young African-American men who
are beginning

24:31.070 --> 24:38.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to realize -- A, they're
becoming much more
fluent in our history and are
really becoming

24:38.544 --> 24:45.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unafraid to use this podium to
express views
that are controversial and not
controversial,

24:45.784 --> 24:55.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and using this sort of national
anthem as
sort of the lightning rod, you
know, for a

24:55.694 --> 24:57.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lot of these controversies.

24:58.030 --> 25:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think it's really been --
it's really
been fascinating.

25:01.367 --> 25:07.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But athletes
have had a
long history of being outwardly
political,

25:07.706 --> 25:08.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
active in social causes.

25:08.941 --> 25:10.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM C. RHODEN: Right.

25:10.209 --> 25:12.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We're quick to
think about
Muhammad Ali.

25:12.411 --> 25:16.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're quick to think about the
moment at the
Olympics when the fists were
raised up.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM C. RHODEN: Right.

25:18.317 --> 25:21.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But there was
also a pretty
good quiet spell where athletes
chose not

25:21.620 --> 25:23.021 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be involved.

25:23.055 --> 25:27.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM C. RHODEN: Yes, when the
-- as the
money started increasing.

25:27.960 --> 25:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I came of age from -- you know,
when I was
16 years old, Jim Brown suddenly
announced

25:34.867 --> 25:40.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his retirement from the game
because his owner,
Arthur Modell, Art Modell, has
sort of been

25:40.105 --> 25:44.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chiding him about not reporting
to training
camp because he was filming
movies.

25:44.643 --> 25:49.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, at that point, Brown was 29
years old,
was the greatest player ever.

25:49.681 --> 25:54.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, basically, he held a press
conference
on the movie set and said, I'm
done.

25:54.153 --> 26:00.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I was 17 years old, Ali
said that he
wasn't going to fight in
Vietnam.

26:00.359 --> 26:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I was 18, it was Smith and
Carlos at
the '68 Mexico Olympics with the
salute.

26:07.499 --> 26:10.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, that was sort of my
politicization.

26:10.302 --> 26:18.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is how I became -- this
is how athletes
should react and should respond
publicly.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then I think you mentioned that
long stretch
of time.

26:20.946 --> 26:27.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what happened is that,
as the money
really became -- started to
enter -- play

26:27.486 --> 26:33.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a more prominent part, and
people got agents
now, now athletes started
getting agents,

26:33.325 --> 26:38.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and agents were saying, hey,
man, you know,
let's take the path of least
resistance.

26:38.597 --> 26:44.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, you know, I guess the
question is, why
all of a sudden are we coming
back to this?

26:44.603 --> 26:48.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why do you have some of the
greatest names
in sports, LeBron James, Dwyane
Wade, you

26:49.007 --> 26:50.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know, Chris Paul, Carmelo
Anthony...

26:50.542 --> 26:54.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Michael
Jordan.

26:54.613 --> 26:57.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM C. RHODEN: Yes, Michael
-- well, that's
another story.

26:57.583 --> 27:00.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: I mean, I
bring Michael
Jordan up because I would say
that he was

27:00.519 --> 27:01.854 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the quiet period, right?

27:01.887 --> 27:04.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was one of the athletes that
did not -- didn't
take a position.

27:04.389 --> 27:06.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM C. RHODEN: Oh, well, you
know what?

27:06.158 --> 27:09.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And here he is
just a few
weeks ago deciding to give a
million to two

27:09.962 --> 27:11.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
different organizations.

27:11.797 --> 27:17.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM C. RHODEN: For a long
time, Michael
Jordan became the model of what
an athlete,

27:17.402 --> 27:22.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a black athlete should be, which
is neutral,
because you want to take money
from both sides.

27:22.674 --> 27:24.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You don't want to make anybody
angry.

27:24.176 --> 27:27.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You want to placate the white
audience.

27:27.145 --> 27:31.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As he famously was quoted as
saying, Republicans
buy sneakers, too.

27:31.683 --> 27:35.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that, because of his
prominence
and because how great he was as
an athlete,

27:35.988 --> 27:42.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that sort of became the standard
for a lot
of athletes, is this whole
politically neutral

27:42.327 --> 27:44.129 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stance.

27:44.162 --> 27:48.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think that it's
interesting that -- and,
as you mentioned a couple of
weeks ago, he

27:48.367 --> 27:52.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
donated money to both sides, the
police side
and to the NAACP Legal Defense
Fund.

27:52.704 --> 27:54.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Right.

27:54.540 --> 27:58.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM C. RHODEN: Also, I think
a lot of
athletes realize that, what is
the power structure

27:58.610 --> 28:00.279 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going to do?

28:00.312 --> 28:04.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have got a league, an NBA,
that's almost
80 percent African-American
players.

28:04.049 --> 28:09.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The National Football League is
almost 70
percent of African-American
players.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Are they going to fire
everybody?

28:11.056 --> 28:13.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Are they going to punish
everybody?

28:13.058 --> 28:19.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that what we're seeing
is a lot of
athletes not being afraid to
roar, whether

28:19.264 --> 28:20.999 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you agree with it or not.

28:21.033 --> 28:27.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
William Rhoden
joining us from New York
tonight, thanks so

28:27.439 --> 28:28.774 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

28:28.807 --> 28:35.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM C. RHODEN: My pleasure.

28:35.514 --> 28:42.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We turn to the
week in politics,
which included, yes, a surprise
campaign detour

28:42.120 --> 28:43.455 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Mexico.

28:43.488 --> 28:46.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that means we turn to the
analysis of
Shields and Brooks.

28:46.091 --> 28:49.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and
New York Times columnist David
Brooks joining

28:49.061 --> 28:50.329 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
us this week from New York.

28:50.362 --> 28:52.464 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
All right, Mark Shields, start.

28:52.497 --> 28:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's go with Mexico for topic
one.

28:54.766 --> 28:59.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the surprise trip,
Donald Trump, not
so surprising, but really a
shortly planned

28:59.638 --> 29:01.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
trip to Mexico that he took.

29:01.173 --> 29:03.108 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now, first the moment itself.

29:03.141 --> 29:05.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He came across looking
presidential.

29:05.243 --> 29:06.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: He did.

29:06.912 --> 29:10.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Peter Hart, the Democratic
pollster, said
that Donald Trump could win this
campaign

29:10.983 --> 29:13.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
if he had one sane month.

29:13.318 --> 29:19.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think an awful lot of
Democrats were
quite nervous on Wednesday
afternoon, when

29:19.725 --> 29:25.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this sort of thoughtful, almost
statesmanlike
Donald Trump showed up at a
joint session

29:25.998 --> 29:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with the president of Mexico.

29:28.567 --> 29:30.435 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He listened.

29:30.469 --> 29:36.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was the longest he had ever
been on camera
without speaking that I can
recall, and almost

29:36.308 --> 29:42.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
came across, I don't want to say
presidential,
but it was flirting with that,
until, of course,

29:42.547 --> 29:50.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he returned to his native land,
in Phoenix,
totally altered and contradicted
that impression

29:50.489 --> 29:59.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with his stem-winder of a
speech, basically
saying we're going to round up
anybody who's

29:59.598 --> 30:01.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an undocumented immigrant in
this country.

30:01.400 --> 30:05.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: David, what
about that,
both the moment and when he came
back, the

30:05.904 --> 30:06.872 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
policy?

30:06.905 --> 30:08.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

30:08.640 --> 30:12.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, I would point out he has
had a sane
month, but it's been spread over
70 years.

30:12.144 --> 30:15.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But he had that moment.

30:15.447 --> 30:22.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He can utter a sane moment for
that time in
Mexico, but, when he came back,
tonally, he

30:22.087 --> 30:23.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just returned to himself.

30:23.455 --> 30:27.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To pay tribute to Donald Trump,
he's incapable
of being a phony.

30:27.059 --> 30:32.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the things he does
express is the
true belief, or at least his
belief, that

30:32.330 --> 30:37.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America is besieged, besieged by
foreigners
who threaten us with crime, with
terrorism,

30:37.102 --> 30:39.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with cultural decay, with job
loss.

30:39.671 --> 30:42.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is how he got into this
race.

30:42.074 --> 30:44.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is what he's expressing
in Phoenix.

30:45.010 --> 30:50.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the substance of what he
said in Phoenix
was actually quietly almost
moderate, I think,

30:50.615 --> 30:52.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but the tone is much more
important.

30:52.651 --> 30:55.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the tone is the same old
hostility to
immigration.

30:55.654 --> 30:57.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that will be politically
determinative.

30:57.522 --> 31:02.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only people in America who
really cotton
on to that kind of message are a
certain section

31:02.994 --> 31:04.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the Republican Party.

31:04.062 --> 31:05.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has really very little appeal
outside of
it.

31:05.931 --> 31:10.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Let me just pick
up on one thing
David said, Hari, and that is,
FOX News poll

31:10.936 --> 31:18.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this week, not exactly a liberal
organ, asked
the following question: What
about undocumented

31:18.343 --> 31:23.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immigrants who are currently
working in the
United States, do you favor
deporting as many

31:23.115 --> 31:29.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as possible or do you favor
setting up a system
for them to become legal
residents?

31:29.121 --> 31:36.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
By a margin of 77 to 19,
Americans favor legal
status, rather than deporting.

31:36.561 --> 31:42.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the includes 66 to 29
percent Republicans
believe that we ought to have
legal status.

31:42.768 --> 31:45.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, David, I think, makes a
reasonable point.

31:46.004 --> 31:52.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is, Donald Trump must
believe this,
because it's not a rational
political position,

31:52.477 --> 31:53.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if he's interested in being
elected.

31:53.912 --> 31:54.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

31:54.913 --> 31:55.881 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: So...

31:55.914 --> 31:57.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Go ahead,
David.

31:57.682 --> 31:59.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I would just add
that, if you
look at the substance of what's
being said

31:59.684 --> 32:04.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
both by Clinton and Trump, you
can very easily
predict where we are going to
end up on immigration.

32:04.556 --> 32:05.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are going to secure the
border.

32:05.891 --> 32:07.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're not going to build a wall,
but we will
secure the border.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will legalize in some form or
another the
people who are here.

32:10.862 --> 32:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will shift a little more
to a skills-based
system than a family
reunification system.

32:15.233 --> 32:17.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the basis of what is
going to happen.

32:17.102 --> 32:21.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And within all the violence and
all the Sturm
und Drang of a campaign,
substantively, the

32:21.540 --> 32:23.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
parties are sort of heading in
that direction.

32:23.275 --> 32:26.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mark, how
different is the
position that he's taken now, or
at least

32:26.578 --> 32:31.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the last week, vs. what Mitt
Romney said
or vs. what really the policy is
today?

32:31.349 --> 32:36.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Mitt Romney's, of
course, was
self-deportation.

32:36.421 --> 32:43.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Trump obviously includes
that as one of
his planks.

32:43.361 --> 32:46.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The difference is not simply in
tone and emphasis.

32:46.631 --> 32:49.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, this has been the
centerpiece.

32:49.501 --> 32:57.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mitt Romney -- it became an
issue in 2012,
but it wasn't the defining issue
of the campaign.

32:57.342 --> 33:03.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was the defining issue for
Donald Trump,
by his own volition, when he
came in.

33:03.615 --> 33:07.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He made this an issue, not that
immigration
had not been a controversial
issue in the

33:07.886 --> 33:11.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country, but he made it the
centerpiece of
his candidacy.

33:11.423 --> 33:19.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he has consistently spoken
in disparaging,
pejorative, ugly terms about
undocumented

33:19.297 --> 33:24.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- there's no undocumented
immigrants who
graduated as valedictorians of
their school

33:24.336 --> 33:28.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or joined the United States
military and served
the country well.

33:28.440 --> 33:31.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He treats them all as though
they're criminal
suspects.

33:31.910 --> 33:36.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: David Brooks,
I heard your
doubt on the building of the
wall and who

33:36.648 --> 33:38.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is going to pay for it.

33:38.450 --> 33:42.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Really, that has become one of
those, not
just slogans, but he repeats it
at every speech,

33:43.021 --> 33:46.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every opportunity he gets, not
so much in
front of the Mexican president,
but certainly

33:47.025 --> 33:48.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
when he came back.

33:48.393 --> 33:52.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you're saying, no, we won't
actually build
that wall?

33:52.364 --> 33:55.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, you know,
this isn't exactly
dog whistle politics.

33:55.767 --> 33:57.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's just whistle politics.

33:57.802 --> 34:01.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look at the NBC/Wall
Street Journal
poll, when they ask people, what
are your

34:01.373 --> 34:05.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
top issues you care about in
this country,
well, economy comes up very
high.

34:05.176 --> 34:06.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
National security comes up very
high.

34:06.444 --> 34:08.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Even the deficit has come up
reasonably high.

34:08.313 --> 34:12.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Only 6 percent list immigration
as one of
their top three issues.

34:12.317 --> 34:13.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not a major issue.

34:13.885 --> 34:16.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the reason it's worked for
Trump is because
he's playing identity politics.

34:16.788 --> 34:20.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's playing us vs. them
politics, basically
native whites against
foreigners.

34:20.992 --> 34:23.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so the wall is not really a
wall.

34:23.328 --> 34:25.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think most people know he's
not going to
actually going to build a wall,
and certainly

34:25.897 --> 34:27.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mexico is not going to pay for
it.

34:27.565 --> 34:31.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a way to say, I'm for us,
against the
encroachments of them.

34:31.069 --> 34:35.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in times of economic stress,
or among
people who feel economic stress,
there's unfortunately

34:35.040 --> 34:37.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a susceptibility of that kind of
identity
politics.

34:37.776 --> 34:41.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mark, let's a
little bit
about the ground game that the
two candidates

34:41.313 --> 34:42.781 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
have.

34:42.814 --> 34:44.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had a report on it from Lisa
Desjardins
and Dan Bush earlier this week.

34:44.582 --> 34:46.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Right.

34:46.518 --> 34:50.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A pretty
significant disparity
in what Hillary Clinton already
has established,

34:50.188 --> 34:51.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
certainly in key battleground
states.

34:52.023 --> 34:55.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trump campaign said that
they're going
to -- I think they have plans to
open 98 more.

34:55.927 --> 34:59.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But do these offices in these
states matter?

34:59.597 --> 35:03.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: They do matter in
this sense.

35:03.168 --> 35:10.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it's a close race, the idea
of being able
to contact and turn out your
supporters, that

35:10.875 --> 35:16.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, to identify them and in many
cases to
persuade them, to find out what
it is that

35:16.414 --> 35:20.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they are interested and doubts
about or questions
they do have.

35:20.185 --> 35:29.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would just point out, in 2008,
Barack Obama
had a rather spectacular ground
operation

35:29.394 --> 35:31.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the field campaign.

35:31.296 --> 35:40.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in four different states, in
Iowa, in
North Carolina, in Florida, and
Nevada, he

35:40.872 --> 35:48.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
won the election on early
voting, that is,
the people who voted before
Election Day.

35:48.480 --> 35:54.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John McCain actually got more
votes on Election
Day, the 12 hours, the first
Tuesday after

35:54.753 --> 35:57.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the first Monday in November, in
which people
voted.

35:57.122 --> 36:03.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he had built up such a
number, had Barack
Obama, that it was enough of a
cushion that

36:03.895 --> 36:06.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he could carry those states and
win the presidency.

36:06.164 --> 36:10.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, yes, it is important, and
it's especially
important in a close race.

36:10.502 --> 36:17.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the state of Florida,
Adam Smith of
The Tampa Bay Times today
reported, and a

36:17.375 --> 36:21.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very respected political writer,
that, in
the state of Florida, Donald
Trump has one

36:21.980 --> 36:23.081 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
field office.

36:23.114 --> 36:27.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mitt Romney had 48 in 2012.

36:27.652 --> 36:32.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton has 50 as of
today, and Donald
Trump has only one.

36:32.557 --> 36:36.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this is one area where his
campaign is
not really competitive.

36:36.294 --> 36:39.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: David Brooks,
the Trump
campaign would probably say,
well, we're doing

36:39.297 --> 36:41.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pretty well, considering we only
have one.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, that's true
in the polls.

36:43.368 --> 36:48.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I do think, if you look at
the ground
game, I think it's the effect,
the marginal

36:48.073 --> 36:51.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
effect on the race is probably 2
percent,
3 percentage points, which is
significant,

36:52.010 --> 36:54.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
given there will be 50 states,
and a certain
number of them in most elections
are going

36:54.846 --> 36:55.814 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be close.

36:55.847 --> 36:57.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think TV ads are about the
same.

36:57.348 --> 37:01.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we're shifting sort of on
the margin here,
at least in a normal race.

37:01.853 --> 37:04.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This race has been far from
normal.

37:04.189 --> 37:07.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, basically -- I will
quote Peter
Hart, too -- he wrote a memo
today, which

37:07.859 --> 37:12.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think was making the very
effective point,
is, the majority of people have
decided they

37:12.197 --> 37:13.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't want to vote for Donald
Trump.

37:13.698 --> 37:16.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They just have to know they can
live with
Hillary Clinton for four years.

37:16.835 --> 37:20.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, if she can prove that
she's livable
with, then she's probably going
to probably

37:20.305 --> 37:21.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rack up a big victory.

37:21.306 --> 37:23.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But she hasn't done that.

37:23.208 --> 37:26.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Her popularity ratings are
sinking right now.

37:26.077 --> 37:29.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm not sure they're sinking
because she's
campaigning too little or too
ineffectively

37:29.614 --> 37:31.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or because she's campaigning too
much.

37:31.416 --> 37:35.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I sort of suspect the latter,
and that she
would do better if she was even
quieter than

37:35.053 --> 37:36.821 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
she is now.

37:36.855 --> 37:39.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Let's talk a
little bit
about that quietness since the
bump that she

37:39.390 --> 37:44.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got after the conventions and
some of the
criticism that Donald Trump got
after going

37:44.095 --> 37:45.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
after the Khan family, right?

37:45.263 --> 37:46.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Right.

37:47.031 --> 37:50.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But she's
largely in August
been taking the time to raise
money.

37:50.235 --> 37:52.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she has sort of stayed out
of the spotlight.

37:52.170 --> 37:59.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And raise money,
she did, what,
$140 million for her campaign
and the Democratic

37:59.777 --> 38:01.412 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Party.

38:01.446 --> 38:03.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And two events struck me.

38:03.781 --> 38:10.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, she basically has been
in Martha's
Vineyard, Nantucket, the
Hamptons, the tony

38:10.955 --> 38:15.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
suburbs of New York, Los
Angeles, San Francisco.

38:15.527 --> 38:19.731 align:left position:25%,start line:80% size:75%
One event was a
$250,000-per-person entry
price.

38:19.764 --> 38:22.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, those are boxcar
numbers.

38:22.800 --> 38:27.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Another was $200,000 for an
individual to
get in.

38:27.138 --> 38:33.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that the question of
what she
does as a candidate, I mean, I
think she's

38:33.411 --> 38:34.879 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
effective in small groups.

38:34.913 --> 38:38.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think she's effective when she
shows empathy
and a personal side.

38:38.750 --> 38:44.722 align:left position:0%,start line:66.67% size:100%
But she doesn't have the benefit
of the doubt
on the question of
trustworthiness and
transparency.

38:44.756 --> 38:48.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they have been anything but
transparent
on this question of e-mails.

38:48.493 --> 38:53.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And e-mails -- I think the one
great moment
she had unscripted in this
campaign were the

38:53.531 --> 38:58.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Benghazi hearings, when, for 11
hours, she
stood there and sat there and
took and answered

38:58.970 --> 39:04.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and took on and basically
vanquished her Republican
interrogators on the House side.

39:04.375 --> 39:12.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, since then, there is sort
of a closing
down and a lockdown, it seems to
me, and a

39:12.116 --> 39:13.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lack of transparency.

39:13.785 --> 39:16.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there is -- I think this
raises further
questions about her
trustworthiness.

39:16.988 --> 39:23.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: David Brooks,
even today,
we had more information from the
FBI about

39:23.795 --> 39:28.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
notes about the interview that
they had, the
long interview, and sort of a
summary of their

39:28.433 --> 39:30.134 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
findings.

39:30.168 --> 39:32.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, as far as we
know what
came out today, nothing really
transforms

39:32.737 --> 39:34.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our version of the story.

39:34.539 --> 39:39.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is carelessness, but it's
mostly reiterating
the pattern of closedness, which
has been

39:39.310 --> 39:43.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going back 20 years, the pattern
of insularity,
the pattern of secrecy.

39:43.414 --> 39:44.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't know where that comes
from.

39:44.782 --> 39:46.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's almost psychological at
this point.

39:46.684 --> 39:49.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know if it has to do
with her marriage,
her upbringing, whatever it is.

39:49.420 --> 39:51.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's just not an open and
transparent person.

39:51.823 --> 39:55.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But one of the things she has
been doing in
the last few weeks is preparing
for the debate.

39:55.460 --> 40:00.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I do think she understands
that the Olympics
sort of changed the culture.

40:00.698 --> 40:03.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The country was super, super
into the election.

40:03.268 --> 40:07.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the Olympics came
along, and something
uplifting came along, and people
were saying,

40:07.805 --> 40:11.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hey, I can watch something on TV
that I enjoy
watching.

40:11.142 --> 40:14.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I do think interest in the
campaign has
waned a little since then.

40:14.312 --> 40:20.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it may not lock in,
especially for low-information
undecided voters, until that
debate.

40:20.118 --> 40:23.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, if she's spending a lot
of time trying
to make herself an attractive
and presentable

40:23.121 --> 40:27.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
personality in that debate, that
may not be
the stupidest thing she could do
with this

40:27.292 --> 40:28.259 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
period.

40:28.293 --> 40:29.994 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I would agree.

40:30.028 --> 40:33.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think she has an advantage
going in the
debate, in that she has debated,
and she's

40:33.097 --> 40:36.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a good debater, and she's
debated under high-pressure
one-on-one situations.

40:36.501 --> 40:40.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump has never been in a
one-on-one
debate, where, for 90 minutes,
you're one

40:40.838 --> 40:43.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the two people on the firing
line.

40:43.641 --> 40:49.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The second thing is, to
disadvantage for Hillary
Clinton, is because she is such
a good debater,

40:49.147 --> 40:54.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because she is so knowledgeable
and thoroughly
prepared on all matters policy,
she's going

40:54.686 --> 40:57.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to go into this as the
overwhelming favorite.

40:57.889 --> 41:00.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what happened to Al
Gore in 2000.

41:00.591 --> 41:02.493 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He took George W. Bush lightly.

41:02.527 --> 41:05.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's what happened to Barack
Obama in the
first debate in 2012.

41:05.930 --> 41:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He took Mitt Romney too lightly.

41:08.299 --> 41:13.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think she and her campaign
are guarding
against this possibility.

41:13.438 --> 41:23.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Mark Shields,
David Brooks, thanks so much.

41:23.247 --> 41:28.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Next: a "NewsHour" shares.

41:28.820 --> 41:37.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Each summer, the federal
research vessel Tiglax
travels the length of the
Aleutian chain in

41:37.495 --> 41:41.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Alaska, ferrying scientists to
remote islands
to study wildlife.

41:41.265 --> 41:46.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Producer Eric Keto with Public
Media's Alaska's
Energy Desk recently took a tour
of the boat

41:46.904 --> 41:49.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when it docked in Dutch Harbor,
and sent us
this story

41:49.407 --> 41:52.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Welcome aboard.

41:52.210 --> 41:55.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's call the research vessel
Tiglax.

41:55.813 --> 41:58.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was commissioned in '86.

41:58.149 --> 42:02.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she's been mostly in the
Aleutians her
whole life.

42:02.420 --> 42:09.060 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The people that want to
understand this chain
and understand the ecosystem
really come through

42:09.093 --> 42:10.728 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this boat.

42:10.762 --> 42:14.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so I have had the
opportunity to meet
them all.

42:14.232 --> 42:15.199 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Hi.

42:15.233 --> 42:16.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's take a walk.

42:16.334 --> 42:18.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have our staterooms that
handle 14 passengers.

42:18.069 --> 42:21.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Of course, you have got your
center room here.

42:21.239 --> 42:24.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Here's the galley, very
comfortable.

42:24.642 --> 42:26.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a half-eaten dessert
you're taking
a look at.

42:26.911 --> 42:32.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We got three freezers on board,
probably about
$21,000 worth of grocery in
April.

42:32.450 --> 42:36.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will grab gear and get
under way from
Homer, with our destination and
being -- the

42:37.021 --> 42:39.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
furthest destination is
(INAUDIBLE).

42:39.724 --> 42:43.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the coolest thing about this
is just the
diversity of it.

42:43.928 --> 42:45.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Two weeks, you will be going to
sea lions.

42:45.229 --> 42:46.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Next you know, it's sea otters.

42:46.764 --> 42:48.499 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You will be doing a bird survey.

42:48.533 --> 42:50.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have been working Department
of Energy.

42:50.334 --> 42:53.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everybody that comes out here,
they are very
passionate about what they want
to do.

42:53.204 --> 42:54.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they only have two weeks to
do it.

42:54.972 --> 43:00.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's our job to make sure we
show them
what they need to see and try to
get it done.

43:00.711 --> 43:01.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to the bridge.

43:01.746 --> 43:04.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have what they call the
latest electronics.

43:04.449 --> 43:05.416 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

43:05.450 --> 43:08.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: They're real late.

43:08.219 --> 43:11.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's almost 30 years old now
and still going
strong.

43:11.989 --> 43:13.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have seen change.

43:13.491 --> 43:15.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have seen things go on the
endangered species
list.

43:15.993 --> 43:18.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have seen things come off the
endangered
species list.

43:18.496 --> 43:22.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a magnificent place.

43:22.867 --> 43:29.207 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And I'm hopeful.

43:29.240 --> 43:35.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And we will be
back shortly.

43:35.046 --> 43:38.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the meantime, take a moment
to hear from
your local PBS station.

43:38.549 --> 43:48.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
