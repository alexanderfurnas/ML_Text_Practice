JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.075 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.108 --> 00:10.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), President of
the United
States: We are in the middle of
a crisis on

00:10.177 --> 00:11.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our southern border.

00:11.945 --> 00:16.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
takes on a
big election promise, ordering a
border wall

00:16.216 --> 00:20.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be built and cracking down on
illegal immigration.

00:20.087 --> 00:26.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: getting to the bottom of
Mr. Trump's
vow to investigate
unsubstantiated claims

00:26.460 --> 00:30.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that millions voted illegally in
the general
election.

00:30.631 --> 00:36.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus: Federal agencies ordered
by the Trump
administration to restrict their
communications

00:36.837 --> 00:42.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
raises concerns about the
government holding
back information from the
public.

00:42.943 --> 00:48.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And after years of stigma, why
researchers
are turning back to psychedelic
drugs as a

00:48.649 --> 00:52.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way to treat severe PTSD and
other mental
illnesses.

00:52.319 --> 00:55.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN ROSS, NYU Langone
Medical Center:
Psychiatrists are really
yearning to have

00:55.756 --> 01:00.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
something that works
differently, that works
quickly, that lasts longer to
add to their

01:00.694 --> 01:01.662 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
toolbox.

01:01.695 --> 01:02.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's really important to do
that.

01:02.963 --> 01:10.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:10.170 --> 01:12.906 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:12.940 --> 01:22.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Day three of this
first White
House workweek, and the focus
today turned

01:22.249 --> 01:24.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the southern border.

01:24.184 --> 01:29.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump moved to make
good on long-promised
action to stop illegal
crossings.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), President of
the United
States: We have been talking
about this right

01:30.757 --> 01:32.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from the beginning.

01:32.492 --> 01:36.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Department of
Homeland
Security was the backdrop for
getting tough

01:36.396 --> 01:38.131 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on immigration.

01:38.165 --> 01:43.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The president signed two
executive orders,
one to start work on completing
a wall along

01:43.937 --> 01:45.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Mexican border.

01:45.639 --> 01:51.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: You folks know how
badly needed
it is as a help, but very badly
need.

01:51.178 --> 01:57.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This will also help Mexico by
deterring illegal
immigration from Central America
and by disrupting

01:57.918 --> 01:59.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
violent cartel networks.

01:59.853 --> 02:06.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The wall was a
signature promise
from the campaign, and so was
his insistence

02:06.159 --> 02:07.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about who will foot the bill.

02:07.561 --> 02:08.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Who's going to pay
for the wall?

02:08.562 --> 02:09.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AUDIENCE: Mexico!

02:09.563 --> 02:10.530 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Not even a doubt.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.332 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

02:12.366 --> 02:19.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Today, before
signing off on
the wall, Mr. Trump told ABC
News that while

02:19.973 --> 02:25.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
construction could begin within
months, Mexico
will not be paying up front.

02:25.045 --> 02:28.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And we will be, in
a form, reimbursed
by Mexico, which I have always
said.

02:29.016 --> 02:30.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: So they will pay us
back?

02:30.150 --> 02:31.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Yes, absolutely,
100 percent.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: So the American
taxpayer will pay
for the wall at first?

02:33.687 --> 02:38.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: All it is, is, we
will be reimbursed
at a later date from whatever
transaction

02:38.358 --> 02:40.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we make from Mexico.

02:40.327 --> 02:45.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, at the
announcement, the
president said construction
would start immediately.

02:45.232 --> 02:50.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mexico's President Enrique Pena
Nieto has
insisted his government will not
pay for a

02:50.804 --> 02:56.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wall, but he is due to visit
Washington next
week, and Mr. Trump said today
he is optimistic

02:56.410 --> 02:58.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about that meeting.

02:58.278 --> 03:03.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: By working
together on a positive
trend, safe borders, and
economic cooperation,

03:03.216 --> 03:10.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I truly believe we can enhance
the relation
between our two nations, to a
degree not seen

03:10.390 --> 03:14.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
before, certainly, in a very,
very long time.

03:14.261 --> 03:19.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president
also acted today
to boost the number of Border
Patrol and immigration

03:19.633 --> 03:26.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agents, and strip federal
funding from so-called
sanctuary cities that shield
undocumented

03:26.673 --> 03:29.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
immigrants from arrest or
detention.

03:29.476 --> 03:34.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition, he moved to end the
practice
of taking undocumented
immigrants into custody,

03:34.881 --> 03:39.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but then releasing them with
orders to report
in later.

03:39.453 --> 03:43.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Beyond immigration, the
president was busy
today on other matters.

03:43.457 --> 03:49.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With a series of tweets, he said
he will announce
his nominee for the U.S. Supreme
Court vacancy

03:49.529 --> 03:57.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on February 2, he promised to
order an investigation
into alleged voter fraud, and he
threatened

03:57.204 --> 04:02.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to send in federal authorities
to curb Chicago's
record surge of gun violence.

04:02.976 --> 04:08.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In response, Chicago's Mayor
Rahm Emanuel
said today he would welcome
federal help.

04:08.515 --> 04:11.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAHM EMANUEL (D), Mayor of
Chicago: Chicago,
like other cities right now that
are dealing

04:11.685 --> 04:19.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with gun violence, wants the
partnership with
federal law enforcement, at
least in a more

04:19.493 --> 04:23.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
significant way than we're
having it today,
whether that's the FBI, the DEA,
the Drug

04:23.697 --> 04:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Enforcement Agency, and the ATF.

04:26.166 --> 04:30.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tomorrow, the
president heads
to Philadelphia to address the
congressional

04:30.871 --> 04:32.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Republican retreat.

04:32.639 --> 04:38.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House indicates he
will also announce
steps in coming days to restrict
refugees

04:38.645 --> 04:40.881 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
entering the U.S.

04:40.914 --> 04:47.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A senior Mexican official now
says that President
Pena Nieto is considering
canceling his trip

04:47.120 --> 04:50.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Washington because of the
order to start
work on the border wall.

04:50.757 --> 04:56.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will focus in detail on Mr.
Trump's immigration
orders and on his call for
investigating voter

04:56.096 --> 04:59.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fraud after the news summary.

04:59.099 --> 05:03.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
White House distanced
itself from news reports that it
may order

05:03.970 --> 05:07.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a major review of handling
terror suspects.

05:07.307 --> 05:13.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reports said that a draft
executive order
could allow for renewed use of
banned interrogation

05:13.480 --> 05:19.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
methods, and for reopening
so-called black
site prisons outside the U.S.

05:19.419 --> 05:23.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Presidential spokesman Sean
Spicer said it
wasn't a White House document,
but he declined

05:23.924 --> 05:25.725 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to say more.

05:25.759 --> 05:30.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A big day on Wall Street, as the
Dow Jones
industrial average, for the
first time, broke

05:30.463 --> 05:32.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the 20000 barrier.

05:32.399 --> 05:37.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Dow gained 155 points, to
close at 20068.

05:37.637 --> 05:43.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose nearly 55
points, and the
S&amp;P 500 added 18.

05:43.310 --> 05:49.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stocks surged from the start, as
strong earnings
and President Trump's promise of
deregulation

05:49.749 --> 05:51.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and tax cuts sparked the rally.

05:51.651 --> 05:57.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIA FIORINI RAMIREZ, MFR
Securities: Companies
may have less cost related to
whether it's

05:57.424 --> 06:04.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
compliance or regulation, and
that frees quite
a bit of the earnings at the
bottom line,

06:04.231 --> 06:11.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they can use some of that to
reinvest,
and invest in capital, and
spread it to dividends

06:11.304 --> 06:12.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going to shareholders.

06:12.706 --> 06:16.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The broader
market is also
passing milestones.

06:16.610 --> 06:21.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq have
had a series
of record closes lately.

06:21.982 --> 06:27.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Somalia, Islamist fighters
attacked a hotel
that's popular with the
country's lawmakers.

06:27.420 --> 06:30.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The government said at least 11
people were
killed.

06:30.190 --> 06:33.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The city's ambulance director
said 28 died.

06:33.326 --> 06:34.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It happened in the capital,
Mogadishu.

06:34.828 --> 06:38.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The extremist Al-Shabaab group
claimed responsibility.

06:39.032 --> 06:45.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Four attackers rammed a car bomb
into the
hotel's gates, and then stormed
the compound.

06:45.105 --> 06:49.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police eventually ended the
siege, killing
all of the militants.

06:50.010 --> 06:55.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hope dimmed today in Italy in
the search for
survivors of an avalanche last
week.

06:55.181 --> 07:00.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officials confirmed 25 dead, as
rescue workers
pulled out more bodies.

07:00.053 --> 07:05.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But crews continued digging
through the snow,
looking for the four people who
are still

07:05.091 --> 07:06.860 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
missing.

07:06.893 --> 07:10.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, Italy's prime
minister admitted
to parliament that there were
delays in the

07:10.997 --> 07:12.832 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
response.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAOLO GENTILONI, Italian Prime
Minister (through
translator): If there are
responsibilities

07:15.935 --> 07:18.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
for the tragedy, the
investigations will clear
this up.

07:18.972 --> 07:22.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government certainly doesn't
fear the
truth, but the truth helps us do
better, not

07:22.809 --> 07:24.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to poison the debate.

07:24.577 --> 07:28.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is in our hands to make sure
that once
the disaster has past, further
injustice is

07:28.415 --> 07:30.216 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not created.

07:30.250 --> 07:34.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As the prime
minister spoke,
residents of quake-struck areas
marched towards

07:34.054 --> 07:38.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Italy's parliament, protesting
the handling
of the crisis.

07:38.491 --> 07:43.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
full analysis
of the Trump administration's
latest moves,

07:43.563 --> 07:49.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including efforts to build a
wall on the Mexico
border; the unsubstantiated
claim that three

07:49.936 --> 07:56.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
million people voted illegally;
an alleged
crackdown on federal agencies'
communication

07:56.142 --> 08:02.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the public; remembering
Mary Tyler Moore;
and much more.

08:02.248 --> 08:15.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We take a deeper look now at
President Trump's
executive actions on immigration
and border

08:15.595 --> 08:22.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
security with Marielena
Hincapie, the executive
director of the National
Immigration Law Center.

08:22.435 --> 08:24.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's an immigrant rights group.

08:24.371 --> 08:28.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Jessica Vaughan, she's from
the Center
for Immigration Studies, which
advocates for

08:28.908 --> 08:31.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tougher border security.

08:31.044 --> 08:32.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

08:32.579 --> 08:34.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Marielena, I'm going to start
with you.

08:34.881 --> 08:37.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Overall reaction to what the
president had
to say today?

08:37.083 --> 08:38.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIELENA HINCAPIE, Executive
Director, National
Immigration Law Center: Well,
Judy, we are

08:38.985 --> 08:42.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- we find this announcement
today as an extremist
policy.

08:43.022 --> 08:48.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think President Trump's
campaign rhetoric
that was anti-immigrant,
xenophobic, anti-refugee,

08:48.762 --> 08:51.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anti-Muslim today is becoming a
harsh reality.

08:51.498 --> 08:58.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's sending a message of
great fear to
immigrant communities across the
country.

08:58.271 --> 09:01.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jessica Vaughan,
reaction to
what he had to say overall?

09:01.408 --> 09:05.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSICA VAUGHAN, Center for
Immigration Studies:
This is a very impressive set of
actions.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He really went big.

09:07.881 --> 09:14.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that is what was needed to
restore integrity
to our immigration system, and
to not only

09:14.387 --> 09:20.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
secure the border, but also
restart interior
enforcement, which has collapsed
in the last

09:20.059 --> 09:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
few years, and shine that not
only do we need
border security, but it has to
be backed up

09:26.599 --> 09:31.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by policies that make sure that
people cannot
game our system.

09:31.971 --> 09:36.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, the end to the catch
and release
system that's been in place for
the last few

09:36.776 --> 09:41.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years is going to make a big
difference in
deterring future illegal
immigration.

09:41.147 --> 09:42.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's important.

09:42.882 --> 09:47.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We needed to start sending that
message to
people that they aren't going to
be able to

09:47.387 --> 09:52.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get away with just getting to
the United States,
getting in, and then being
home-free from

09:52.892 --> 09:54.527 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
enforcement.

09:54.561 --> 09:56.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me pick
up on that
and ask Marielena Hincapie about
that.

09:56.796 --> 10:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What about -- the president
said, we're going
to stop the so-called catch and
release, where

10:00.366 --> 10:03.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they were stopping people,
arresting them,
but then letting them go and
said come back

10:03.736 --> 10:04.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for a certain court date.

10:04.971 --> 10:06.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARIELENA HINCAPIE: Right.

10:06.806 --> 10:09.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the reason that people are
being allowed
to go before an immigration
judge is because

10:09.075 --> 10:12.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many of the people, particularly
from Central
America in the recent, last
couple of years

10:12.879 --> 10:16.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were people that actually, once
they went
before an immigration judge,
were able to

10:16.349 --> 10:20.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
show that they had a credible
fear and that
they were eligible for asylum.

10:20.119 --> 10:24.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a country where we
believe that every
single person should have their
fair day in

10:24.991 --> 10:26.025 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
court.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is no different in our
immigration system.

10:27.994 --> 10:31.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem is, we have a very
dysfunctional
immigration system, very few
immigration judges.

10:31.498 --> 10:35.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, one of the things
that President
Trump has done, not today, but
in some of

10:35.768 --> 10:39.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his previous announcements, has
been to freeze
all federal hires.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that includes immigration
judges.

10:41.074 --> 10:44.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Jessica
Vaughan, if it
is a system that could have been
working if

10:44.644 --> 10:50.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there were enough people, enough
federal employees
to make it work, why then
dismantle it and

10:50.416 --> 10:53.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
go back and say we won't release
you anymore?

10:53.052 --> 11:00.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSICA VAUGHAN: Well, the
system has been
exploited and too many cases
dumped on the

11:00.627 --> 11:03.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immigration courts that should
never have
been there.

11:03.863 --> 11:08.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are other forms of due
process that
ICE could have been using and
the Border Patrol

11:08.401 --> 11:14.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could have been using all these
years that
would have been resolved much
more quickly

11:14.407 --> 11:20.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and used less resources, and
brought about
a quicker resolution to the case
for the illegal

11:20.980 --> 11:22.782 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
immigrant.

11:22.815 --> 11:25.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what's going to happen now
is, they're
going to put resources at the
border, so that

11:25.718 --> 11:28.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Border Patrol can resolve
these cases.

11:28.922 --> 11:35.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There will be asylum officers
and immigration
judges there, so that any
applications for

11:35.662 --> 11:38.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
asylum can be dealt with very
quickly.

11:38.498 --> 11:43.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we won't see is tens of
thousands
of people admitted into the
country who then

11:44.003 --> 11:50.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
skip out on their immigration
hearings or
are not successful in getting
asylum, but

11:50.410 --> 11:56.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then just disappear into the
woodwork and
ICE is told not to go looking
for them.

11:56.416 --> 12:00.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is what makes our system so
dysfunctional
now, and that's what is going to
change under

12:00.920 --> 12:02.589 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these actions.

12:02.622 --> 12:05.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Marielena
Hincapie, one of
the things the president
announced was hiring

12:05.391 --> 12:09.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more Border Patrol agents,
hiring more immigration
officials.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why isn't that a good thing in
order to enforce
the law?

12:12.031 --> 12:16.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIELENA HINCAPIE: We actually
already have
a lot of both Border Patrol
agents and immigration

12:16.502 --> 12:18.237 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
agents.

12:18.271 --> 12:21.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is happening, Judy, is,
one, is a lot
of what was announced today,
particularly

12:21.608 --> 12:25.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with respect to the wall,
particularly with
respect to the number of Border
Patrol and

12:25.111 --> 12:27.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immigration agents, frankly, is
political
theatrics.

12:27.914 --> 12:32.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
None of that is going to go into
effect without
congressional appropriations,
without more

12:32.051 --> 12:33.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
money, more federal spending.

12:33.486 --> 12:36.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in fact, it is us as
taxpayers that will
pay for all of that.

12:36.723 --> 12:41.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Part of what was really
troubling about today's
announcements is, as Jessica
mentioned, it's

12:41.527 --> 12:45.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not just at the border, but in
the interior,
the orders begin, the executive
order today

12:45.665 --> 12:49.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
begins by saying that every
individual, right
-- we're talking about the 11
million undocumented

12:49.669 --> 12:53.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immigrants -- are considered a
national security
threat, a public safety threat.

12:53.973 --> 12:57.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That includes people who are
taking care of
our children.

12:57.377 --> 13:00.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It includes people who are
picking our fruits
and vegetables.

13:00.179 --> 13:02.982 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It includes people who are
serving us at restaurants.

13:03.016 --> 13:06.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those are not individuals who
are, in fact,
national security threats.

13:06.352 --> 13:07.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are our neighbors.

13:07.353 --> 13:08.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They are part of our families.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to ask you
both about
the wall.

13:10.056 --> 13:12.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, before I do that, let me
ask you, Jessica
Vaughan, about this notion.

13:12.825 --> 13:17.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Did the president send a signal
today that
every one of these, whether it's
11 million

13:17.263 --> 13:22.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or 12 million undocumented
immigrants in this
country, are a threat?

13:22.068 --> 13:25.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JESSICA VAUGHAN: No, I don't
think that's
what is being said at all.

13:25.905 --> 13:31.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under the law, of course, anyone
who is here
illegally is potentially subject
to deportation.

13:31.978 --> 13:39.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But these orders focus very
clearly on deterring
illegal immigration, dealing
very quickly

13:39.252 --> 13:44.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with people who cross the border
illegally,
and enforcing the law in the
interior of the

13:44.824 --> 13:47.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country, with criminal aliens
being the top
priority.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, that is appropriate.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's smart enforcement.

13:51.397 --> 13:54.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what has been missing for
the last
eight years.

13:54.801 --> 14:00.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, yes, enforcement costs
money, but illegal
immigration and tolerating
illegal immigration

14:00.306 --> 14:02.041 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
costs much more.

14:02.075 --> 14:08.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The National Academy of Science
has found
that it's something like $50
billion a year

14:08.181 --> 14:13.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that goes to services to illegal
alien-headed
households.

14:13.252 --> 14:19.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's about time that we get
back on track
and start enforcing the law
again.

14:19.492 --> 14:20.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's what the public expects.

14:20.893 --> 14:23.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why they voted for Donald
Trump in
part.

14:23.930 --> 14:26.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You want to
respond quickly
to that, and then we're going to
ask about...

14:26.299 --> 14:27.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

14:27.300 --> 14:28.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARIELENA HINCAPIE: Yes.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, actually, that's not what
has been missing,
Judy.

14:30.236 --> 14:32.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under President Obama, he was in
fact focusing
on people with criminal
convictions.

14:32.338 --> 14:36.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is different here is, in
addition to
focusing on individuals with
criminal convictions,

14:36.476 --> 14:41.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this executive order actually
says that individuals
who have been charged with a
crime, even if

14:41.147 --> 14:45.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they haven't been convicted,
even someone
who may have done something that
is considered

14:45.718 --> 14:48.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to be a crime would be
priorities for enforcement.

14:48.187 --> 14:52.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, that is deeply troubling
in a country
when we believe that people are
innocent until

14:52.859 --> 14:54.627 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
proven guilty.

14:54.660 --> 14:57.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Due process is critical to both
our criminal
justice system, as well as our
immigration.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jessica Vaughan,
only a minute
left.

14:59.232 --> 15:03.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the wall, the president said
throughout
the campaign this was something
going to be

15:03.202 --> 15:04.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
paid for by Mexico.

15:04.704 --> 15:10.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, though, he said, at least
initially,
the taxpayers will pay for it.

15:10.376 --> 15:12.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Did you want him to go farther
than that?

15:13.012 --> 15:14.347 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is this what you expected?

15:14.380 --> 15:17.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JESSICA VAUGHAN: This is pretty
much what
I expected.

15:17.383 --> 15:25.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will take time to raise the
revenue from
other sources, whether it's
Mexico or illegal

15:25.858 --> 15:33.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aliens or, you know, through
remittances or
withheld tax refunds or visa
fees or what

15:33.065 --> 15:34.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have you.

15:34.233 --> 15:36.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are lots of different ways
to raise
that revenue.

15:36.569 --> 15:44.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think Congress is very
willing and the
public is very willing to put
taxpayer funds

15:44.043 --> 15:48.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up front to get this enforcement
going right
away and to improve security at
the border,

15:48.948 --> 15:52.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because, as I said, it's a lot
more expensive
not to enforce the law.

15:52.885 --> 15:55.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quick, 10
seconds on the
wall.

15:55.421 --> 15:58.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIELENA HINCAPIE: This is
political theatrics,
Judy.

15:58.257 --> 16:00.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mexico was never going to pay
for this wall.

16:00.359 --> 16:03.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We as taxpayers are now stuck
with that bill.

16:03.462 --> 16:08.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Everything that has been
announced by President
Trump is extreme, it's
expensive, and ineffective.

16:08.234 --> 16:10.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we are
going to continue
to it look at this.

16:10.903 --> 16:15.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know more will be unfolding
in the days
to come on the question of
immigration.

16:15.741 --> 16:17.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Marielena Hincapie, Jessica
Vaughan, thank
you.

16:17.743 --> 16:20.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARIELENA HINCAPIE: Thank you.

16:20.279 --> 16:27.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JESSICA VAUGHAN: You're welcome.

16:27.854 --> 16:35.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Turning now to
another initiative
from the president, this one
about the integrity

16:35.394 --> 16:37.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of our elections.

16:37.063 --> 16:41.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump has again repeated the
unproven
claim that millions of illegal
votes were

16:41.901 --> 16:46.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cast in the last election, and
now he says
he will order a federal
investigation to look

16:46.939 --> 16:47.974 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
into it.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.709 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has that story.

16:49.742 --> 16:54.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), President of
the United
States: We're in a rigged
system, folks.

16:54.213 --> 16:55.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're in a rigged system.

16:55.514 --> 16:57.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They even want to try to rig the
election
at the polling booths.

16:57.817 --> 17:01.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: He made it a
rallying cry
during his presidential
campaign.

17:01.487 --> 17:06.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, having won the White House,
President
Trump is raising the issue yet
again.

17:06.692 --> 17:11.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Twitter today, he announced:
"I will be
asking for a major investigation
into voter

17:11.397 --> 17:12.765 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fraud.

17:12.798 --> 17:16.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Depending on results, we will
strengthen up
voting procedures."

17:16.135 --> 17:20.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This follows his remarks to
congressional
leaders on Monday, where, in a
closed-door

17:20.106 --> 17:24.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meeting, the president repeated
his claim
that Hillary Clinton won the
popular vote

17:24.877 --> 17:29.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only because of three to five
million illegal
votes being cast for her.

17:29.949 --> 17:35.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, there is no evidence of
widespread
voter fraud in the presidential
election last

17:35.154 --> 17:36.856 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fall.

17:36.889 --> 17:40.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what's more, previous
studies have found
no such evidence going back to
2000.

17:40.993 --> 17:44.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Top Republicans, including House
Speaker Paul
Ryan, underscored that point
yesterday.

17:44.830 --> 17:46.399 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

17:46.432 --> 17:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: I
have seen no evidence to that
effect.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I have made that very, very
clear.

17:49.201 --> 17:52.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: South Carolina
Republican
Lindsey Graham went further,
telling the president

17:52.271 --> 17:53.539 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to knock it off.

17:53.572 --> 17:55.308 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

17:55.341 --> 17:57.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South
Carolina: If the
president of the United States
is claiming

17:57.109 --> 18:05.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that 3 to 3.5 million people
voted illegally,
that shakes confidence in our
democracy.

18:05.851 --> 18:08.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He needs to disclose why he
believes that.

18:08.721 --> 18:12.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Still, the
president persists,
as his White House spokesman,
Sean Spicer,

18:12.825 --> 18:14.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
acknowledged on Tuesday.

18:14.493 --> 18:16.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
He continues to maintain that
belief.

18:16.562 --> 18:21.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And President
Trump's pick
for attorney general, Senator
Jeff Sessions,

18:21.400 --> 18:25.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said at his confirmation hearing
this month
that he believes -- quote -- "We
regularly

18:25.905 --> 18:29.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have fraudulent activities occur
during election
cycles."

18:29.542 --> 18:34.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, White House spokesman
Spicer said the
investigation that the president
wants is

18:34.180 --> 18:36.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about the integrity of the
system.

18:36.115 --> 18:39.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: There's a lot of
people that
are dead that are on rolls.

18:39.151 --> 18:42.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are people that are voting
in tow places
or that are on the rolls in two
different

18:42.922 --> 18:44.657 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
states.

18:44.690 --> 18:47.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think taking the necessary
steps to study
and to track what we can do to
understand

18:47.626 --> 18:49.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is something that is definitely,
clearly in
the best interests.

18:49.528 --> 18:53.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Senator Bernie
Sanders and
leading Democrats fired back
that the president

18:53.632 --> 18:58.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is actually -- quote -- "telling
Republicans
to accelerate voter suppression"
with stricter

18:58.704 --> 19:00.639 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
voter I.D. laws.

19:00.673 --> 19:06.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Spicer acknowledged today that
expanding controversial
voter I.D. laws could be one
outcome of the

19:06.278 --> 19:08.314 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investigation.

19:08.347 --> 19:12.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on the president's
unproven allegations
and his call for an
investigation, I'm joined

19:12.985 --> 19:14.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
now by Rick Hasen.

19:14.787 --> 19:18.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a law professor at the
University of
California, Irvine, and writes
the Election

19:18.090 --> 19:22.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Law Blog, and by Alex Padilla,
who is California's
secretary of state.

19:22.795 --> 19:25.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a Democrat, and he oversees
elections
there.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Gentlemen, welcome to you both.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rick Hasen, I would like to
start with you.

19:29.135 --> 19:35.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The allegation on the table is
that three
or four or five million people
voted illegally

19:35.207 --> 19:36.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in this last election.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is there any evidence that that
went on?

19:38.778 --> 19:41.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICK HASEN, University of
California, Irvine:
There's no evidence that that
went on.

19:41.313 --> 19:45.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is no evidence even that
thousands or
even hundreds of illegal votes
were cast.

19:46.018 --> 19:52.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, think about five
million people
involved in a conspiracy that no
one has been

19:52.892 --> 19:57.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
able to detect, even in those
states with
Republican secretaries of state
that are looking

19:57.630 --> 20:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out for this kind of fraud that
is supposedly
happening.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is just a ludicrous idea.

20:02.501 --> 20:06.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you were going do this
and engage in
this vast conspiracy, you would
think that

20:06.639 --> 20:10.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you would be able to actually
swing the results
of the election and put maybe
10,000 or 20,000

20:10.709 --> 20:12.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more votes in Michigan and in
Pennsylvania.

20:12.745 --> 20:16.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It just -- it is a ludicrous
accusation.

20:16.182 --> 20:19.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Secretary of
State Padilla,
the same question to you.

20:19.385 --> 20:22.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You oversaw an election in the
biggest state
in the country.

20:22.321 --> 20:24.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much election fraud did you
see in your
state?

20:24.323 --> 20:26.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALEX PADILLA, California
Secretary of State:
Look, I can honestly tell that
you we have

20:26.826 --> 20:32.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
zero evidence of any
non-citizens voting in
the November election here in
the state of

20:32.465 --> 20:34.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
California.

20:34.366 --> 20:38.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We take voter fraud very
seriously and invite
anybody that has information
about irregularities

20:38.437 --> 20:40.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or wrongdoing to bring it
forward.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we're happy to look into it.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I extended that offer to team
Trump back in
November.

20:44.977 --> 20:47.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that offer still stands.

20:47.346 --> 20:51.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, like Rick mentioned,
there's zero evidence
of this happening.

20:51.784 --> 20:53.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here's what my bigger concern
is.

20:53.552 --> 20:58.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the more that
President Trump
and the administration calls
into question

20:58.691 --> 21:04.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the integrity of the elections,
they're simply
setting the stage for proposed
changes to

21:04.497 --> 21:09.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policy and changes to law that
will follow
that will take our country
backwards as it

21:09.368 --> 21:11.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pertains to voting rights.

21:11.237 --> 21:13.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we need to push back every
step of the
way.

21:13.072 --> 21:17.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Mr. Padilla,
though, staying
with you, a lot of conservatives
will argue

21:17.409 --> 21:22.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that if you don't need to have
an I.D. to
prove you are who you say you
are when you

21:22.414 --> 21:27.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go to vote, couldn't there be
widespread voter
fraud, and you just wouldn't
know about it?

21:27.286 --> 21:32.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX PADILLA: There's a lot of
hypotheticals
that people would like to kind
of put out

21:32.725 --> 21:36.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there to create the concern, to
create the
doubt.

21:36.428 --> 21:39.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the fact of the matter is,
voter fraud
isn't something that we just
started paying

21:39.899 --> 21:42.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attention to in this November
election.

21:42.201 --> 21:45.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is a question that comes up
in each and
every election cycle.

21:45.905 --> 21:51.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there has been study after
study, report
after report, investigation
after investigation

21:51.877 --> 21:55.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a variety of sectors that all
conclude
the same thing.

21:55.447 --> 22:00.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Voter fraud may be very, very
isolated, but
at the end of the day, it is
nearly nonexistent.

22:00.085 --> 22:03.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Rick, a
question for you.

22:03.088 --> 22:08.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sean Spicer today tried to
seemingly dial
down the accusations that Donald
Trump had

22:08.961 --> 22:10.663 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
made.

22:10.696 --> 22:13.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he said that the
investigation, if it
goes forward, will look at
things like dead

22:13.232 --> 22:17.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people on the voter rolls or
people being
registered in two different
states.

22:17.937 --> 22:21.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Interestingly today, it turned
out that the
president's daughter, his
commerce secretary

22:21.640 --> 22:26.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pick and his counselor Steve
Bannon were themselves
all registered to vote in two
different states.

22:26.946 --> 22:31.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But those things happening, dead
people on
voter rolls or registering in
two states,

22:31.984 --> 22:33.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is that evidence of fraud?

22:33.752 --> 22:38.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RICK HASEN: Well, there is
occasional fraud.

22:38.190 --> 22:44.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But almost all of these
accusations of dead
people voting turn out to be
either bureaucratic

22:44.330 --> 22:46.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
incompetence or voter error.

22:46.131 --> 22:51.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, a few years ago, there was a
sensationalized
statement in North Carolina that
there were

22:51.570 --> 22:53.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tons of dead people voting.

22:53.439 --> 22:56.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And when they actually
investigated, they
found that not one of those
involved voter

22:56.775 --> 22:58.611 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fraud.

22:58.644 --> 23:03.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mostly what they involved was
either a mistake
where, say, a senior was
confused for a junior,

23:03.215 --> 23:06.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or a voter signed on the wrong
line in the
poll book.

23:06.352 --> 23:07.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And there is a lot of dead wood.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are a lot of people who
move from one
state to another.

23:10.122 --> 23:13.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That may be what is happening
with some of
the people in the Trump
administration.

23:13.292 --> 23:16.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And their old registration is
not canceled.

23:16.362 --> 23:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have very little evidence
of people
engaging in -- certainly in
impersonation

23:21.734 --> 23:25.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fraud, which you mentioned
earlier, double
voting, very rare.

23:26.005 --> 23:29.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The kind of fraud that does
happen, when it
does happen, tends to be
absentee ballot fraud.

23:29.808 --> 23:33.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is the one kind of
fraud I have not
heard Donald Trump mentioning
anything about

23:33.812 --> 23:35.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
trying to cut down on.

23:35.748 --> 23:38.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we really cared about fraud,
that would
be number one on the list.

23:38.817 --> 23:40.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's not even on the list,
apparently.

23:40.586 --> 23:44.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Secretary
Padilla, we often
see, after there are accusations
of voter

23:44.290 --> 23:50.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fraud, very soon thereafter,
there are attempts
to crack down and to pass
stiffer voting I.D.

23:50.896 --> 23:52.164 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
laws.

23:52.197 --> 23:55.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you expect to see that in the
wake of this
investigation?

23:55.668 --> 23:59.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEX PADILLA: That's frankly my
biggest fear
here.

23:59.271 --> 24:03.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, we have heard the
allegations starting
in November about rampant voter
fraud with

24:03.442 --> 24:06.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not a shred of evidence or proof
to back it
up.

24:06.078 --> 24:11.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now we are hearing not just
those allegations
yet again, but now a call for a
major investigation,

24:12.017 --> 24:17.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to use his words, an
investigation based on
allegations that are not based
in reality

24:17.656 --> 24:20.125 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or in any evidence whatsoever.

24:20.159 --> 24:21.960 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's where we are today.

24:21.994 --> 24:27.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And like I said, if this is
simply setting
the tone for going backwards on
voting rights

24:27.533 --> 24:32.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in America, that is something
that we ought
to be concerned about and be
prepared to push

24:32.738 --> 24:34.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back on, because we have seen
the playbook.

24:34.640 --> 24:39.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look what has happened in state
after state
after state across the country,
overly aggressive

24:39.244 --> 24:46.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
purging of voter rolls, very
creatively written
voter I.D. laws, the elimination
or significant

24:46.485 --> 24:51.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reduction of early voting
opportunities, making
it harder for American citizens
to be registered

24:51.924 --> 24:54.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to vote and to actually cast a
ballot.

24:54.460 --> 24:57.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's unpatriotic, in my
opinion, un-American
and undemocratic.

24:57.796 --> 25:03.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Rick Hasen,
let's say this
investigation that is being
called for by

25:03.235 --> 25:06.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Trump administration goes
forward.

25:06.438 --> 25:07.539 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Could it be a good thing?

25:07.573 --> 25:10.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If so, how would you like it to
unfold?

25:10.242 --> 25:15.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICK HASEN: Well, I think if we
had an investigation
into the extent to which there
is voter fraud

25:15.547 --> 25:22.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and suppression, and we had it
with bipartisan,
well-respected people in charge,
as we had

25:22.321 --> 25:27.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 200, when we had Presidents
Carter and
Ford, or in 2004, when we had
President Carter

25:27.192 --> 25:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and James Baker, or in 2008,
when we had Ben
Ginsberg and Bob Bauer, two
Republican and

25:34.400 --> 25:38.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democratic election lawyers, if
we had professionals,
we had election administrators
all involved,

25:38.504 --> 25:43.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and we looked at the whole
picture, do these
laws suppress more votes than
prevent -- than

25:43.542 --> 25:46.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the amount of fraud they
prevent, I think
that would be a great thing.

25:46.445 --> 25:50.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just don't think that that is
what Donald
Trump's administration is going
to set up.

25:50.682 --> 25:55.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I don't have a lot of
confidence that
the investigation would be a
full, fair investigation

25:55.554 --> 25:58.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on a bipartisan basis that
really looks at
evidence to get to the truth.

25:58.991 --> 26:02.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEX PADILLA: And I would offer
two things,
if I may.

26:02.494 --> 26:08.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Short term, if the president
really was interested
about the integrity of the
November election

26:08.934 --> 26:11.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that just took place, he ought
to pick up
that intelligence briefing.

26:11.837 --> 26:16.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The intelligence community is
unanimous in
their findings that there was
foreign interference

26:16.141 --> 26:17.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with our elections this
November.

26:17.976 --> 26:20.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The president ought to
acknowledge that and
he should act on that.

26:21.013 --> 26:25.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Longer term, if the Trump
administration really
wants to be helpful and the
Republican Congress

26:25.250 --> 26:28.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really wants to be helpful,
there would be
another round of election
funding.

26:28.887 --> 26:33.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The last time there was
significant investment
into how we conduct elections
came in the

26:33.492 --> 26:35.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wake of Florida in 2000.

26:35.794 --> 26:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congress acted on a bipartisan
basis, put
moneys out to the state for the
upgrade of

26:41.066 --> 26:42.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our voting systems.

26:42.401 --> 26:45.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But those systems are now more
than a decade
old.

26:45.971 --> 26:51.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as the Brennan Center and
other bipartisan
commissions have told us, that
is probably

26:51.810 --> 26:54.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the ticking time bomb threat to
our elections.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We need to invest in new
equipment.

26:56.215 --> 26:59.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Alex Padilla,
the secretary of state of
California, and

26:59.852 --> 27:00.786 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Rick Hasen, U.C.

27:00.819 --> 27:02.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Irvine, thank you both very
much.

27:02.287 --> 27:03.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALEX PADILLA: Thanks.

27:03.288 --> 27:07.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RICK HASEN: Thank you.

27:07.292 --> 27:16.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

27:16.502 --> 27:22.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
using psychedelic
drugs to treat illness; and
remembering Mary

27:22.341 --> 27:24.009 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Tyler Moore.

27:24.042 --> 27:28.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, one other story that
has been
getting much attention about
these first few

27:28.647 --> 27:33.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
days of the Trump
administration, are government
agencies being silenced from
their normal

27:33.819 --> 27:36.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way of communicating with the
public?

27:36.355 --> 27:39.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And is this administration going
further than
its predecessors?

27:39.825 --> 27:41.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

27:41.727 --> 27:46.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Reports continued
today from
several news outlets that the
Trump administration

27:46.365 --> 27:51.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has tried to limit the flow of
information
from key government agencies,
many involved

27:51.203 --> 27:54.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in environmental and scientific
research.

27:54.339 --> 27:58.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among them, according to The
Washington Post,
Associated Press and others, the
Environmental

27:58.744 --> 28:04.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Protection Agency, where staff
are reportedly
banned from sending press
releases or posting

28:04.182 --> 28:07.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the agency's social media
accounts.

28:07.452 --> 28:12.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Similar orders were allegedly
issued within
the Departments of Interior and
Agriculture.

28:12.991 --> 28:18.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials from the USDA later
told reporters
the order was improperly issued
and not cleared

28:18.330 --> 28:20.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by senior leadership.

28:20.132 --> 28:24.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, at the White House
today, Press
Secretary Sean Spicer disputed
the broader

28:25.003 --> 28:26.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
claims altogether.

28:26.805 --> 28:28.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
No, no, there's nothing that's
come from the

28:28.206 --> 28:30.108 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
White House.

28:30.142 --> 28:33.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In a separate
interview with
NPR, however, a spokesman for
the Trump transition

28:33.378 --> 28:39.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
team at the EPA did say agency
scientists
will likely have their research
reviewed on

28:39.084 --> 28:43.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a case-by-case basis before
being released
publicly.

28:43.922 --> 28:46.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Juliet Eilperin has been looking
into these
developments for The Washington
Post.

28:46.792 --> 28:47.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She joins us now.

28:48.026 --> 28:50.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Juliet, a certain amount of
confusion
at this point.

28:50.195 --> 28:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much do we know about
whether the administration
is attempting to silence these
agencies?

28:54.633 --> 28:57.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN, The Washington
Post: Well,
there are certainly -- there are
some agencies

28:57.970 --> 29:04.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where there have been clear
efforts by new
members of the administration
who are restricting

29:05.010 --> 29:06.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the communication.

29:06.678 --> 29:11.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, other administrations have
also sought
to get everyone on the same
page.

29:11.149 --> 29:15.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They seem -- these new
administration officials
seem to be going further, and,
in some cases,

29:15.687 --> 29:17.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they're quite restrictive.

29:17.456 --> 29:21.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, just it kind of depends on a
case-by-case
basis, but there is no question
that there

29:21.326 --> 29:24.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is a clampdown on direct
communication with
the public in some of these
agencies.

29:24.529 --> 29:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, before
I ask you
for an example, but go back to
that comparison.

29:28.567 --> 29:30.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There is always a normal
changeover, right?

29:30.969 --> 29:36.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so does this look more like
a temporary
pause in these agencies, or is
this on a different

29:36.308 --> 29:38.176 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
scale?

29:38.210 --> 29:42.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: It certainly
seems to be
more severe in terms of some
individual agencies.

29:42.547 --> 29:47.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And also, because of advances in
technology,
they're simply more forms of
communication.

29:47.519 --> 29:53.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There weren't, you know, tons of
Twitter accounts
back when the Obama
administration took over.

29:53.525 --> 29:56.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you know, it is certainly
being done in
a visible way.

29:56.228 --> 29:59.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it is affecting more
platforms, and that
is something that is different.

29:59.297 --> 30:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, so
take an example.

30:01.166 --> 30:05.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of focus, of course, on
the EPA, for
example, restricting social
media, when papers

30:05.170 --> 30:07.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can be published.

30:07.139 --> 30:10.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some talk now about whether
there is a review
of the Web site, specifically
about the climate

30:10.809 --> 30:12.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
change information there.

30:12.110 --> 30:13.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do we know so far?

30:14.012 --> 30:18.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: At that agency,
it's very
clear that you have officials
who are restricting

30:18.884 --> 30:23.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the level of communication, both
in terms
of, again, these social media
accounts, press

30:23.655 --> 30:28.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
releases, other kinds of
communication, as
well as the fact that they are
indicating

30:28.593 --> 30:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the record that they will
regulate kind
of what communications
scientists can have

30:34.766 --> 30:36.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the public in certain
instances.

30:36.401 --> 30:38.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So that is something that is
significant.

30:38.770 --> 30:41.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, in terms its of the Web
site, which is
something we have been looking
very carefully

30:41.840 --> 30:49.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into, the EPA has many Web pages
devoted to
climate, sharing data, things
like that.

30:49.648 --> 30:54.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was an effort to explore
taking it down,
and career staff there resisted.

30:54.553 --> 30:57.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as a result, they are now
not going to
do that.

30:57.522 --> 30:59.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But that did happen.

30:59.191 --> 31:02.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there was this effort, but
then it was
reversed later on.

31:02.127 --> 31:06.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You heard Sean
Spicer say today
it is not a White House effort.

31:06.698 --> 31:10.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where would it be coming from,
if not from
there?

31:10.035 --> 31:13.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Could it be the agencies
themselves sort of
taking proactive steps?

31:13.472 --> 31:19.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: It seems like
it's a combination
of new appointees in some of
these agencies

31:19.878 --> 31:24.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and to some extent career
officials responding
to what they think are messages
they might

31:24.116 --> 31:26.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have gotten from the
administration more broadly.

31:26.752 --> 31:32.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sean Spicer, as you noted and as
you explained,
is on the record saying they are
not directing

31:32.357 --> 31:34.259 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

31:34.292 --> 31:37.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is no question that
this is something
that certainly has transpired
since President

31:37.429 --> 31:39.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump has taken office.

31:39.231 --> 31:42.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And to go from
the EPA to some
other agencies, a common thread
or some of

31:42.701 --> 31:47.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the focus clearly is on
scientific data, specifically
around climate change, correct?

31:47.472 --> 31:51.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: Right, that is
something
that certainly surfaced at USDA,
although,

31:51.376 --> 31:54.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
again, they reversed themselves
over time.

31:54.212 --> 31:59.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is interesting about the
Interior Department
is they are restricting a huge
amount of communication,

31:59.117 --> 32:03.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including with, say, tribes,
which potentially
can raise questions of
sovereignty.

32:03.321 --> 32:08.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it is not just a question of
a tweet,
which is kind of one of the
things Sean Spicer

32:08.393 --> 32:10.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was talking about.

32:10.262 --> 32:14.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is really about, how are you
communicating,
whether it's your research or
your policies,

32:14.466 --> 32:15.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the broader public?

32:15.967 --> 32:18.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And are you able
to talk to
people inside these agencies?

32:18.670 --> 32:21.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What kind of concerns are you
hearing?

32:21.173 --> 32:25.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: Many of the
career officials
are quite scared right now.

32:25.043 --> 32:26.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There is no question.

32:26.044 --> 32:28.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, I think we will see how
this plays out.

32:28.346 --> 32:32.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, there are -- there have
been these
tensions early on in previous
administrations.

32:32.951 --> 32:37.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what we are looking for
are what are
the decisions past this initial
flurry of

32:37.656 --> 32:42.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
activity that will really set
the ground rules
for, to what extent can federal
officials

32:42.861 --> 32:46.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
share what they know and what
they are finding
out with the public, whether
it's through

32:46.131 --> 32:47.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the media or directly?

32:47.866 --> 32:52.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Juliet
Eilperin
of The Washington Post, thank
you very much.

32:52.070 --> 33:01.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: Thanks so much,
Jeff.

33:02.013 --> 33:07.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We turn now to
Congress.

33:07.519 --> 33:11.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican members of the House
and Senate
are in Philadelphia today for
their annual

33:11.389 --> 33:13.291 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
retreat.

33:13.325 --> 33:17.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are trying to outline an
ambitious agenda
to accomplish in the next 200
days, and setting

33:17.529 --> 33:21.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the tone for how they will work
with President
Trump and his administration.

33:21.766 --> 33:24.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our Lisa Desjardins has been
there.

33:24.436 --> 33:31.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lisa, first off, we led off
tonight's program
with the announcements by the
president today

33:31.343 --> 33:33.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
having to do with cracking down
on illegal
immigration.

33:33.545 --> 33:37.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, one big element of
that is the
border wall.

33:37.549 --> 33:41.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know members of Congress,
especially the
Republicans, are looking at how
to pay for

33:41.486 --> 33:42.454 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

33:42.487 --> 33:44.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Have they come up with an
answer?

33:44.656 --> 33:46.825 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: There is some
news.

33:46.858 --> 33:49.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is not definitive yet, but
a plan seems
to be emerging, Judy.

33:49.861 --> 33:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House Speaker Paul Ryan told
gathered Republicans
today that they should consider
possibly a

33:55.634 --> 33:57.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
supplemental spending bill.

33:57.602 --> 34:02.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That would be a separate
spending bill devoted
just to homeland security and
maybe some military

34:02.574 --> 34:03.975 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
spending.

34:04.009 --> 34:06.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, a caveat here, that request
needs to
still come from the president.

34:07.012 --> 34:08.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But this looks like the
mechanism.

34:08.880 --> 34:12.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The questions about that bill
are, of course,
what is in it, probably a border
wall, probably

34:12.884 --> 34:16.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all of those new border and
customs agents
that the president wants.

34:16.688 --> 34:21.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't have a price tag yet,
also no clear
way how they would pay for it.

34:21.192 --> 34:24.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the idea seems to be to get
that spending
bill off the ground and maybe
pass within

34:24.896 --> 34:26.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the next two months.

34:26.898 --> 34:30.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, Lisa, you
have been reminding
us, Republicans in Congress
tackling a number

34:30.869 --> 34:35.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of complicated issues, what to
do about them,
taxes, health care.

34:35.473 --> 34:38.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have been divided among
themselves over
what to do.

34:38.176 --> 34:42.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now that they are getting closer
to the nitty-gritty,
working out the details, are
they coming any

34:42.447 --> 34:44.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
closer together to agreement?

34:44.149 --> 34:47.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I spoke to so
many Republicans
today, Judy.

34:47.619 --> 34:51.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is certainly a will,
but the way
is not clear yet on many of
these issues.

34:51.690 --> 34:56.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is still major divide over
big things
like Medicaid and also over some
clear just

34:56.795 --> 34:58.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
issues of process.

34:58.163 --> 35:00.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How many bills does it take to
accomplish
all of this?

35:00.832 --> 35:02.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How long does it take to do it?

35:02.667 --> 35:07.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is one thing, though that
seems to be
at least on the tracks, a
deadline for when

35:07.105 --> 35:10.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the actual final repeal bill
will move through
Congress.

35:10.709 --> 35:14.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The House says they want their
bill all the
way done and voted on in the
next month.

35:15.013 --> 35:18.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is just the repeal, not the
replace,
but that would be a major step.

35:18.750 --> 35:24.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, finally Lisa,
we know the
president is making news on a
number of fronts

35:24.255 --> 35:27.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today, issuing executive orders
on a variety
of things.

35:28.026 --> 35:28.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's been tweeting.

35:29.027 --> 35:30.762 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's been doing interviews.

35:30.795 --> 35:34.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the things that came
out late this
afternoon in an interview he did
with ABC

35:34.933 --> 35:40.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
News has to do with his belief,
he is stating
his belief again that enhanced
interrogation,

35:40.705 --> 35:46.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is one way of saying
torture, he believes,
can be effective with terror
suspects.

35:46.478 --> 35:53.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On some of these -- are things
like this and
other executive actions and
statements by

35:53.184 --> 35:57.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president, what effect are
they having
on these conversations among
Republicans?

35:57.822 --> 35:59.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Absolutely.

35:59.591 --> 36:01.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Look at the program we have had
tonight.

36:01.393 --> 36:05.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of the issues that you have
brought up
tonight have landed on
Republicans' laps coming

36:05.497 --> 36:07.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from the White House in this
retreat.

36:07.165 --> 36:10.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is not what they wanted to
talk about,
but they have been talking about
it.

36:10.702 --> 36:13.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on torture, there is some
divide among
Republicans.

36:13.538 --> 36:16.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For example, I asked Senator
John Thune.

36:16.041 --> 36:19.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said that that is a decided
issue, that
torture is unlawful.

36:19.577 --> 36:24.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But others, like new
Congresswoman Liz Cheney,
daughter of Dick Cheney, said
she thinks it's

36:24.449 --> 36:25.650 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not that simple.

36:25.683 --> 36:27.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So there is some divide on that.

36:27.352 --> 36:29.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is what Republicans have
been asked about
today.

36:29.087 --> 36:31.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not what they really wanted
to talk about.

36:31.089 --> 36:35.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fascinating, Lisa
Desjardins,
on top of it all in
Philadelphia.

36:35.493 --> 36:47.372 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you, Lisa.

36:47.405 --> 36:58.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now: why some psychiatrists and
researchers
are giving psychedelic drugs a
second look

36:58.516 --> 37:02.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as a possible way of treating
depression and
some mental illnesses.

37:02.654 --> 37:08.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The idea had been shunned for
years, but now
some say a time for larger
trials with the

37:08.593 --> 37:10.228 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
drugs is due.

37:10.261 --> 37:14.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Miles O'Brien has the story for
our weekly
segment on the Leading Edge of
science.

37:14.399 --> 37:16.234 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SGT.

37:16.267 --> 37:22.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
C.J. HARDIN (RET.), U.S. Army
Veteran: I was
diagnosed with post-traumatic
stress disorder

37:22.774 --> 37:24.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Fort Campbell.

37:24.409 --> 37:26.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: C.j.

37:26.277 --> 37:31.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Hardin is a former Army
helicopter mechanic
and machine gunner who faced
imminent death

37:31.950 --> 37:36.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Iraq, and also after he got
home.

37:36.321 --> 37:41.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
C.J. HARDIN: The way that my
emotions ran,
and how it felt uncontrollable,
I didn't trust

37:41.926 --> 37:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
myself having a weapon around
me, because
I was suicidal, very suicidal at
that point.

37:48.867 --> 37:54.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Years of pills
and talk therapy
failed to help his
post-traumatic stress disorder.

37:54.873 --> 38:00.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he turned to a surprising
alternative
at the center of a revolution in
neuroscience

38:00.945 --> 38:01.913 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and medicine.

38:01.946 --> 38:03.715 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

38:03.748 --> 38:06.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MITHOEFER, Therapist:
So, this is
the MDMA that we use for the
current study.

38:06.484 --> 38:11.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Hardin took MDMA,
more commonly
known as Ecstasy, under the
watchful eyes

38:11.789 --> 38:17.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of therapists Michael and Annie
Mithoefer,
a husband-and-wife team based in
Charleston,

38:17.128 --> 38:18.096 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
South Carolina.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.330 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

38:19.364 --> 38:20.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MITHOEFER: This is where
we do the
MDMA sessions.

38:20.765 --> 38:24.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't know how this works,
but we have
ideas about it.

38:24.502 --> 38:29.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In one study of
19 subjects,
more than 80 percent reported
significant

38:29.974 --> 38:33.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
improvement, after carefully
guided sessions
like this.

38:33.244 --> 38:34.212 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SGT.

38:34.245 --> 38:35.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
C.J. HARDIN: Which I knew was
the PTSD.

38:35.413 --> 38:37.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was never feeling comfortable
at home.

38:37.182 --> 38:41.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was still lucid, but it just
felt like I
had opened up a new avenue of
thinking.

38:41.186 --> 38:45.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: C.J. Hardin says
the difference
for him was like night and day.

38:45.723 --> 38:47.625 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SGT.

38:47.659 --> 38:52.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
C.J. HARDIN: I had three
experiences at full
dosage, but the effects after
the first treatment

38:52.730 --> 38:54.098 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were profound.

38:54.132 --> 38:59.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would have said a 60 percent
reduction in
my symptoms immediately.

38:59.304 --> 39:02.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I felt a mighty change had
occurred.

39:02.640 --> 39:07.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The fact that
these studies
are happening at all represents
a mighty change

39:07.645 --> 39:12.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the scientific community, a
renaissance
in thinking about psychedelic
drugs like MDMA,

39:12.850 --> 39:18.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LSD and psilocybin, the drug
found in magic
mushrooms.

STEPHEN ROSS, NYU Langone
Medical Center:
Psychiatrists are really
yearning to have

39:21.192 --> 39:26.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
something that works
differently, that works
quickly, that lasts longer to
add to their

39:26.297 --> 39:27.265 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
toolbox.

39:27.298 --> 39:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's really important to do
that.

39:29.133 --> 39:34.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Stephen Ross is a
psychiatrist
and addiction specialist at NYU
Langone Medical

39:34.539 --> 39:35.940 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Center.

39:35.974 --> 39:41.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is exploring the medical uses
of psilocybin,
a close cousin of LSD.

39:41.045 --> 39:46.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says the drugs are safe, but
only in a
carefully controlled setting.

39:46.150 --> 39:47.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Can you overdose?

39:47.385 --> 39:49.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN ROSS: There are no known
overdoses
with psilocybin.

39:50.021 --> 39:52.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not known to have a toxic
dose.

39:52.991 --> 39:55.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's considered safe
physiologically.

39:55.059 --> 39:59.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, psychologically, that's
where the potential
damage and danger is.

39:59.264 --> 40:04.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why these drugs, in
uncontrolled
settings, can create anxiety,
they can create

40:04.535 --> 40:06.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
paranoia, they can create
dangerous behavior.

40:06.871 --> 40:12.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Skeptics say the
studies are
relatively small, and it's
extremely difficult

40:12.310 --> 40:15.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to compare these drugs with a
placebo.

40:15.747 --> 40:20.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Concerns notwithstanding,
researchers across
the nation are tuning in and
turning on to

40:20.985 --> 40:28.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
psychedelics a few generations
after psychologist
Timothy Leary unintentionally
stigmatized

40:28.059 --> 40:29.794 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

40:29.827 --> 40:36.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the 1960s, Leary conducted a
series of
valid experiments with LSD and
psilocybin,

40:36.267 --> 40:42.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but as he devolved into an
infamous psychedelic
poster boy, the drugs escaped
the lab.

40:42.173 --> 40:46.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: The natural state of the
brain is chaos.

40:46.344 --> 40:51.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In 1970, the
federal government
made the drugs illegal, in the
same category

40:51.949 --> 40:53.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as heroin.

40:53.785 --> 40:58.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The mainstream medical community
tapped out,
even though there was a lot of
data suggesting

40:58.122 --> 41:01.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the drugs might help people with
certain mental
illnesses.

41:01.292 --> 41:07.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN ROSS: I was fascinated
that, how could
this have been such a big part
of a psychiatry

41:07.365 --> 41:10.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that I never heard about it,
completely
buried in my training?

41:10.134 --> 41:13.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that just made me really
curious to look
further into it.

41:13.204 --> 41:18.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Much remains a
mystery, but
advanced neuroimaging has
provided some new

41:18.443 --> 41:20.211 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
clues.

41:20.244 --> 41:25.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Psilocybin seems to quiet brain
areas known
as the default mode network,
essentially our

41:25.883 --> 41:27.518 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
autopilot mode.

41:27.552 --> 41:32.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this might help break the
chains of addiction,
or lift the fog of depression.

41:32.623 --> 41:36.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN ROSS: So it's plausible
that sort
of deactivating that network can
take someone

41:36.594 --> 41:39.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
away from a stuck pathologic
rhythm into something
else.

41:39.697 --> 41:45.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The Mithoefers
are working
on a similar hypothesis as they
study MDMA

41:45.570 --> 41:48.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and its effects on PTSD.

41:48.072 --> 41:51.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They too suspect the drug helps
break a cycle.

41:51.075 --> 41:52.877 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

41:52.910 --> 41:56.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MITHOEFER: We know that
people with
PTSD have increased activity in
the amygdala,

41:56.848 --> 42:00.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the fear center, and they have
decreased activity
in the prefrontal cortex.

42:00.852 --> 42:04.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The amygdala is
at the center
of our brain.

42:04.655 --> 42:10.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is what creates our emotional
reactions,
pleasant and unpleasant,
including sadness,

42:10.328 --> 42:12.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
anxiety and fear.

42:12.230 --> 42:17.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The prefrontal cortex, our
executive brain,
is where we temper those
emotions through

42:17.402 --> 42:19.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rational decision-making.

42:19.237 --> 42:27.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MDMA decreases activity in the
amygdala and
increases activity in the
prefrontal cortex.

42:27.678 --> 42:32.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it tamps down the negative
emotions in
the first place and also
increases the brain's

42:33.017 --> 42:36.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ability to keep those feelings
in check.

42:36.821 --> 42:42.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Researchers aren't sure whether
the drug works
by causing direct changes in
brain chemistry,

42:42.427 --> 42:45.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or simply by making trauma
easier to talk
about and process.

42:45.963 --> 42:47.832 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

42:47.865 --> 42:52.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MITHOEFER: What we see
in the sessions
is that it seems to kind of
bring people down

42:52.937 --> 43:01.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from being overwhelmed by
emotions, but also
kind of bring them up from being
numbed out

43:01.078 --> 43:03.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or disconnected from emotions.

43:03.448 --> 43:05.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's when the therapeutic
change happens.

43:05.983 --> 43:10.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: With both drugs,
doctors use
a similar approach.

43:10.855 --> 43:16.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dr. Ross showed me the room
where he and his
team conduct therapy Sessions
for subjects

43:16.527 --> 43:18.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
under the influence of
psilocybin.

43:18.362 --> 43:24.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN ROSS: We walk over to
them, give them
the pill, some water, they take
it, and then

43:24.869 --> 43:29.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they will essentially sit here
for about half-an-hour.

43:29.073 --> 43:33.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will turn the music on, the
pre-selected
music, give them some art books,
or they will

43:33.244 --> 43:35.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
meditate a little bit.

43:35.179 --> 43:38.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then after, about
half-an-hour, when they're
feeling something, we will
instruct them into

43:38.349 --> 43:39.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the default position.

43:39.617 --> 43:42.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lie down on your back, eye
shades, music.

43:42.587 --> 43:45.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the two therapists sit here
for many hours.

43:45.623 --> 43:50.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In December, Ross
and colleagues
published a paper on the impact
of psilocybin

43:50.928 --> 43:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for people with severe anxiety
or depression
due to a grave illness.

43:55.800 --> 44:01.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They found that a single dose of
psilocybin
reliably helped 60 percent to 80
percent of

44:01.339 --> 44:06.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them feel better immediately,
and for as long
as six months.

44:06.444 --> 44:08.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Researchers at Johns Hopkins
reported similar
results.

44:08.980 --> 44:14.385 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
ESTALYN WALCOFF,
Psychotherapist: My name
is Estalyn Walcoff and I work as
a psychotherapist.

44:14.418 --> 44:17.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Estalyn Walcoff
was a subject
in the NYU study.

44:17.722 --> 44:23.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ESTALYN WALCOFF: It was as if
this spirit
that I had hoped to connect to
was so much

44:23.828 --> 44:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bigger and stronger than I had
ever imagined.

44:28.599 --> 44:30.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was quaking in my boots.

44:30.234 --> 44:34.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Ross and
Mithoefer say it's
important to temper the
enthusiasm.

44:34.438 --> 44:36.073 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

44:36.107 --> 44:42.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MITHOEFER: This seems to
be a very
powerful tool, but it is only a
tool.

44:42.313 --> 44:48.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's the person's own
healing process
and their relationships, the
therapeutic relationships,

44:48.252 --> 44:50.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that support that that are very
important.

44:51.022 --> 44:54.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there is the danger of
people thinking
of it as a magic bullet.

44:54.325 --> 44:55.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEPHEN ROSS: We're following
the data.

44:56.027 --> 44:59.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't think that this is
going to cure
anything or change the world.

44:59.764 --> 45:04.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are focused on helping sick
people and
just doing more science and
following the

45:04.335 --> 45:05.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
data, seeing where it leads.

45:05.670 --> 45:09.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Both drugs may
soon be put
to a bigger test.

45:09.907 --> 45:15.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Researchers are asking the
government to approve
some major trials, with hundreds
of subjects,

45:15.646 --> 45:17.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some time this year.

45:17.648 --> 45:26.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Miles O'Brien, the "PBS
NewsHour," New York.

45:26.991 --> 45:34.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight:
remembering
a TV legend, Mary Tyler Moore.

45:34.832 --> 45:39.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And back to Jeffrey Brown, who
has our remembrance.

45:39.503 --> 45:49.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It was sitcom
television that
signaled and helped push larger
cultural change,

45:49.614 --> 45:55.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"The Mary Tyler Moore Show" in
the 1970s,
in which the actress played a
single, 30-something

45:55.686 --> 46:01.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
working woman, Mary Richards, a
TV producer
at a local Minneapolis station,
here with

46:01.726 --> 46:04.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
her boss, played by Ed Asner.

46:04.261 --> 46:06.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ED ASNER, Actor: You know what?

46:06.697 --> 46:08.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have got spunk.

46:08.299 --> 46:09.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:09.300 --> 46:10.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARY TYLER MOORE, Actress:
Well...

46:10.701 --> 46:12.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ED ASNER: I hate spunk.

46:12.703 --> 46:13.671 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:13.704 --> 46:15.473 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ED ASNER: I'll tell you what.

46:15.506 --> 46:18.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will try you out for a couple
of weeks and
see how it works out.

46:18.809 --> 46:22.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If I don't like you, I will fire
you.

46:22.113 --> 46:23.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARY TYLER MOORE: Right, right.

46:23.714 --> 46:26.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ED ASNER: If you don't like me,
I will fire
you.

46:26.350 --> 46:27.318 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:27.351 --> 46:28.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARY TYLER MOORE: That certainly
seems fair.

46:28.352 --> 46:30.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I will get a towel from the
kitchen.

46:30.121 --> 46:31.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In the '60s,
Moore had been
a beloved figure in a more
traditional role

46:31.922 --> 46:36.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for women, as the frazzled, but
often hilarious
wife of Dick Van Dyke on the
show bearing

46:36.894 --> 46:37.928 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his name.

46:37.962 --> 46:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARY TYLER MOORE: Snow White
lived.

46:41.799 --> 46:42.767 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:42.800 --> 46:47.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DICK VAN DYKE, Actor: Oh, what a
day.

46:47.538 --> 46:49.306 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:49.340 --> 46:55.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Over the years,
she won seven
Emmy Awards for her television
roles, and

46:55.613 --> 47:01.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an Oscar-nominated performance
in the 1980
film "Ordinary People," the
story of a disintegrating

47:01.952 --> 47:05.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
family following a son's death.

47:05.589 --> 47:10.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Moore wrote and spoke of her own
struggles,
a battle with alcoholism, and
with the diabetes

47:10.861 --> 47:13.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she lived with for some 40
years.

47:13.798 --> 47:16.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She was also a champion for
animal rights.

47:16.701 --> 47:21.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mary Tyler Moore was 80 years
old.

47:21.205 --> 47:25.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A short time ago, I spoke with
Dick Cavett.

47:25.676 --> 47:29.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He interviewed Mary Tyler Moore
a number of
times over the years, and was a
good friend.

47:29.547 --> 47:34.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I began by asking about her
talent as a comic
actor.

47:34.452 --> 47:39.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dick Cavett, thanks so much for
joining us.

47:39.190 --> 47:43.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, Mary Tyler Moore, the
comic performer,
what did she have?

47:43.494 --> 47:47.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DICK CAVETT, Entertainer: She
had it all.

47:47.131 --> 47:48.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She had everything.

47:48.666 --> 47:52.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she had more than many comic
performers.

47:52.803 --> 48:01.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We had that period of so many
wonderful what
used to be called comediennes,
Lucy and Carol

48:01.579 --> 48:02.580 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Mary.

48:02.613 --> 48:04.715 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mary was extremely beautiful.

48:04.749 --> 48:06.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that doesn't necessarily go
up to that
period of time with comediennes.

48:06.283 --> 48:08.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were either scrawny or had
bad hair or
looked funny.

48:08.052 --> 48:13.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to be a beauty and to be a
comedienne,
witty, and even, when required,
slapstick,

48:13.858 --> 48:15.993 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mary had it all.

48:16.026 --> 48:25.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once, a writer on the show said,
Mary is the
only person I have ever worked
with who made

48:25.970 --> 48:26.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
every script better.

48:26.971 --> 48:28.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I said, be specific.

48:28.773 --> 48:33.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said, all can I say is,
when we gave
Mary the script, we found laughs
in straight

48:33.210 --> 48:37.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lines that we didn't know were
there.

48:37.515 --> 48:42.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mary had the greatest laugh, the
gutsiest,
almost really bawdy laugh that
you rarely

48:42.520 --> 48:44.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saw her do on television, a
great sense of
humor.

48:44.789 --> 48:54.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Though we didn't have the term
glass ceilings,
she in fact came through one,
and made it

48:54.732 --> 48:59.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
better for a lot of other women
in television
by showing that she was somebody
who was -- a

48:59.503 --> 49:05.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
woman could pull, pull the
audience in a very
big way.

49:05.509 --> 49:09.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Dick
Cavett, thank
you very much for joining us.

49:09.847 --> 49:14.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for some more perspective on
Mary Tyler
Moore's influence, I'm joined
now by Cynthia

49:14.051 --> 49:15.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Littleton of "Variety."

49:15.619 --> 49:18.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She has written about Moore and
is the author
of two books about television.

49:18.589 --> 49:23.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, Cynthia, it's almost
hard to think
back to TV in those days, the
kinds of subjects

49:23.194 --> 49:26.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that were not discussed, the way
women were
not portrayed, or the way they
were portrayed.

49:26.664 --> 49:30.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In what ways did Mary Tyler
Moore and that
show change things?

49:30.100 --> 49:36.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CYNTHIA LITTLETON, "Variety":
Well, as you
said, the image of a strong,
independent woman

49:36.307 --> 49:42.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over 30 who wasn't necessarily
hunting for
a husband, but wanted to build a
career, that

49:42.279 --> 49:47.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was pretty revolutionary for
September of
1970, when the show premiered.

49:47.084 --> 49:50.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you think about what
was going on
in the country, you have the
stirrings of

49:50.921 --> 49:53.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the second wave of the modern
women's movement.

49:53.524 --> 49:55.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It really was quite a
confluence.

49:55.326 --> 50:00.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, what are
examples of some
things that she helped bring to
the fore in

50:00.564 --> 50:02.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the culture, in popular
entertainment?

50:02.499 --> 50:09.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CYNTHIA LITTLETON: I think the
show very famously
made references to her taking
birth control

50:09.373 --> 50:15.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bills, made references to her
spending the
night with dates, made a very
early reference

50:15.679 --> 50:22.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a character, a guest star
character being
gay as almost a matter-of-fact
aside.

50:22.052 --> 50:26.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those were -- those were
things done in
a show that didn't necessarily
wear its social

50:26.590 --> 50:32.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
consciousness on its sleeve, not
as much as
"All in the Family," but in
reflecting the

50:32.830 --> 50:37.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
state of the culture as it stood
in the early
'70s, just had profound impact.

50:37.868 --> 50:42.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And much of this,
of course,
through the very specific
persona of Mary

50:42.840 --> 50:44.808 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tyler Moore herself, right?

50:44.842 --> 50:50.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CYNTHIA LITTLETON: Mary
Richards, and I think
there was a continuum to the
character she

50:50.147 --> 50:51.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
played on "The Dick Van Dyke
Show."

50:51.882 --> 50:58.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Laura Petrie was not a mousy
sitcom wife,
but very independent, very, very
smart.

50:58.756 --> 51:01.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She famously wore capri pants
around the house.

51:01.825 --> 51:06.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She -- Laura Petrie was also --
I think Mary
Tyler Moore's career truly was a
continuum

51:07.031 --> 51:10.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of role models right -- that
were right for
the era.

51:10.200 --> 51:13.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, very
briefly, I mean,
obviously, there was impact in
spinoffs from

51:13.971 --> 51:19.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that program, but do you see the
impact and
legacy today in performers and
shows?

51:19.543 --> 51:25.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CYNTHIA LITTLETON: So many
workplace comedies
are always held up against the
standard that

51:25.149 --> 51:27.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"The Mary Tyler Moore Show" set.

51:27.117 --> 51:29.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Such as?

51:29.086 --> 51:36.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CYNTHIA LITTLETON: You know,
current shows
that try to have a workplace
setting, like,

51:36.093 --> 51:38.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you know, so many shows over the
years.

51:38.796 --> 51:45.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That ensemble of characters, it
was just a
murderers row of Betty White,
Cloris Leachman,

51:45.235 --> 51:47.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Valerie Harper, Ed Asner.

51:47.371 --> 51:49.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It really does still set the
standard.

51:49.673 --> 51:52.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
Cynthia Littleton
of "Variety," thank you very
much.

51:52.910 --> 51:58.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CYNTHIA LITTLETON: Thank you.

51:58.615 --> 52:11.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online right
now: Researchers predict that
the average

52:11.595 --> 52:16.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
monthly water bill will rise by
nearly $50
over the next five years.

52:17.001 --> 52:21.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That means that for one-third of
Americans,
water could become unaffordable.

52:21.705 --> 52:24.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can see which communities
are most at
risk.

52:24.875 --> 52:28.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's on our Web site,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:28.879 --> 52:34.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later tonight on PBS, Twin
Cities PBS presents
a film about one of the most
critical health

52:34.151 --> 52:36.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
crises to face the country.

52:36.487 --> 52:42.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Alzheimer's: Every Minute
Counts" illuminates
the mounting emotional and
financial costs

52:42.426 --> 52:46.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
associated with caring for those
afflicted
by the disease and it provides a
powerful

52:46.830 --> 52:51.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wakeup call that underscores the
pressing
need to come up with viable
solutions, and

52:51.869 --> 52:53.337 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
quickly.

52:53.370 --> 52:57.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Alzheimer's: Every Minute
Counts," it airs
tonight on most PBS stations.

52:57.775 --> 52:59.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

52:59.376 --> 53:00.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.
