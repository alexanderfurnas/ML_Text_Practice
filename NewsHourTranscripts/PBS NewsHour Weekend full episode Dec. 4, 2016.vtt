IT'S A PART -- IT'S PARTLY

04:01.100 --> 04:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:29.667 --> 04:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERMITTED FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE IN.

04:31.500 --> 04:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOTH THINGS THAT HAVE REPORTEDLY

04:34.500 --> 04:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COME OUT THAT THIS WAREHOUSE WAS

04:36.133 --> 04:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEING USED FOR.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

04:39.200 --> 04:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY TO BLAME.

04:40.400 --> 04:43.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WONDERING

04:43.167 --> 04:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO THESE OWNERS WERE AND WHO

04:45.200 --> 04:46.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS THROWING OFF THIS EVENT AND

04:46.567 --> 04:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE IN

04:47.933 --> 04:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A BUILDING SUCH AS THIS BUILDING

04:49.633 --> 04:50.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR A PARTY.

04:50.333 --> 04:51.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW I THINK SOMETHING THAT'S

04:51.567 --> 04:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPORTANT TO KNOW ABOUT OAKLAND

04:52.833 --> 04:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THAT THESE KINDS OF SPACES

04:55.233 --> 04:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE ACTUALLY PART OF WHAT GIVES

04:57.200 --> 04:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OAKLAND ITS CHARACTER.

04:58.633 --> 04:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN YOU SPEAK TO A LOT OF

04:59.833 --> 05:01.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE THEY SPEAK TO THESE

05:01.167 --> 05:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAREHOUSE PARTIES AND IT IS A

05:02.333 --> 05:03.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PART OF OAKLAND'S CULTURE.

05:03.867 --> 05:05.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THESE SPACES EXIST.

05:05.367 --> 05:07.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN MANY WAYS THESE SPACES

05:07.167 --> 05:08.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE PLACES WHERE PEOPLE WHO YOU

05:08.967 --> 05:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW FEEL LIKE THEY DON'T HAVE

05:10.733 --> 05:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANY OTHER OUTLET MAY BE ABLE TO

05:12.600 --> 05:14.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GO TO TO BE ENTERTAINED, TO HAVE

05:14.967 --> 05:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTIES LIKE THIS.

05:16.500 --> 05:17.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CERTAINLY THERE ARE QUESTIONS

05:17.867 --> 05:20.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RAISED ABOUT HOW MANY OF THESE

05:20.667 --> 05:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPACES EXIST AND HOW CLOSE OF AN

05:22.200 --> 05:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EYE THE CITY IS KEEPING ON THESE

05:23.533 --> 05:24.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPACES.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT'S GOING TO BE COMING

05:26.267 --> 05:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT IN THE NEXT DAYS, MONTHS,

05:28.300 --> 05:29.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES.

05:29.467 --> 05:30.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: AND ALSO THE ISSUE

05:30.567 --> 05:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF WHETHER THE PEOPLE ARE USING

05:34.700 --> 05:37.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SPACE FOR RESIDENCES OR

05:37.367 --> 05:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACES TO STAY FOR SHORT PERIODS

05:39.233 --> 05:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF TIME RIGHT?

05:40.233 --> 05:42.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> CERTAINLY WE HAVE HEARD

05:42.367 --> 05:43.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STORIES OF PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE

05:43.867 --> 05:45.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
