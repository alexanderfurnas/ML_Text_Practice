JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.733 --> 00:07.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.200 --> 00:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
an abrupt about-face.

00:09.833 --> 00:14.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
President Trump bans
transgender people from
serving in the military,
a surprise move drawing

00:16.033 --> 00:18.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
criticism from both
sides of the aisle.

00:18.333 --> 00:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then: Free from the reign of
ISIS, the Iraqi city of Mosul
grapples with a new battle,

00:24.900 --> 00:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as revenge killings push it
deeper into a cycle of violence.

00:28.766 --> 00:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM PORTEOUS, Deputy Program
Director, Human Rights Watch:
If you are continuing to commit

00:32.933 --> 00:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
abuses with impunity, then you
are simply sowing the seeds for
the reemergence of extremism

00:41.166 --> 00:43.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and radicalism in Iraq.

00:43.200 --> 00:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what
football does to the mind -- the
shocking results of a study that

00:49.333 --> 00:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
found brain damage in almost all
professional football players.

00:53.600 --> 00:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:56.066 --> 01:00.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:00.366 --> 01:05.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: From
President Trump today,
an abrupt announcement.

01:11.800 --> 01:16.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He is reinstating a ban
on transgender troops,
and reopening the debate
on who gets to serve

01:18.433 --> 01:20.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the U.S. military.

01:20.966 --> 01:25.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Word of the military policy
reversal came not from the
Pentagon, but from the president

01:27.133 --> 01:29.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on Twitter.

01:29.233 --> 01:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said: "The United States
government will not accept or
allow transgender individuals

01:34.400 --> 01:38.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to serve in any capacity
in the U.S. military."

01:38.133 --> 01:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he went on: "Our military
must be focused on victory,
and cannot be burdened with the

01:45.166 --> 01:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tremendous medical costs and
disruption that transgender
in the military would entail."

01:51.033 --> 01:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Candidate Trump had promised
to protect the rights
of transgender people.

01:54.800 --> 01:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
White House Press Secretary
Sarah Huckabee Sanders was
asked about that today.

01:58.766 --> 02:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, INCOMING
WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:
He's also voiced that this

02:00.833 --> 02:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a very expensive and
disruptive policy, and based on
consultation that he's had with

02:05.433 --> 02:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his national security team, came
to the conclusion that it erodes
military readiness and unit

02:11.600 --> 02:14.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cohesion, and made the
decision based on that.

02:14.600 --> 02:19.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Socially
conservative groups
welcomed the decision, but
it drew quick condemnation

02:21.366 --> 02:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from many Democrats,
including New York Congressman
Sean Patrick Maloney.

02:24.133 --> 02:26.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN PATRICK MALONEY (D), New
York: We have heard every tired
-- every tired discriminatory

02:28.266 --> 02:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
argument before, and they have
always fallen away over time in
the face of reason and decency

02:34.600 --> 02:36.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and equality.

02:36.666 --> 02:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Some leading
members of the president's own
party also rejected the new

02:40.266 --> 02:45.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ban, including Senators John
McCain and Orrin Hatch and Joni
Ernst, who served in the U.S.

02:47.166 --> 02:49.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
military in Iraq.

02:49.700 --> 02:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ASHTON CARTER, Former
U.S. Secretary Of Defense:
I'm announcing today
that we're ending the

02:51.233 --> 02:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ban on transgender Americans
in the United States military.

02:54.133 --> 02:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All of this
comes more than a year after the
Obama administration's secretary

03:01.066 --> 03:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of defense, Ashton Carter,
announced that transgender
people would be allowed to serve

03:04.966 --> 03:07.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
openly.

03:07.100 --> 03:11.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The RAND Cooperation
estimates there are up
to 6,600 transgender
troops on active duty,

03:13.133 --> 03:16.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with possibly another
4,000 in the Reserves.

03:16.466 --> 03:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Carter gave the armed services
until this month to adjust.

03:20.366 --> 03:25.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But his successor, James Mattis,
recently delayed implementation
by another six months.

03:27.366 --> 03:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Joint Chiefs of Staff said
they need to determine whether
transgender recruits have

03:33.600 --> 03:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
medical issues affecting
their ability to deploy and
meet physical standards.

03:39.233 --> 03:43.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Congresswoman
Vicky Hartzler of Missouri
has unsuccessfully
proposed legislation

03:44.700 --> 03:46.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to bar medical services
for transgender troops.

03:46.833 --> 03:48.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:48.933 --> 03:50.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VICKY HARTZLER (R), Missouri:
The bottom line is, do we need
to spend any of our precious

03:50.966 --> 03:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tax dollars on these surgeries,
when we have soldiers that are
having trouble getting body

03:56.700 --> 03:59.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
armor and bullets?

03:59.266 --> 04:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Brynn
Tannehill is a transgender
former Navy pilot, and
director for an advocacy

04:04.133 --> 04:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
group that fights for
transgender service members.

04:06.500 --> 04:07.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

04:07.500 --> 04:09.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
CMDR.

04:09.566 --> 04:11.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BRYNN TANNEHILL (RET.)
ÑMD-BOÑU.S. Navy:
What's extraordinarily
disruptive to unit

04:11.600 --> 04:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cohesion is taking people who
have unique, valuable skills
within their units, and yanking

04:16.166 --> 04:19.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
them out of those units,
ones that are often only
one deep in their units.

04:19.366 --> 04:20.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And you can't replace that.

04:20.833 --> 04:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what affects mission
and mission accomplishment.

04:23.533 --> 04:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The White
House indicated today
that the military will
take the lead on deciding

04:29.933 --> 04:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what becomes of transgender
people already serving.

04:33.033 --> 04:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our own William Brangham has
reported on transgender people
serving in the military.

04:37.633 --> 04:41.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He joins me now to
further explain today's
move by the president.

04:41.366 --> 04:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, William, first,
something about the term.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are talking about
people who are transgender.

04:45.900 --> 04:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The term transition or
transitioning is also used.

04:49.900 --> 04:51.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Help us understand
the distinction.

04:51.733 --> 04:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I understand
this can be confusing
for a lot of people.

04:54.033 --> 04:56.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Just basic facts.

04:56.133 --> 05:00.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
To be transgender just
means that your gender
identity doesn't match
your birth certificate.

05:01.666 --> 05:03.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, you're born as female, but
you do not feel you're female.

05:03.900 --> 05:05.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You feel like you're a male.

05:05.466 --> 05:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
To transition can mean a
whole spectrum of things.

05:08.933 --> 05:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It can mean -- it's not just
the surgery people tend to think
of, and certainly not every

05:12.933 --> 05:15.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
transgender person
has that surgery.

05:15.233 --> 05:16.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It can simply mean
taking hormones.

05:16.733 --> 05:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It can just mean changing your
clothes, changing your name.

05:20.600 --> 05:25.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, transitioning can be an
entire spectrum from things,
from medical technologies to

05:25.466 --> 05:27.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
just changing your
personality a little.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, we heard
the president - - the press
secretary at the White House,

05:30.466 --> 05:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sarah Sanders, citing the
president's concerns, and
he tweeted about this.

05:34.366 --> 05:38.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He says it's expensive,
the cost, the disruption.

05:38.433 --> 05:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She talked about
readiness, unit cohesion.

05:41.400 --> 05:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are those factors that the
Pentagon is concerned about?

05:44.700 --> 05:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As far as we
know, there's no good evidence
that the Pentagon has ever

05:48.833 --> 05:50.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been concerned about
those two things.

05:50.866 --> 05:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the issue of disruption,
the RAND study that you cited
in your report, they did a

05:55.133 --> 06:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
study that looked at whether or
not having trans service members
would cause this disruption.

06:02.200 --> 06:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they surveyed 18 different
countries around the world,
including the U.K., Australia,

06:07.366 --> 06:10.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Israel, all of whom have
trans service members,
and those countries
reported no disruptions

06:11.900 --> 06:14.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whatsoever, no need to
change their policies.

06:14.400 --> 06:19.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the issue of cost,
the president said
this is -- I think he's
implying that somehow this

06:19.066 --> 06:21.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is going to cost a
fortune for the budget.

06:21.200 --> 06:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, this RAND study
indicated that the rough costs
per year are about $2 million

06:25.833 --> 06:28.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to $8 million.

06:28.200 --> 06:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's not a lot in a $600
billion Pentagon budget.

06:31.233 --> 06:34.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And just for point of
comparison, let's say
those RAND numbers are
totally wrong and it's

06:34.266 --> 06:36.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
even more.

06:36.300 --> 06:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Pentagon right now spends
10 times that amount on Cialis
and Viagra, so just as a

06:42.400 --> 06:43.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
point of comparison.

06:43.633 --> 06:46.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Another
kind of medication.

06:46.366 --> 06:49.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
William, why is
this happening now?

06:49.033 --> 06:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there a sense out of the
blue the president tweeted
about this, this morning?

06:52.766 --> 06:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It did
seem to come out of the blue.

06:54.566 --> 06:57.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In fact, we reached out
to the Pentagon today
to ask them about that.

06:57.300 --> 07:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And an indication of how much
they were caught flat-footed
about this, they had nothing to

07:01.733 --> 07:03.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
say and referred us
back to the White House.

07:03.733 --> 07:06.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
My sense is that
there's two reasons.

07:06.533 --> 07:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One, ever since the Obama
administration introduced
this change, there have
been social conservatives,

07:12.966 --> 07:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mike Pence in particular, who
have been very resistant to it.

07:15.533 --> 07:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They think it's social
engineering of the worst kind.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The
vice president.

07:19.200 --> 07:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Exactly.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they have fought it.

07:22.233 --> 07:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, today, very specifically,
there was a fight in the
House amongst the GOP -- they

07:25.533 --> 07:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were trying to getting
a spending bill passed
with all sorts of goodies
that the president

07:29.333 --> 07:32.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wanted, including money
for his border wall.

07:32.566 --> 07:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some deficit and defense
hawks said we need to put in a
piece of legislation that bans

07:38.666 --> 07:41.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
transgender sex
reassignment surgery.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That was pushed back
on by the leadership.

07:43.566 --> 07:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, apparently, some of these
members went to the president
and said, help us out with

07:46.600 --> 07:48.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this policy.

07:48.633 --> 07:52.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he then went 10, 50 yards
further down the line and
announced this outright ban.

07:54.966 --> 07:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, again,
we see divisions inside the
Republican Party over this.

07:57.433 --> 07:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Exactly.

07:59.566 --> 08:02.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, finally,
William, what does this mean
for active-duty members now

08:02.466 --> 08:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are transgender,
whether they're serving in
this country or overseas?

08:05.433 --> 08:07.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's
the great unknown.

08:07.500 --> 08:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sarah Huckabee Sanders said,
we're working out the policy.

08:10.066 --> 08:12.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Pentagon has
no comment on this.

08:12.866 --> 08:17.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I talked to some people today
who are in touch with trans
service members right now, and

08:17.466 --> 08:22.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they said that there is an
incredible feeling of fear and
panic and just uncertainty, that

08:23.200 --> 08:24.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you have signed up.

08:24.433 --> 08:26.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You might be deployed
overseas right now.

08:26.533 --> 08:29.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of a sudden, you look at
your phone, the president has
tweeted that your position in

08:29.666 --> 08:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the military is over, so
big unanswered questions.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A number
of questions here.

08:35.466 --> 08:38.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham, we thank you.

08:38.500 --> 08:43.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in the day's other news: The
Supreme Court of South Carolina
ruled that same-sex couples

08:45.400 --> 08:48.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deserve the same protections
from domestic violence
as heterosexual couples.

08:50.100 --> 08:52.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The court said that the
state's existing law
is unconstitutional.

08:52.533 --> 08:55.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Several other states
have already changed
their laws on the issue.

08:55.633 --> 09:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Activists expressed hope
that today's decision
encourages more to do so.

09:02.633 --> 09:05.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. Senate voted down a
proposal today to repeal the
Affordable Care Act two years

09:07.000 --> 09:09.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from now, while it
works on a replacement.

09:09.333 --> 09:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was the latest sign that
it is going to be tougher to
win passage of a health care

09:13.166 --> 09:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reform bill than it was
just simply to get the votes
yesterday to begin debate.

09:17.500 --> 09:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will have a full report on
this after the news summary.

09:22.033 --> 09:26.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump took a new
verbal shot at U.S. Attorney
General Jeff Sessions today.

09:26.300 --> 09:31.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Twitter, he complained that
Sessions ought to fire acting
FBI Director Andrew McCabe

09:33.300 --> 09:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for allegedly being too close
to his fired predecessor, James
Comey, and to Hillary Clinton.

09:39.733 --> 09:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even so, White House Press
Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders
left open the possibility

09:45.900 --> 09:48.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that the president may
decide to keep Sessions.

09:48.433 --> 09:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS:
He's obviously disappointed,
but also wants the attorney
general to continue

09:52.900 --> 09:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to focus on the things
the attorney general does.

09:56.633 --> 10:00.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, you can be disappointed
in someone, but still want
them to continue to do their

10:00.066 --> 10:02.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
job.

10:02.066 --> 10:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the past week,
the president has subjected
Sessions to daily hectoring

10:05.633 --> 10:08.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for recusing himself
in the Russia probe.

10:08.633 --> 10:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But at a rally last night, Mr.
Trump rejected criticism of his
own behavior, saying -- quote

10:15.666 --> 10:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - "It is so easy to act
presidential, but that's
not going to get it done."

10:20.666 --> 10:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Afghanistan, Taliban gunmen
killed at least 26 Afghan
soldiers today after storming an

10:26.066 --> 10:28.433 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
army base in the
country's south.

10:28.433 --> 10:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The attack took place near
Kandahar, Afghanistan's
second largest city.

10:33.200 --> 10:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It came as the Taliban
has made significant
gains across the country.

10:37.833 --> 10:42.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Back in this country,
a bit of good news:
Republican Congressman
Steve Scalise has been

10:42.700 --> 10:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
released from a Washington
hospital after being shot and
critically wounded last month.

10:49.633 --> 10:52.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He will now begin what
the hospital called
intensive rehabilitation.

10:52.800 --> 10:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Louisiana lawmaker was one
of four people shot by a gunman
during a baseball practice.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He has had several surgeries.

11:00.933 --> 11:05.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Federal Reserve is
keeping its standard
interest rate unchanged.

11:05.233 --> 11:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Central Bank today cited
solid job gains, but noted that
inflation remains below the

11:11.033 --> 11:12.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
target level.

11:12.466 --> 11:17.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Fed officials already raised
rates twice this year.

11:17.133 --> 11:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump today
announced that the
Taiwan-based Foxconn will
build a $10 billion plant in

11:23.333 --> 11:27.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Wisconsin to make liquid
crystal display panels.

11:27.033 --> 11:30.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It could mean 3,000
jobs, if it's built.

11:30.700 --> 11:35.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Foxconn has not always
followed through on new
projects in the U.S.

11:35.400 --> 11:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial average gained
97 points to close at 21711.

11:41.966 --> 11:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 10, and the
S&amp;P 500 was up a fraction.

11:46.166 --> 11:51.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what's next after another failed
health care vote; President

11:53.200 --> 11:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump signals he will pull
out of the Iran nuclear deal;
revenge killings in Iraq, the

11:58.800 --> 12:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
aftermath of the fight
against ISIS; and much more.

12:13.133 --> 12:17.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans faced another
challenge today in their efforts
to dismantle the Affordable

12:17.566 --> 12:18.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Care Act.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins has more.

12:20.166 --> 12:21.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader: This
certainly won't be easy.

12:23.100 --> 12:25.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hardly anything in
this process has been.

12:25.333 --> 12:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The whirlwind
process ticked on in the Senate
today, but Republicans found

12:30.333 --> 12:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
themselves no closer to passing
a plan to repeal or replace
the Affordable Care Act.

12:36.933 --> 12:40.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Two key GOP ideas failed
by significant margins
in the past 24 hours.

12:43.900 --> 12:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, last night, nine
Republicans voted against the
latest Senate plan, including

12:51.233 --> 12:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Ted Cruz's proposal
plan to allow insurance plans
with almost no regulations.

12:58.333 --> 13:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then today came an idea backed
by conservatives like Kentucky
senator Rand Paul, a straight

13:03.933 --> 13:05.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
repeal in two years with
no replacement attached.

13:05.866 --> 13:10.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Paul said Obamacare's
relations mean options
are far too limited.

13:10.300 --> 13:12.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAND PAUL (R), Kentucky: Do you
think that the -- that every
American should get to choose,

13:14.833 --> 13:18.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that every American gets
to choose whether they have
insurance or not, and what kind

13:18.600 --> 13:20.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of insurance they have?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is what it's about.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a freedom of choice.

13:22.466 --> 13:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But his
straight repeal lost 45-55.

13:28.400 --> 13:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Seven Republican senators
rejected the idea.

13:31.866 --> 13:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican leaders
instead focused on a
longer game, reminding
their party of its pledge

13:36.633 --> 13:37.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to repeal Obamacare.

13:37.666 --> 13:39.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:39.633 --> 13:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN THUNE (R), South
Dakota: We made a commitment
to the American people.

13:41.800 --> 13:44.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's time to make
good on that promise.

13:44.233 --> 13:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And it now
appears the Senate GOP's best
shot at a bill is what's known

13:51.066 --> 13:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as skinny repeal, repealing
the individual mandate,
and not much else.

13:54.166 --> 13:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is expected to be one of
the last votes this week, and
so begins the jockeying for

13:58.833 --> 14:00.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what goes in it.

14:00.833 --> 14:04.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
South Carolina Lindsey Graham
wants more block grants
for states in the plan.

14:04.400 --> 14:06.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:06.500 --> 14:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South
Carolina: And if it can't do
that, I'm not voting for it.

14:09.500 --> 14:14.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: All this a
day after the Senate barely
voted to begin debate.

14:14.266 --> 14:19.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, President Trump singled
out Alaska's Lisa Murkowski
for her vote against starting

14:19.266 --> 14:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debate yesterday, tweeting that
she "really let the Republicans
and our country down yesterday.

14:25.133 --> 14:27.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Too bad."

14:27.266 --> 14:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Murkowski defended her vote
to The Alaska Dispatch News,
saying, "I didn't think that

14:31.433 --> 14:36.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we were ready for the
debate, and I have said
pretty consistently
that process really does

14:36.366 --> 14:38.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
matter."

14:38.466 --> 14:42.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As it does to Democrats, like
Oregon's Ron Wyden, calling
for fixes, rather than repeal

14:42.966 --> 14:43.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for Obamacare.

14:43.933 --> 14:45.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:45.900 --> 14:47.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RON WYDEN (D), Oregon: We
all agree that the Affordable
Care Act is not perfect.

14:47.966 --> 14:52.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to take steps
immediately to stabilize the
private insurance market.

14:54.900 --> 14:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The clock is
now ticking on the 20 hours
of debate required for any

15:00.166 --> 15:02.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bill.

15:02.766 --> 15:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After that, any amendments
not already passed can
be tacked on in a process
known as vote-a-rama.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Senate Republican
Whip John Cornyn:

15:08.433 --> 15:10.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:10.400 --> 15:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN CORNYN (R), Texas: We will
conclude one way or another
on either late Thursday or

15:13.033 --> 15:15.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Friday morning.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That means
the Senate, and Americans
watching, have two days to weigh

15:18.600 --> 15:22.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in on this critical draft about
the future of health care.

15:22.566 --> 15:26.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Lisa Desjardins.

15:26.700 --> 15:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It has been just
over two years since the Iran
nuclear agreement was signed

15:41.133 --> 15:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
under the Obama administration.

15:43.333 --> 15:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But President Trump may very
well be on the way toward
pulling the United States out of

15:48.933 --> 15:49.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the deal.

15:49.733 --> 15:51.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has that.

15:51.766 --> 15:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Candidate Donald
Trump ran against the agreement,
but President Trump has twice

15:55.300 --> 16:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
followed the State Department's
advice, and certified that
Iran is complying with it.

16:00.166 --> 16:04.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But now, in a Wall Street
Journal interview published
today, Mr. Trump indicates he's

16:04.100 --> 16:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
willing to overrule the State
Department when the next
certification is due in October.

16:11.066 --> 16:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: We have given
them the benefit of every doubt.

16:15.500 --> 16:16.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're doing very
detailed studies.

16:16.966 --> 16:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, personally, I have
great respect for my people.

16:18.933 --> 16:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it was up to me,
I would have had them
noncompliant 180 days ago.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
QUESTION: Do you expect
them to be declared
noncompliant next time?

16:22.066 --> 16:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Personally, I do.

16:23.733 --> 16:27.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: What would it
mean if Mr. Trump said
Iran is not complying?

16:27.033 --> 16:28.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's at stake here?

16:28.533 --> 16:29.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We get two views.

16:29.833 --> 16:32.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
First, Rob Malley is
here in the studio.

16:32.133 --> 16:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As special assistant to
President Obama, he was the lead
senior White House negotiator

16:37.866 --> 16:39.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the agreement.

16:39.366 --> 16:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is now a vice president of
the International Crisis Group.

16:42.533 --> 16:44.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And joining us from
Toronto is Mark Dubowitz.

16:44.666 --> 16:49.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He is chief executive
of the Foundation for
Defense of Democracies,
a Washington, D.C.-based

16:50.000 --> 16:51.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
think tank.

16:51.533 --> 16:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has been advising the Trump
administration on Iran policy.

16:53.433 --> 16:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Rob, let me start with you.

16:55.833 --> 16:58.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What's your response to
what the president said?

16:58.700 --> 17:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I should point out that, in that
interview, he went on to say
that he thinks Iran is taking

17:03.700 --> 17:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
advantage of this country.

17:06.233 --> 17:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said: "They have taken
advantage of a president
named Barack Obama who
didn't know what the

17:10.333 --> 17:12.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hell he was doing."

17:12.333 --> 17:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT MALLEY, Middle East
Program Director, International
Crisis Group: I'll respond to

17:13.600 --> 17:15.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that, but let's get
the facts straight.

17:15.566 --> 17:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have now, since President
Trump has been in office, twice,
they -- the administration

17:21.000 --> 17:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
certified that Iran was
in compliance of the deal.

17:24.066 --> 17:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Twice, the administration waived
the sanctions, which is a way
of indicating that it's mutually

17:30.066 --> 17:32.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
reciprocal.

17:32.166 --> 17:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the administration's
response to the fact that Iran
is doing its share, we do our

17:35.533 --> 17:37.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
share.

17:37.933 --> 17:40.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Twice, the agency, the
international agency
that's responsible for
deciding whether -- decides

17:40.866 --> 17:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on compliance -- whether Iran is
in compliance with its nuclear
restrictions, the International

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Atomic Energy Agency, twice
since Trump has been in office,
it has said that Iran is living

17:50.600 --> 17:52.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up to its deal.

17:52.733 --> 17:56.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, twice, the joint
commission, which is a
commission formed by all
of the member countries

17:56.000 --> 18:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that negotiated the deal,
including the United
States, twice, including
recently, they have

18:00.833 --> 18:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
said that Iran is in compliance.

18:02.933 --> 18:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So maybe the president has
information that he hasn't
shared with anyone else.

18:05.433 --> 18:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, at this point, it's clear
that for almost every objective
observer, every objective

18:09.633 --> 18:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
observer -- the subjective
observers may have another view
-- but every objective observer

18:13.566 --> 18:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has said Iran is in compliance.

18:15.600 --> 18:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I don't know where he
comes up with saying that he
knows, but others don't know.

18:20.200 --> 18:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even his Cabinet disagrees,
apparently, but he knows that
Iran is not in compliance.

18:23.300 --> 18:28.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, that really would
be breaking our own
obligations under the
deal, but also breaking

18:29.766 --> 18:31.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with our allies, which would put
us in a very difficult position.

18:31.300 --> 18:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mark Dubowitz, you
are advising the administration.

18:35.100 --> 18:39.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I presume you wouldn't want
to talk about that advice,
make that advice public.

18:39.300 --> 18:43.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But what should the
president should do?

18:43.000 --> 18:46.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you think the
president should do when this
next certification comes up?

18:46.900 --> 18:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK DUBOWITZ, Foundation for
the Defense of Democracies:
So, the president should make

18:50.233 --> 18:53.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it very clear that Iran is not
in compliance with the deal.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's been very clear.

18:55.800 --> 18:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Secretary Tillerson's letter
to Congress again made it very
clear that there are incremental

18:59.400 --> 19:01.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
violations of the deal.

19:01.500 --> 19:06.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president actually didn't
certify that Iran is in full
compliance with the deal.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He merely said that Iran
meets certain conditions
that were laid by Congress,
which didn't require

19:10.633 --> 19:12.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
full compliance.

19:12.633 --> 19:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, my advice to the president
would be state the facts,
which is, Iran is incrementally

19:16.400 --> 19:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
violating the deal, but unless
there's a material breach of the
JCPOA, the nuclear deal, don't

19:23.700 --> 19:26.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go to the joint commission,
don't snap back the
U.N. sanctions, but
use that noncompliance

19:26.466 --> 19:31.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a predicate to roll out
a much more comprehensive
Iran policy that deals
with all forms of Iranian

19:33.433 --> 19:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
malign behavior, not only
nuclear misbehavior, but Iran's
malign behavior across multiple

19:39.366 --> 19:41.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fronts.

19:41.433 --> 19:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a full, comprehensive
policy, and it gets us away
from this myopic focus on the

19:44.633 --> 19:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nuclear deal, which I think
paralyzed U.S.-Iran policy
under President Obama.

19:49.200 --> 19:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Rob Malley, myopic
focus on the nuclear deal?

19:53.366 --> 19:58.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or should there be consideration
of things, a broader
consideration, as he says?

20:00.333 --> 20:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROB MALLEY: There should,
there has been, and there
will continue to be.

20:02.400 --> 20:05.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, what the Obama
administration, what
President Obama did was
take one issue, which

20:05.866 --> 20:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was a critical issue, not only
our national security experts,
but Israeli and other experts

20:10.400 --> 20:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said, if Iran were to rush
to a bomb, we would be in
a very difficult situation.

20:14.933 --> 20:16.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let's look at the
case of North Korea.

20:16.366 --> 20:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We wouldn't want to see a North
Korea in the Persian Gulf.

20:19.833 --> 20:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that was a priority at
that point wasn't not to
give up on the other issues.

20:24.800 --> 20:28.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Let's at least make sure
that Iran is not in a
position to get a bomb.

20:28.400 --> 20:31.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At the same time, let's
push back on their
regional activities,
let's see what we can

20:31.333 --> 20:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do about their ballistic
missiles, but the deal itself --
and deliberately -- was about

20:35.900 --> 20:36.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this issue.

20:36.900 --> 20:38.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It wasn't a case of myopia.

20:38.766 --> 20:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was a case of, we're
going to deal with the issue.

20:40.833 --> 20:42.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We solved it, at least
for the time being.

20:42.933 --> 20:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And let's work on the other
issues at the same time.

20:44.900 --> 20:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is nothing in the nuclear
deal that would prevent us
from taking action against

20:48.400 --> 20:52.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iran if it engaged in
terrorism, ballistic missiles,
human rights violations.

20:52.966 --> 20:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question at the heart
of what the president
said is whether we are
going to continue to

20:56.266 --> 21:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
honor our part of the deal,
to make sure that Iran also
honors its part and doesn't rush

21:02.866 --> 21:05.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to a nuclear bomb, so
that we don't have what
we now in North Korea.

21:05.300 --> 21:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
North Korea, we have a country
that has a nuclear bomb,
and we have no visibility on

21:08.733 --> 21:10.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what they're doing.

21:10.700 --> 21:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Iran, we have a country that
doesn't have a nuclear bomb,
and we have almost maximum

21:13.400 --> 21:17.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
visibility as a result of
the deal in every aspect
of their nuclear program.

21:17.133 --> 21:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mark Dubowitz,
what about that, the idea that
it's better to know what is

21:21.033 --> 21:25.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
going on, to work within
this agreement and know
what Iran is doing?

21:25.166 --> 21:30.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK DUBOWITZ: Well, I'm glad
Rob brought up the fatally
flawed North Korea nuclear

21:32.166 --> 21:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agreement, because the
Iran nuclear agreement is
similarly fatally flawed.

21:34.633 --> 21:39.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It contains within it
sunset provisions, where
the restrictions of
Iran's nuclear program

21:39.300 --> 21:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually go away over time, and
Iran can emerge, by actually
faithfully complying with the

21:44.033 --> 21:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deal, with an industrial sized
nuclear program, with near zero
nuclear breakout capability,

21:51.533 --> 21:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a much easier covert
sneak-out capability
with an ICBM, with a
powerful economy fortified

21:56.700 --> 21:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against our ability to
use sanctions, and with
increased regional hegemony.

21:59.233 --> 22:01.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, Rob is right.

22:01.333 --> 22:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The deal temporarily pushed the
Iranians further in terms of
breakout, but over the medium

22:08.466 --> 22:11.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
term, Iran is going to emerge
with everything it wants by
faithfully complying with the

22:11.766 --> 22:13.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
deal.

22:13.766 --> 22:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we don't want another
fatally flawed nuclear agreement
like we had with North Korea.

22:16.400 --> 22:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What we need to start dealing
with is this flawed agreement.

22:19.566 --> 22:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the president has
already made it very clear that
he thinks this is a terrible

22:24.366 --> 22:26.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
deal, he thinks it's
a fatally flawed deal.

22:26.566 --> 22:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think my advice to him
is don't certify compliance
and begin to lay the predicate

22:33.466 --> 22:36.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a massive pressure campaign
and get the Iranians back
to the table to negotiate a

22:36.866 --> 22:41.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nuclear deal number two that
addresses some of these fatally
flawed elements of the deal,

22:43.733 --> 22:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, by the way, give us
inspection rights into military
sites, which, right now, we

22:46.233 --> 22:50.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have in theory, but, in
practice, the Iranians
aren't letting us into
their military sites,

22:50.233 --> 22:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where they're likely to engage
in nuclear weaponization
activities like they have in

22:54.000 --> 22:56.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the past.

22:56.066 --> 22:58.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we better rectify this
fatally flawed deal, or the
Iranians are going to a nuke,

22:58.866 --> 23:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ICBMs, and they're going to have
the ability to dominate like
nothing we have seen before.

23:03.833 --> 23:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Rob Malley, what
would be the consequences?

23:05.633 --> 23:07.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is at stake here?

23:07.766 --> 23:11.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What would be the consequences
if the president did say Iran
is not living up to this deal?

23:11.700 --> 23:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROB MALLEY: Well, first, I
have to say, I'm a little bit
confused about argument that

23:14.566 --> 23:16.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mark was making.

23:16.566 --> 23:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is the argument that the deal is
fatally flawed and, therefore,
we shouldn't accept it, we

23:19.133 --> 23:22.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
should walk away, we
should renegotiate it,
which would be one path?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Very dangerous.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I won't get into that.

23:25.066 --> 23:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or is his view, the deal is
OK for now, but in 12, 13, 14,
15 years, as some provisions

23:31.100 --> 23:34.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are going to expire, and
so we should think of
whether we can negotiate
what happens afterwards,

23:34.466 --> 23:36.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
but in which case we're
going to give something
to Iranians in return.

23:36.600 --> 23:39.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nobody is going to -- the
Iranians are not going to accept
to negotiate more restrictions

23:39.600 --> 23:40.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in exchange for nothing.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I think we need to clarify.

23:42.600 --> 23:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, we're in a much
better position than we were at
the time President Obama took

23:46.766 --> 23:49.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
office, because we have
these restrictions.

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And according to every
inspection that has been done,
every report by the IAEA, Iran

23:54.833 --> 23:56.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is in compliance.

23:56.900 --> 23:59.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, if tomorrow, the president
were to decide to announce
that Iran is not in compliance,

23:59.066 --> 24:03.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first of all, I think we
would have a little bit of
deja vu in terms of Iraq.

24:03.066 --> 24:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think most people in the
international community
would believe that
we're just fabricating

24:07.200 --> 24:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
evidence, because we
haven't shared it, because,
right now, we're the only
ones who are claiming

24:10.900 --> 24:13.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that Iran is not in --
or we would be the only
ones claiming that.

24:13.900 --> 24:15.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That would not put us
in a strong position.

24:15.933 --> 24:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we were to do that, and
that is it, and continue to
honor the deal, it would be a

24:19.933 --> 24:21.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hiccup.

24:21.966 --> 24:24.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would once again signal
to the world that we have a
rather erratic administration.

24:24.633 --> 24:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he were then to impose
sanctions, to reimpose
the sanctions that were
lifted, reimpose sanctions

24:28.900 --> 24:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on Iran's nuclear program,
then we would be in breach.

24:31.900 --> 24:36.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And either Iran would itself
say we're not only bound by
our own commitments, and we

24:38.800 --> 24:43.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a possibility of Iran
trying to acquire a nuclear
bomb, or we would be isolated in

24:43.366 --> 24:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the international
community, because the
Europeans, the Russians,
the Chinese, everyone would

24:46.333 --> 24:47.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
say, it's on you.

24:47.733 --> 24:48.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not on Iran.

24:48.733 --> 24:50.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why would we want that?

24:50.233 --> 24:52.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mark Dubowitz, let
me -- I want you to respond.

24:52.633 --> 24:54.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What would happen?

24:54.600 --> 24:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What practically would
happen if the president
said they weren't complying?

24:59.800 --> 25:01.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And then what should
the next step be?

25:01.933 --> 25:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK DUBOWITZ: Well, actually,
practically speaking, what
Rob's not telling you is that,

25:04.833 --> 25:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if the president says they're
not complying, but he doesn't
say that they're in material

25:08.500 --> 25:11.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
breach, then actually
nothing happens.

25:11.233 --> 25:12.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Then we don't go to
the joint commission.

25:12.966 --> 25:15.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We don't snap back U.N.
and U.S. sanctions.

25:15.400 --> 25:18.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We merely say Iran is engaging
in incremental violations.

25:18.766 --> 25:23.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we know that the Iranians
violate incrementally,
not egregiously, even
though, over time, the

25:23.266 --> 25:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sum total of the incremental
violations is always egregious.

25:26.700 --> 25:31.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What Rob's not telling
you is that he knows and
we know that the Iranians
have been incrementally

25:31.066 --> 25:32.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
violating this deal.

25:32.333 --> 25:34.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have exceeded
heavy water caps.

25:34.300 --> 25:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Heavy water is the
essential ingredient you
need for a plutonium bomb.

25:38.533 --> 25:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're testing more advanced
centrifuges than they are
permitted under the nuclear

25:41.833 --> 25:43.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agreement.

25:43.800 --> 25:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have been illicitly
procuring nuclear and ballistic
missile technology in Germany,

25:46.700 --> 25:49.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
according to German
intelligence services.

25:49.333 --> 25:51.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they have exceeded
their enrichment cap.

25:51.100 --> 25:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, the fact of the matter
is, there are violations.

25:53.233 --> 25:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're not material breaches.

25:54.766 --> 25:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're incremental violations.

25:56.733 --> 26:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president should state
that, certify that, and say
Iran is not in full compliance.

26:00.433 --> 26:03.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, the second step is to say
whether it's a material breach.

26:03.800 --> 26:04.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it's.

26:04.800 --> 26:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not a material breach.

26:06.333 --> 26:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he should move ahead with
the maximum pressure campaign.

26:07.800 --> 26:08.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Mark
Dubowitz, I'm sorry.

26:08.966 --> 26:10.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're out of time.

26:10.500 --> 26:11.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mark Dubowitz, Rob Malley, we're
going to have to leave it there.

26:11.766 --> 26:12.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you, gentlemen.

26:12.766 --> 26:14.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROB MALLEY: Thank you.

26:14.500 --> 26:19.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK DUBOWITZ: Thanks so much.

Coming up on the "NewsHour":
the former government
ethics director who
resigned after clashing

26:30.100 --> 26:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the Trump administration;
striking new findings linking
brain injury directly to

26:35.266 --> 26:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
football; and a profile of
Trump supporters living in a
place known for being liberal.

26:41.466 --> 26:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The battle to retake Mosul
from ISIS is nearing its end.

26:45.433 --> 26:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And yet a new deadly campaign is
under way by some Iraqi forces
of revenge and retribution

26:51.833 --> 26:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against those suspected to
have fought for or aided ISIS.

26:55.966 --> 27:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From Northern Iraq, special
correspondent Marcia Biggs and

And a warning: Images and
accounts in this story
may disturb some viewers.

27:06.733 --> 27:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: It starts at dawn
here in West Mosul, members
of Iraqi special forces going

27:13.100 --> 27:17.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
door to door in search
of ISIS sleeper cells.

27:17.300 --> 27:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clashes continue in a small
pocket of the Old City, but for
most of Mosul, this is where

27:23.166 --> 27:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the fight against ISIS stands.

27:25.866 --> 27:29.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In some houses, we find the
remnants of life under ISIS.

27:29.466 --> 27:34.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This was a Da'esh
prison, he says.

27:35.866 --> 27:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So this was once the home
of a local politician.

27:37.400 --> 27:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When ISIS took the area, they
turned his house into a jail.

27:40.233 --> 27:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISIS imprisoned anyone
who didn't pledge loyalty
to them, who didn't
join them and stick to

27:45.000 --> 27:47.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their rules, this
lieutenant says.

27:47.266 --> 27:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They considered them outlaws.

27:50.533 --> 27:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After several hours searching,
they come across this man, who
they believe may have escaped

27:55.266 --> 27:57.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the current clashes
in the Old City.

27:57.633 --> 27:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He is arrested immediately.

27:59.966 --> 28:02.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do you believe he
is an ISIS fighter?

28:02.400 --> 28:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
I think he is.

28:06.800 --> 28:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He is not from this area.

28:08.300 --> 28:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
No one has ever seen here.

28:10.100 --> 28:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
People here don't know him.

28:11.333 --> 28:13.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He is very thin, and
the I.D. card is fake.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, probably he is ISIS.

28:15.600 --> 28:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
For no reason, the militias
took my son five months ago.

28:33.133 --> 28:34.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We don't know where.

28:34.133 --> 28:35.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We are not ISIS.

28:35.633 --> 28:37.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My son is a shepherd.

28:37.166 --> 28:39.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If we were ISIS, you
could come and kill me.

28:39.333 --> 28:44.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Ask anyone here.

MARCIA BIGGS: Just last week,
this photo emerged of suspected
ISIS fighters rounded up and

29:25.066 --> 29:30.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
held in a small dark room in
the 120-degree heat, an eye for
an eye, as the captors become

29:31.900 --> 29:33.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
captive.

29:33.833 --> 29:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dr. Mansour Maarouf Mansour
was working in Qayyarah General
Hospital when this video

29:39.366 --> 29:41.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was taken last spring.

29:41.333 --> 29:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The hospital was inundated
with unidentified bodies
coming down the Tigris River.

29:45.900 --> 29:48.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The morgue could barely
handle the grim deluge.

29:48.633 --> 29:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A local resident described the
what he saw at the riverbank.

29:51.833 --> 29:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
They had their hands
tied behind their backs.

29:55.200 --> 29:57.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They were blindfolded
and shot in the head.

29:57.366 --> 29:58.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They were floating
down the river.

29:58.866 --> 30:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: And just last
week, even more bodies.

30:02.800 --> 30:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You received a lot of bodies
that looked to have been the
victims of execution, is that

30:06.866 --> 30:07.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right?

30:07.866 --> 30:09.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Yes.

30:09.400 --> 30:10.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

Yes, most of them were killed
by shooting to the head.

30:14.633 --> 30:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's very little in compared
to those who were killed by
the liberation process, through

30:21.233 --> 30:25.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the mines, land mines,
or the bombs, mortar
bombs, or airstrike.

30:27.000 --> 30:31.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARCIA BIGGS: The number
of civilian casualties
has been staggering.

30:33.133 --> 30:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Former Kurdish Deputy Prime
Minister Hoshyar Zebari says
at least 40,000 dead, many of

30:38.333 --> 30:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them at the hands of coalition
airstrikes, which include both
Iraqi and American firepower.

30:44.533 --> 30:49.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As residents return
home to a Mosul depleted
of ISIS fighters, the
new campaign may be

30:49.433 --> 30:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of collective
punishment against possible
ISIS sympathizers.

30:56.533 --> 30:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We traveled to a village just
south of the city, where many
of the residents collaborated

30:59.833 --> 31:01.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with ISIS.

31:01.933 --> 31:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had heard reports of
so-called revenge death squads
coming for them in the dead of

31:06.833 --> 31:08.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
night.

He was later killed
in an airstrike.

UM NAZIM, Iraq (through
translator): They told us, if
your sons and husbands do not

31:23.833 --> 31:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
declare loyalty, we will bring
back the religious police
and we will behead them.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was an old man when we were
threatened, so he was scared.

31:30.666 --> 31:33.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

MARCIA BIGGS: Since the
liberation of her town
from ISIS, she says
local militias have

31:42.266 --> 31:45.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
threatened her, demanding
that she leave, even shooting
up and raiding her home.

UM NAZIM (through translator):
We have lost our minds.

31:49.033 --> 31:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every night when we sleep,
we don't know if we will
be alive in the morning.

31:52.333 --> 31:54.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is our life?

31:54.433 --> 31:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were all throwing their
clothes in bags, but we
didn't know where to go.

31:57.533 --> 32:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't have money to
leave or even to rent a car.

32:00.733 --> 32:03.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't know what
to do, where to go.

32:03.466 --> 32:05.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I was pacing back and
forth in the front yard.

32:05.600 --> 32:07.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I told them, kill me.

32:07.700 --> 32:09.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's better than this.

32:09.200 --> 32:11.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Come on and kill me
and end my suffering.

32:22.600 --> 32:24.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We lead humans.

32:24.233 --> 32:29.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I mean, our soldiers,
our police, they are
human, not eagles.

32:31.100 --> 32:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maybe someone make some bad
thing, but the majority, the

32:40.666 --> 32:42.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
good with the people.

TOM PORTEOUS, Deputy Program
Director, Human Rights Watch:
The Iraqi government sometimes

33:25.933 --> 33:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
responds to our reports and
our advocacy by making the
right sort of noises and making

33:34.733 --> 33:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the right kinds of statements,
but it's never followed up with
a proper procedure to secure

33:41.033 --> 33:43.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
accountability for the
abuses that we document.

33:43.833 --> 33:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can win the war militarily
against the Islamic State,
but if you are continuing to

33:51.766 --> 33:56.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
commit abuses with impunity,
then you are simply sowing
the seeds for the reemergence

33:58.900 --> 34:01.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of extremism and
radicalism in Iraq.

MARCIA BIGGS: Like many Sunni
Arabs that lived under ISIS, Um
Nazim feels she is under siege

34:08.766 --> 34:12.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the Shia-dominated government
and militias that fought and
won the battle against ISIS.

34:13.400 --> 34:15.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do you hope that
ISIS will come back?

34:15.866 --> 34:20.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
UM NAZIM (through translator):
I don't hope that ISIS will
come back, but there was peace

34:20.400 --> 34:23.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and no one interfered in
the life of anyone else.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No one oppressed anyone.

34:24.166 --> 34:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The situation was calmer.

34:26.200 --> 34:29.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: For you, but
for those who weren't part of
ISIS, they were very scared.

34:29.300 --> 34:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UM NAZIM (through translator):
No, no one in Iraq was scared.

34:32.833 --> 34:37.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everybody was living in peace
under ISIS, not just us, because
my husband was with ISIS.

34:37.666 --> 34:40.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARCIA BIGGS: But
how can you say that?

34:40.300 --> 34:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have heard so many stories
of people who were killed,
people who were repressed, who

34:46.600 --> 34:48.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
couldn't go to school?

34:48.000 --> 34:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UM NAZIM (through
translator): I don't know.

34:49.333 --> 34:51.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I didn't go out.

34:51.033 --> 34:52.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I didn't see anything.

34:52.400 --> 34:55.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm only responsible for
myself, not for others.

34:55.433 --> 34:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I didn't see anyone kill
anyone else in front of me.

34:58.533 --> 35:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I heard people say that
others were killed, but
who knows who killed them.

MARCIA BIGGS: What do you say
to the children whose parents
were killed by ISIS suicide

35:09.200 --> 35:10.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bombers?

35:10.600 --> 35:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UM NAZIM (through
translator): I don't know.

35:11.500 --> 35:12.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I didn't see.

35:12.966 --> 35:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I wasn't with ISIS to
know anything about that.

35:15.766 --> 35:18.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ISIS became a state
and a government.

35:18.500 --> 35:20.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Who can say anything to
them under their rule?

35:20.900 --> 35:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Like many under
occupation, Um Nazim turned a
blind eye in order to ensure

35:27.466 --> 35:30.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
her own safety.

35:30.100 --> 35:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

revenge can be a dirty game.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Earlier this
month, Walter Shaub resigned
as director of the federal

35:59.333 --> 36:04.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Office of Government
Ethics, a position he's
held since January 2013.

36:06.266 --> 36:09.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the final months of his
tenure, Shaub clashed with the
Trump administration on a number

36:09.666 --> 36:11.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of ethics issues.

36:11.566 --> 36:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Currently, he is senior
director of ethics for the
nonprofit Campaign Legal Center.

36:16.533 --> 36:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And Mr. Shaub joins me now.

36:17.933 --> 36:20.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Thank you for being
here at the "NewsHour."

36:20.066 --> 36:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you had been -- you were
just telling me you had been
at the Office of Government

36:22.900 --> 36:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ethics for, what, 15, 16 years?

36:25.000 --> 36:26.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALTER SHAUB, Campaign
Legal Center: Right.

36:26.933 --> 36:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Leading up
to your decision to resign.

36:29.333 --> 36:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You had another six months to
go as director of the office.

36:32.866 --> 36:34.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Why leave?

36:34.066 --> 36:35.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why not stay until
the end, next January?

36:35.566 --> 36:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WALTER SHAUB: Well, first of
all, thanks for having me.

36:37.800 --> 36:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I started at OGE in 2001 and
have served there continuously,
except for two years, when I

36:44.866 --> 36:47.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
left.

36:47.300 --> 36:50.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have seen OGE operate
under three different
presidential administrations
right now, including

36:52.800 --> 36:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the administrations of President
Bush and President Obama, who
were incredibly supportive

36:56.533 --> 36:59.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the ethics program.

36:59.166 --> 37:04.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both of those administrations
really supported OGE
in absolutely every
way they could, and

37:05.266 --> 37:07.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
our work functioned
very smoothly.

37:07.933 --> 37:12.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In the past eight
months, we have departed
from ethical norms.

37:15.366 --> 37:18.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the program is under
significant pressure
from the White House
that has set a tone there

37:19.133 --> 37:21.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the top that ethics
doesn't matter.

37:21.266 --> 37:25.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I did all I could,
and I reached a point where
I thought there wasn't more I

37:25.666 --> 37:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
could achieve from inside.

37:27.633 --> 37:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, by leaving, I would
actually have more freedom to
continue to try to push for the

37:33.466 --> 37:34.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
restoration of our
ethics program.

37:34.966 --> 37:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you have
been speaking out since then.

37:37.100 --> 37:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Give us an example of the way or
ways that this administration,
as you say, was putting

37:41.833 --> 37:44.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
stress on the ethics procedures.

37:44.566 --> 37:49.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALTER SHAUB: Well, in one
way, it really began with the
president declaring that he's

37:50.700 --> 37:53.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not going to divest his
financial interests.

37:53.333 --> 37:57.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that means there is a
cloud over all government
decision-making that
stems from the president,

37:59.933 --> 38:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because you can't know whether
his decisions are being made
on the basis of policy aims

38:04.866 --> 38:06.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or on the basis of
financial interests.

38:06.900 --> 38:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when he travels to all of
his properties on a frequent
basis, he's giving each of them

38:11.533 --> 38:15.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
free advertisements, and he
speaks freely about those.

38:15.166 --> 38:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He could have, instead,
divested his interests and
told his administration
to stay away there

38:19.966 --> 38:24.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his properties, which would
have kept some of the foreign
governments or charities or

38:26.966 --> 38:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
businesses that have booked his
business -- his properties to
be closer to the president not

38:31.766 --> 38:33.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do that.

38:33.300 --> 38:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think a lot of things happen
on a day-to-day basis as well.

38:38.033 --> 38:43.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I fought a battle that took
over a month to get them to
release some waivers that they

38:44.433 --> 38:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had been issuing, and OGE's
collection of waivers...

38:46.533 --> 38:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: To individuals.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALTER SHAUB: To
individual appointees.

38:49.666 --> 38:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And OGE's collection of waivers
and other ethics documents
has been a routine function

38:53.866 --> 38:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of OGE's program dating all
the way back to its beginning.

38:57.233 --> 39:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OGE is by statute the
supervising Ethics Office.

39:01.300 --> 39:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I finally got the waivers,
I was shocked to see that a
number of them, most of them,

39:08.766 --> 39:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually, were unsigned,
undated, either explicitly
or implicitly retroactive,
and two of them

39:13.666 --> 39:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were issued by the counselor
of the president to a group of
people that included himself.

39:16.833 --> 39:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, that's about as bad an
ethics program as you can run.

39:19.966 --> 39:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, now you
know that -- what the White
House has been saying since you

39:23.200 --> 39:24.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
left your position.

39:24.300 --> 39:25.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They were criticizing
you before.

39:25.666 --> 39:27.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have been
criticizing since.

39:27.133 --> 39:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They say you have been
talking to the news media.

39:29.533 --> 39:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I saw one quote where they
said you were "grandstanding,"
that you're trying to
give additional powers

39:37.933 --> 39:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the Ethics Office
that it never had before.

39:40.266 --> 39:44.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WALTER SHAUB: Well, I
do think that, based
on recent experiences,
the Ethics Office needs

39:44.833 --> 39:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more power than it's had before,
because its functions depended
on a White House that wanted

39:50.700 --> 39:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to support the ethics program.

39:52.733 --> 39:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, when they threw roadblocks
in the way of the supervising
Ethics Office's ability

39:59.633 --> 40:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to again access to
routine ethics documents,
that was a clear signal
that OGE didn't have

40:04.500 --> 40:06.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
enough ability to
carry out its mission.

40:06.533 --> 40:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And then very
recently, Walter Shaub, you
have spoken out about the person

40:10.066 --> 40:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who has been named the
acting director of the
Ethics Office since you left.

40:14.833 --> 40:16.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why the concern there?

40:16.866 --> 40:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALTER SHAUB: So, you know, I
want to make clear that I think
that individual, Dave Apol,

40:22.733 --> 40:26.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is a good person and
an excellent attorney.

40:26.066 --> 40:31.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I hired him because he has got
a particular viewpoint, which
is at odds with the traditional

40:33.033 --> 40:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interpretation of the ethics
role that OGE has always had,
because I wanted diversity

40:36.933 --> 40:39.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of opinion.

40:39.033 --> 40:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it worked well while I was
in charge because I had two see
senior officials who had very

40:42.866 --> 40:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
differing opinions, and we
could have robust debate.

40:46.333 --> 40:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Dave was always
very respectful when a
decision was finally made.

40:50.166 --> 40:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I am concerned that he has
a particular outlook, that he
would wind up loosening the

40:56.300 --> 40:58.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ethics rules and
OGE's interpretations.

40:58.333 --> 41:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, to be clear, I would have
no problem if they nominated
him, so the Senate could

41:02.500 --> 41:04.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
vet these viewpoints.

41:04.933 --> 41:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that the
administration did
an end-run around the
natural succession of the

41:11.233 --> 41:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chief of staff to appoint
one of her subordinates
as acting director in
order to avoid the Senate

41:16.533 --> 41:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
confirmation process and have
someone in the office who is
sympathetic to their views.

41:23.500 --> 41:25.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just
very quickly, in the
time that we have left,
you are trying now, as

41:25.900 --> 41:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we said, to beef up the
Office of Government Ethics.

41:29.400 --> 41:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're working with members
of Congress from both
political parties to do this.

41:33.133 --> 41:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just in a quick nutshell,
what do you think needs to
be done, needs to be added?

41:36.533 --> 41:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALTER SHAUB: So, there's a
number of measures I'm proposing
to try to get OGE a little bit

41:40.600 --> 41:45.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more independence, including
the ability to gather records
and information, if necessary,

41:46.366 --> 41:48.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by issuing subpoenas.

41:48.500 --> 41:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I also think that there's
a number of tweaks that can
be done to the ethics rules.

41:51.800 --> 41:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, ultimately, I would like
to see some accountability
for resolving presidential

41:56.600 --> 41:58.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
conflicts of interest.

41:58.666 --> 42:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That last one might be a
tougher sell, but some of the
proposals are technical enough

42:02.166 --> 42:04.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that they shouldn't
be controversial.

42:04.200 --> 42:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I hope
we can stay in touch with
you as you work on this.

42:07.900 --> 42:12.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Walter Shaub, the former
director of the office
of Government Ethics,
thank you very much.

42:12.666 --> 42:17.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALTER SHAUB: Thanks
for having me.

42:20.833 --> 42:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: A new study
raises even stronger concerns
about the risks of brain

42:29.033 --> 42:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
injury from the country's most
popular professional sport.

42:32.900 --> 42:35.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the focus of our weekly
segment the Leading Edge.

42:35.766 --> 42:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Hari Sreenivasan has the
story from our New York studios.

42:38.666 --> 42:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We have
known about the dangers of
hard hits and concussions from

42:43.200 --> 42:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
football, and that many
players are suffering
from CTE, or chronic
traumatic encephalopathy.

42:50.233 --> 42:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, yesterday, the largest
study to date concluded that
110 of 111 former NFL players

42:56.600 --> 43:01.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who had died and donated
their brains had CTE.

43:01.033 --> 43:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These included former
greats such as quarterback
Kenny Stabler and
linebacker Dave Duerson.

43:05.800 --> 43:10.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Researchers also looked at the
brains of 202 former players,
including high school and

43:12.200 --> 43:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
college athletes; 87 percent
were found to have CTE.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The NFL released a statement.

43:18.000 --> 43:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It said in part: "We appreciate
the work for the value it
adds in the ongoing quest for

43:22.800 --> 43:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a better understanding of CTE.

43:25.500 --> 43:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The NFL will continue to work
with a wide range of experts
to improve the health of

43:30.133 --> 43:33.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
current and former
NFL athletes."

43:33.333 --> 43:37.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michael Alosco is a co-author
of the study from the Boston
University CTE Center.

43:37.766 --> 43:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Michael, thanks for joining us.

43:39.900 --> 43:43.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You and your researchers point
out that this is not a random
sample, that the group of

43:43.566 --> 43:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brains that you were studying
either came directly from
the athletes or from members

43:47.633 --> 43:50.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of their family who thought
there might be something wrong.

43:50.600 --> 43:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That said, what does this
information tell you?

43:53.233 --> 43:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What does this data point to?

43:55.300 --> 43:57.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL ALOSCO, Boston
University CTE Center:
This is the largest case
series study to date

43:57.833 --> 43:59.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of CTE.

43:59.100 --> 44:02.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You know, it's among
football players.

44:02.666 --> 44:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The sheer numbers, the sheer
size of the individuals who
had CTE is really concerning.

44:09.533 --> 44:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's really suggesting a link
between prior participation
in football and CTE.

44:16.200 --> 44:20.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's really going to serve as
a foundation, as a rich data
source going forward to really

44:22.400 --> 44:26.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
study this disease and
figuring out what causes
it and identifying the
risk factors and to

44:27.733 --> 44:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
really better understand it.

44:29.400 --> 44:32.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Help
us understand what
CTE does to the brain.

44:32.966 --> 44:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL ALOSCO: It's a
neurodegenerative disease,
so a neurodegenerative
disease similar to

44:37.600 --> 44:42.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Alzheimer's, but it's
very distinct from
Alzheimer's disease.

44:42.066 --> 44:45.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What we see in CTE is
this protein called tau.

44:45.266 --> 44:50.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tau is a protein that helps
stabilize the cell, but in
CTE, it becomes abnormal.

44:52.066 --> 44:56.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, specifically, it
starts to collect around
the blood vessels.

44:56.600 --> 45:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's located at the base of
the (INAUDIBLE) kind of right
below the bottom of the tissue

45:03.600 --> 45:05.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the brain.

45:05.800 --> 45:08.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it's a really
unique presentation.

45:08.200 --> 45:11.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, Michael,
I know you sent us a slide.

45:11.400 --> 45:13.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're going to put
that on the screen.

45:13.433 --> 45:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the left-hand side, you kind
of see a cross-section of a
brain that's almost off-white.

45:16.866 --> 45:20.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And then, on the
right-hand side, you see
a lot more dark edges.

45:20.666 --> 45:22.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that, I suppose,
is where the CTE is.

45:22.466 --> 45:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But what -- how does this
affect a player's behavior?

45:24.933 --> 45:29.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MICHAEL ALOSCO: We see
a lot of different types
of symptoms in CTE.

45:29.133 --> 45:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of them are nonspecific,
meaning that, you know, we see
these symptoms across various

45:33.866 --> 45:36.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
conditions.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
However, in CTE, we're
commonly seeing behavior
changes, so we're seeing
aggressive behaviors,

45:40.866 --> 45:42.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
violent behaviors.

45:42.100 --> 45:44.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're seeing changes in
mood, like depression.

45:44.266 --> 45:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're also seeing changes
in thinking and memory.

45:49.100 --> 45:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What we need to identify is what
symptoms are specific to CTE.

45:53.600 --> 45:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And by doing that, it will
help us diagnose CTE in life
and really characterize it.

45:58.566 --> 46:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the
things I found interesting was
that you actually found this

46:02.400 --> 46:04.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in high school players.

46:04.533 --> 46:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so that means that this
wasn't just the big-time NFL
superstars that were hitting

46:08.733 --> 46:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
each other with tremendous
force, but does this
have a cumulative effect?

46:12.233 --> 46:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL ALOSCO: That was
actually really surprising
to us as well is, we're
finding CTE kind of

46:16.733 --> 46:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
across the levels of play going
from high school up to the
people who play professionally,

46:21.500 --> 46:23.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as you mentioned.

46:23.466 --> 46:25.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But we don't know how
much is too much yet.

46:25.933 --> 46:29.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, we don't know
what it means if you just
play high school football.

46:29.666 --> 46:32.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't know what that means
in terms of risk for CTE.

46:32.066 --> 46:34.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We did find it in
three individuals.

46:34.600 --> 46:39.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we need to, you know,
identify those people
and follow them over
time to see what happens

46:39.000 --> 46:41.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to them.

46:41.100 --> 46:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Speaking of
that, while this is obviously
the gold standard, you have

46:44.233 --> 46:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
someone's brain to
work with, but that's,
unfortunately, posthumously.

46:47.266 --> 46:52.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Is there anything that
science is doing now to
be able to detect and
diagnose and intervene

46:53.133 --> 46:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
while a player is still alive?

46:55.133 --> 46:58.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL ALOSCO: Right now, we
can only diagnose CTE after
death, as you mentioned.

46:58.666 --> 47:03.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our work at Boston University
is also, though, studying living
subjects, and we're trying

47:05.566 --> 47:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to identify tools that look
at the brain, that look at
different proteins in the blood,

47:10.433 --> 47:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trying to identify these tools
that can detect CTE in life.

47:14.300 --> 47:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're really hopeful that,
you know, in the next five
or seven years, we will make

47:18.566 --> 47:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a lot of progress on that front.

47:20.500 --> 47:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It's important
to point out you're not
just focused on NFL players.

47:23.566 --> 47:26.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You have actually the
brains of athletes from
other sports as well?

47:26.100 --> 47:27.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL ALOSCO: Right.

47:27.766 --> 47:31.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, the paper that we're
talking about is all
about football players.

47:31.133 --> 47:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, really, it's a brain bank
for all individuals who had some
type of exposure to repetitive

47:37.466 --> 47:39.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
head impacts.

47:39.600 --> 47:42.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: I think one
of the questions that parents
want to know is, should I pull

47:42.166 --> 47:44.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
my child out of football?

47:44.166 --> 47:48.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL ALOSCO: So,
that's the million-dollar
question we always get.

47:50.733 --> 47:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's a very tough question,
and the reason being is, we
know there's a lot of benefits

47:53.566 --> 47:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
associated with playing sports
and participating in sports.

47:57.833 --> 48:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But this study and our findings,
they raise a lot of concern.

48:02.133 --> 48:04.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But we need to do
more future research.

48:04.800 --> 48:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need to know more about the
disease, more about the risk
factors for the disease before

48:08.766 --> 48:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we can really make any
informed recommendations
about policy or about safety.

48:14.500 --> 48:16.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We need to learn more.

48:16.566 --> 48:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Michael Alosco, thanks so
much for joining us today.

48:18.200 --> 48:23.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MICHAEL ALOSCO: Thank
you for having me.

48:25.233 --> 48:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We turn now to
the second half of our series on
political divisions in unlikely

48:35.900 --> 48:37.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
places.

48:37.933 --> 48:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In May, "NewsHour" producer
Elizabeth Flock wrote about a
group of women in a conservative

48:41.533 --> 48:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
West Virginia coal mining town
who spoke out against President
Trump and received backlash

48:47.266 --> 48:49.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from their neighbors.

48:49.366 --> 48:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her new piece, out this week,
is an in-depth look at a group
of conservative women trying

48:55.400 --> 48:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to find their voice in a city
known for its progressive
politics, Portland, Oregon.

48:59.300 --> 49:00.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And Liz joins me now.

49:00.366 --> 49:01.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Liz, welcome back.

49:01.766 --> 49:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You were in Portland for
several days and just got back.

49:04.433 --> 49:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why did you choose that city?

49:06.500 --> 49:10.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: In part, I
chose Portland just because
it was a progressive city, and

49:10.666 --> 49:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was really interested to see,
what is it like to be a Trump
supporter in such a liberal

49:16.133 --> 49:18.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
place?

49:18.066 --> 49:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there had also been a
number of recent pro-Trump
rallies even after the election

49:21.300 --> 49:26.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Portland and the surrounding
area, and those had ended in
some violent clashes between

49:27.033 --> 49:28.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the left and the right.

49:28.533 --> 49:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so I was really interested
to see what was going on there.

49:30.533 --> 49:33.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we
actually covered --
covered some of those.

49:33.100 --> 49:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How did you find these women?

49:35.200 --> 49:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How did you get in touch with
them and how easy was it to
get them to trust you, to talk

49:38.233 --> 49:39.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to you?

49:39.233 --> 49:41.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: Yes.

49:41.133 --> 49:45.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, I found all of them online
through pro-Trump Facebook
groups, Women for Trump.

49:45.166 --> 49:46.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was really hard
to gain their trust.

49:46.833 --> 49:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A lot of them had no
interested in speaking to me.

49:49.100 --> 49:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is a perception that the
media is very liberal, very
biased, produces fake news.

49:56.100 --> 49:58.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Some of them said they'd
speak to me and later
made the decision that
they didn't want to.

49:58.433 --> 50:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one of the women I met in
a public park because she said:
"I'm concerned about meeting

50:03.900 --> 50:05.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

50:05.366 --> 50:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't know what you're
going to do when I meet you.

50:06.300 --> 50:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Maybe you will try to hurt me.

50:07.833 --> 50:09.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think we should met
in a public place."

50:09.600 --> 50:13.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So there was a lot of
fear of the media and
how they're portrayed.

50:13.000 --> 50:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tell us about
what it's like for them?

50:16.933 --> 50:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do they go through as they
express their political views?

50:20.733 --> 50:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: Well,
they certainly get a lot of
pushback for their beliefs.

50:24.600 --> 50:28.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And some of them do have more
extreme beliefs, to be certain.

50:28.866 --> 50:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Others hold more moderate
views, but they're all sort of
clumped together as one thing.

50:33.633 --> 50:37.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're called racists
and bigots regularly.

50:37.933 --> 50:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they're attacked online.

50:39.566 --> 50:41.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're told that
they should go die.

50:41.933 --> 50:46.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One woman told me, one day,
when she was walking her dog and
wearing a Trump hat, a man just

50:46.200 --> 50:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stopped to say to her: "Your
kind isn't wanted here.

50:49.433 --> 50:51.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You should just leave."

50:51.933 --> 50:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if they go to these
rallies, they face even
more of an extreme reaction.

50:58.966 --> 51:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many people in Portland, in the
Pacific Northwest come out to
counterprotest these rallies.

51:01.900 --> 51:06.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And some of them are
more liberal Portlanders
who just want to say,
I don't agree with what

51:06.200 --> 51:08.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you have to say.

51:08.200 --> 51:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But others are militant leftists
that show up and basically
say, we're unapologetic about

51:13.533 --> 51:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
using physical violence
against these Trump supporters.

51:16.233 --> 51:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, certainly, violence happens
on both sides, but the militant
leftists are very unapologetic

51:21.966 --> 51:23.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and open about it.

51:23.966 --> 51:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I think, for
people who didn't realize
it, it's eye-opening.

51:25.433 --> 51:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One of the women you talked
to, Liz, is transgender.

51:27.833 --> 51:28.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: Yes.

51:28.833 --> 51:31.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Her name is Athena Brown.

51:31.300 --> 51:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Athena switched parties
from being a Democrat
to being a Republican
in mid-2016, just before

51:37.533 --> 51:39.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the election.

51:39.600 --> 51:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She became fed up, she said,
with what she saw as political
correctness on the left and

51:44.700 --> 51:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the liberal LGBT community.

51:47.533 --> 51:51.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she told me: "You know,
when I became - - when I came
out as transgender, I lost

51:51.666 --> 51:53.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two friends.

51:53.200 --> 51:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When I came out as Republican,
I lost 100 friends on Facebook."

51:56.300 --> 52:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so she really saw that
as an example of the left's
intolerance to people who do not

52:02.033 --> 52:03.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
share their views.

52:03.266 --> 52:05.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do
these women keep going?

52:05.333 --> 52:09.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In that environment, where
they are such a minority,
what keeps them going?

52:10.333 --> 52:12.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do they deal with it?

52:12.366 --> 52:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: I think they're
actually invigorated by the
pushback that they're getting.

52:18.500 --> 52:21.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think they really feel that
it's worth, it's important to
go out and defend what they

52:23.033 --> 52:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
see as an attack on free speech.

52:25.633 --> 52:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, one of the
interesting things I saw is, as
the left tried to shut down what

52:32.566 --> 52:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they had to say, these Trump
supporters, these women were
more determined to go out and to

52:37.333 --> 52:39.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
speak.

52:39.433 --> 52:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They just wanted to get more
active and became more even
strident in their beliefs.

52:41.800 --> 52:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, in a way,
it was a mirror image of the
anti-Trump women you talked to

52:47.666 --> 52:48.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in conservative West Virginia.

52:48.866 --> 52:50.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: Absolutely.

52:50.966 --> 52:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In both places, I think, as
people tried to shut down what
they had to say, these women

52:54.633 --> 52:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just wanted to speak out louder.

52:56.400 --> 52:58.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They wanted to get more
involved and more active.

52:58.966 --> 53:03.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, in both places, it felt
like people on opposite sides
of the political divide were

53:05.100 --> 53:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not speaking to each other.

53:07.066 --> 53:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were speaking past each
other, and there was no interest
in really hearing what the

53:11.233 --> 53:12.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
other side had to say.

53:12.933 --> 53:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Discouraging,
but some great reporting.

53:15.766 --> 53:18.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Liz Flock, thank you very much.

53:18.466 --> 53:20.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: Thanks.

53:20.100 --> 53:24.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you
can find Liz's full
reports on our Web site.

53:25.533 --> 53:27.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:27.733 --> 53:29.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that is the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

53:29.233 --> 53:30.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:30.700 --> 53:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again
right here tomorrow evening.

53:32.766 --> 53:37.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank you,
and we will see you soon.
