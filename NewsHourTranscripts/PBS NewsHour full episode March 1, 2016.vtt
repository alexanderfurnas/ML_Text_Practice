00:04.738 --> 00:06.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.306 --> 00:07.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:08.075 --> 00:11.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
Super Tuesday is finally here.
Voters head

00:11.879 --> 00:18.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to polls and caucuses, as the
candidates prepare
for a critical turning point in
their campaigns.

00:18.185 --> 00:23.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And we break down
the numbers
on how candidates can secure the
delegates

00:23.457 --> 00:25.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that will put them over the top.

00:25.359 --> 00:30.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus, Mark
Shields and David
Brooks are here to give
up-to-date analysis

00:30.264 --> 00:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as results pour in from across
the U.S.

00:33.133 --> 00:38.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead, we
continue our series
on the integration of special
education programs

00:38.872 --> 00:44.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in Los Angeles schools --
tonight, why some
parents and teachers believe it
could hurt

00:44.344 --> 00:46.146 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more than help.

00:46.246 --> 00:49.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDA HILTON, Mother: I would
say that their
job is to educate my child and
my job is to

00:49.950 --> 00:56.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
socialize my child. A safe
environment is
important, and many of these
other schools

00:56.523 --> 00:57.791 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
just aren't safe.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:01.028 --> 01:05.365 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:05.465 --> 01:18.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All signs point
to a big Super
Tuesday for the leaders of the
Republican

01:18.679 --> 01:23.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Democratic presidential
packs. They're
hoping to roll up so many wins
tonight that

01:23.984 --> 01:26.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
party opponents will fall by the
wayside.

01:26.887 --> 01:30.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In turn, those opponents spent
their day hoping
just to hang on.

01:30.724 --> 01:34.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
Today is the big day. Today is
the day we

01:34.494 --> 01:36.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have been waiting for, for a
year.

01:36.396 --> 01:42.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the prize at
the end of
the day, more than 860 delegates
for Democrats

01:42.736 --> 01:45.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and almost 600 for Republicans.

01:45.739 --> 01:51.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But GOP front-runner Donald
Trump was sure
enough of his Super Tuesday
showing that he

01:51.712 --> 01:54.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
turned to states that vote in
the coming days
and weeks.

01:54.247 --> 02:00.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Columbus, Ohio, he again took
jabs at Republican
rivals, Marco Rubio.

02:00.320 --> 02:03.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I call him little Marco, little
Marco.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.925 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Ted Cruz.

02:05.025 --> 02:09.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Lying Ted. We will
build a wall.
Anything you do, you take a
position, and

02:09.997 --> 02:14.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then you see him on television
when he's not
around you and he says exactly
the opposite

02:14.835 --> 02:16.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of what your position is.

02:16.670 --> 02:21.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The two senators
hoping at
least to slow Trump's momentum
answered in

02:21.241 --> 02:26.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind. Cruz voted with his family
in Houston,
and appealed to his fellow
Texans.

02:26.913 --> 02:31.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: If you don't want
Donald Trump
to be your nominee, if you're
among that 65

02:31.618 --> 02:36.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
percent of Republicans who
recognize that
Donald Trump could be a disaster
as the nominee,

02:36.423 --> 02:38.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
then I ask you to join us.

02:38.191 --> 02:42.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Rubio sounded the
same theme
in Andover, Minnesota, this
afternoon.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
Today, the front-runner, at
least according

02:44.931 --> 02:49.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to national polls in the
Republican primary
is someone who is preying on
your anger, is

02:49.770 --> 02:53.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
someone who is preying on fear.
And there
has never been, in the history
of mankind,

02:53.640 --> 02:58.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a great movement that has been
based on fear
and on anger. Donald Trump will
be an embarrassment

02:59.046 --> 03:02.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to America, will be an
embarrassment to anyone
who supported him.

03:02.249 --> 03:07.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the Democratic
side, with
Hillary Clinton out in front,
Senator Bernie

03:07.120 --> 03:13.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders went home to Vermont to
vote, and
assess his chances of holding
back the Clinton

03:13.727 --> 03:15.729 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tide.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
I am confident that if there is
a large voter

03:17.631 --> 03:22.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
turnout today across this
country, we are
going to do well. And if there's
not, we're

03:22.569 --> 03:27.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
probably going to be struggling.
But I hope
that there will be millions of
people coming

03:27.841 --> 03:31.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out, and participating in what I
call the
political revolution.

03:31.111 --> 03:35.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But the leaders
in the two
races are increasingly turning
their gaze

03:36.083 --> 03:43.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on each other as likely
opponents in November.
Trump laced into Clinton today
and the continuing

03:43.123 --> 03:46.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
furor over her handling of
e-mails as secretary
of state.

03:46.993 --> 03:51.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Hillary Clinton
cannot do the
job, number one. Number two, she
shouldn't

03:51.865 --> 03:57.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be allowed to do the job because
what she
did was a criminal act. She
shouldn't be allowed

03:57.137 --> 03:58.972 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to run.

03:59.072 --> 04:03.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A few minutes
later, Clinton
fired back in Minneapolis, and
again condemned

04:03.510 --> 04:07.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump's initial refusal to
reject endorsements
by white supremacists.

04:07.948 --> 04:12.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I was very disappointed that he
didn't disavow

04:12.652 --> 04:21.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what appears to be support from
David Duke
and from the Ku Klux Klan. That
is exactly

04:21.228 --> 04:25.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the kind of statement that
should be repudiated.

04:25.198 --> 04:30.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in
Washington, that same
issue weighed on Republican
leaders, eying

04:30.504 --> 04:33.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their party's prospects if Trump
leads the
ticket.

04:33.607 --> 04:37.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader:
Senate Republicans condemn David
Duke, the

04:37.544 --> 04:46.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KKK, and his racism. It has
nothing -- that
is not the view of Republicans
that have been

04:46.653 --> 04:51.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
elected to the United States
Senate, and I
condemn his comments in the most
forceful

04:51.591 --> 04:53.393 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

04:53.493 --> 04:55.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House:
If a person wants to be the
nominee of the

04:55.328 --> 05:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Party, there can be
no evasion
and no games. They must reject
any group or

05:00.433 --> 05:08.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cause that is built on bigotry.
This party
doesn't prey on people's
prejudices. We appeal

05:08.875 --> 05:10.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to their highest ideals.

05:10.877 --> 05:16.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: House Speaker
Paul Ryan said
he still plans to support the
eventual Republican

05:16.383 --> 05:22.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nominee. But an Associated Press
survey found
more than half of GOP senators
and governors

05:22.923 --> 05:25.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are not yet saying if they will
do the same.

05:25.959 --> 05:31.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will get reports from key
states voting
today and analysis after the
news summary.

05:31.798 --> 05:36.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the day's other
news: President
Obama and Senate leaders met
face-to-face

05:36.803 --> 05:41.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the vacancy on the U.S.
Supreme Court,
but they resolved nothing. The
president laid

05:41.908 --> 05:47.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out his thinking in the Oval
Office session,
but Republicans remained opposed
to any nomination

05:47.847 --> 05:49.115 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this year.

05:49.216 --> 05:51.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That drew a new blast from
Democrats.

05:51.718 --> 05:54.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. HARRY REID (D-NV), Minority
Leader: And
we're going to continue beating
the drums.

05:55.088 --> 06:02.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
All we want them to do is
fulfill their constitutional
duty and do their job. And at
this stage,

06:02.128 --> 06:07.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have decided not to do
that. They think
that they are going to wait and
see what President

06:07.334 --> 06:09.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump will do, I guess, as far
as a nomination.

06:09.903 --> 06:14.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Back at the Capitol,
Republicans
say they -- said they're not
budging, and

06:14.774 --> 06:18.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they rejected the Democrats'
criticism as
so much political point-scoring.

06:18.545 --> 06:23.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: Do any of
you think
a Democrat majority in the
Senate would be

06:23.750 --> 06:31.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
confirming a Republican
president's nomination
in the last year of his term? Of
course not.

06:31.291 --> 06:34.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is going to be decided by
the American
people and the next president,
whoever that

06:34.561 --> 06:37.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
may be, will fill this vacancy.

06:37.397 --> 06:41.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The White House said
the president
is reading files on potential
nominees, but

06:42.068 --> 06:45.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doesn't yet have a short list of
candidates.

06:45.138 --> 06:50.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Another big swing
on Wall Street.
Stocks surged higher today,
after construction

06:50.710 --> 06:55.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spending in the U.S. jumped in
January to
the highest level in eight
years. The Dow

06:55.849 --> 07:03.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jones industrial average gained
nearly 350
points to close at 16865. The
Nasdaq rose

07:03.757 --> 07:08.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
131 points, and the S&amp;P 500 was
up 46.

07:08.595 --> 07:14.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The battle between tech giant
Apple and the
FBI over unlocking a terrorist's
iPhone played

07:14.668 --> 07:16.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out before Congress today.

07:16.536 --> 07:21.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The two sides argued their
points before the
House Judiciary Committee, as
Hari Sreenivasan

07:21.474 --> 07:23.310 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
reports.

07:23.410 --> 07:25.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY, FBI Director: The
tools you are
counting on us to keep you safe
are becoming

07:25.945 --> 07:27.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
less and less effective.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE SEWELL, General Counsel,
Apple: We're
doing this because we think that
protecting

07:30.750 --> 07:36.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the security and the privacy of
hundreds of
millions of iPhone users is the
right thing

07:36.523 --> 07:38.325 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to do.

07:38.425 --> 07:41.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: FBI Director
James Comey
and Apple lead counsel Bruce
Sewell used the

07:41.594 --> 07:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hearing to lay out the cases
they're making
in federal court. The fight
centers around

07:46.366 --> 07:51.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an Apple iPhone used by Syed
Farook last December
in San Bernardino, California.
He and his

07:51.504 --> 07:55.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wife, Tashfeen Malik, shot dead
14 people.

07:55.275 --> 07:59.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Federal agents have been unable
to access
the phone's content due to
Apple's encryption,

07:59.846 --> 08:02.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Comey says it bespeaks a
larger problem.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: All of our lives
are on these
devices, which is why it's so
important that

08:05.985 --> 08:10.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they be private. That also means
all of the
criminals, pedophiles, and
terrorists' lives

08:10.223 --> 08:15.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are on these devices. And if
they can't, if
they are warrant-proof, even a
judge can't

08:15.562 --> 08:18.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
order access to a device, that
is a big problem.

08:18.298 --> 08:22.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A federal
magistrate in
California has ordered Apple to
create special

08:22.135 --> 08:27.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
software that will help unlock
the San Bernardino
phone. Comey acknowledged today
that would

08:27.574 --> 08:31.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
set a precedent. He argued it
would be limited
in scope.

08:31.578 --> 08:36.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Apple CEO Tim Cook has
warned it could
be used to compromise hundreds
of millions

08:36.850 --> 08:37.984 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

Again, Bruce Sewell:

BRUCE SEWELL: The tool that
we're being asked
to create will work on any
iPhone that is

08:44.524 --> 08:50.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in use today. It is extensible.
It is common.
The principles are the same. So
the notion

08:50.563 --> 08:55.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that this is somehow only about
opening one
lock or that there is some
category of locks

08:55.735 --> 08:59.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that can't be opened with the
tool that they're
asking us to create is a
misnomer.

HARI SREENIVASAN: Apple says
it's prepared
to take the fight to the U.S.
Supreme Court,

09:03.810 --> 09:05.578 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
if need be.

09:05.678 --> 09:08.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the meantime, the Justice
Department is
also seeking court orders for
more than a

09:08.681 --> 09:13.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dozen Apple devices in other
cases. Yesterday,
a federal magistrate in New York
ruled in

09:13.686 --> 09:18.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
favor of Apple in a drug
prosecution, saying
the government is trying to gain
impermissibly

09:18.658 --> 09:20.393 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
absurd results.

09:20.493 --> 09:24.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Separately,
Attorney General
Loretta Lynch warned against
letting Apple

09:24.230 --> 09:29.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
alone decide the outcome of the
encryption
debate. She spoke in San
Francisco and called

09:29.402 --> 09:32.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for cooperation between Silicon
Valley and
Washington.

09:32.305 --> 09:38.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The International
Criminal Court
has brought its first-ever
charges for destroying

09:38.211 --> 09:44.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ancient cultural sites. A
radical Islamist,
Ahmad al-Faqi al-Mahdi, was
formally accused

09:45.018 --> 09:52.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today. The case stems from the
July 2012 destruction
of ancient mausoleums at
Timbuktu in the African

09:52.659 --> 09:58.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nation of Mali. Al-Mahdi's
defense lawyers
suggested they will try to
justify his actions

09:58.798 --> 10:00.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on religious grounds.

10:00.633 --> 10:05.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Pakistan, tens
of thousands
of conservative Muslims
protested against

10:05.438 --> 10:11.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the execution of a policeman. He
was hanged
in Rawalpindi for killing a
governor who opposed

10:11.878 --> 10:17.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a blasphemy law. It mandates
death for insulting
Islam. Mourners walked for miles
through the

10:18.084 --> 10:23.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
streets of Rawalpindi today amid
tight security.
They chanted support for the
police officer

10:24.090 --> 10:26.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and for the law against
blasphemy.

10:26.359 --> 10:31.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The migrant crisis
in Greece grew
ever more dire today, and the
U.N. Refugee

10:31.931 --> 10:35.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Agency warned of humanitarian
disaster.

10:35.635 --> 10:39.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
James Mates of Independent
Television News
traveled to the Greek border
with Macedonia,

10:40.006 --> 10:42.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
where growing numbers are
stranded.

10:42.308 --> 10:48.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATES: Outside and looking
in, almost
10,000 refugees and would-be
migrants whose

10:48.248 --> 10:55.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dreams of a new life in Northern
Europe are
now blocked by razor wire and
armed police.

10:55.455 --> 10:59.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Only a few weeks ago, they would
have been
waved through this border
crossing, and bussed

10:59.459 --> 11:05.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
northwards towards Austria and
Germany. When
the Austrians started saying no,
the domino

11:05.231 --> 11:10.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
effect rippled back towards
Greece.

11:10.203 --> 11:17.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Open the borders," they chant,
as they sit
across the main north-south
railway line.

11:17.610 --> 11:22.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But those days may be gone for
good. Well,
it's past midday now. We have
been here most

11:22.815 --> 11:27.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the morning, and so far not a
single person
has gone through this gate. No
explanation

11:27.921 --> 11:32.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as to why it's shut. Yesterday,
these people
rioted. Today, they're waiting
patiently,

11:32.592 --> 11:35.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but it's not getting them any
further.

11:35.495 --> 11:39.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And judging by the military
hardware being
rolled into place, the
Macedonians are serious

11:39.999 --> 11:46.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about this. And we saw Czech,
Slovakian and
Austrian police here reinforcing
their Macedonian

11:46.806 --> 11:55.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
colleagues. Every country on
this Balkan route
seems to want it shut down.

11:55.148 --> 12:03.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We met the Behar (ph) family,
six young daughters
who've been here for 10 days
already. Their

12:03.923 --> 12:09.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tiny cousin Andy (ph) has spent
precisely
half his life in this camp. And
they want

12:09.429 --> 12:14.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him out of here quickly. They
don't speak
much English, but know what they
want most.

12:14.367 --> 12:18.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GIRL: Please, open the door,
Macedonia.

12:18.871 --> 12:23.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Please open Macedonia.
Please open Macedonia.

12:23.610 --> 12:31.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATES: And still they come
along the
railway lines, and by foot on
all roads leading

12:31.184 --> 12:37.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
northwards, a bottleneck
becoming more congested
every day. At some point,
something is going

12:37.857 --> 12:39.759 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to have to give.

12:39.859 --> 12:44.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Meanwhile, NATO's
top commander
in Europe, U.S. Air Force
General Philip Breedlove,

12:44.564 --> 12:49.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
warned the refugee flow is --
quote -- "masking
the movement" of Islamic State
militants and

12:49.736 --> 12:52.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
others, and setting the stage
for an attack.

12:52.972 --> 12:57.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An update to a story we reported
last night.
Late today, the governor of
South Dakota vetoed

12:57.877 --> 13:03.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a bill that required transgender
students
to use the bathroom of their
birth sex. The

13:03.483 --> 13:05.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
legislative fight had gained
national attention.

13:06.019 --> 13:11.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And astronaut
Scott kelly returns
to Earth tonight after setting
an American

13:11.424 --> 13:17.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
record for the longest
continuous stay in
space. Kelly handed over command
of the International

13:17.664 --> 13:24.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Space Station yesterday. He's
been in orbit
340 days, and he sent back a
gallery of out-of-this-world

13:24.470 --> 13:30.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
videos and photos. A Russian,
Valeri Polyakov,
holds the record for longest
space flight

13:30.877 --> 13:33.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by any human, and that's at 437
days.

13:33.780 --> 13:36.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Welcome home,
Commander Kelly.

13:36.315 --> 13:37.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sure.

13:38.084 --> 13:41.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Still on the
"NewsHour": full
coverage of Super Tuesday from
reporters on

13:41.254 --> 13:46.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the ground and in-depth analysis
from Mark
Shields and David Brooks; plus,
the challenge

13:47.060 --> 13:54.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of educating students with
special needs without
holding other students back.

13:54.634 --> 14:08.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The focus today
is obviously
on the states that are voting,
but both parties'

14:08.948 --> 14:15.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
front-runners are already
looking ahead to
the March 15 contests, including
in Florida,

14:15.188 --> 14:18.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and will end this day in that
critical battleground
state.

14:18.925 --> 14:24.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It also happens to be where we
have sent our
new "NewsHour" correspondent,
John Yang.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.165 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome, John.

14:26.265 --> 14:32.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We sent you to Florida on your
second day
on the job. And I guess it's no
coincidence

14:32.205 --> 14:34.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the two front-runners are
heading there,
too.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That's right, Judy.

14:36.609 --> 14:40.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, on a night like this,
you can really
tell a lot about how a campaign
is feeling

14:40.813 --> 14:46.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by where they are. This was not
a Super Tuesday
state, as you say, but here in
Miami is where

14:46.686 --> 14:51.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton will be, and
just a little
bit north of here in West Palm
Beach is where

14:51.357 --> 14:57.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump will be, both very
confident,
a sign of confidence about how
they expect

14:57.497 --> 14:59.365 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do tonight.

14:59.465 --> 15:05.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Donald Trump can sweep all
the states outside
Ted Cruz's home state of Texas,
he will be

15:05.972 --> 15:12.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
poised to put this contest away
in two weeks,
when there are big contests,
including here

15:12.612 --> 15:14.447 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Florida.

15:14.547 --> 15:19.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, Judy, on the Democratic
side, Hillary
Clinton hopes to pull away from
Bernie Sanders

15:19.385 --> 15:26.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the delegate count in a very
big way. Sanders
didn't even really compete in
the delegate-rich

15:26.259 --> 15:32.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states of the South, focusing on
other states
where the voters, the voting
population had

15:32.398 --> 15:35.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a lower percentage of
African-Americans.

15:35.468 --> 15:40.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here in the South, the -- that
African-American
population expected to give
Clinton an edge.

15:41.007 --> 15:46.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Clinton does have a good
night, expect
when she comes out here tonight
that she will

15:46.546 --> 15:51.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sound a lot more like a nominee,
rather than
a candidate for the nomination
-- Judy, Gwen.

15:51.884 --> 15:55.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: John, let me add my
welcome to
the "NewsHour."

15:55.221 --> 15:57.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Thank you.

15:57.123 --> 16:00.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Florida is so often
the lock to
the key -- the key to the lock
of who wins

16:00.993 --> 16:03.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these elections, whether in the
general or
in the primary.

16:03.830 --> 16:10.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that -- so, why is it that
it has already
leapfrogged over so many other
states that

16:10.136 --> 16:11.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we're watching tonight?

16:11.971 --> 16:16.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, for -- partly,
one reason
on the Republican side, it's the
home state

16:16.742 --> 16:20.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of one of the candidates, Marco
Rubio, who
is also returning here to Miami
tonight.

16:20.880 --> 16:27.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has only been on the ballot
here once before,
statewide ballot. That's why a
lot of the

16:27.887 --> 16:33.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans I talk to said, to
their chagrin,
it is likely that Rubio is not
going to be

16:33.693 --> 16:36.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
able to win his home state in
two weeks.

16:36.162 --> 16:40.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Democratic side, it goes
back to the
mantra of Florida, Florida,
Florida. This

16:41.067 --> 16:45.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a state that's going to be
crucial to both
sides. I think that Hillary
Clinton, as she

16:45.705 --> 16:51.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
makes the pivot toward a general
election
campaign, toward going after the
Republicans,

16:51.978 --> 16:56.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wants to really stake out the
ground here
in Florida.

16:56.349 --> 17:00.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: John, we look
forward the hearing
from you a little bit more later
on tonight

17:00.386 --> 17:02.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when we begin to get results.
Thanks.

17:02.255 --> 17:04.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Thanks a lot.

17:04.490 --> 17:08.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now we move north to
Georgia,
with the second largest number
of delegates

17:08.694 --> 17:11.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at stake for both parties in
tonight's contests.

17:11.898 --> 17:16.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And joining us to explore the
political landscape
there is Celeste Headlee of
Georgia Public

17:16.702 --> 17:18.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Broadcasting in Atlanta.

17:18.704 --> 17:22.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Celeste, give us a sense of what
you're going
to be watching and what we
should be watching

17:22.575 --> 17:24.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Georgia tonight.

17:24.543 --> 17:31.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CELESTE HEADLEE, Georgia Public
Broadcasting:
I think the biggest thing to
watch is turnout.

17:31.117 --> 17:35.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders has taken a risk
in playing
for the young vote here, and
especially young

17:35.554 --> 17:40.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
African-Americans, young
Hispanics. If they
turn out for him, he could do
better than

17:40.426 --> 17:45.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expected. If they don't, then,
as the polls
suggest, Clinton will take the
race here for

17:45.498 --> 17:47.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Democrats.

17:47.333 --> 17:51.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Donald Trump has a sizable
lead in the
polls as well. If the polls are
accurate,

17:51.837 --> 17:53.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump and Clinton will
take tonight
in Georgia.

17:53.973 --> 17:56.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Celeste, it's
Judy Woodruff.

17:56.642 --> 18:02.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tell us how Georgia differs from
its next-door
neighbor South Carolina, where
Clinton and

18:02.381 --> 18:06.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump both just absolutely wiped
out the opposition.

18:06.719 --> 18:13.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CELESTE HEADLEE: Well, you know,
Georgia is
a very diverse state.

18:13.459 --> 18:17.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Georgia is really on the leading
edge in the
changing demographics in this
state. In fact,

18:17.563 --> 18:21.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clarkston, Georgia, is known as
the most diverse
square mile in America.

18:21.667 --> 18:25.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This, however, is also the place
where the
Tea Party really got a lot of
its momentum

18:25.805 --> 18:31.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as well, so there's kind of a
number of forces
pulling and pushing. Also, in
reference to

18:31.877 --> 18:36.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the black vote, which really
helped carry
Clinton in South Carolina, this
is Dr. Martin

18:36.515 --> 18:40.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Luther King's home town. This is
a place where
the question of whether Clinton
can carry

18:40.419 --> 18:43.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the black vote nationally will
really be tested.

18:43.489 --> 18:47.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Clinton comes away with the
vast majority
of the black vote here in
Georgia, that means

18:47.259 --> 18:51.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
she can probably carry it
through the rest
of the nation. And in Georgia,
the bulk of

18:51.697 --> 18:56.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Democratic Party is made up
by African-Americans.
So, that's really something to
keep your eye

18:56.268 --> 18:57.770 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on here.

18:57.870 --> 19:04.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Celeste Headlee
with Georgia
Public Television, we thank you.

19:04.477 --> 19:09.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And much farther north, Senator
Bernie Sanders
is hoping to score a home field
advantage

19:09.315 --> 19:13.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in New England with contests in
Massachusetts
and his own home state of
Vermont.

19:13.986 --> 19:19.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we turn now to Emily Rooney
of public
TV station WGBH in Boston.

19:19.291 --> 19:21.160 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hi, Emily.

19:21.260 --> 19:25.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, tell us. We know Bernie
Sanders does have
a big advantage in Vermont, but
Massachusetts

19:25.631 --> 19:27.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is a little different, isn't it?

19:27.466 --> 19:30.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMILY ROONEY, WGBH: Yes, I mean,
I don't think
Massachusetts people have really
paid that

19:30.770 --> 19:34.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much attention to Bernie Sanders
until recently,
of course, the New Hampshire
primary.

19:34.874 --> 19:40.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there has been a huge, huge
media push
here, radio and television, and
it was locally

19:41.080 --> 19:45.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
oriented. It wasn't national
advertising.
It was local. And it's every
other advertisement,

19:45.684 --> 19:50.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all doing the Oscars, AM radio,
every other
commercial, so, personalized,
local, and I

19:51.090 --> 19:52.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
think very effective.

19:52.992 --> 19:58.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
About 20,000 Democrats, who were
enrolled
as Democrats, have switched
their party affiliation.

19:58.264 --> 20:02.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, that could be because they
want to kind
of offset what's going to happen
on the Republican

20:02.268 --> 20:05.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
side, but interesting that it's
kind of leveling
the playing field a little bit.

20:05.704 --> 20:07.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Emily, I want to ask
you. It's
Gwen.

20:07.840 --> 20:12.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to ask you about the
Elizabeth Warren
factor. There was a very odd
moment yesterday

20:12.111 --> 20:16.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in which someone fabricated a
"New York Times"
front page which suggested that
Emily -- that

20:16.816 --> 20:21.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Elizabeth Warren had endorsed
Bernie Sanders,
which did not happen, I want to
be clear.

20:21.587 --> 20:26.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But everybody has been kind of
watching the
shadow of the progressive
senator from Massachusetts,

20:26.158 --> 20:30.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
very popular progressive
senator, and the
fact that she seems to not have
gotten into

20:30.563 --> 20:32.364 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this at all.

20:32.465 --> 20:35.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CELESTE HEADLEE: No. No matter
how hard you
push Elizabeth Warren, she stays
silent. That's

20:35.468 --> 20:37.269 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been our experience right now.

20:37.369 --> 20:41.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's not waded into this at
all. Even our
very popular governor, Charlie
Baker, as you

20:41.841 --> 20:45.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, originally endorsed Chris
Christie.
He hasn't endorsed anyone right
now. And there

20:45.945 --> 20:50.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been a big push from the
editorial pages
for both of them to endorse
someone, but neither

20:50.816 --> 20:51.884 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
one of them has.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.719 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: OK.

20:53.819 --> 20:57.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, thank you very much, Emily
Rooney. As
always, you step in for us up
there in New

20:57.389 --> 20:58.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
England. We appreciate it so
much.

20:58.724 --> 21:00.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CELESTE HEADLEE: Thanks.

21:00.559 --> 21:04.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We turn now to
Virginia, a key
swing state this fall, where a
mother and

21:04.497 --> 21:08.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
daughter see the Democratic race
through very
different generational lenses.

21:08.601 --> 21:12.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AIYHA ABDELBAGI, Sanders
Supporter: My name
is Aiyha Abdelbagi. I'm 19 years
old. I live

21:12.838 --> 21:17.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Falls Church, Virginia, and
I'm advocating
for Bernie Sanders to be the
next president

21:17.143 --> 21:18.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the United States.

21:19.044 --> 21:22.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AHLAM ELSHAIB, Clinton
Supporter: My name
is Ahlam Elshaib. I'm the mother
of four children.

21:22.748 --> 21:29.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm voting for Mrs. Hillary
Clinton. I feel
like she has plenty of
experience.

21:29.522 --> 21:36.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Me and my daughter, Aiyha, we
love to talk
a lot about so many issues. We
have, like,

21:36.362 --> 21:39.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more than a mother and daughter
relationship.
We are friends.

21:39.498 --> 21:44.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AIYHA ABDELBAGI: I go to George
Mason University.
I'm in my second semester of
freshman year,

21:44.503 --> 21:50.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and I'm a government and
international relations
major. It takes me about an
hour-and-a-half

21:50.176 --> 21:51.777 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to get to school.

21:51.877 --> 21:55.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, lots of time, I usually like
the read
my textbooks, which I try to do.
But, if I

21:55.748 --> 21:58.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get bored, I read the newspaper.
I listen
to music.

21:58.384 --> 22:02.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I definitely would love to be
like a senator
or somewhere high up there. I
get like this

22:02.788 --> 22:06.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rush when I hear about politics
and watching
the news. It's my passion.

22:06.458 --> 22:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AHLAM ELSHAIB: I'm a stay-home
mother. My
day starts so early in the
morning. I start

22:14.033 --> 22:21.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do my job at home, cleaning,
cooking, prepare
their beds. When I came to the
United States,

22:21.807 --> 22:24.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for 14 years, I did not have any
health insurance.

22:24.944 --> 22:28.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AIYHA ABDELBAGI: We'd go to the
doctor, but
I would never see you at the
doctor or the

22:28.681 --> 22:30.482 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dentist. It makes sense now.

22:30.583 --> 22:35.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AHLAM ELSHAIB: Yes. And now I
feel, like,
happy to have Obamacare, very
important issues

22:35.688 --> 22:37.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that Mrs. Hillary is talking
about.

22:37.756 --> 22:41.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AIYHA ABDELBAGI: A lot of my
friends are government
majors. So, we sit and we
discuss like what's

22:41.393 --> 22:45.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going on around the world. We're
advocating
for what we think are solutions
to the main

22:45.664 --> 22:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
problems around the country.

22:47.733 --> 22:51.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
I will do everything that I can
to rid this

22:51.237 --> 22:54.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country of the ugly stain of
racism.

22:54.340 --> 22:56.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AIYHA ABDELBAGI: Bernie Sanders
came to George
Mason University.

22:57.009 --> 23:00.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a girl who went up
there. And she
asked him about the anti-Islamic
rhetoric

23:00.913 --> 23:05.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is being said. And he
embraced her in
a way that made me feel like he
was embracing

23:05.284 --> 23:06.986 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me.

23:07.086 --> 23:09.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's kind of scary, like, going
to school
wearing a scarf. There's always
like this

23:09.688 --> 23:14.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
paranoia that just follows you
around. And
when he was speaking, he was
like, "That shouldn't

23:14.426 --> 23:16.195 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
exist."

23:16.295 --> 23:20.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a college student who sees
her dad work
over 70 hours a week as a
taxicab driver and

23:20.165 --> 23:24.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as someone who has to get a job
just to cover
a little bit of school and extra
expenses,

23:24.937 --> 23:28.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's hard to not know why we're
not living
comfortably.

23:28.540 --> 23:33.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: I want
every kid in America
to know they will be able to go
to college

23:33.912 --> 23:36.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
regardless of the income of
their families.

23:36.782 --> 23:39.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AIYHA ABDELBAGI: Bernie, when he
says that
he wants the make college free,
it's a very

23:40.085 --> 23:42.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
personal issue, because I think
education
is important for everyone.

23:42.488 --> 23:48.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AHLAM ELSHAIB: With Hillary
Clinton, she makes
realistic ideas. She does not
just say she

23:48.227 --> 23:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will make college free. She says
that she
will make it affordable, which
is easier to

23:54.667 --> 23:56.602 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
believe, right? Yes. Uh-huh.

23:56.702 --> 24:00.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I am a proud lifelong fighter
for women's

24:00.773 --> 24:07.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issues, because I firmly believe
what's good
for women is good for America.

24:07.646 --> 24:09.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

24:09.548 --> 24:11.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AIYHA ABDELBAGI: As a future
politician, of
course I try to change my mom's
mind. I want

24:11.383 --> 24:14.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her to believe in what I believe
in, but I
think it's great that she has
her own opinions

24:14.186 --> 24:16.021 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as well.

24:16.121 --> 24:18.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is really important to see a
woman in the
White House. But it doesn't have
to be Hillary.

24:18.590 --> 24:20.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Like, I could be the Hillary of
tomorrow.

24:20.426 --> 24:23.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Quite a mother
and daughter
story.

24:23.462 --> 24:28.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And now we turn to Hari
Sreenivasan to see
what social media data may
reveal about today's

24:28.534 --> 24:30.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Super Tuesday vote.

24:30.202 --> 24:32.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thanks.

24:32.137 --> 24:35.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, voters in 11 states and
American Samoa
will raise their political voice
with delegates

24:35.841 --> 24:39.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the line in this year's race.
Will their
demographics and what's on their
mind give

24:40.079 --> 24:44.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us clues as to how they will
vote? Our data
team looked for clues in the
numbers.

24:44.616 --> 24:48.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to the census, more
than 60 million
Americans are old enough to vote
in Super

24:48.487 --> 24:53.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tuesday states. That's more than
a quarter
of the country's voting-age
population. And

24:53.158 --> 24:57.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in many ways, these voters offer
the widest
cross-section of America that we
have seen

24:57.196 --> 24:59.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so far this election cycle.

24:59.531 --> 25:04.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, the states voting
tonight include
a wide range of incomes.
Alaskans have a median

25:04.436 --> 25:10.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
household income of $71,000,
while Arkansan
households earn on average a
little more than

25:10.142 --> 25:14.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
$41,000. That's far less than
the national
median household income.

25:14.246 --> 25:18.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what information are these
households
searching for and talking about?
According

25:18.283 --> 25:23.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to data from Google News Lab,
Donald Trump
was the most searched-for
Republican candidate

25:23.455 --> 25:28.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
across Super Tuesday states.
When people in
today's contested states were
searching for

25:28.260 --> 25:32.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
information on the Democratic
candidates,
more people were searching for
Bernie Sanders

25:32.464 --> 25:34.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than Hillary Clinton.

25:34.333 --> 25:39.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Search results also showed a
geographic split.
Sanders' information was sought
in states

25:39.671 --> 25:45.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that were North and West, such
as Vermont,
Minnesota and Colorado, even
Texas and Oklahoma,

25:45.477 --> 25:50.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
while Clinton was being searched
for more
in places like Arkansas,
Georgia, Tennessee,

25:50.549 --> 25:52.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and even Virginia.

25:52.418 --> 25:56.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As in contests past, what's on
the mind of
the voter and the conversations
they share

25:56.622 --> 26:02.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
across social media depends on
where you look.
Across the Deep South,
Christianity was the

26:02.428 --> 26:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
biggest conversation driver on
Facebook in
relation to politics this
election cycle.

26:08.200 --> 26:13.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among Facebook users in Super
Tuesday states
overall, the most talked-about
topics were

26:13.505 --> 26:18.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
racism and discrimination,
followed by Christianity
and guns.

26:18.243 --> 26:22.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look north and to the
states west of
the Mississippi, the biggest
concerns were

26:23.048 --> 26:27.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Wall Street and financial
regulation. While
Facebook users nationwide
weren't talking

26:27.786 --> 26:33.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about this issue, they were
concerned about
the economy and jobs. And
further north, the

26:33.692 --> 26:38.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
most significant topic to
Alaska's Facebook
users was border security.

26:38.797 --> 26:41.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And now a bit of a
history lesson.

26:41.934 --> 26:46.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
William Brangham reports on how
Super Tuesday
has come to play a critical role
in the presidential

26:46.638 --> 26:50.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nomination process and why it
can make or
break candidates.

26:50.709 --> 26:53.779 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You know what
day it is.

26:53.879 --> 26:57.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Hello, Virginia.

26:57.649 --> 27:00.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I love you. I love Georgia.

27:00.586 --> 27:02.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
Minnesota can make history.

27:02.387 --> 27:04.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
God bless the great state of
Texas.

27:04.289 --> 27:06.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Super Tuesday,
the single
biggest voting day in the 2016
presidential

27:06.792 --> 27:09.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
primary contest. But what makes
it so super?

27:10.062 --> 27:14.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Well, it's been known to
effectively seal
the deal or signal the end for
candidates

27:14.600 --> 27:16.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
vying for their party's
nomination.

27:16.535 --> 27:20.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The primary
voting day political
pundits have been talking about
for months

27:21.006 --> 27:22.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
finally arrived today.

27:22.774 --> 27:26.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The first
modern-day Super
Tuesday happened in 1988, when a
whopping

27:26.478 --> 27:32.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
20 states, mostly in the South,
held primaries
on March 8 of that year. The
idea was inspired

27:32.384 --> 27:35.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by a group of moderate Southern
Democratic
governors who were frustrated by
what they

27:35.921 --> 27:39.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
felt was their lack of influence
in national
elections.

27:39.458 --> 27:42.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Larry Sabato directs the Center
for Politics
at the University of Virginia.

27:42.127 --> 27:43.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LARRY SABATO, Director,
University of Virginia
Center for Politics: They wanted
to try to

27:44.029 --> 27:48.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moderate the Democratic Party,
to move it
more to the center, so it could
win a national

27:48.667 --> 27:54.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election. And that was the
origin of Super
Tuesday, to put the Southern
states in the

27:54.306 --> 28:00.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
early part of the calendar, so
that, ideally,
in their view, a more moderate
candidate would

28:00.112 --> 28:03.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
receive a big boost from that
particular day's
voting.

28:03.382 --> 28:07.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But the plan
backfired.
The Southern governors hung
their hopes on

28:07.219 --> 28:12.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then Tennessee Senator Al Gore,
but he split
votes with Jesse Jackson, which
led then Massachusetts

28:13.058 --> 28:18.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Governor Michael Dukakis to
first-place finishes
in Texas and Florida, and
Dukakis went on

28:18.397 --> 28:20.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to become the nominee.

28:20.232 --> 28:25.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LARRY SABATO: The unintended
consequences
of reform. Their plan didn't
work, pure and

28:25.203 --> 28:30.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
simple. I think they were
surprised that Gore
didn't do better than he did,
and they weren't

28:30.876 --> 28:36.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
too keen on Michael Dukakis
either, who was
boosted at least as much by
Super Tuesday

28:36.848 --> 28:38.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as any other candidate.

28:38.750 --> 28:41.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Since then,
Super Tuesday
and the momentum that comes with
it has been

28:41.520 --> 28:43.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a good predictor of eventual
party nominees.

28:43.689 --> 28:45.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BOB DOLE (R), Former
Presidential Candidate:
I think the only Tuesday that's
going to be

28:45.757 --> 28:53.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more super than this Tuesday
will be Tuesday,
November 5. That's going to be
super.

28:53.332 --> 28:55.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

28:55.167 --> 28:56.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In 1996,
then-Republican
Senator Bob Dole swept the field
and forced

28:57.069 --> 29:02.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his then-rival, businessman
Steve Forbes,
to withdraw two days after their
Super Tuesday

29:02.140 --> 29:07.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
matchup. And, in 2000, then-Vice
President
Gore did the same. With 81
percent of Democratic

29:08.013 --> 29:12.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
delegates up for grabs on Super
Tuesday, he
effectively locked up the
nomination.

29:12.384 --> 29:17.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Gore's victory was a
sweet one.
The former Tennessee senator
swept all 11

29:17.889 --> 29:20.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
primary states and five
contested party caucuses.

29:20.726 --> 29:25.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And then 2008,
the Super
Duper Tuesday, when more than 20
states voted.

29:26.098 --> 29:29.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the results only predicted
the nomination
for one side.

29:29.267 --> 29:33.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Democrats Hillary
Clinton and
Barack Obama are pretty much in
the same position

29:33.805 --> 29:36.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they were when Super Tuesday
began.

29:36.141 --> 29:40.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Then-Senator
Barack Obama
narrowly edged out then-Senator
Hillary Clinton

29:40.112 --> 29:44.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the all-important delegate
count, but not
enough to clinch the nomination.

29:44.583 --> 29:48.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That same day, Senator John
McCain emerged
as the clear front-runner for
the Republicans.

29:48.420 --> 29:51.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), Arizona:
We're going
to win today, and we're going to
win the nomination,

29:51.790 --> 29:53.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and we're going to win the
presidency.

29:53.692 --> 29:58.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: On this Super
Tuesday, 10
states have both Republican and
Democratic

29:58.330 --> 30:03.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
primaries or caucuses with
delegates at stake.
And, yes, they're mostly in the
South.

30:03.468 --> 30:07.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans also have a caucus
in Alaska,
while Democrats will also caucus
in Colorado

30:07.639 --> 30:09.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and American Samoa.

30:09.541 --> 30:14.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LARRY SABATO: This is one of the
most important
days on the calendar. It has
come at a moment

30:14.913 --> 30:19.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when both parties are poised to
move in a
certain direction.

30:19.351 --> 30:23.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: On the
Democratic side,
Hillary Clinton has widened her
delegate lead

30:23.689 --> 30:28.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over Senator Bernie Sanders with
her dominating
win in South Carolina last
weekend. And Donald

30:28.760 --> 30:32.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump boasts a double-digit
margin over the
rest of the GOP field.

30:32.230 --> 30:38.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LARRY SABATO: It certainly will
be a milestone
along the way toward a Trump
nomination or,

30:38.370 --> 30:43.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
alternately, toward having one
of the other
candidates, possibly Marco
Rubio, begin to

30:43.809 --> 30:48.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suggest that he can catch up to
Trump or at
least force a contested
convention.

30:48.880 --> 30:54.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: A contested
convention?
Remember, Super Tuesday was
designed to prevent

30:54.386 --> 30:59.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just that. While that may be
working for the
Democrats, for the Republicans,
this Super

30:59.391 --> 31:01.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Tuesday may do just the
opposite.

31:01.526 --> 31:05.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham
in Washington, D.C.

31:05.397 --> 31:10.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it would not
be Super Tuesday
without the analysis of Shields
and Brooks.

31:10.268 --> 31:14.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and
New York Times columnist David
Brooks.

31:14.306 --> 31:15.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Gentlemen, welcome.

31:15.974 --> 31:19.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
No comments about hair or
anything else we
saw or heard in the last few
minutes.

31:19.377 --> 31:19.945 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

31:20.045 --> 31:21.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Wow. Wow.

31:21.913 --> 31:22.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, we have
heard about
past Super Tuesdays. What are
you looking

31:22.848 --> 31:23.648 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for tonight?

31:23.749 --> 31:25.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, Trump is the
story.

31:25.717 --> 31:28.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, Trump is one of the
biggest political
stories of our lifetime. And so
the fact that

31:29.020 --> 31:33.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- well, I'm supposed to be
objective, but
a bigoted buffoon may get the
nomination of

31:33.425 --> 31:37.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a major party is sort of a big
deal. Everywhere
I go all around the world,
people are fixated

31:37.629 --> 31:39.464 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on this fact.

31:39.564 --> 31:43.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, if he does what the
polls suggest,
that's just a major event in
American political

31:43.735 --> 31:46.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
life, if he takes this gigantic
step toward
the nomination of a major party.

31:46.404 --> 31:50.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Mark, I wonder if --
we just heard
the history of this and how we
came to this

31:51.076 --> 31:52.878 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
point.

31:52.978 --> 31:56.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wonder if that has something
to do with
where we are now. By creating a
Super Tuesday

31:56.181 --> 31:58.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that was supposed to come up
with a...

31:58.717 --> 32:00.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Moderate, yes.

32:00.152 --> 32:02.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: ... predetermined
result, that
it's backfiring now.

32:02.988 --> 32:04.790 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think it has.

32:04.890 --> 32:10.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, unintended consequences,
the law thereof.
It was organized by Chuck Robb,
the former

32:10.428 --> 32:16.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
governor of Virginia, son-in-law
of President
Johnson, to really stop the
Democratic Party

32:16.368 --> 32:21.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from drifting to the left. And
as William
described beautifully in that
piece, Jesse

32:21.740 --> 32:26.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jackson nearly showed how it
could be done
and became the model.

32:26.244 --> 32:31.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He upset the apple cart when
Michael Dukakis
in 1988 was supposed -- was able
to run what

32:31.283 --> 32:35.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they called a four-corners
strategy by winning
Florida and Texas and the state
of Washington

32:35.554 --> 32:37.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the Northeast as well.

32:37.622 --> 32:43.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it -- no, it has become --
the difference
between Super Tuesday and the
events that

32:43.495 --> 32:50.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
precede it is that all of Iowa,
New Hampshire,
even Nevada, they see the
candidates up close.

32:50.368 --> 32:52.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They can touch them. They can
listen to them.

32:52.437 --> 32:59.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now it's strictly wholesale
politics. It's
what voters conclude from what
they read,

32:59.911 --> 33:07.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see, sense, communicate about
them. And I
think that's -- Donald Trump has
shown depth

33:08.086 --> 33:14.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and strength in three different
states, in
winning New Hampshire and Nevada
and South

33:14.559 --> 33:16.294 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Carolina.

33:16.394 --> 33:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's showing a breadth now that
is really
rather remarkable. If he carries
Alabama and

33:21.266 --> 33:24.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Massachusetts in the same day,
it's been a
long time.

33:25.070 --> 33:26.805 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

33:26.905 --> 33:28.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Mitt Romney didn't
do as well
on Super Tuesday, nor did John
McCain, the

33:28.840 --> 33:33.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last two nominees, as it appears
that Donald
Trump is poised to do.

33:33.211 --> 33:38.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, David, can
we really blame
the calendar and Super Tuesday,
because -- is

33:38.350 --> 33:43.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the argument that if Donald
Trump had more
time, he wouldn't be as
appealing as he is?

33:43.288 --> 33:46.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I have been saying
that for
eight months, so, you know, I --
no, he's...

33:46.691 --> 33:47.792 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

33:47.893 --> 33:49.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And you have not
been proved right
yet.

33:49.561 --> 33:51.129 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

33:51.229 --> 33:54.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: It's coming,
sometimes in eight
years, when he's out of office.

33:54.699 --> 34:01.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No, it's -- I don't -- you know,
he's just
dominant. He's dominant with
moderate voters.

34:01.473 --> 34:05.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's dominant with downscale
voters. But he's
pretty dominant with upscale
voters. He's

34:05.477 --> 34:09.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beating people among Latino
voters, at least
those folks who vote in
Republican primaries.

34:09.447 --> 34:14.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's just amazingly dominant.
And it's fascinating.
The whole world is -- whole
media world is

34:14.519 --> 34:19.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hating on him, John Oliver and
everybody else.
It's having no effect, no
measurable effect.

34:19.925 --> 34:23.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I want to just
piggyback back
to that, because it seems
interesting to me,

34:23.595 --> 34:27.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David, that Republicans are
becoming more
conservative, Democrats,
according to exit

34:27.399 --> 34:31.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
polls we have already seen
tonight, are becoming
more liberal, and the twain
isn't meeting

34:31.436 --> 34:33.238 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
here at all.

34:33.338 --> 34:35.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. No, that's
true, though
Trump shows that there was more
ideological

34:35.273 --> 34:37.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
flexibility in the Republican
Party than we
would have thought.

34:37.776 --> 34:42.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here's a guy who is praising
Planned Parenthood,
whose policies on health care
are almost Sanders-esque

34:42.847 --> 34:47.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
sometimes. And so all the
orthodox candidates,
Bobby Jindal, gone.

34:47.385 --> 34:48.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Right.

34:48.653 --> 34:50.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And Ted Cruz is
now the closest
thing.

34:51.056 --> 34:56.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the couple races that I
think are interesting
to look at, obviously Texas. If
Cruz loses,

34:56.594 --> 35:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's gone. But if he wins, he
hangs around.
Georgia and Virginia, maybe
there is some

35:01.166 --> 35:05.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hope there we see somebody with
a strong second-place
finish, but, mostly, if the
polls are anywhere

35:06.071 --> 35:08.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
close to correct, we're just
looking for strong
second-place finishes in a
couple...

35:08.740 --> 35:12.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Mark, the
question people
keep asking is, what else could
Ted Cruz or

35:13.078 --> 35:17.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marco Rubio or any one of the
other candidates
who dropped out on the
Republican side, what

35:17.582 --> 35:22.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could they have done to have
nicked or stopped
or slowed down Donald Trump?

35:22.954 --> 35:24.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, they could
have engaged
him.

35:24.823 --> 35:29.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, let's be very blunt
about it. Jeb
Bush, now departed from the
race, was the

35:29.394 --> 35:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only candidate who showed really
any courage,
any directness in confronting
Donald Trump

35:35.066 --> 35:35.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and was aggressive.

35:36.001 --> 35:37.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But look where it
got him.

35:37.836 --> 35:40.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Now, Rubio did, in
an act of
desperation, very well. Don't
get me wrong.

35:40.672 --> 35:44.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He did a Donald Trump on Donald
Trump, is
what he did.

35:44.642 --> 35:50.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, when we start to get
into the size
of hands as a question of
presidents' qualifications,

35:50.782 --> 35:55.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, then we have really
descended. And
we have followed -- we can't say
that Donald

35:56.054 --> 35:59.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump has not elevated the
discourse in this.

35:59.290 --> 36:05.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, no, I just -- I think they
gave him a
ride. The rest of them were
sniping at each

36:05.163 --> 36:10.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other. Cruz was on Rubio. And
they were back
and forth, and at Jeb and so
forth. But, I

36:10.902 --> 36:15.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mean, nobody other than Jeb Bush
took him
on, and now the questions have
been raised,

36:15.240 --> 36:21.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether it's Trump University.
It's all been
out there, Judy. That is not new
information.

36:21.479 --> 36:27.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If somebody -- the oppo research
of every
campaign had it, but no one
wanted to bell

36:27.185 --> 36:31.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the cat or beard the lion or
whatever you
want to -- however you want to
describe it.

36:31.222 --> 36:35.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Our friend Amy
Walter was here
last night. And among other
things, she said

36:35.326 --> 36:41.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that if Donald Trump does as
well as people
expect him to tonight, it will
be an implosion

36:41.132 --> 36:44.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the Republican Party, it
will no longer
be what it ever was.

36:44.903 --> 36:46.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you agree with her on that,
David?

36:46.571 --> 36:48.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. Yes.

36:48.406 --> 36:52.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, we have never seen a
candidate at
all like him. He's not a
conservative by any

36:52.410 --> 36:58.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
principle. He's not a policy
wonk. He has
no policies and proposals. He
has -- and he

36:58.716 --> 37:03.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has, frankly, racial attitudes
that remind
you of the ugliness of an
earlier era of a

37:03.721 --> 37:05.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
different country.

37:05.690 --> 37:10.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that's just a gigantic
shift for a
party. And people are upset with
the establishment.

37:10.495 --> 37:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I realize that. But that doesn't
mean the
authoritarian solution is the
solution. But

37:15.400 --> 37:19.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there has been a rising sense of
authoritarianism
in the American people, which
has been measurable

37:19.304 --> 37:24.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in polls for a number of years,
and now it's
finding its political
efflorescence.

37:24.275 --> 37:27.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's talk about
the Democrats
for a minute, Mark.

37:27.278 --> 37:31.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton is looking like
she's in pretty
solid shape. But Bernie Sanders
says he's

37:31.783 --> 37:36.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not walking away. He says he's
staying in
this race until the end. He's
been running

37:36.121 --> 37:40.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around the country campaigning
everywhere.
What does he represent for her
at this point?

37:40.825 --> 37:43.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, he
represents her hope
and salvation.

37:43.828 --> 37:50.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, Hillary Clinton was a
great candidate
in 2008, when she was beaten,
when she was

37:50.235 --> 37:55.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an underdog, fighting back
against Barack
Obama, who was headed as a
steamroller toward

37:55.673 --> 38:00.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the nomination. That brought out
the -- the
Clintons do not do well in
political prosperity.

38:00.845 --> 38:03.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They don't do well when
unchallenged.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.450 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

38:05.550 --> 38:10.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And she became a
better candidate
after she lost New Hampshire.
Bernie Sanders

38:10.155 --> 38:13.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
raised $40 million last month.

38:13.158 --> 38:14.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

38:15.093 --> 38:17.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I mean, that is
phenomenal.
That is almost three times as
much as Hillary

38:18.029 --> 38:20.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Clinton made -- raised in the
month of January.

38:20.365 --> 38:27.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, so he represents, I
think, a hope
for her, in the sense that
there's a competition

38:27.138 --> 38:31.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that continues. If he wins a
couple of states
tonight, which they're holding
out hope that

38:31.876 --> 38:39.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they can, he's certainly alive.
He's got an
intense and passionate
following. And I think

38:39.284 --> 38:45.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's -- she's now referring to
him again as
her esteemed colleague, which is
an indication

38:45.523 --> 38:46.591 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
she thinks...

38:46.691 --> 38:48.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Because she's
attacking Trump
instead.

38:48.626 --> 38:50.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: But the reason she
has got this
big league is because of the
Democratic Party's

38:50.495 --> 38:54.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
equivalent of the House of
Lords, which is
what the superdelegates are.

38:54.365 --> 39:00.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, if you were once the
Democratic leader
of the city council in
Minneapolis, you're

39:01.039 --> 39:05.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be a super delegate, I
mean, for
no other deserving reason. And
so she's got

39:05.610 --> 39:09.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an enormous lead among them, so
leading among
the House of Lords. And the
question is, can

39:09.881 --> 39:12.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you win primaries? And she's
done pretty darn
well recently.

39:12.317 --> 39:18.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Are Democrats hoping
for and are
Republicans fearing the
potential for a third

39:18.389 --> 39:22.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
party, that Republicans say, we
can't have
this? We have had some leaders
say that already.

39:22.393 --> 39:24.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"I will not vote for either of
them."

39:24.562 --> 39:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then finding someone to
anoint and come
to the rescue -- and Democrats,
of course,

39:29.300 --> 39:30.902 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
would love that.

39:31.002 --> 39:32.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I still don't
think it
would happen. Obviously, Michael
Bloomberg

39:32.604 --> 39:34.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is the obvious case.

39:34.505 --> 39:39.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the states are basically
partisan. The
parties -- people are basically
locked into

39:39.644 --> 39:43.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their party ideology, even if
Donald Trump
is the nominee. So the idea that
Mike Bloomberg

39:43.781 --> 39:44.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or some third-party candidate...

39:44.682 --> 39:46.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Mitt Romney?

39:46.217 --> 39:48.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: That would be a
total implosion
for the Republican Party.

39:48.920 --> 39:52.724 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)
DAVID BROOKS: I doubt even he
could carry
any states, and then, even if
they did, it

39:52.824 --> 39:56.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would just get thrown to the
House of Representatives.
And a body made of entirely of
Republicans

39:56.961 --> 40:00.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Democrats is not going to
elect a non-Republican
or Democrat. So, I think there
will be no

40:00.732 --> 40:02.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
third party.

40:02.600 --> 40:05.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But isn't it not
really clear
which part of the Republican
Party Donald

40:05.637 --> 40:07.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump doesn't represent?

40:07.739 --> 40:12.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because they're -- you hear very
conservative
Republicans saying they don't
like him, and

40:12.610 --> 40:16.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
you hear more moderate
Republicans saying
they don't like him. So, who do
you run to

40:16.381 --> 40:18.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
satisfy the rest of the
Republican Party?

40:18.516 --> 40:20.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I -- I think
that's a very legitimate
question.

40:20.618 --> 40:25.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is -- whatever else he is,
he's his own
man. He walks where he chooses
to walk. He

40:25.290 --> 40:30.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doesn't truckle before any
particular constituency
in the Republican Party. I don't
care who

40:30.928 --> 40:33.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it is. So, in that sense, it's a
strength.

40:33.598 --> 40:38.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem that Republicans,
the sense of
panic among Republicans in
Washington is that

40:38.670 --> 40:43.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
he will be a disaster in
November and take
with him the Republican control
of the Senate

40:43.341 --> 40:48.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a lot of -- put in jeopardy
a lot of moderate
Republican House seats.

40:48.179 --> 40:52.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that's what they're
anxious about.
They think that this is not a
man who is going

40:52.150 --> 40:55.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to win a majority of the country
in a presidential
election in November.

40:55.987 --> 41:01.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You know, winners or
losers aside,
how would you guys assess the
tone of this

41:01.659 --> 41:03.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaign in the last couple of
weeks?

41:03.795 --> 41:07.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's certainly nothing like we
have ever seen,
and I wonder if you think that's
for good

41:07.598 --> 41:08.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or ill.

41:09.067 --> 41:10.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we won't let
you repeat
anything you have heard.

41:10.101 --> 41:10.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Nothing.

41:10.635 --> 41:11.069 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:11.169 --> 41:12.937 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
DAVID BROOKS: No.

41:13.037 --> 41:16.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's for ill. The Democratic
side is fine.
It's a normal race. You have
sort of moderate

41:16.274 --> 41:21.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vs. a lefty. But the way the
Republicans are
going after each other and the
screaming,

41:21.679 --> 41:24.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to me, some -- there was a pivot
point, which
is why I think this is such a
big moment in

41:25.083 --> 41:27.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
American politics. It was the
first debate.

41:27.218 --> 41:30.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump had already
attacked Carly Fiorina
for the way she looked. He then
turned to

41:30.922 --> 41:35.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rand Paul and said, "I'm not
going to attack
him for the way he looks, but
there's a lot

41:35.526 --> 41:36.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to work with there."

41:36.194 --> 41:37.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Right.

41:38.096 --> 41:41.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And so, at that
moment, a lot
of taboos just crumbled and
dissolved. And

41:41.899 --> 41:43.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we entered a new world.

41:43.935 --> 41:47.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As I have said on this program
before, Donald
Trump spent 25 years in the
world of professional

41:47.105 --> 41:51.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wrestling, and he just brought
that style.
And it happened to play. This is
not about

41:51.342 --> 41:55.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policy. This is about manners.
He was against
the manners that we have assumed
to be the

41:55.646 --> 42:00.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
manners of the public discourse.
And he's
dissolved them all. And it's
paid off for

42:00.785 --> 42:02.053 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
him so far.

42:02.153 --> 42:03.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, in the end, it
wasn't just
him doing it.

42:03.421 --> 42:05.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Oh, absolutely.
People had to
go there.

42:05.256 --> 42:07.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Rubio followed
him right down
that path.

42:08.025 --> 42:09.694 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

42:09.794 --> 42:11.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Rubio got bigger
crowds and
more enthusiasm, a bigger
reaction when he

42:12.063 --> 42:13.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
started doing it, too.

42:13.898 --> 42:19.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I would compare it to the
impeachment, the
language. You almost had to get
the children

42:19.904 --> 42:22.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out of the room when the news
came on in impeachment.

42:22.840 --> 42:24.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean the Bill
Clinton...

42:24.776 --> 42:29.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Bill Clinton's
impeachment and
all the surrounding events and
testimony there.

42:29.947 --> 42:35.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that was mercifully over.
You know, it
happened, and then it was
resolved. And then

42:36.020 --> 42:41.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we didn't have -- this is heroin
in the bloodstream,
I mean, because politics is the
most imitative

42:41.959 --> 42:45.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of all human activities, with
the possible
exception of political
journalism.

42:45.229 --> 42:47.198 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:47.298 --> 42:51.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And, you know,
people win elections.
And if you used a blue bumper
sticker to win,

42:51.536 --> 42:53.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my goodness, I'm going to use a
blue bumper
sticker.

42:54.005 --> 42:58.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is going to be it.
Donald Trump is
going to be -- you know, you
steal a hot stove

42:58.910 --> 43:04.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and go back to the smoke, you're
a child molester,
you're whatever else, I mean,
he's just kind

43:04.782 --> 43:07.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of taken all standards and
removed them.

43:07.351 --> 43:09.153 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's working.

43:09.253 --> 43:12.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And it's working.
I mean, that's
it. That's why I say it's like
success is

43:13.024 --> 43:13.458 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
emulated.

43:13.558 --> 43:15.293 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: OK.

43:15.393 --> 43:18.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Well, Mark Shields, David
Brooks, we will
be talking to you and watching
you, I don't

43:19.063 --> 43:20.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
know, eat your words or
whatever.

43:20.264 --> 43:20.798 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

43:20.898 --> 43:22.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Thank you.

43:22.800 --> 43:26.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tune in tonight for more Shields
and Brooks,
as I just said, plus the latest
results this

43:26.704 --> 43:39.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Super Tuesday. We will have
special PBS "NewsHour"
coverage at 11:00 p.m. Eastern.

43:39.317 --> 43:47.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
we take a
break from politics.

43:48.025 --> 43:52.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Four decades after the federal
government
established special education
services for

43:52.463 --> 43:56.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
students with disabilities,
school districts
around the country are still
trying to live

43:57.001 --> 44:02.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up to the law. Last week, we
showed you some
of the progress. But there are
still big challenges

44:02.707 --> 44:07.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ahead, and in some cases,
questions about
how well those efforts are
working.

44:07.879 --> 44:12.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent John
Tulenko of Education
Week has the second of two
stories he filed

44:12.984 --> 44:18.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from California. It's part of
our weekly education
series, Making the Grade, which
airs Tuesdays

44:19.023 --> 44:20.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the "NewsHour."

44:21.025 --> 44:25.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: In Los Angeles,
the nation's
second largest school system, it
took a class-action

44:26.030 --> 44:32.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lawsuit filed in 1993 to bring
attention to
the failures in special
education.

44:32.370 --> 44:37.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Teachers weren't trained,
records weren't
kept, and thousands of students
were not receiving

44:37.542 --> 44:39.277 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
services.

44:39.377 --> 44:43.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sharyn Howell, the district's
special education
director, says progress has been
made.

44:43.381 --> 44:45.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHARYN Howell, Special Education
Director,
Los Angeles Unified School
District: I think

44:45.349 --> 44:49.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have come a long ways. Even
at that point
in time in LAUSD and in other
school districts,

44:49.587 --> 44:55.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
special education was still
thought of as
this was a very separate group
of students

44:55.626 --> 44:59.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and most of them were in
segregated classes
someplace.

44:59.230 --> 45:05.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: But not anymore.
Today, many
of the problems have been
resolved, especially

45:05.369 --> 45:11.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when it comes to inclusion. In
2003, about
half of all students with
disabilities were

45:11.842 --> 45:17.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
taught alongside their
non-disabled peers
for the majority of the day. Now
it's 90 percent

45:17.448 --> 45:22.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for students with learning or
speech and language
disabilities.

45:22.186 --> 45:27.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For other special education
students, there's
still a ways to go.
Seventeen-year-old Leo

45:28.025 --> 45:33.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Villegas, who has Down syndrome,
spends most
of his day in a separate
classroom. But even

45:33.531 --> 45:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that's beginning to change.

45:35.633 --> 45:39.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSIE VILLEGAS, Mother: I want
Leo to be included
in the community. I don't want
Leo to be segregated

45:39.770 --> 45:41.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
all the time. I mean, come on.

45:41.806 --> 45:43.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Rosie Villegas is
Leo's mother.

45:43.774 --> 45:49.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSIE VILLEGAS: I want other
students or other
people to see Leo and accept Leo
the way he

45:49.614 --> 45:58.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is, even if it doesn't work, to
try.

45:58.356 --> 46:06.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: At his mother's
insistence,
Leo is in a few general
education classes

46:06.631 --> 46:11.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like economics, but not without
support.

46:11.435 --> 46:15.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Monet Gothard is with Leo all
day, helping
with his behavior and class
work.

46:15.673 --> 46:19.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MONET GOTHARD, Behavior
Intervention Therapist:
I was reading a story to him,
and then he

46:19.143 --> 46:21.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was answering reading
comprehension questions.

46:22.013 --> 46:28.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: How often is Leo
doing the same
things as the other students in
class?

46:28.419 --> 46:35.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MONET GOTHARD: Well, for it to
be meaningful
for Leo at the level that he's
at, the work

46:35.259 --> 46:37.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has to be modified.

46:37.161 --> 46:46.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSS KRAMER, Special Education
Teacher: It's
a good buzzword, gen ed. Put the
kids in gen

46:47.071 --> 46:49.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ed, gen ed, gen ed. I don't know
if it's for
everybody.

46:49.774 --> 46:54.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Most of the time,
Leo is in
Ross Kramer's class, together
with other students

46:54.712 --> 46:58.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with intellectual disabilities.

46:58.149 --> 47:07.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSS KRAMER: I don't, myself,
usually send
kids to general education unless
it's part

47:07.591 --> 47:09.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the meeting and the parents
insist on that
happening.

47:09.593 --> 47:11.395 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN TULENKO: Why?

47:11.495 --> 47:13.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSS KRAMER: Would I have sent
-- because
I don't think they could access
the curriculum

47:13.497 --> 47:18.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as well. A lot of the work is
being spoon-fed
and done to them. And what are
they retaining?

47:18.836 --> 47:20.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are they getting from that?

47:20.838 --> 47:23.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Others see it
differently.

47:23.841 --> 47:28.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHARYN HOWELL: That young man,
when he leaves
school, he's not going to a
special education

47:28.312 --> 47:32.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
job. He's not going to a special
education
movie theater. And so it's
important for our

47:32.917 --> 47:37.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
students to be in that community
of individuals
that they're going to spend the
rest of their

47:37.888 --> 47:39.857 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
life with when they leave us.

47:39.957 --> 47:44.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: With that in mind,
Los Angeles
has been phasing out schools
that serve only

47:44.729 --> 47:48.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
students with disabilities, like
McBride Special
Education Center.

47:48.999 --> 47:51.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There, we met Brandon Buschini.

47:51.569 --> 47:55.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Would you like to go to a
regular high school,
yes or no?

47:55.773 --> 48:00.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN TULENKO: Brandon, a
20-year-old high
school senior, has physical and
cognitive

48:00.978 --> 48:06.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
delays that prevent him from
walking and speaking.
He's been at McBride since he
was 3 years

48:06.717 --> 48:07.885 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
old.

48:07.985 --> 48:11.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BRANDON BUSCHINI, Student
(through computer
voice): No.

48:11.956 --> 48:17.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Ah. So you would
like to stay
here for school?

48:17.495 --> 48:22.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BRANDON BUSCHINI (through
computer voice):
Yes.

48:22.633 --> 48:24.902 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: His mother agrees.

48:25.002 --> 48:30.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDA HILTON, Mother: I'm not
against inclusion
at all. I actually wanted him to
be in a -- quote,

48:30.841 --> 48:34.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unquote -- "regular school" when
he was small.
It's just that, based on his
needs, it's the

48:34.712 --> 48:37.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- it's not the appropriate
place for him.

48:37.148 --> 48:41.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Brandon requires a
full-time
health care aide, in addition to
other assistance.

48:41.919 --> 48:47.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LINDA HILTON: He needs an
occupational therapist.
He needs a speech therapist. He
needs a teacher

48:47.691 --> 48:52.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's working with a speech
therapist to
be on the same page, an
environment that he

48:52.463 --> 48:58.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can access with his wheelchair.
And you don't
find that anywhere else.

48:58.135 --> 49:01.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHARYN HOWELL: All those things
are available.
We can make all those things
available in

49:02.072 --> 49:06.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a general education campus. Why
would we not
give those students an
opportunity to have

49:06.210 --> 49:08.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
exposure to their general
education peers?

49:08.512 --> 49:15.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDA HILTON: I would say that
their job is
to educate my child and my job
is to socialize

49:15.686 --> 49:21.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my child. A safe environment is
important,
and many of these other schools
just aren't

49:22.059 --> 49:24.061 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
safe.

49:24.161 --> 49:28.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Many buildings
aren't even accessible,
lacking basic accommodations
like ramps. Fixing

49:28.265 --> 49:34.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that could cost over a billion
dollars, twice
as much as what's been budgeted.

49:34.672 --> 49:39.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brandon's school is already
equipped, but
what about academics?

49:39.677 --> 49:41.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What are your education goals
for Brandon?

49:42.046 --> 49:46.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDA HILTON: Working with the
right teachers
to actually access Brandon,
because Brandon

49:46.750 --> 49:55.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is fully capable of
understanding in real
time, but due to his
developmental delays,

49:55.893 --> 50:00.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it makes it difficult for all of
us to communicate
with him.

50:00.464 --> 50:07.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: So, Brandon is
fully there.
Shouldn't he be taking regular
classes?

50:07.805 --> 50:13.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDA HILTON: It depends on the
teacher and
it depends on the services. So,
that's where

50:13.444 --> 50:15.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it becomes a little bit tricky.

50:15.379 --> 50:21.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Because getting
services isn't
easy, even for parents who
support inclusion.

50:21.218 --> 50:24.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSIE VILLEGAS: Constantly,
there is a fight
with the school district because
they're saying,

50:24.889 --> 50:27.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yes, we are providing service,
when they're
not.

50:27.791 --> 50:33.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, Leo has an hour of
speech a week.
So, first, I call and say, what
is the day

50:33.197 --> 50:37.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that my son is going to be
getting service?
I go there, and the speech
therapist is not

50:37.201 --> 50:38.936 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

50:39.036 --> 50:40.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ROSTETTER, Independent
Monitor, Los
Angeles Unified School District:
What you're

50:40.938 --> 50:45.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
raising here is Outcome 13.
Outcome 13 is
the measure the school district
has not been

50:45.876 --> 50:47.745 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
able to achieve.

50:47.845 --> 50:52.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: David Rostetter,
who was brought
in by the courts to monitor
special education

50:52.216 --> 50:58.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here, is referring to the final
requirement
of L.A.'s longstanding lawsuit:
At least 85

50:58.322 --> 51:01.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
percent of students must receive
100 percent
of their services.

51:01.592 --> 51:05.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ROSTETTER: The best the
district has
been able to do is to be, on
average with

51:05.963 --> 51:12.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
service provision, 72 percent of
the students
receive 100 percent of it. That
is absolutely,

51:12.670 --> 51:15.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
completely unacceptable.

51:15.572 --> 51:22.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Speech therapist
Ashley Hall
has 55 students between two
schools. That's

51:22.246 --> 51:28.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about 11 students per day, plus
at least an
hour for paperwork, parent
meetings and not

51:28.252 --> 51:30.020 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to mention lunch.

51:30.120 --> 51:33.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ASHLEY HALL, Speech Therapist:
So there are
days that we have to accommodate
the children

51:33.490 --> 51:37.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in different ways. So maybe a
child who you
would see one on one, or one on
two ends up

51:37.261 --> 51:41.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being in a group of children
with four or
five, and they don't necessarily
get the time

51:41.365 --> 51:43.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that they need.

51:43.233 --> 51:50.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lowering caseloads would be a
significant
help. I had about 36 students
when I was at

51:50.240 --> 51:55.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a private clinic, and we saw
success much
more rapidly because those
numbers were lower.

51:55.479 --> 52:00.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ROSTETTER: They lose
speech therapists
every year over this. You can't
perform in

52:00.818 --> 52:02.586 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that environment.

52:02.686 --> 52:06.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHARYN HOWELL: We know that, no
matter how
much work we do, there are
always going to

52:06.423 --> 52:10.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be teachers or administrators or
parents who
are going to push us and say,
what you're

52:10.594 --> 52:14.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doing is not right, and that's
OK, because
it makes us think about what
we're doing and

52:14.965 --> 52:19.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it makes us really make sure
that the programs
that we do have meet everybody's
needs.

52:19.436 --> 52:24.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN TULENKO: For Brandon
Buschini's family,
it's imperative he receives
services. His

52:24.508 --> 52:28.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mother and other parents have
turned to the
courts to keep schools like his
open.

52:28.645 --> 52:32.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDA HILTON: So, this kind of
speaks to the
level of the law-breaking.

52:32.816 --> 52:37.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: L.A. Unified
declined to comment
on the lawsuit, which is
awaiting a court

52:38.055 --> 52:41.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
decision on whether the case
will move forward.

52:41.492 --> 52:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

National

Institutes of Health classifies
as a rare
disease. But caring for a family
member with

53:10.721 --> 53:15.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a rare condition, and finding
support and
proper care, can be daunting.

53:15.793 --> 53:21.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We spent time with a Maryland
