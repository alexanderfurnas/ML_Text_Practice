JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:06.273 --> 00:07.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.274 --> 00:09.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

00:09.042 --> 00:12.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
It's the eve of the final
presidential debate.

00:12.246 --> 00:17.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton prepares behind
closed doors,
while we consider Donald Trump's
claims of

00:18.018 --> 00:19.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a media conspiracy.

00:19.920 --> 00:24.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Tuesday,
John Yang reports from Nevada,
where a Republican

00:24.057 --> 00:28.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
split on Donald Trump creates a
close race
for a crucial Senate seat.

00:28.428 --> 00:34.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, as the
international community
struggles with a refugee crisis,
how Uganda

00:34.067 --> 00:38.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is becoming one of the most
welcoming countries
for those fleeing conflict.

00:38.071 --> 00:42.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Camps tend
to confine
people, whereas, in Uganda, when
refugees

00:42.576 --> 00:48.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
arrive, they are issued legal
I.D.s that entitle
them to move freely anywhere in
the country

00:48.181 --> 00:51.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to find a job, start a business,
put their
children in school.

00:51.985 --> 00:54.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:54.421 --> 00:58.725 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:58.759 --> 01:11.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's three weeks
to go until
Election Day, just 24 hours
until the last

01:11.772 --> 01:17.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
presidential debate, and charges
of vote fraud
and media bias are swirling.

01:17.477 --> 01:22.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the current occupant of
the White House
dismissed such talk, and rebuked
the candidate

01:22.816 --> 01:27.821 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
behind it.

01:27.854 --> 01:33.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a Rose Garden welcome for
the Italian
prime minister, and President
Obama used it

01:33.427 --> 01:36.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to call out Donald Trump on his
claims of
a rigged election.

01:37.030 --> 01:39.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
You start whining before the
game is even

01:39.333 --> 01:43.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over, if whenever things are
going badly for
you or you lose, you start
blaming somebody

01:43.470 --> 01:47.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
else, then you don't have what
it takes to
be in this job.

01:47.674 --> 01:51.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Trump shot back
this afternoon
in Colorado Springs.

01:51.044 --> 01:54.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
But they even want to try and
rig the election

01:55.015 --> 01:59.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the polling booths, where so
many cities
are corrupt, and you see that.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And voter fraud is all too
common.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then they criticize us for
saying that.

02:03.757 --> 02:07.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Running mate Mike
Pence joined
in.

02:07.094 --> 02:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Visiting Republican Party
offices in rural
North Carolina that were
firebombed over the

02:12.866 --> 02:19.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weekend, he insisted voter fraud
is a reality,
and called for voters to be on
the lookout.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.907 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

02:20.941 --> 02:22.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE PENCE (R-IN), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
Donald Trump and I are
encouraging all of

02:22.776 --> 02:27.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our supporters around the
country and frankly
American, whatever their
politics, to take

02:27.681 --> 02:34.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the opportunity to be involved
in a respectful
way in providing accountability
at our polling

02:34.087 --> 02:35.922 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
places.

02:35.956 --> 02:40.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Pence also
complained of media
bias and what he called scant
coverage of

02:40.227 --> 02:42.029 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
negative news about Clinton.

02:42.062 --> 02:48.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The latest such news involved
communications
between the FBI and a senior
State Department

02:48.335 --> 02:52.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
official who wanted one of
Clinton's e-mails
reclassified.

02:52.739 --> 02:54.641 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It wasn't.

02:54.674 --> 03:00.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But last night in Green Bay,
Wisconsin, Trump
charged there's collusion in the
Obama administration

03:00.414 --> 03:02.382 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to help Clinton.

03:02.416 --> 03:08.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The candidate's wife, Melania,
was on CNN,
claiming that the sexual assault
allegations

03:08.388 --> 03:10.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against her husband are not
true.

03:10.357 --> 03:11.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MELANIA TRUMP, Wife of Donald
Trump: I believe
my husband.

03:11.658 --> 03:13.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I believe my husband.

03:13.126 --> 03:15.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This was all organized from the
opposition.

03:15.429 --> 03:21.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Former "People"
magazine writer
Natasha Stoynoff is one of the
accusers.

03:21.334 --> 03:24.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She stated that Trump forced
himself on her
in 2005.

03:24.905 --> 03:31.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, today, the publication
reported that
six of her colleagues and close
friends corroborate

03:31.278 --> 03:33.080 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
her account.

03:33.113 --> 03:39.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Clinton remained out
of the public
eye today, even as poll after
poll offered

03:39.052 --> 03:40.854 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
her good news.

03:40.887 --> 03:46.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Washington Post reported she
has a clear
advantage in the latest survey
of battleground

03:46.093 --> 03:47.894 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
states.

03:47.928 --> 03:54.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a USA Today poll found 68
percent of young
voters favor the Democratic
nominee, to 20

03:54.201 --> 03:55.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
percent for Trump.

03:56.002 --> 04:01.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of this sets the stage for
tomorrow night's
third and final encounter
between the two

04:01.274 --> 04:03.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nominees, this one in Las Vegas.

04:03.710 --> 04:08.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the day's
other news:
Iraqi forces slowed their
advance on Mosul

04:08.181 --> 04:12.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in its second day, as they
reached larger
towns on the outskirts.

04:12.853 --> 04:16.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Humanitarian groups warned the
city's one
million people could face a
disaster.

04:16.790 --> 04:19.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But President Obama said plans
are in place
to avert a crisis.

04:19.860 --> 04:22.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will explore the situation in
Mosul later
in the program.

04:22.596 --> 04:28.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next door in
Syria, Russian
halted strikes on Aleppo today,
ahead of their

04:28.335 --> 04:32.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
call for a short-term stop to
all fighting
on Thursday.

04:32.739 --> 04:36.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's meant to allow humanitarian
aid into
that ravaged city.

04:36.476 --> 04:41.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in Moscow, the Russian
defense minister
warned militant groups to
evacuate when the

04:41.748 --> 04:43.617 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fighting stops.

04:43.650 --> 04:46.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SERGEI SHOIGU, Russian Defense
Minister (through
translator): We call on the
leadership of

04:46.086 --> 04:50.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
countries that have influence
over armed groups
in Eastern Aleppo to convince
their leaders

04:50.123 --> 04:52.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to stop military action and
abandon the city.

04:52.959 --> 04:57.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everyone truly interested in the
fastest possible
stabilization should take
genuine political

04:57.631 --> 05:00.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
steps and not continue shuffling
political
papers.

05:00.700 --> 05:04.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thursday's pause
in the fighting
is set to last eight hours.

05:04.471 --> 05:09.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A United Nations spokesman
complained today
that that's not nearly enough
time to get

05:09.809 --> 05:12.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
humanitarian convoys in and out
of Aleppo.

05:12.712 --> 05:16.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A temporary
halt to the
fighting in Yemen is also in the
works.

05:16.583 --> 05:21.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The country's warring factions
agreed today
to a 72-hour cease-fire,
beginning shortly

05:21.188 --> 05:23.023 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
before midnight Wednesday.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's to allow much-needed
humanitarian aid
to be delivered.

05:25.659 --> 05:30.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Iran, a court
has sentenced
an Iranian-American businessman
and his father

05:30.730 --> 05:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to 10 years in prison each.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Siamak Namazi was detained a
year ago.

05:36.603 --> 05:40.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His 80-year-old father was
arrested in February.

05:40.073 --> 05:44.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today's announcement says they
were sentenced
for -- quote -- "cooperating
with the hostile

05:44.077 --> 05:45.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
government of America."

05:46.012 --> 05:48.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Back in this
country, for
a fifth straight year, Social
Security recipients

05:49.015 --> 05:52.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and federal retirees will get
just a tiny
bump in benefits.

05:52.953 --> 05:57.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The annual cost-of-living hike
announced today
is three-tenths of a percent.

05:57.390 --> 06:01.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The average monthly Social
Security payment
is $1,238.

06:01.628 --> 06:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That means the increase for the
coming year
will be less than $4 a month.

06:06.466 --> 06:11.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wall Street moved
higher today,
thanks to some strong earnings.

06:11.238 --> 06:15.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 75
points to close near 18162.

06:15.508 --> 06:21.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 44 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added 13.

06:21.281 --> 06:25.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And the
original ruby slippers
from "The Wizard of Oz" will get
a makeover

06:25.552 --> 06:28.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if the Smithsonian can raise
$300,000.

06:28.388 --> 06:32.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's asking the public to help
on the crowdfunding
Web site Kickstarter.

06:32.559 --> 06:37.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The ruby slippers are nearly 80
years old,
and showing their age, at the
National Museum

06:37.297 --> 06:39.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Natural History in
Washington.

06:39.199 --> 06:44.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The institution wants to repair
them and build
a new display.

06:44.070 --> 06:48.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what's driving
the idea that the media is
rigging the election;

06:48.575 --> 06:53.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a tight race in Nevada as
Democrats try to
take back the Senate; the
looming humanitarian

06:53.913 --> 07:08.762 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
crisis in Iraq; and much more.

07:08.795 --> 07:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Claims of news media bias in
politics are
certainly nothing new.

07:13.199 --> 07:18.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what of Donald Trump's
accusation that
the press is actually
responsible for rigging

07:18.204 --> 07:21.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the presidential election
against him?

07:21.274 --> 07:25.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To explore that notion, we are
joined by Jim
Rutenberg, media columnist for
The New York

07:25.545 --> 07:27.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Times, and Robert Lichter.

07:28.014 --> 07:33.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's director of the center for
Media and
Public Affairs at George Mason
University.

07:33.353 --> 07:35.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

07:35.422 --> 07:37.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm going to start with you,
Robert Lichter.

07:37.757 --> 07:41.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump is saying that the
media -- and
I'm quoting -- is being -- that
the election

07:41.895 --> 07:48.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is being rigged by what he calls
the dishonest,
distorted media pushing Hillary
Clinton.

07:48.034 --> 07:51.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have studied the American
media for, what,
decades?

07:51.871 --> 07:54.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is there a grain of truth to
what he says?

07:54.841 --> 07:57.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT LICHTER, George Mason
University: Well,
when people say the media are
biased, they

07:57.644 --> 08:02.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
usually mean somebody is getting
too much
attention, more than he
deserves, and his

08:02.415 --> 08:04.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coverage is more favorable than
he should
get.

08:04.751 --> 08:06.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Donald Trump is a news magnet.

08:06.653 --> 08:10.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He gets more attention than
anybody else,
but a lot of that attention
compares him either

08:10.924 --> 08:12.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with Hitler or Mussolini.

08:12.692 --> 08:17.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So studies show what our eyes
see, that Trump
gets a lot of coverage, that his
coverage

08:17.897 --> 08:19.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is very negative.

08:19.733 --> 08:23.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has managed the considerable
feat of getting
more negative coverage than
Hillary Clinton,

08:23.169 --> 08:25.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who has issues in her own right.

08:25.972 --> 08:28.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that -- so you could
make a case that
there is bias.

08:28.708 --> 08:36.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the question is whether
the traditional
definitions of bias apply to
such a nontraditional

08:36.349 --> 08:37.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
candidate as Donald Trump.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jim Rutenberg,
how do you see
this?

08:39.786 --> 08:42.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You write about this stuff
frequently for
The Times.

08:42.255 --> 08:46.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM RUTENBERG, The New York
Times: I think
I would agree with that
assessment to a degree.

08:46.326 --> 08:50.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One thing is, though, that
Donald Trump's
candidacy has been so amazing
and has been

08:50.563 --> 08:54.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
such -- it has had such a
can't-look-away
quality, because he says things
that we're

08:54.167 --> 08:57.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not used to hearing from the
standard-bearer
oft Republican Party.

08:57.470 --> 09:03.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, to the extent that some of
the things
are about the appearances of
women, what have

09:03.243 --> 09:08.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you, what we just heard on the
"Access Hollywood"
leaked tape of him discussing
his behavior

09:08.181 --> 09:13.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with women, was at best
descriptions of groping,
there's going to be a reaction
to it.

09:13.520 --> 09:16.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The press is going to cover
that, and it's
going to, yes, be negative, but
it is also

09:16.656 --> 09:18.324 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what it is.

09:18.358 --> 09:21.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's a pretty accurate
description of what
he said in that tape, for
instance.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's take
this a little
bit further.

09:23.897 --> 09:28.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What Donald Trump -- Bob
Lichter, what Donald
Trump is saying is that the
media is in collusion

09:28.735 --> 09:30.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with the Clinton campaign.

09:30.737 --> 09:34.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What evidence is there that that
could possibly
be true?

09:34.507 --> 09:38.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT LICHTER: Well, they have
been so nice
to her about her e-mails, I
think, is a piece

09:38.344 --> 09:40.146 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of evidence.

09:40.180 --> 09:43.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's perfectly obvious, and,
again, studies
show that her coverage is more
negative than

09:43.850 --> 09:44.784 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
positive.

09:44.818 --> 09:45.785 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
There's been...

09:45.819 --> 09:46.786 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

09:46.820 --> 09:48.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wait a minute.

09:48.688 --> 09:53.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was one story about a
member of the
Clinton organization passing
along information

09:53.092 --> 09:54.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ahead of a debate.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.128 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is that right?

09:55.161 --> 09:56.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT LICHTER: Right.

09:56.162 --> 09:57.130 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

09:57.163 --> 09:58.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There was that one story.

09:58.164 --> 09:59.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

09:59.999 --> 10:02.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT LICHTER: And then there
is the issue
of her not turning these over,
which has been

10:02.068 --> 10:05.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
raised many, many times by
Donald Trump and
by journalists.

10:05.738 --> 10:11.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think they're just -- there
isn't a case
that can be made that the media
has gone soft

10:11.611 --> 10:12.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Hillary Clinton.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's not getting great coverage
either.

10:14.414 --> 10:19.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, in fact --
and Bob Lichter
just referred to this, Jim
Rutenberg -- the

10:19.619 --> 10:24.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
media, especially television
media, can be
credited for giving Donald Trump
a lot of

10:24.891 --> 10:28.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
airtime, a lot of print space
during the primary
period.

10:28.761 --> 10:34.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM RUTENBERG: I mean, this
drove his Republican
competitors for the nomination
crazy.

10:34.200 --> 10:38.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there was one analysis that
my newspaper
wrote about where the figure
that was used

10:38.538 --> 10:42.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in terms of -- quote, unquote --
"free media"
-- this was the value of the
extra airtime

10:42.175 --> 10:44.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he got from the news networks --
was some
$2 billion.

10:44.944 --> 10:46.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No candidate came close.

10:46.613 --> 10:48.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So he draws the cameras.

10:48.147 --> 10:49.482 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It can be a good thing for him.

10:49.516 --> 10:50.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sometimes, it's a bad thing for
him.

10:50.917 --> 10:52.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Right now, it's not going so
well.

10:52.852 --> 10:56.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you put
this in historical
perspective, Bob Lichter?

10:56.523 --> 11:00.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know the role of the press
has changed
in this country.

11:00.226 --> 11:08.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you have talked about
how, 17th, 18th
centuries, we had a partisan
press in the

11:08.034 --> 11:09.802 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
United States.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT LICHTER: Yes, Donald
Trump should go
back a couple of hundred years
and see the

11:11.037 --> 11:13.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nasty things that were said
about Adams and
Jefferson.

11:13.373 --> 11:18.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's only the 20th century that
the press
has taken on the role of being
an objective

11:18.278 --> 11:22.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
arbiter, trying to be fair and
balanced and
objective.

11:22.682 --> 11:28.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in a way, it releases
journalists from
the responsibility of saying I'm
presenting

11:28.421 --> 11:31.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this from my point of view, sort
of nobody's
point of view.

11:31.257 --> 11:32.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm being fair all around.

11:32.792 --> 11:35.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump makes that really
hard to do.

11:35.061 --> 11:38.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is man who insults members
of his own
party.

11:38.464 --> 11:39.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He bullies his opponents.

11:39.799 --> 11:43.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He says things that are
demonstrably untrue.

11:43.136 --> 11:48.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you do with that as a
journalist to
be objective without becoming
negative in

11:48.374 --> 11:50.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a way that opens you to charges
of media bias?

11:50.610 --> 11:55.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Trump has done a good
job of kind
of defanging the media, to some
degree.

11:55.181 --> 11:59.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Jim
Rutenberg, you have
also written about how Donald
Trump has singled

11:59.519 --> 12:04.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out the press at his campaign
rallies, to
the point where members of the
press have

12:04.991 --> 12:07.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
felt uncomfortable and worse.

12:07.827 --> 12:13.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM RUTENBERG: Well, two major
networks are
now using security at his
rallies.

12:13.533 --> 12:17.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's kind of, he will direct
the crowd
at the assembled press.

12:17.370 --> 12:21.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have covered many rallies
in my career
where that hasn't happened, with
the exception

12:21.641 --> 12:26.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of maybe Sarah Palin kind of
toward the end
of '08 and when she was kind of
flirting with

12:26.379 --> 12:28.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
her own presidential run.

12:28.181 --> 12:31.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And other colleagues I have
talked to who
are much older than I am refer
me back the

12:31.818 --> 12:34.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
George Wallace and some of his
rallies were
tense.

12:34.654 --> 12:36.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the National Guard was there
protecting
the press.

12:36.689 --> 12:41.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this is the insane territory
to be in,
as a country right now, where
this is a conversation

12:41.661 --> 12:43.429 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we're having.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jim Rutenberg,
staying with
you, I want to come back to
something you

12:45.398 --> 12:51.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quoted this week in one of your
columns, a
senior editor at the Web site
American Conservative,

12:51.838 --> 12:54.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and he -- it's Rod Dreher, I
think is how
you say his name.

12:54.974 --> 13:00.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said: "Mainstream journalists
are interested
in every kind of diversity,
except the kind

13:00.713 --> 13:03.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that would challenge their own
prejudices.

13:03.416 --> 13:08.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those include bigotry against
conservative
religion, bigotry against rural
folks and

13:08.588 --> 13:11.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bigotry against working-class
and poor white
people."

13:11.958 --> 13:13.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's pretty sweeping, isn't
it?

13:13.893 --> 13:18.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM RUTENBERG: It's a sweeping
generalization,
but, that said, I think, look,
we're not perfect.

13:18.731 --> 13:22.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And for what most of our
conversations so
far have been a defense of the
press, but

13:22.568 --> 13:24.404 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the press -- let's face it.

13:24.437 --> 13:27.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A big part of the country is
primed to believe
what Donald Trump is telling
them about the

13:27.440 --> 13:28.641 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
press.

13:28.675 --> 13:30.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the press needs to
definitely take a look
at itself.

13:30.209 --> 13:32.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And look, there is something to
it.

13:32.045 --> 13:36.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a cultural mind-set
that I think
even goes across the kind of
ideological divide

13:36.115 --> 13:37.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the mainstream news media.

13:37.884 --> 13:41.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Wall Street Journal
editorial page and
The New York Times editorial
page agree on

13:41.354 --> 13:46.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
certain things like free trade
that this crowd
feels is, you know, threatening
their livelihoods

13:46.693 --> 13:48.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and their country.

13:48.461 --> 13:54.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At the same time,
we know that
-- you have talked, Robert
Lichter, about

13:54.567 --> 14:01.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the need for American --
frankly, for journalists
to rethink the way we write
about, not just

14:01.074 --> 14:04.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump, but the people who
have been
supporting Donald Trump.

14:04.243 --> 14:09.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT LICHTER: Yes, I think Jim
Rutenberg
was quite right that
journalists, national

14:09.916 --> 14:13.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
media journalists are kind of
part of an elite.

14:13.519 --> 14:17.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they know government elites,
they know
business elites.

14:17.957 --> 14:20.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's these elites that
Donald Trump is
running against.

14:20.860 --> 14:27.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as a result, he stirs the
populism of
his supporters, who also feel
that the elites

14:27.200 --> 14:32.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are running away with the
country, although
I think it's overstated to say
that these

14:32.271 --> 14:33.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are kind of peasants with
pitchforks.

14:33.906 --> 14:39.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there is a kind of bias
in that portrayal
of his supporters.

14:39.979 --> 14:43.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are some of those people,
but he obviously
wouldn't be running in the
40-odd percent

14:43.983 --> 14:47.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the public with nobody like
-- with everybody
like that.

14:47.086 --> 14:49.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: No question about
that.

14:49.489 --> 14:50.656 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Robert Lichter, we thank you.

14:50.690 --> 14:53.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jim Rutenberg with The New York
Times, thank
you both.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JIM RUTENBERG: Thanks so much.

14:54.927 --> 15:00.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: From the press,
we turn to
Nevada for the "NewsHour"'s
latest on-the-ground

15:00.099 --> 15:02.001 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
report.

15:02.034 --> 15:06.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A split amongst Republicans,
paired with sluggish
growth in construction, means
that jobs are

15:06.105 --> 15:10.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
front and center, and a key
Senate race is
now in play.

15:10.309 --> 15:12.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang reports.

15:12.245 --> 15:16.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of our continuing

and opportunity in America,
Chasing the Dream.

JOHN YANG: The sun rises over
the Nevada Desert,
one day closer to the election.

15:27.026 --> 15:29.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEIDI HARRIS, Radio Talk Show
Host: Why don't
we just change the name to
groper in chief?

15:29.195 --> 15:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And Heidi Harris is
talking to
the biggest audience of any Las
Vegas morning

15:33.933 --> 15:35.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
radio talk show host.

15:35.835 --> 15:42.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A hot topic, the very tight
Senate contest
between Republican Joe Heck and
Democrat Catherine

15:42.575 --> 15:43.543 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Cortez Masto.

15:43.576 --> 15:46.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HEIDI HARRIS: I tried to watch
Heck and Masto.

15:46.045 --> 15:47.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I tried to watch it.

15:47.046 --> 15:48.014 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I did.

15:48.047 --> 15:50.049 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

15:50.082 --> 15:50.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE HECK (R-NV), Senatorial
Candidate: Therefore,
I cannot in good conscience
continue to support

15:50.516 --> 15:52.251 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump.

15:52.285 --> 15:56.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Heck shook up the
race when he
jumped off the Donald Trump
bandwagon after

15:57.023 --> 16:03.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the now-infamous "Access
Hollywood" tape surfaced,
one of more than a dozen
Republicans in tough

16:03.930 --> 16:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
congressional races to withdraw
their support.

16:07.166 --> 16:11.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now some Trump supporters say
they're dumping
Heck, like this caller to the
Heidi Harris

16:11.971 --> 16:12.939 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
show.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CALLER: It's time to send a
message.

16:14.307 --> 16:19.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We put Donald Trump there for a
reason, and
that's how I feel.

16:19.345 --> 16:25.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will be voting for Donald and
the ballot
questions, but not for Joe Heck.

16:25.618 --> 16:30.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Harris, a reluctant
Trump supporter,
says she hears that a lot from
listeners.

16:30.223 --> 16:33.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEIDI HARRIS: I don't know that
many of them
are going to vote for her
instead of him,

16:33.693 --> 16:37.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Catherine Cortez Masto, but I
think they're
going to stay home and not vote
for Heck,

16:37.096 --> 16:38.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which essentially gives her a
free vote.

16:38.998 --> 16:44.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: With early voting
beginning Saturday,
it's become a big campaign
issue.

16:44.070 --> 16:48.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Heck was pressed on his
about-face last week
in a televised debate.

16:48.074 --> 16:50.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said it was a personal
decision.

16:50.276 --> 16:52.144 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE HECK: As an emergency
department doctor,
I have taken care of far too
many women who've

16:53.279 --> 16:57.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
been victims of domestic
violence or sexual
assault.

16:57.049 --> 17:03.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have great empathy for
anyone who ever
had to experience such a
tragedy.

17:03.155 --> 17:05.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My wife was a victim of domestic
abuse in
a prior relationship.

17:05.691 --> 17:08.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Cortez Masto wasn't
buying it.

17:08.327 --> 17:09.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO (D),
Nevada Senatorial
Candidate: Let's call this for
what it is.

17:09.896 --> 17:12.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congressman Heck was worried
about his political
career.

17:12.465 --> 17:17.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It was Heck's last
public appearance
before leaving for a week-long
Army Reserve

17:17.236 --> 17:20.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
assignment at the Pentagon,
where he's General
Heck.

17:20.840 --> 17:26.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nevada's desert and mountains
can feel remote,
but its politics are
surprisingly typical.

17:26.646 --> 17:33.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Since 1908, it has failed to
vote for winner
of the White House just once.

17:33.152 --> 17:36.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this year, it may decide who
controls
the Senate.

17:36.255 --> 17:41.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Analysts say it's the
Republicans' best shot
at winning a Democratic-held
seat.

17:41.294 --> 17:44.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's attracting outsized
interest and money.

17:44.330 --> 17:46.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: Who else has sunk
millions in to
elect Joe Heck?

17:47.033 --> 17:53.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Nearly $49 million
worth of ads
from outside groups, many in
Spanish in this

17:53.139 --> 17:58.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
state that's about 30 percent
Latino.

17:58.344 --> 18:03.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whoever wins this race will
become only the
fifth person to elected to the
seat since

18:03.082 --> 18:10.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
1933, replacing Senate
Democratic Leader Harry
Reid, who's retiring after 30
years.

18:10.957 --> 18:15.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Heck served in the Nevada state
Senate and
was elected to the House in
2010.

18:15.661 --> 18:21.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cortez Masto is a former federal
prosecutor
and two-term Nevada attorney
general.

18:21.400 --> 18:25.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even before his un-endorsement,
Heck said
he disagreed with Trump's
remarks about women

18:25.972 --> 18:27.840 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and minorities.

18:27.873 --> 18:33.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week, CNN published an
audiotape of Heck,
authenticated by his campaign,
at closed-door

18:33.479 --> 18:34.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Las Vegas fund-raiser.

18:34.714 --> 18:35.681 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

18:35.715 --> 18:36.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOE HECK: I want to support him.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I really do, but he has got to
change his
tone.

18:38.617 --> 18:41.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's got to be -- I don't
want to make
him into a politician or make
him into the

18:41.454 --> 18:45.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
same thing that he is running
against.

18:45.124 --> 18:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he has got to realize that
he is not going
to win this race by appealing to
the 20 percent

18:53.599 --> 18:56.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or 30 percent of the Republican
base.

18:56.702 --> 19:02.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Gun store owner Bob
Irwin, a Republican
backing Trump, says he's
disappointed by Heck's

19:02.608 --> 19:04.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
decision, blaming Heck's
campaign managers.

19:04.910 --> 19:11.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB IRWIN, Gun Store Owner: The
new guys are
trying to make a politician out
of him.

19:11.917 --> 19:13.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's not a politician.

19:13.719 --> 19:20.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought he should just simply
rise above
the fray and talk about
Obamacare and creating

19:20.126 --> 19:24.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
jobs by changing the tax
structure to bring
businesses into the country.

19:24.397 --> 19:28.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But he says he will
still vote
for Heck.

19:28.300 --> 19:33.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iowa Republican Senator Joni
Ernst, a Trump
supporter standing in for Heck
while he's

19:33.906 --> 19:37.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Reserve duty, seemed to open
the door to
ticket-splitting.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.045 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

19:39.078 --> 19:41.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONI ERNST (R), Iowa: We need to
separate
the presidential race from what
is really

19:41.080 --> 19:44.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
important right now, the United
States Senate
race as well.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's what Joe is running for.

19:46.652 --> 19:52.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Cortez Masto welcomes
Hillary Clinton's
embrace, appearing with her last
week in Las

19:52.158 --> 19:53.926 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Vegas.

19:53.959 --> 19:56.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: There's
going to be
things that we disagree on, but
that's part

19:56.695 --> 19:57.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the process, right?

19:57.997 --> 20:02.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then we work together and
find compromise
along the way.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's how it should work.

20:03.969 --> 20:07.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: President Obama will
visit this
coming weekend to campaign for
both Cortez

20:07.606 --> 20:09.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Masto and Clinton.

20:09.708 --> 20:14.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The economy is a big issue in
both the Senate
and presidential races, which
polls show both

20:14.580 --> 20:16.348 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very close.

20:16.382 --> 20:22.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No state boomed like Nevada
until the recession,
when it went bust like no other
state.

20:22.354 --> 20:28.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the real estate bubble
burst, the carpenters
union went from 18 million
manhours a year

20:28.127 --> 20:30.062 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to two million.

20:30.096 --> 20:32.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Frank Hawk is the union's
business manager.

20:32.131 --> 20:36.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANK HAWK, Carpenters Union: In
2009, we
had a record amount of suicides
in our local

20:36.669 --> 20:37.636 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

20:37.670 --> 20:41.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We were losing about 15 a month
to suicides.

20:41.574 --> 20:45.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People were cashing in their
retirement to
save their houses, only to lose
them anyway.

20:45.411 --> 20:51.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2010, we had a record amount
of cardiac
arrests for people under 45.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that was due to the stress.

20:53.152 --> 20:58.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The union backed Heck
when he ran
for the House, but now they're
behind Cortez

20:58.557 --> 21:07.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Masto, with members going
door-to-door for
her and the rest of the
Democratic ticket.

21:07.233 --> 21:10.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Damore is a political
scientist at the
University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

21:10.169 --> 21:12.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID DAMORE, Political
Scientist, University
of Nevada, Las Vegas: What's
missing from

21:12.438 --> 21:17.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our -- from the return here of
the economy
is those construction jobs.

21:17.543 --> 21:22.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those were a real driver, and as
opposed to
being, you know, $10 job hours,
they're $30,

21:22.348 --> 21:23.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
$40 job hours there.

21:23.883 --> 21:27.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That blue-collar
frustration is
driving some of Trump's support.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID DAMORE: He's also, of
course, mobilizing
working-class whites.

21:30.256 --> 21:35.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have a smaller share of
college-educated
people in Nevada, so some of the
sort of cultural

21:35.628 --> 21:39.932 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
movement away from the
Republican Party isn't
quite so strong in Nevada.

21:39.965 --> 21:43.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clearly, Trump is a mobilizer on
both sides,
right?

21:43.669 --> 21:46.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's mobilizing Latino voters in
a way that
we haven't seen.

21:46.906 --> 21:52.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Driving them, Damore
says, to the
Democrats, like the family and
friends who

21:52.811 --> 21:55.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gathered Sunday night on the
west side of
Las Vegas.

21:55.981 --> 22:02.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the kitchen, it was dinner,
in the living
room, politics watching a
Spanish-language

22:02.855 --> 22:06.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rebroadcast of the Heck-Cortez
Masto debate.

22:06.659 --> 22:11.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since January, activist Jose
Macias, whose
parents came to the United
States illegally,

22:11.964 --> 22:16.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has helped dozens of Latinos
become citizens
so they can vote next month.

22:16.268 --> 22:20.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE MACIAS, Community Activist:
We have to
go out there and really, really
show the numbers

22:20.573 --> 22:26.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the power we do have, because
a lot of
candidates think that we don't
have power

22:26.779 --> 22:34.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when they're talking to the
rallies, attacking
Mexicans, attacking women,
people of color.

22:34.920 --> 22:39.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reason that I'm working for
a vote, we
have to make sure that we tell
them that we

22:39.291 --> 22:40.960 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do matter.

22:40.993 --> 22:45.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mobilizing to try to
help decide
who wins the White House and the
Senate.

22:45.064 --> 22:51.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang in Las
Vegas.

22:51.604 --> 23:02.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One subject
that's sure
to come up in the final
presidential debate

23:02.081 --> 23:06.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the state of the American
economy, and,
more specifically, the state of
the American

23:06.485 --> 23:08.287 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
worker.

23:08.320 --> 23:11.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During the primary season, in
what now seems
ages ago, we looked at
Americans' attitudes

23:11.457 --> 23:13.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
toward the economy.

23:13.259 --> 23:15.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have an update tonight with
our partners
at Marketplace and "Frontline,"
part of our

23:15.861 --> 23:18.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
series on How the Deck Is
Stacked.

23:18.530 --> 23:23.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The unemployment rate may now
stand at 5 percent
officially, and more than 10
million new jobs

23:23.402 --> 23:25.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have been created during the
Obama administration.

23:25.504 --> 23:29.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But a new survey done by
Marketplace and Edison
Research found nearly a third of
people are

23:29.808 --> 23:34.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
afraid of losing their jobs
within the next
six months, and almost 40
percent of people

23:34.313 --> 23:37.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say they are losing sleep over
their financial
situation.

23:37.916 --> 23:40.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Marketplace host Kai Ryssdal is
with us again.

23:40.152 --> 23:44.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kai, when we first did this a
year ago, we
expected things to get better.

23:44.890 --> 23:48.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why are people more anxious now
and seem less
financially secure?

23:48.494 --> 23:51.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL, Marketplace: The
thing about
the economy, Hari, is that we
measure it in

23:51.997 --> 23:55.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
numbers, right, things like the
unemployment
rate, but people experience it
through how

23:55.968 --> 23:57.870 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they feel.

23:57.903 --> 24:01.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what they're feeling now is
anxiety, possibly
because the election is drawing
near, possibly

24:01.440 --> 24:07.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because they sense that the
headline numbers
of unemployment at 5 percent and
gross domestic

24:07.513 --> 24:11.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
product growing at a
percent-and-a-half, plus
or minus, they're not feeling
that in their

24:11.617 --> 24:15.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lives, while, at the same time,
food prices
are going up and gas is bopping
around, $2.5,

24:15.354 --> 24:18.424 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
$3 a gallon, whatever it is.

24:18.457 --> 24:23.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People don't feel that security
they really
would like to feel seven years
now into an

24:23.796 --> 24:25.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
economic expansion.

24:25.564 --> 24:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All the
numbers that you
just rattled off, what's
interesting is that

24:28.067 --> 24:31.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your survey also reveals that
there's a lack
of trust in the data itself.

24:31.403 --> 24:33.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAI RYSSDAL: Oh, yes.

24:33.372 --> 24:38.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this was, to me anyway, one
most of interesting
and disturbing things about this
entire survey.

24:38.243 --> 24:42.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We asked people whether they
trust government
economic data, the stuff that we
do on Marketplace

24:42.748 --> 24:47.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all the time, consumer spending,
the unemployment
rate, all of that stuff; 25
percent of all

24:47.686 --> 24:51.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Americans completely distrust
government economic
data.

24:51.523 --> 24:56.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then you drill down a little
bit and you
ask them to -- who they're
voting for and

24:56.328 --> 25:02.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how they feel about government
data, 48 percent
of Donald Trump voters distrust
government

25:02.334 --> 25:06.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
data; 5 percent of Hillary
Clinton voters
distrust the economic data.

25:06.372 --> 25:10.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, if you look at
what's happening
out there on the campaign trail
and some of

25:10.075 --> 25:13.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the rhetoric that's coming from
the Trump
camp and from the candidate
himself, it sort

25:13.345 --> 25:16.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of stands to reason that his
voters are going
to distrust that data.

25:16.448 --> 25:20.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Speaking of
distrust, there
is also this feeling that your
survey is picking

25:20.486 --> 25:22.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up on about the system being
rigged.

25:22.254 --> 25:27.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a couple of the numbers that
leapt out
to me, 62 percent of Americans
say that the

25:27.593 --> 25:29.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
system, the economy is rigged.

25:29.828 --> 25:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, when you break this
down, 66 percent
of Trump supporters say it's
rigged for those

25:34.733 --> 25:38.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who get government assistance;
62 percent
of Clinton supporters say it's
rigged for

25:38.904 --> 25:39.872 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
white Americans.

25:39.905 --> 25:41.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's really depends on who you
ask.

25:41.774 --> 25:45.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, really, regardless of who
you ask, they
still think the deck is stacked
against them.

25:45.310 --> 25:46.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAI RYSSDAL: Right.

25:46.311 --> 25:47.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They think the desk is stacked
against them.

25:47.679 --> 25:50.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what is interesting is who
they think
the deck is stacked for.

25:50.816 --> 25:57.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In about 90 percent of all
responses, people
think it's stacked for
politicians, for corporations

25:57.556 --> 25:59.324 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and the rich.

25:59.358 --> 26:01.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what you see here is this
divide that
we're seeing now out in the
economy at large

26:01.960 --> 26:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between those who have assets,
those who have
income, those who have wealth,
and those,

26:07.699 --> 26:12.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as we have been talking about
for a long time
now, who simply don't, and the
income inequality

26:12.404 --> 26:14.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gap in this country and how it's
playing out
now in this election.

26:14.606 --> 26:17.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Kai, are you
surprised by
these results?

26:17.209 --> 26:19.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Were the pollsters surprised by
these results?

26:19.178 --> 26:22.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: So, we had a whole
lot of long
conversations about this with
our partners

26:22.915 --> 26:23.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at Edison Research.

26:23.982 --> 26:26.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think it breaks down along
two lines.

26:26.518 --> 26:30.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First is, on the distrust in
government, on
the feeling that the economy is
rigged, that

26:30.422 --> 26:34.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plays directly from what we see
happening
out on the campaign trail.

26:34.092 --> 26:38.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know Donald Trump and his
surrogates say
all the time the economy is
rigged, the election

26:38.230 --> 26:39.832 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is rigged.

26:39.865 --> 26:44.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this is sort of the fallout
from that.

26:44.837 --> 26:48.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But also we're seeing a shift
now from what
happened in the primaries, where
you had people

26:48.040 --> 26:52.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like Bernie Sanders and like
Donald Trump
saying the economy is rigged,
and those numbers

26:52.678 --> 26:54.446 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now are coming home to roost.

26:54.480 --> 26:58.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other thing is really that
the numbers
on income inequality and who
they think it

26:58.083 --> 27:02.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is rigged for can't come as a
surprise, because
what we have known for years now
is that the

27:02.855 --> 27:05.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gains in this economy go to the
top 1 percent.

27:06.024 --> 27:09.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The rest of it, the other 99
percent, just
don't get the gains.

27:09.695 --> 27:13.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're seeing that now play
out both on
the campaign trail and also in
this survey.

27:13.932 --> 27:17.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Kai
Ryssdal of
Marketplace and our partners at
"Frontline"

27:17.569 --> 27:21.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on How the Deck Is Stacked,
joining us from
L.A. today, thanks so much.

27:21.473 --> 27:27.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAI RYSSDAL: You bet.

27:27.913 --> 27:31.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

27:31.984 --> 27:37.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
country where
refugees have been welcomed with
open arms;

27:37.856 --> 27:43.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and teaching politics in an
unusual and at-times
crude election.

27:43.595 --> 27:48.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: the fight over Mosul
and taking
back the last major stronghold
in Iraq for

27:48.767 --> 27:50.636 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ISIS.

27:50.669 --> 27:54.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We take two looks at it now,
with a Jeffrey
Brown conversation with the head
of a humanitarian

27:54.706 --> 28:00.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
group and, to begin, this report
from the
front by John Irvine Independent
Television

28:00.779 --> 28:01.813 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
News.

28:01.847 --> 28:02.814 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(GUNFIRE)

28:02.848 --> 28:05.951 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN IRVINE: Keeping enemy heads
down.

28:05.984 --> 28:13.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I.S. aren't far away, and the
gunfire gives
Kurdish soldiers the chance for
a quick look

28:13.792 --> 28:15.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over no man's land.

28:15.928 --> 28:19.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They want a glimpse of home.

28:19.398 --> 28:23.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These men are from what will be
the next village
liberated.

28:23.502 --> 28:29.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Having fled from there in June
2014, they
can hardly wait to run.

28:29.141 --> 28:33.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But while some people will soon
be going back
home, others are having to flee.

28:33.812 --> 28:36.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have just left Mosul.

28:36.415 --> 28:41.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a few more dangerous
undertakings
than escaping the clutches of
I.S. and crossing

28:41.853 --> 28:48.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over, but they managed it,
carrying a few
belongings and a white flag.

28:48.961 --> 28:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Regarding the battle, with the
help of coalition
airstrikes still smoldering
today, the Kurds

28:54.633 --> 28:57.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
did make important gains.

28:57.202 --> 29:02.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under normal circumstances, the
city of Mosul
would be just 10 minutes' drive
away.

29:02.441 --> 29:08.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, for the time being, the
advance here
has been halted because advances
elsewhere

29:08.213 --> 29:10.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have not gone so well.

29:10.182 --> 29:17.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These Iraqi forces want to wait
for their
colleagues to catch up before
pressing ahead.

29:17.623 --> 29:22.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In a house in a captured
village, we saw rooms
full of piles of earth.

29:22.060 --> 29:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I.S. go to great lengths to hide
their tunnels
from coalition drones.

29:28.100 --> 29:33.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These networks amounted to
extensive living
quarters underground.

29:33.405 --> 29:37.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We saw only a faction of one
system in what
is a small village.

29:37.709 --> 29:40.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What must the defenses in Mosul
be like?

29:40.746 --> 29:44.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And for a closer
look at what
faces civilians caught in the
crossfire, I'm

29:44.983 --> 29:46.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
joined by David Miliband.

29:46.752 --> 29:50.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's the former British foreign
secretary,
now president and CEO of the
International

29:50.589 --> 29:51.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Rescue Committee.

29:51.857 --> 29:53.625 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome to you.

29:53.659 --> 29:57.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I assume that a lot of people
right now face
this immediate difficult choice
of whether

29:57.496 --> 30:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to flee the city if they can or
remain behind
and see what happens.

30:01.366 --> 30:03.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND, Former British
Foreign Secretary:
You're absolutely right.

30:03.602 --> 30:09.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have our own staff now
northeast and south
of the city.

30:09.107 --> 30:13.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
About 1,000 people have so far
left since
the fighting began.

30:13.178 --> 30:14.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have been talking to them.

30:14.913 --> 30:18.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the perilous choice that
they face is
between staying put and waiting
to see how

30:18.884 --> 30:24.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fighting develops and, on
the other hand,
trying their find their way out
of the city,

30:24.056 --> 30:28.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
using all their savings for
transport, and
taking the risk with land mines,
sniper fire

30:28.460 --> 30:30.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and other kinds of interference.

30:30.095 --> 30:32.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it really is a perilous
choice and a terrifying
one.

30:32.898 --> 30:36.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Today, President
Obama said,
"It's not something I expect
will be easy,

30:36.535 --> 30:42.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but it perhaps hasn't been
publicized enough
the degree of planning, assets
and resources

30:43.008 --> 30:45.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we have devoted to this
important problem."

30:45.877 --> 30:52.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, I wonder, as the fighting
begins, how
much can the interest in
refugees and humanitarians

30:52.317 --> 30:54.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
play into the actual fighting
strategy?

30:54.352 --> 30:55.787 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What do you see?

30:55.821 --> 30:57.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: I think that
there are two
things that are important.

30:57.756 --> 31:02.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, we have to say
loud and clear
to all those who are engaged in
the fighting

31:02.894 --> 31:07.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that attention to and respect
for humanitarian
needs is absolutely imperative.

31:07.299 --> 31:11.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anyone with any knowledge of
Iraq, never mind
any concern about the future,
knows that the

31:11.470 --> 31:16.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
way in which the war is
prosecuted has a big
impact on what comes afterwards.

31:16.308 --> 31:18.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Secondly, there has been a lot
of planning.

31:18.510 --> 31:24.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The United Nations coordinator
for Iraq, Lise
Grande, is an outstanding public
servant.

31:24.516 --> 31:29.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The head of the United Nations
High Commission
on Refugees is in Baghdad at the
moment.

31:29.354 --> 31:31.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the planning has been
serious.

31:31.289 --> 31:36.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the truth is, if the numbers
rise to the
kind of level that the U.N.
fears, anything

31:36.495 --> 31:42.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
above 500, 750, a million
people, at that
sort of scale, even at a
quarter-of-a-million

31:42.834 --> 31:46.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
scale, it's going to overwhelm
the camps that
are being set up.

31:46.538 --> 31:51.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why we're putting
such emphasis
on the need to support those who
flee the

31:51.676 --> 31:56.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
city and don't find themselves
in camps, but
instead are staying with
friends, are staying

31:56.681 --> 32:00.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
overnight in mosques, are
finding informal
ways of surviving.

32:00.919 --> 32:04.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's very important that
they get support
as well, in addition to those
who make it

32:04.523 --> 32:06.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the camps that are being set
up.

32:06.324 --> 32:09.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, in fact,
the U.N. has
already reported that, in spite
of appeals,

32:09.528 --> 32:14.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it had not received additional
funding for
emergency camps and all the aid
that it thinks

32:14.366 --> 32:15.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it might need.

32:15.634 --> 32:17.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How would you describe the
shortfall at this
point?

32:17.903 --> 32:22.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: Well, I think
that 60,000
tents have been put in place.

32:22.641 --> 32:27.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you think they could support
a family,
you can do the numbers yourself.

32:27.579 --> 32:31.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the time of the United
Nations General
Assembly last month, the U.N.
reported that

32:31.817 --> 32:35.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the funding was only 30 to 40
percent of what
they -- of what was needed.

32:35.620 --> 32:40.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, obviously, we don't know
the kind of
exodus that's going to take
place, but everything

32:40.525 --> 32:44.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the president said today
suggests that the
fighting is not going to be over
quickly.

32:44.930 --> 32:50.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, therefore, we have to
prepare for a long
struggle in which the
humanitarian needs grow,

32:50.635 --> 32:56.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
both inside the city and those
outside who
have their lives disrupted for
not just weeks,

32:56.107 --> 32:57.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but probably months.

32:57.943 --> 33:00.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, in fact, we
talked last
night on the program about the
military aspect

33:00.712 --> 33:02.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to this and how long it will
take.

33:02.447 --> 33:07.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I see the same reports you
do today that
longer than perhaps people even
thought.

33:07.052 --> 33:12.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when you think about those
longer-term
needs from the humanitarian
aspect of this,

33:12.824 --> 33:13.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what's most important?

33:13.825 --> 33:15.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's crying out?

33:15.160 --> 33:17.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: I think three
things need
to be preeminent.

33:17.262 --> 33:23.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, all men and boys
over the age
of 14 are going to be screened
when they leave

33:23.501 --> 33:26.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the city, screened for obvious
security reasons.

33:26.438 --> 33:31.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's imperative, given the
lessons in Fallujah
and elsewhere, that there's
independent monitoring

33:31.243 --> 33:32.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of those screening arrangements.

33:33.011 --> 33:37.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Otherwise, the fear of
persecution is going
to lead to chaos and frankly to
dangerous

33:37.682 --> 33:39.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
decisions being made by
individuals.

33:39.618 --> 33:44.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secondly, we need to make sure
that, as the
camps fill up, those outside
camps get better

33:44.756 --> 33:46.524 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
support.

33:46.558 --> 33:49.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The best means of support,
frankly, is to
get them cash, because it's a
market economy

33:49.261 --> 33:53.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and these people will have used
up their savings
to get out of the city.

33:53.431 --> 33:56.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The third element is obviously
the situation
of those still trapped inside.

33:56.468 --> 34:02.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a lot of fear of land
mines and other
need for specialists' help to
help those civilians

34:02.207 --> 34:05.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are inside the city, even
before you get
to the new building process
afterwards.

34:05.977 --> 34:09.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And just briefly,
if you could,
to the extent that there are
many military

34:09.381 --> 34:12.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forces involved in this, is it
clear who is
in charge?

34:12.550 --> 34:14.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that a concern as well?

34:14.419 --> 34:17.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: I think it's a
very dangerous
situation for the staff of an
NGO like ours.

34:18.023 --> 34:20.225 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
These are local Iraqi people.

34:20.258 --> 34:22.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're local people who are
working for us.

34:22.761 --> 34:24.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Of course, it's a sovereign
government.

34:24.529 --> 34:27.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The legitimate government of
Iraq is in charge.

34:27.198 --> 34:31.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you're right to point out
the multitude
of different factions and the
danger of civilians

34:31.636 --> 34:34.039 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
being caught in the crossfire.

34:34.072 --> 34:38.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why, at an absolute
minimum, effective
coordination across the -- those
supporting

34:38.743 --> 34:41.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Iraqi government is
absolutely imperative.

34:41.212 --> 34:44.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: David Miliband of
the International
Rescue Committee, thank you once
again.

34:44.049 --> 34:49.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: Thank you very
much.

34:49.921 --> 35:02.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next: In a world
struggling
to accommodate a record number
of refugees,

35:02.701 --> 35:05.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one country has been notably
welcoming.

35:05.537 --> 35:09.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Fred de
Sam Lazaro has
a report from Uganda.

35:09.607 --> 35:11.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of his Agents for
Change series.

35:11.943 --> 35:19.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Nakivale in
Southern Uganda
looks like any other dusty rural
African town.

35:19.651 --> 35:26.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's remarkable is that almost
none of its
113,000 residents are Ugandan.

35:26.658 --> 35:28.226 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Ethiopia?

35:28.259 --> 35:32.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of these schoolchildren and
their parents
are refugees.

35:32.998 --> 35:34.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Burundi?

35:34.399 --> 35:35.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Rwanda?

35:35.834 --> 35:37.702 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Congo?

35:37.736 --> 35:45.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
All told, 13 nations are
represented in this
crowded school, their families
fleeing conflicts

35:45.510 --> 35:50.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
across a wide swathe of East
Africa and finding
haven in what must rank as one
of the world's

35:50.849 --> 35:53.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
most hospitable countries to
refugees.

35:53.952 --> 35:58.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Uganda, refugees are placed
in settlements
and not camps, and the
government says there's

35:58.256 --> 36:00.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an important difference.

36:00.125 --> 36:04.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Camps tend to confine people,
whereas, in
Uganda, when refugees arrive,
they are issued

36:04.529 --> 36:10.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
legal I.D.s that entitle them to
move freely
anywhere in the country, to find
a job, start

36:10.435 --> 36:14.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a business, put their children
in school.

36:14.506 --> 36:18.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Refugees in rural areas are
given a small
plot of land to farm.

36:18.410 --> 36:20.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Others migrate to the urban
areas.

36:21.012 --> 36:25.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Somalis are among the earlier
arrivals in
recent years.

36:25.950 --> 36:30.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their enclaves in the capital,
Kampala, are
well-established with small
businesses and

36:30.655 --> 36:36.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mosques, a predominantly Muslim
community
in a mostly Christian nation.

36:36.361 --> 36:40.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mohammed Abdi runs this grocery
story with
his partner, Zahara Hassan.

36:40.231 --> 36:44.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHAMMED ABDI, Somali Immigrant
(through translator):
We have very many Ugandan
customers and we

36:45.003 --> 36:45.970 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are friends.

36:46.004 --> 36:48.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I am one of the Somali elders in
the community.

36:48.807 --> 36:52.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We interact with the elders of
the Ugandan
community, whether leaders in
this distract

36:52.677 --> 36:53.645 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or region.

36:53.678 --> 36:55.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we are friends, and they
welcome us.

36:55.814 --> 36:56.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're very happy.

36:56.815 --> 36:58.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're like one people.

36:58.650 --> 37:02.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And one
scholar who's
studied refugees in Uganda says
there's reason

37:02.187 --> 37:03.988 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be happy

37:04.022 --> 37:06.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALEXANDER BETTS, Oxford
University: We showed
in the capital city of Uganda,
Kampala, 20

37:06.691 --> 37:10.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
percent of refugees own
businesses that employ
someone else.

37:10.662 --> 37:14.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And of those they employ, 40
percent are citizens
of the host country.

37:14.732 --> 37:17.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So refugees can contribute to
the host societies
that they're part of.

37:17.836 --> 37:23.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Oxford
University's Alexander
Betts says Uganda is the
exception in a world

37:23.208 --> 37:28.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where refugees face widespread
hostility,
often stoked by politicians.

37:28.413 --> 37:32.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXANDER BETTS: It's all too
easy to have
a race to the bottom in terms of
political

37:32.517 --> 37:37.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
standards, where provincial and
municipal
politicians or national
politicians say, these

37:37.455 --> 37:38.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people are a burden.

37:38.690 --> 37:40.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have to keep them out.

37:40.625 --> 37:44.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And while
many politicians,
especially in Western
democracies, must tread

37:44.329 --> 37:50.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
carefully on this issue, Betts
says it's not
a problem in Uganda, where one
man rules virtually

37:50.735 --> 37:52.504 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unchallenged.

37:52.537 --> 37:55.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXANDER BETTS: President
Museveni has been
able to adopt refugee policies
that are a

37:55.940 --> 38:00.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
little different, in part
because there are
lower standards of
accountability to the public.

38:00.378 --> 38:05.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, not having democratic
standards is definitely
not something to celebrate, but
it highlights

38:05.183 --> 38:11.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the difficulties for democracies
to open up
their economies to non-citizens.

38:11.256 --> 38:13.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a hard thing for
politicians.

38:13.091 --> 38:17.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Recent
history might also
account for Uganda's hospitality
to refugees.

38:17.962 --> 38:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Yoweri Museveni
himself lived in
exile for years during and after
the bloody

38:22.834 --> 38:25.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dictatorship of Idi Amin.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Museveni's rebels took power 30
years ago.

38:27.505 --> 38:29.240 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REV.

38:29.274 --> 38:32.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZAC NIRINGIYE, Bishop, Anglican
Church of
Uganda: There's been a history
of violence

38:32.410 --> 38:34.045 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this region.

38:34.078 --> 38:38.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Zac
Niringiye is a bishop
in the Anglican Church of
Uganda.

38:38.049 --> 38:39.517 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REV.

38:39.551 --> 38:44.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZAC NIRINGIYE: South Sudan,
Rwanda, Burundi,
even Congo and even Uganda.

38:44.789 --> 38:51.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that that has created a
sense of being
hospitable, because you never
know.

38:51.496 --> 38:53.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It may be your turn next.

FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Despite
praise for its
hospitality, life in Uganda is
far from perfect

38:58.836 --> 39:00.672 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for refugees.

39:00.705 --> 39:05.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their number has doubled in the
past five
years to more than
half-a-million, most recently

39:05.410 --> 39:10.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from separate conflicts in
Burundi and South
Sudan.

39:10.215 --> 39:15.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many refugees, like Abebesh
Gebreslassie,
remain haunted by the ordeal
that brought

39:15.720 --> 39:17.488 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
them here.

39:17.522 --> 39:20.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABEBESH GEBRESLASSIE, Refugee
from Eritrea
(through translator): My husband
was killed,

39:20.191 --> 39:22.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
my son was killed, and also my
daughter.

39:22.527 --> 39:27.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: A son and
daughter died
in their escape from Eritrea,
part of the

39:27.365 --> 39:32.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exodus of hundreds of thousands
from a country
notorious for human rights
abuses.

39:32.270 --> 39:36.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her son-in-law made it to Libya,
but died
in the Mediterranean.

39:36.641 --> 39:42.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gebreslassie survived the
journey of thousands
of miles on foot and on trucks
with her then

39:42.914 --> 39:45.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
6-year-old twin son and
daughter.

39:45.049 --> 39:49.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But she made a wrenching
decision to leave
two older teenaged children
behind.

39:49.954 --> 39:54.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABEBESH GEBRESLASSIE (through
translator):
I feared if we all died, like my
son who was

39:54.425 --> 39:55.760 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
shot.

39:55.793 --> 39:58.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I left them so that our family
can survive,
can be represented.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: They are
still there now?

40:00.965 --> 40:02.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ABEBESH GEBRESLASSIE (through
translator):
I don't know.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.802 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

40:04.836 --> 40:07.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Along the
way, she also
took custody of her orphaned
granddaughter,

40:07.772 --> 40:09.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Sara, who's now four.

40:09.607 --> 40:14.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABEBESH GEBRESLASSIE (through
translator):
I don't care if I die here, but
I want a better

40:14.279 --> 40:17.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
future for my children, and
that's not possible
without a good education.

40:17.649 --> 40:23.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: That's not
likely in the
crowded school her children
attend, with 120

40:23.921 --> 40:29.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
students in each classroom, and
perhaps, because
of that, teachers who aren't
very sympathetic.

40:29.294 --> 40:32.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are severe consequences
for being late,
for instance.

40:32.764 --> 40:33.765 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They beat you?

40:33.798 --> 40:34.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: Yes.

40:34.799 --> 40:36.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Who beats
you?

40:36.868 --> 40:39.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUDENT: The teachers, yes, they
beat me.

40:39.370 --> 40:41.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The teachers, they say, if you
come late,
we wash the toilets.

40:41.706 --> 40:43.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: So, if
you're late, you
have wash the toilets.

40:43.474 --> 40:45.209 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: Yes.

40:45.243 --> 40:47.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: "They don't
understand,"
she said, "that I'm late because
I've gone

40:47.645 --> 40:50.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to fetch water and helped my
mother with the
chores."

40:50.581 --> 40:56.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the end, Ugandan and
international officials
say it boils down to resources,
or a lack

40:56.554 --> 40:58.323 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of them.

40:58.356 --> 41:03.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Uganda may be hospitable, but it
has a gross
domestic product of just $600
per year per

41:03.795 --> 41:04.996 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
person.

41:05.029 --> 41:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nakivale's school is funded by
the U.N.'s
Refugee Agency.

41:08.466 --> 41:14.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It gives Uganda some $200
million annually
in refugee aid, a fraction of
what's needed,

41:14.806 --> 41:20.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but not likely to increase amid
the demands
on donor governments for
refugees out of Syria,

41:20.545 --> 41:23.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Iraq, Ukraine and elsewhere.

41:23.247 --> 41:25.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Charles Yaxley is the U.N.
agency's spokesman
in Uganda.

41:25.950 --> 41:29.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES YAXLEY, United Nations
High Commissioner
for Refugees in Uganda: Around
the world,

41:29.721 --> 41:34.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
humanitarian financing is
arguably at breaking
point.

41:34.158 --> 41:38.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Currently, humanitarian appeals
for South
Sudanese and Burundian refugees
in Uganda,

41:38.696 --> 41:40.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
both of those appeals are
severely underfunded.

41:40.832 --> 41:46.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We've received less than a
quarter of the
money we need for 2016, and that
leaves real

41:46.204 --> 41:48.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gaps in our humanitarian
response.

41:48.840 --> 41:55.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It means we're not able to
provide the education
support for children such as
better schools,

41:55.279 --> 41:57.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more schools, more teachers.

41:57.215 --> 42:02.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: That does
not bode well
for the future of Abebesh
Gebreslassie's twins,

42:02.553 --> 42:05.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who shared their dreams in
halting, shy English.

42:06.023 --> 42:07.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What would you like to do when
you grow up?

42:07.458 --> 42:09.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: When I grow up, I want
to be a doctor
and to help my mother.

42:09.961 --> 42:12.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: How about
you, David?

42:12.163 --> 42:13.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What would you like to do when
you grow up?

42:13.898 --> 42:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUDENT: I wish to be a pilot.

42:15.733 --> 42:18.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: You want to
be a pilot?

42:18.202 --> 42:19.170 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: Yes.

42:19.203 --> 42:20.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Yes.

42:20.204 --> 42:21.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where would you like to go?

42:21.472 --> 42:23.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: Every place, America,
like, I guess,
everywhere.

42:23.674 --> 42:26.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: America and
everywhere.

42:26.210 --> 42:28.112 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: Yes.

42:28.146 --> 42:32.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Possible,
but like their
chance of a good education here,
with lottery-like

42:32.683 --> 42:33.785 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
odds.

42:33.818 --> 42:37.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
America admitted 70,000 refugees
last year.

42:37.321 --> 42:42.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.N. says there are 65
million displaced
people in the world today.

42:42.760 --> 42:47.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Fred de Sam
Lazaro in Nakivale, Uganda.

42:47.799 --> 42:53.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fred's reporting
is a partnership
with the Under-Told Stories
Project at the

42:53.404 --> 43:01.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
University of St. Thomas in
Minnesota.

43:01.913 --> 43:08.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: As we know,
tomorrow's the
final presidential debate.

43:08.186 --> 43:12.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tens of millions of voters will
be watching,
but there are other audiences
too, including

43:12.824 --> 43:17.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
middle and high school students
around the
country, who are often watching
and even tweeting

43:17.395 --> 43:20.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as part of their civics or
government classes.

43:20.331 --> 43:24.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During this campaign season the
nature of
what's being discussed,
particularly questions

43:24.368 --> 43:29.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about sexual assault and other
tough rhetoric,
makes this a different year for
teachers and

43:29.407 --> 43:30.608 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
students.

43:30.641 --> 43:32.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the focus of this week's
Making the
Grade segment.

43:32.977 --> 43:37.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We begin in an A.P. government
class at T.C.
Williams High School in
Alexandria, Virginia.

43:37.482 --> 43:40.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW ORZEL, Teacher, T.C.
Williams High
School: I guess the first
question I would

43:40.084 --> 43:41.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
pose to you is, why?

43:41.219 --> 43:44.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why actually watch these things?

43:44.155 --> 43:46.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Anybody have thoughts on why
you're drawn
to this?

43:46.757 --> 43:50.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Andrew Orzel
is getting
his seniors ready for tomorrow
night's debate.

43:51.028 --> 43:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And given what was discussed
right off the
bat in the last debate, some of
the students

43:55.533 --> 43:59.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are not feeling enthused about
what the candidates
might want to focus on.

43:59.070 --> 44:01.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADDISON GUYNN, Student: I almost
stopped watching
the last one.

44:01.772 --> 44:08.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was getting so combative, so
loud, it was
kind of just hard to get a --
like, at one

44:08.179 --> 44:10.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
point, it gets to be difficult
to handle mentally.

44:10.414 --> 44:13.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW ORZEL: And I, as a
teacher, honestly
have been frustrated by this, in
that normally,

44:13.985 --> 44:17.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the beginning of the year,
one of the things
we get into is ideology of
liberals believe

44:17.522 --> 44:19.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this, conservatives believe
this.

44:19.857 --> 44:21.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Presidential debates usually
show that.

44:21.659 --> 44:24.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you're not actually getting
to see kind
of the liberal arguments vs.
conservative.

44:25.029 --> 44:29.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Even, so Orzel
is assigning
his students to watch again.

44:29.867 --> 44:34.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He asked whether the debates
might change
anyone's mind and their
expectations if the

44:34.872 --> 44:36.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tone was similar.

44:36.674 --> 44:39.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMAL JABATI, Student: I feel
like Trump has
the most to gain, because he's
like -- he

44:39.644 --> 44:41.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was down by 11 points.

44:41.212 --> 44:42.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now it's nine points.

44:42.713 --> 44:46.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if he does get on this one,
he can have
a higher chance of winning.

44:46.984 --> 44:49.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMANDA EISENHOUR, Student: I
would say the
person who has potentially the
most to lose

44:49.353 --> 44:54.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this election would be the
American people,
because if we become ingrained
in the idea

44:54.559 --> 44:58.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that this is normal, this is the
normal tone
of our political rhetoric and
discourse in

44:58.696 --> 45:02.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this country, then we're not
going to expect
more in debates in the future.

45:02.500 --> 45:07.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's potentially damaging to
democracy
as an institution in America for
many years

45:07.572 --> 45:09.006 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to come.

45:09.040 --> 45:11.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Orzel is
expected to discuss
it in class on Thursday.

45:11.576 --> 45:15.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Peter Laboy says he hopes
the focus will
be different than last time.

45:15.079 --> 45:19.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER LABOY, Student: We are
here arguing
about locker room talk and Bill
Clinton.

45:19.383 --> 45:22.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's just like, instead of
talking about
what really matters, we're
talking about each

45:22.486 --> 45:24.322 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
other and negative aspects.

45:24.355 --> 45:26.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I just don't think that's
good.

45:26.824 --> 45:30.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That's an
issue many teachers
are grappling with.

45:30.294 --> 45:33.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some 90 percent of high school
students take
at least one civics class.

45:33.297 --> 45:36.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, how are teachers dealing
with this kind
of campaign?

45:36.567 --> 45:38.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We hear from Richard House.

45:38.269 --> 45:41.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He teaches seventh grade civics
at Gunston
Middle School in Arlington,
Virginia.

45:41.606 --> 45:44.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Chris Cavanaugh, who teaches
government
to juniors and seniors at
Plainfield High

45:44.809 --> 45:45.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
School in Indiana.

45:46.010 --> 45:47.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Richard, let me start with you.

45:47.778 --> 45:50.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're talking to an audience
that's just
turning into teenagers.

45:51.015 --> 45:52.617 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You had them watch debate one.

45:52.650 --> 45:54.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You didn't assign debate two.

45:54.385 --> 45:56.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What were their impressions?

45:56.354 --> 46:01.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD HOUSE, Teacher, Gunston
Middle School:
I think a lot of them, words
they used, entertained.

46:01.359 --> 46:06.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I also tried to bring it
back to, let's
focus on the issues, that that
hateful rhetoric

46:06.364 --> 46:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doesn't have a place in my
classroom.

46:08.666 --> 46:11.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when we're talking about the
debate, when
we're discussing it, we're going
to focus

46:11.435 --> 46:13.337 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the issues.

46:13.371 --> 46:16.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for example, for the first
debate, I had
them pick two or three issues
that were focused

46:16.774 --> 46:18.009 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the debate.

46:18.042 --> 46:19.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What did each candidate say
about them?

46:19.510 --> 46:21.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then we can have a classroom
discussion.

46:21.512 --> 46:25.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do not want to take time to
really focus
on some of the personal behavior
that the

46:25.883 --> 46:29.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
candidates have exhibited and
some of the
negative behavior.

46:29.120 --> 46:33.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They know what I expect of them
and the expectations
that I have when they walk into
my classroom.

46:33.224 --> 46:37.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this election should be
about policy and
it should be about the issues
and focusing

46:37.495 --> 46:39.130 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on them.

46:39.163 --> 46:40.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Chris, your
high school
students, what did they think so
far?

46:40.965 --> 46:43.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER CAVANAUGH, Teacher,
Plainfield
High School: I think they have
been a little

46:43.501 --> 46:47.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bit turned off by some of the
rhetoric they
have been hearing.

46:47.138 --> 46:53.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would agree that you try to
get them to
focus on the policies and not
the politics.

46:53.511 --> 46:59.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as with having older
students, you want
to allow them the freedom to be
able to discuss

46:59.583 --> 47:04.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of the issues and some of
the rhetoric
that's been used in the debates.

47:04.889 --> 47:09.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it's been a tough row to
hoe, so to speak.

47:09.460 --> 47:13.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Chris, staying
with you
for a second, how do you
navigate some of

47:13.297 --> 47:19.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these topics, especially the
ones, as teenagers,
sexuality, sort of locker room
talk, all of

47:19.904 --> 47:23.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that that came up, all the sort
of personal
attacks that the candidates took
on each other?

47:23.574 --> 47:24.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you discuss it?

47:24.575 --> 47:26.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER CAVANAUGH: Right.

47:26.410 --> 47:30.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, I think I try to couch it
in historical
terms, in the fact that, you
know, I think

47:30.347 --> 47:36.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mudslinging is nothing new in
American politics,
or not new in politics, period.

47:36.253 --> 47:38.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can go back to the Roman
states with Cicero.

47:38.689 --> 47:44.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or one of my favorites is to
discuss the election
of 1800, where Jefferson accused
Adams of

47:44.729 --> 47:51.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
having hermaphroditical
tendencies, and Adams
said that Jefferson had a
mulatto father.

47:52.002 --> 47:55.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, slinging mud is nothing new
in American
politics.

47:55.706 --> 48:01.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's tough to get the kids to
sort through
that to get to those policies
and to be able

48:01.245 --> 48:07.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to lay those policies side by
side to get
to see what the candidates are
proposing.

48:07.518 --> 48:12.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Richard House,
as you assigned
your students to keep track of
policy positions,

48:12.356 --> 48:14.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did they notice what was being
talked about
and what wasn't?

48:14.992 --> 48:19.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD HOUSE: I think there was
definitely
a notice of the issues that they
were focusing

48:19.396 --> 48:23.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on, but, at the same time,
they're always
-- they're middle schoolers.

48:23.267 --> 48:25.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's a certain maturity level
there.

48:25.069 --> 48:29.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They notice what these
candidates are saying
and the hateful rhetoric that is
coming out

48:29.373 --> 48:30.708 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of their mouths.

48:30.741 --> 48:33.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you have to forewarn them:
We're not going
to focus on that.

48:33.577 --> 48:35.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to take the high
road.

48:35.312 --> 48:38.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some of the things that are
coming out
of these candidates' mouths, I
don't want

48:38.582 --> 48:40.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them coming out of yours.

48:40.351 --> 48:43.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do want them to be able to
formulate their
own opinions, but, at the same
time, they

48:43.654 --> 48:47.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also have to know that, in my
classroom, bigotry
and hate doesn't have a place.

48:47.424 --> 48:51.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Richard, what
about the
administration or parents
knowing that these

48:51.762 --> 48:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conversations are happening in
the classrooms
of their children?

48:55.199 --> 48:56.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Have they been supportive?

48:56.200 --> 48:57.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RICHARD HOUSE: I think so.

48:58.002 --> 49:03.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think my goal this year is to
bring certain
as we -- current events to
issue, to light

49:03.174 --> 49:04.375 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in my classroom.

49:04.408 --> 49:05.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We focused on police brutality.

49:05.943 --> 49:10.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We talked about Colin
Kaepernick's protest.

49:10.181 --> 49:14.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And after that, I got an e-mail
from a parent
thanking me for bringing those
issues to light,

49:14.885 --> 49:20.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they were able to have a
substantive
conversation about police
brutality and privilege,

49:20.391 --> 49:22.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something that they normally
might not have
had at the dinner table.

49:22.626 --> 49:28.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I think parents are
appreciative when
teachers do bring to light
certain issues

49:28.065 --> 49:29.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that are currently going on in
our country.

49:29.867 --> 49:33.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Chris
Cavanaugh, how do
you walk the line between
teaching them how

49:33.103 --> 49:34.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to think and not what to think?

49:34.839 --> 49:40.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER CAVANAUGH: Well, I
think it's
important to create -- listening
to Richard

49:40.110 --> 49:44.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speak, I think it's important to
create that
environment where it's a safe
environment,

49:44.248 --> 49:47.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
especially maybe for my
students, being a
little bit older and maybe a
little further

49:47.751 --> 49:54.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
along in the political
socialization process,
to have them start to -- a safe
environment

49:54.091 --> 49:58.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to express those ideas and then
to get them
to examine themselves.

49:58.229 --> 50:03.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I like to play devil's advocate
quite a bit
with my students, regardless of
what they

50:03.767 --> 50:10.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
support, and to challenge them
on those views
to get them to reexamine their
own views.

50:10.040 --> 50:16.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, thankfully, you know, we're
well aware
of fact-checking organizations
that exist,

50:16.380 --> 50:21.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so we can go back and fact-check
debates to
see what the candidates have
said and how

50:21.685 --> 50:24.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
well it holds up under scrutiny.

50:24.555 --> 50:27.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Richard, how
do the facts
play into it?

50:27.524 --> 50:29.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Technically, they're coming into
your classroom.

50:29.260 --> 50:34.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're expecting you to maybe
help them see
what is true and what isn't.

50:34.965 --> 50:36.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do you get that across?

50:36.767 --> 50:40.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD HOUSE: I think, a lot of
times, it's
my job to guide their thinking,
but not tell

50:40.537 --> 50:44.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them what to think, give them
the resources
out there, so that they can go
out and do

50:44.742 --> 50:47.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the research and formulate an
opinion on their
own.

50:47.912 --> 50:50.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For example, today, we were
talking about
voting.

50:50.381 --> 50:53.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We registered to vote for a mock
election
that we're going to have in with
weeks.

50:53.584 --> 50:55.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then we focused on voter
I.D. laws.

50:55.452 --> 51:00.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I presented information on,
these are how
voter I.D. laws impact people
across this

51:00.524 --> 51:02.293 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

51:02.326 --> 51:05.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you think that -- and I posed
the question,
do you think this is done
because of voter

51:05.896 --> 51:11.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fraud, or is it done because --
to place an
unnecessary burden on minority
voters?

51:11.068 --> 51:13.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then I wanted them to be
able to formulate
their own opinion.

51:13.337 --> 51:17.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's my job to present them
with the information
they need, but it's their job to
form their

51:17.274 --> 51:19.043 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
own opinion.

51:19.076 --> 51:21.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally,
Chris, in this
day and age, your students can
be fairly active

51:21.745 --> 51:23.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
during the debate.

51:23.614 --> 51:26.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The next morning, when you look
past through
their Twitter feeds or their
Facebook comments,

51:26.817 --> 51:28.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what are you looking for?

51:28.385 --> 51:30.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER CAVANAUGH: Honestly,
I try not
to do that.

51:30.487 --> 51:32.256 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

51:32.289 --> 51:36.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER CAVANAUGH: I have
only had a couple
kids where I have had to go back
and say,

51:36.226 --> 51:41.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you know, what they posted
perhaps does not
encourage debate.

51:41.565 --> 51:44.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It doesn't push the debate or
conversation
forward.

51:44.335 --> 51:48.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, you want to avoid the
politics of
the personal attacks.

51:48.339 --> 51:53.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there have only been a
couple kids that
I have had to admonish for that.

51:53.344 --> 52:01.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we try to -- it's difficult,
because we're
trying to promote civic
discourse, civil discourse.

52:01.218 --> 52:05.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, unfortunately, we don't see
that in the
adult world as much as -- we
don't see it

52:05.689 --> 52:07.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
modeled for them as much as it
should be.

52:07.491 --> 52:11.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Chris Cavanaugh
from Plainfield High in Indiana
and Richard

52:11.428 --> 52:13.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House from Gunston Middle School
in Virginia,
thanks for joining us.

52:13.731 --> 52:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RICHARD HOUSE: Thank you for
having me.

52:16.066 --> 52:22.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER CAVANAUGH: Thank
you.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Tonight on
"Frontline": a joint
investigation with ProPublica
into efforts

52:29.446 --> 52:32.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to combat ISIS on the European
continent.

"Terror in Europe" looks at
government attempts
to counter extremism, revealing
missteps and

52:38.088 --> 52:44.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
systemic breakdowns in the
run-up to the Charlie

NARRATOR: As recruits returned
to Europe,
the authorities in France and
Belgium were

52:49.633 --> 52:51.101 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
overwhelmed.

52:51.135 --> 52:55.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Every
week, people
would come back from Syria.

52:55.839 --> 52:57.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There was nothing except Syria.

52:57.041 --> 52:58.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was all about Syria.

52:58.742 --> 53:02.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were so many cases related
to Syria
that people who should have been
watched just

53:02.312 --> 53:04.148 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
could not be.

53:04.181 --> 53:07.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clearly, we can't do everything,
and we didn't
have the means -- we still don't
-- to monitor

53:07.785 --> 53:09.686 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all of this.

53:09.720 --> 53:13.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LOUIS CAPRIOLI, Former French
Domestic Intelligence
Counterterror Chief (through
translator):

53:13.657 --> 53:17.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That brings up the issue of
having to make
choices.

53:17.461 --> 53:25.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
