ALE, REALLY BELIEVE THAT JUSTICE

01:46.206 --> 01:50.644 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCALIA WAS A LEADER OF

01:50.644 --> 01:52.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSERVATIVE LEGAL THOUGHT, NOT

01:52.746 --> 01:54.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST ON THE SUPREME COURT, BUT

01:54.548 --> 01:56.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALSO OFF THE BENCH.

01:56.883 --> 02:00.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN PARTICULAR, HE WAS -- HE

02:00.554 --> 02:03.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REVITALIZED, BROUGHT 0 TO THE

02:03.357 --> 02:05.125 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORE, TO THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS

02:05.125 --> 02:08.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO JUDGES AND LAWYERS HIS BELIEF

02:08.695 --> 02:10.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN ORIGINALISM AS A WAY OF

02:10.597 --> 02:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERPRETING THE CONSTITUTION.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.602 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE LOOKED AT THE CONSTITUTION'S

02:15.602 --> 02:18.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TEXT AND HE SAW THE MEANING OF

02:18.472 --> 02:21.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CONSTITUTION, NOT IN TERMS

02:21.008 --> 02:23.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE

02:23.310 --> 02:25.879 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRAMERS, BUT FOR WHAT THE WORDS

02:25.879 --> 02:27.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEANT OR WERE UNDERSTOOD TO MEAN

02:27.748 --> 02:30.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THE TIME OF THE WRITING, AND

02:30.217 --> 02:33.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE HAS, BY TAKING THAT APPROACH,

02:33.086 --> 02:35.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE HAS SENSITIZED ALL OF THE

02:35.088 --> 02:36.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUSTICES ON THE BENCH, WHO DO

02:36.957 --> 02:38.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT CALL THEMSELVES ORIGINAL

02:38.792 --> 02:41.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIST TO AT LEAST LOOK FIRST AT

02:41.695 --> 02:43.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WORDS OF THE CONSTITUTION

02:43.697 --> 02:45.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHAT THE MEANING WAS AT THE

02:45.665 --> 02:47.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIME THEY WERE WRITTEN, AND I

02:47.667 --> 02:49.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK THAT HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS

02:49.603 --> 02:51.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTRIBUTION, A THAT HE WILL BE

02:51.405 --> 02:52.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOWN FOR.

02:52.873 --> 02:53.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Thompson: WERE THERE

02:53.673 --> 02:55.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPECIFIC AREAS OF THE LAW WHERE

02:55.475 --> 02:57.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WAS MOST INFLUENTIAL OR A

02:57.444 --> 02:59.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEADER ON THE COURT?

02:59.279 --> 03:00.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YES.

03:00.414 --> 03:04.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIRST OF ALL, HE LED SOMETHING

03:04.017 --> 03:05.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF A REVOLUTION ON THE COURT IN

03:05.819 --> 03:07.954 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERMS OF THE MEANING OF THE

03:07.954 --> 03:10.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIXTH AMENDMENT, CONFRONTATION

03:10.390 --> 03:12.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLAUSE, AND AS YOU KNOW, THAT IS

03:12.259 --> 03:13.994 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CLAUSE THAT SAYS A CRIMINAL

03:13.994 --> 03:16.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEFENDANT HAS THE RIGHT TO

03:16.296 --> 03:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONFRONT HIS OR HER ACCUSERS,

03:19.433 --> 03:21.301 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HE BELIEVED THAT THAT --

03:21.301 --> 03:23.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IT MEANS,

03:23.737 --> 03:27.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT MEANS THAT WHOEVER ACTUALLY

03:27.007 --> 03:29.576 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TESTS THE DNA HAS TO SHOW UP IN

03:29.576 --> 03:32.245 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COURTROOM TO TESTIFY TO THE

03:32.245 --> 03:34.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESULTS OF THAT DNA TEST.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU COULDN'T USE A SURROGATE,

03:36.316 --> 03:38.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU HAD TO HAVE THE RIGHT PERSON

03:38.785 --> 03:40.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THE WITNESS STAND.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE ALSO REINVIGORATED THE WORLD

03:42.956 --> 03:46.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF JURIES AS FACT FINDERS.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WERE TIMES IN CERTAIN

03:47.894 --> 03:50.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASES WHERE JUDGES WOULD DECIDE

03:50.397 --> 03:52.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACTS, BUT HE SAID THAT HAD

03:52.099 --> 03:54.768 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALWAYS BEEN THE ROLE OF THE JURY

03:54.768 --> 03:56.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND FOR A SERIES OF DECISIONS ON

03:56.736 --> 03:59.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COURT MADE THAT CLEAR.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK THOSE AREAS, HE WILL

04:01.475 --> 04:03.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE KNOWN FOR AS WELL.

04:03.443 --> 04:05.779 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN FACT, HE OFTEN GAVE A JOKE HE

04:05.779 --> 04:08.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD BE A CRIMINAL DEFENDANT'S

04:08.682 --> 04:11.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEST FRIEND.

04:11.017 --> 04:12.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> AND CAN YOU TELL US, HOW DOES

04:12.953 --> 04:14.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DEATH AFFECT THE CASES THAT

04:14.421 --> 04:16.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE CURRENTLY PENDING?

04:16.456 --> 04:18.725 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT IS A VERY GOOD QUESTION.

04:18.725 --> 04:20.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS YOU KNOW, THERE ARE NINE

04:20.060 --> 04:21.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUSTICES.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH HIS DEATH THERE ARE EIGHT

04:23.296 --> 04:26.032 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THERE ARE CASES THAT MAY I

04:26.032 --> 04:28.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSPECT HAVE BEEN DECIDED BY A

04:28.802 --> 04:31.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIVIDED VOTE IF HE WERE STILL ON

04:31.138 --> 04:34.407 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BENCH, PERHAPS 5-4, VERY

04:34.407 --> 04:37.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIGH PROFILE, HIGH STAKES

04:37.611 --> 04:39.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES BEFORE THE

04:39.279 --> 04:41.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COURT THIS TERM, LIKE ABORTION,

04:41.915 --> 04:45.152 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMMIGRATION, CASES INVOLVING THE

04:45.152 --> 04:48.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REDISTRICTING MILLIONS.

04:48.188 --> 04:49.589 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH HIS DEATH, THERE ARE EIGHT

04:49.589 --> 04:51.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUSTICES REMAINING AND WHETHER,

04:51.691 --> 04:54.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, HE HAS ACTUALLY --

04:54.628 --> 04:57.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RULED ON KNOWS CASES ALREADY,

04:57.297 --> 04:58.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME OF THOSE CASES HAVE NOT

04:58.698 --> 05:00.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN BEEN ARGUED YET, IT SETS UP

05:00.967 --> 05:03.370 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE EIGHT

05:03.370 --> 05:05.839 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUSTICES AND THE POSSIBILITY OF

05:05.839 --> 05:10.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOUR-FOUR SPLIT, WHICH MEANS

05:10.010 --> 05:12.712 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT A REGULAR COURT'S DECISION

05:12.712 --> 05:15.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STANDS IF THE COURT DIVIDES 4-4.

05:15.248 --> 05:16.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE

05:16.416 --> 05:18.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO HAVE TO BE WORKED OUT

05:18.385 --> 05:20.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS THE JUSTICES GO FORWARD NOW

05:20.387 --> 05:21.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITHOUT JUSTICE SCALIA ON THE

05:25.792 --> 05:27.327 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD THIS VACANCY CREATED

05:27.327 --> 05:30.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFFECT THE BALANCE OF THE COURT?

05:30.096 --> 05:32.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THAT IS JUST WHAT I

05:32.432 --> 05:35.602 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HINTED AT A LITTLE BIT.

05:35.602 --> 05:38.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS I SAID, RIGHT NOW, THE COURT

05:38.705 --> 05:41.908 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS DIVIDED IDEOLOGICALLY 5-4,

05:41.908 --> 05:45.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU HAVE FIVE JUSTICES WHO WHO

ARE APPOINTED BY REPUBLICANS,

05:47.080 --> 05:48.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:56.856 --> 06:00.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
4-4 SPLIT.

06:00.193 --> 06:03.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE VACANCY WOULD BE A VERY

06:03.363 --> 06:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTROVERSIAL HIGH PROFILE

06:06.266 --> 06:09.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VACANCY, A LOT DEPENDS ON WHAT

06:09.603 --> 06:11.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SENATE'S WISHES ARE AT THIS

06:11.104 --> 06:12.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POINT.

06:12.405 --> 06:14.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL PRESIDENT OBAMA TRY TO FILL

06:14.241 --> 06:16.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT VACANCY AS SOON AS

06:16.076 --> 06:17.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POSSIBLE?

06:17.944 --> 06:19.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WOULD BE FILLING ONE OF THE

06:19.913 --> 06:22.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSERVATIVE SPLITS, WHICH SINCE

06:22.849 --> 06:25.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE IS A DEMOCRAT, IF HE WANTED

06:25.151 --> 06:27.887 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO GET THROUGH SOMEONE WHO WAS A

06:27.887 --> 06:30.156 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIBERAL OR MODERATE LIBERAL,

06:30.156 --> 06:31.725 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT COULD SHIFT THE BALANCE OF

06:31.725 --> 06:33.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COURT.

06:33.526 --> 06:34.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE A LOT OF UNKNOWNS

06:34.694 --> 06:36.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT NOW.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.264 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE ARE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO

06:37.264 --> 06:39.032 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAIT AND SEE.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY

06:40.267 --> 06:41.768 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

IN GENERAL.

06:43.503 --> 06:45.972 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I KNOW THAT MANY OF -- SOMETIMES

STINGING AND PEOPLE WONDERED,

06:51.311 --> 06:52.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DID THE OTHER JUSTICES TAKE

OFFENSE AT SOME OF THE LANGUAGE

06:54.714 --> 06:57.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE USED, AND THE TRUTH IS, HE

06:57.350 --> 07:00.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS WIDELY LIKED ON THE BENCH

07:00.287 --> 07:02.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

HE WAS -- HE COULD BE VERY

07:14.968 --> 07:19.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FUNNY, AND SO I THINK HE WANTED

07:19.272 --> 07:20.607 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- HE IS GOING TO BE MISSED VERY

07:20.607 --> 07:22.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

10:23.756 --> 10:25.291 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPTIMISM THAT THOSE WILL BE

10:25.291 --> 10:26.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STARK, AND THE QUESTION IS HOW

10:26.793 --> 10:28.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONG WILL THEY LAST?

10:28.528 --> 10:30.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SECOND AND MUCH HARDER PART

10:30.063 --> 10:31.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THIS IS WHAT MOST PEOPLE

10:31.698 --> 10:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD CALL A CEASE-FIRE AND WHAT

10:33.700 --> 10:34.801 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE CALLING FOR THESE

10:34.801 --> 10:36.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PURPOSES A CESSATION OF

10:36.569 --> 10:38.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOSTILITIES.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.607 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN SECRETARY KERRY HAS SAID

10:40.607 --> 10:42.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS MAY ONLY BE A PAUSE.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE IDEA IS GIVE ENOUGH OF A

10:44.944 --> 10:46.613 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUIET MOMENT TO ACTUALLY GET

10:46.613 --> 10:48.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEGOTIATIONS GOING.

10:48.114 --> 10:49.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Thompson: IT SEEMS THAT AS

10:49.382 --> 10:50.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TALK OF THIS CEASE-FIRE HAVE

10:50.984 --> 10:52.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCREASED, SO HAVE TENSIONS

10:52.619 --> 10:54.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETWEEN THE U.S. AND RUSSIA.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THIS JUST POSTURING, OR IS IT

10:56.189 --> 10:57.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER?

10:57.724 --> 10:59.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YOU KNOW, IT REALLY IS

10:59.025 --> 11:01.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING BIGGER.

11:01.427 --> 11:02.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK OF THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS.

11:02.795 --> 11:04.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE THE CONTINUED TENSIONS

11:04.898 --> 11:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SANCTIONS OVER UKRAINE.

11:07.066 --> 11:08.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE THE INCREASED RUSSIAN

11:08.968 --> 11:11.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PATROLS OFF THE OF THE BRITISH

11:11.871 --> 11:15.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COAST, OFF MOST OF EUROPE, MORE

11:15.275 --> 11:18.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NUCLEAR FORCES BEING EXERCISED.

11:18.144 --> 11:20.046 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK HERE, THE AMERICANS

11:20.046 --> 11:21.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE TAKEN A LITTLE BIT BY

11:21.314 --> 11:24.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SURPRISE AT THE SPEED AT WHICH

11:24.551 --> 11:27.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RUSSIANS ENDED UP ENTERING

11:27.120 --> 11:29.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT AIR WAR OVER ALEPPO, AND

11:29.522 --> 11:31.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THUS GAINING SOME LEVERAGE THAT

11:31.357 --> 11:32.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE U.S. RIGHT NOW DOES NOT HAVE

11:32.992 --> 11:34.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN RETURN.

11:34.093 --> 11:34.994 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Thompson: ONE OF THE

11:34.994 --> 11:36.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISSUES THAT HAS CAUSED TENSION

11:36.629 --> 11:38.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES IS

11:38.231 --> 11:39.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS ISSUE OF MILITARY

11:39.098 --> 11:40.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COORDINATION IN SYRIA.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

11:42.001 --> 11:43.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT AND IF THERE'S BEEN ANY

11:43.102 --> 11:44.904 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOVEMENT ON THAT FRONT.

11:44.904 --> 11:46.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN

11:46.239 --> 11:48.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY, VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT

11:48.041 --> 11:49.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GETTING INTO COORDINATION WITH

11:49.776 --> 11:51.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RUSSIANS BECAUSE THEY SAY,

11:51.377 --> 11:52.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOK, THE RUSSIANS ARE DECEIVING

11:52.745 --> 11:54.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE ABOUT WHO THEY'RE

11:54.847 --> 11:55.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRIKING.

11:55.815 --> 11:56.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE STRIKING MANY OF THE

11:56.950 --> 11:59.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REBEL GROUPS ALIGNED WITH THE

11:59.452 --> 12:01.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNITED STATES OTHER ANDS WHO

12:01.321 --> 12:03.323 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE BEEN OPPOSING ASSAD, AND

12:03.323 --> 12:04.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAYING THAT THEY'RE JUST

12:04.257 --> 12:06.125 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRIKING THE TWO TERROR GROUPS

12:06.125 --> 12:07.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED BY THE

12:07.760 --> 12:09.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNITED NATIONS, THE ISLAMIC

STATE, AND THE AL-NUSRA FRONT.

12:12.131 --> 12:16.669 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE COORDINATION IS GOING TO

12:16.669 --> 12:18.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE UNAVOIDABLE OVER THE NEXT FEW

12:18.905 --> 12:20.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEEKS BECAUSE THEY'RE SUPPOSED

12:20.673 --> 12:22.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO WORK TOGETHER IN A JOINT TASK

THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO WORK

TOGETHER ON THE CEASE-FIRE, AND

12:31.217 --> 12:31.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO WORK

12:31.985 --> 12:32.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOGETHER ON THE HUMANITARIAN

12:32.952 --> 12:34.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AID.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO THAT

12:35.822 --> 12:36.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITHOUT SOMETHING THAT

12:36.990 --> 12:39.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APPROACHES COORDINATION, MADE

12:39.092 --> 12:40.493 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL THE HARDER BY THE FACT THAT

12:40.493 --> 12:42.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE UNITED STATES, OF COURSE,

12:42.028 --> 12:44.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BACK INTO THE SANCTIONS BUSINESS

12:44.097 --> 12:46.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAINST THE RUSSIANS RIGHT NOW.

12:46.099 --> 12:46.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Thompson: DAVID, YOU CAN

12:46.899 --> 12:47.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE

12:47.734 --> 12:49.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIMETABLE, HOW THIS WILL ALL

12:49.035 --> 12:51.437 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORK ON THE GROUND.

12:51.437 --> 12:52.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, MEGAN, THE WAY IT'S

12:52.238 --> 12:54.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPPOSED TO WORK IS THAT THE

12:54.107 --> 12:55.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HUMANITARIAN RELIEF IS SUPPOSED

12:55.541 --> 12:57.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BEGIN WITHIN DAYS, AND

12:57.677 --> 12:59.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECRETARY KERRY SAID TODAY THAT

12:59.812 --> 13:01.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TRUCKS ARE LOADED UP AND

13:01.147 --> 13:02.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
READY TO GO.

13:02.548 --> 13:04.617 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THAT'S A DIFFERENT THING

13:04.617 --> 13:06.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAN ACTUALLY GETTING THEM INTO

13:06.019 --> 13:07.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE.

13:07.086 --> 13:07.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE RUSSIANS ARE SUPPOSED TO

13:07.987 --> 13:09.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE AIRDROPPING SOME AID.

13:09.956 --> 13:10.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME OF THE BIG QUESTIONS IS

13:10.923 --> 13:12.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE THEY AIRED DROP IT AND TO

13:12.325 --> 13:14.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH PEOPLE?

13:14.093 --> 13:16.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF A WEEK FROM TODAY WE STILL

13:16.062 --> 13:17.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEE A LOT OF FIGHTING GOING ON,

13:17.797 --> 13:19.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEN YOU'LL KNOW THAT THIS

13:19.399 --> 13:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WASN'T WORK THE WAY IT WAS

13:20.700 --> 13:21.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPPOSED TO.
