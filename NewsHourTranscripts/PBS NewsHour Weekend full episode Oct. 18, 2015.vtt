00:42.967 --> 00:43.700
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING AND

00:43.700 --> 00:44.867
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:44.867 --> 00:46.200
ISRAEL IS ANNOUNCING NEW STEPS

00:46.200 --> 00:47.000
TO CURB A RASH OF DEADLY ATTACKS

00:47.000 --> 00:49.900
ON ITS CITIZENS.

00:49.900 --> 00:51.067
AN ARAB MAN SHOT AND STABBED

00:51.067 --> 00:52.500
PEOPLE IN A BUS STATION IN THE

00:52.500 --> 00:53.333
SOUTHERN ISRAELI CITY OF

00:53.333 --> 00:54.567
BEERSHEBA.

00:54.567 --> 00:56.667
POLICE SAY AN ISRAELI SOLDIER

00:56.667 --> 00:58.033
DIED, AND TEN PEOPLE WERE

00:58.033 --> 00:59.233

00:59.233 --> 01:00.467
EARLIER IN THE DAY, THE ISRAELI

01:00.467 --> 01:01.667
CABINET PROPOSED POLICE BE

01:01.667 --> 01:03.167
ALLOWED TO STOP AND FRISK ANYONE

01:03.167 --> 01:04.267

01:04.267 --> 01:06.267
CARRYING A WEAPON.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.933
TEL AVIV AND THREE OTHER CITIES

01:07.933 --> 01:09.533
SAID THEY WILL PROHIBIT ARAB

01:09.533 --> 01:10.567
WORKERS IN THEIR SCHOOLS

01:10.567 --> 01:12.167
STARTING TOMORROW.

01:12.167 --> 01:13.767
AND ISRAEL IS ENFORCING

01:13.767 --> 01:14.633
ROADBLOCKS IN ARAB EAST

01:14.633 --> 01:16.067
JERUSALEM.

01:16.067 --> 01:17.500
THE MOVE COMES A DAY AFTER

01:17.500 --> 01:18.933
PALESTINIANS CARRIED OUT FIVE

01:18.933 --> 01:20.400
KNIFE ATTACKS ON ISRAELIS IN

01:20.400 --> 01:21.767
JERUSALEM AND THE WEST BANK.

01:21.767 --> 01:22.600
FOUR OF THOSE ATTACKERS WERE

01:22.600 --> 01:24.067
SHOT AND KILLED.

01:24.067 --> 01:25.300
OVER THE PAST MONTH, EIGHT

01:25.300 --> 01:26.567
ISRAELIS HAVE DIED IN

01:26.567 --> 01:28.100
PALESTINIAN STABBINGS, WHILE

01:28.100 --> 01:29.733
ISRAELI SOLDIERS AND POLICE HAVE

01:29.733 --> 01:31.333
SHOT AND KILLED AROUND 40

01:31.333 --> 01:32.700
PALESTINIANS IN CLASHES, MANY OF

01:32.700 --> 01:33.900
WHOM ISRAEL IDENTIFIED AS KNIFE

01:33.900 --> 01:36.233
ATTACKERS.

01:36.233 --> 01:38.200
TODAY, ISRAELI SOLDIERS REMOVED

01:38.200 --> 01:39.833
30 JEWISH WORSHIPPERS WHO DID

01:39.833 --> 01:41.833
NOT HAVE PERMISSION TO GATHER
IN"

01:41.833 --> 01:43.967
JOSEPH'S TOMB," A SHRINE NAMED

01:43.967 --> 01:45.100
AFTER THE BIBLICAL JOSEPH IN THE

01:45.100 --> 01:46.033
PALESTINIAN-CONTROLLED CITY OF

01:46.033 --> 01:47.733
NABLUS.

01:47.733 --> 01:49.767
THE UNREST THAT BEGAN FOUR WEEKS

01:49.767 --> 01:51.267
AGO WAS FUELED BY RUMORS THAT

01:51.267 --> 01:52.733
ISRAEL MIGHT LIMIT ACCESS TO THE

01:52.733 --> 01:53.733
AL AQSA MOSQUE IN JERUSALEM'S

01:53.733 --> 01:55.267
OLD CITY.

01:55.267 --> 01:57.467
AGAIN TODAY ISRAELI PRIME

01:57.467 --> 01:59.000
MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAID

01:59.000 --> 02:00.167
THAT IS WRONG, THAT ISRAEL IS"

02:00.167 --> 02:03.033
PRESERVING THE STATUS QUO" IN

02:03.033 --> 02:04.467
THE OLD CITY, WHICH HAS SITES

02:04.467 --> 02:05.600
SACRED TO JEWS, MUSLIMS, AND

02:05.600 --> 02:07.267
CHRISTIANS.

02:07.267 --> 02:08.900
U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN

02:08.900 --> 02:11.033
KERRY SAID TODAY HE PLANS TO

02:11.033 --> 02:12.033
MEET SEPARATELY THIS WEEK WITH

02:12.033 --> 02:13.667
NETANYAHU AND PALESTINIAN

02:13.667 --> 02:14.767
PRESIDENT MAHMOUD ABBAS TO TRY

02:14.767 --> 02:16.367
TO DEFUSE TENSIONS.

02:16.367 --> 02:18.033
CORRESPONDENT MARTIN SEEMUNGAL

02:18.033 --> 02:19.433
IS IN JERUSALEM AND JOINS ME NOW

02:19.433 --> 02:20.767
BY SKYPE TO DISCUSS THE LATEST

02:20.767 --> 02:25.267
ON THE SITUATION THERE.

02:25.267 --> 02:25.833
WHAT ARE THE IMPACTS

02:25.833 --> 02:27.567
ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS OF ALL

02:27.567 --> 02:30.933
THESE ROADBLOCKS, DO YOU FEEL

02:30.933 --> 02:31.633
IT?

02:31.633 --> 02:34.067
YEAH, YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN

02:34.067 --> 02:35.433
COMING TO EAST JERUSALEM FOR

02:35.433 --> 02:37.033
QUITE SOME TIME AND HAVE NEVER

02:37.033 --> 02:37.633
SEEN ROADBLOCKS.

02:37.633 --> 02:39.500
THERE IS ONE JUST DOWN THE ROAD

02:39.500 --> 02:41.267
THAT HAS NEVER BEEN HERE IN THE

02:41.267 --> 02:43.067
TIME I HAVE BEEN COMING HERE.

02:43.067 --> 02:45.133
INITIALLY IT WAS JUST A CAR WITH

02:45.133 --> 02:46.967
SOME BORDER POLICE MANNING THE

02:46.967 --> 02:49.367
ROAD BLOCKS, STOPPING PEOPLE.

02:49.367 --> 02:50.800
NEXT DAY THEY DROPPED ABOUT

02:50.800 --> 02:53.100
THREE OR FOUR HUGE CON CREATE

02:53.100 --> 02:53.667
BLOCKS ON THE ROAD.

02:53.667 --> 02:56.133
BUT THERE ARE ROADBLOCKS GOING

02:56.133 --> 03:00.267
OUT OF MOST OF THE AREAS

03:00.267 --> 03:02.467
OF-- THE ARAB AREAS OF EAST

03:02.467 --> 03:03.667
JERUSALEM, SOME CLOSER TO

03:03.667 --> 03:05.700
JERUSALEM ITSELF.

03:05.700 --> 03:06.567
OTHERS A LITTLE BIT MORE REMOTE.

03:06.567 --> 03:10.633
SOME OF THE ARAB AREAS THERE,

03:10.633 --> 03:14.100
WHERE BASICALLY WE KNOW THAT THE

03:14.100 --> 03:16.467
ISRAELIS ARE SAYING THE THREE OF

03:16.467 --> 03:18.600
THE ALLEGED ASSAILANTS ACTUALLY

03:18.600 --> 03:20.133
CAME FROM THAT AREA.

03:20.133 --> 03:22.767
AND THAT AREA HAS BEEN-- SEEMS

03:22.767 --> 03:25.033
TO HAVE BEEN SEALED OFF.

03:25.033 --> 03:26.233
AND OBVIOUSLY THIS CAUSES ALL

03:26.233 --> 03:27.867
KINDS OF TENSION IN AND AROUND

03:27.867 --> 03:30.300
THE AREA.

03:30.300 --> 03:31.567
JERUSALEM, PEOPLE LIVE IN CLOSE

03:31.567 --> 03:32.833
QUARTERS, IT DOES HAVE AN IMPACT

03:32.833 --> 03:34.300
ON DAY TO DAY LIVES.

03:34.300 --> 03:35.367
>> Sreenivasan: CAN YOU FEEL THE

03:35.367 --> 03:36.000
TENSION?

03:36.000 --> 03:37.067
IS IT PALPABLE?

03:37.067 --> 03:39.267
THIS IS A REGION THAT IS USED TO

03:39.267 --> 03:41.900
THESE SORTS OF STRESSES.

03:41.900 --> 03:43.700
>> YEAH, BUT THIS IS SOME WHAT

03:43.700 --> 03:44.200
DIFFERENT, HARI.

03:44.200 --> 03:46.200
BECAUSE WHAT YOU'VE GOT ARE

03:46.200 --> 03:47.767
THESE KNIFE ATTACKS.

03:47.767 --> 03:49.967
THEY COME RANDOMLY.

03:49.967 --> 03:52.967
YOU KNOW, YOU TALK TO JEWISH

03:52.967 --> 03:54.467
ISRAELIS ON THE STREET AND THEY

03:54.467 --> 03:56.667
SAY, YOU KNOW, WE COULD BE

03:56.667 --> 03:58.100
STANDING AT A BUS STOP WAITING

03:58.100 --> 04:01.767
TO CATCH THE BUS AND THERE COULD

04:01.767 --> 04:03.300
BE AN ATTACK RIGHT THERE.

04:03.300 --> 04:05.067
IT COMES WITHOUT WARNING.

04:05.067 --> 04:07.033
AS A RESULT OF THAT, PEOPLE ARE

04:07.033 --> 04:09.633
REALLY QUITE NERVOUS ABOUT IT.

04:09.633 --> 04:11.933
AND THAT IS SOMETHING WE HADN'T

04:11.933 --> 04:16.033
SEEN SINCE ITS SECOND INTIFADA,

04:16.033 --> 04:17.700
I SUPPOSE THERE COULD BE THOSE

04:17.700 --> 04:19.233
TENSION BACK IN 2001 WHEN I WAS

04:19.233 --> 04:20.100
ALSO HERE WITH THE BUS BOMBS

04:20.100 --> 04:22.000
GOING OFF, AND THE SUICIDE BOMBS

04:22.000 --> 04:23.400
THAT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH

04:23.400 --> 04:27.033
THAT SECOND INTIFADA.

04:27.033 --> 04:28.867
THIS ROUND OF VIOLENCE, OF

04:28.867 --> 04:31.167
STRIFE IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT,

04:31.167 --> 04:33.900
IS BASICALLY DRIVEN BY RANDOM

04:33.900 --> 04:35.567
KNIFE ATTACKS.

04:35.567 --> 04:36.533
LONE WOLVES.

04:36.533 --> 04:38.133
AND NOT ONLY DOES THAT CAUSE A

04:38.133 --> 04:40.167
LOT OF TENSION, BUT JUST PEOPLE

04:40.167 --> 04:41.600
GOING ABOUT THEIR DAILY LIVES

04:41.600 --> 04:43.400
WHETHER IT'S GOING SHOPPING,

04:43.400 --> 04:44.133
GOING TO THE BUS STOP OR

04:44.133 --> 04:44.867
WHATEVER.

04:44.867 --> 04:46.267
BUT IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT

04:46.267 --> 04:47.967
FOR THE ISRAELI POLICE TO COMBAT

04:47.967 --> 04:49.433
IT AND HENCE THEY ARE PUTTING IN

04:49.433 --> 04:50.600
THE ROADBLOCKS TO TRY TO DO

04:50.600 --> 04:51.200
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.100
>> I ALSO WANT TO GIVE OUR

04:53.100 --> 04:53.867
VIEWERS A LITTLE BIT OF A

04:53.867 --> 04:54.767
PREVIEW OF THE PIECE THAT YOU

04:54.767 --> 04:57.000
ARE WORKING ON FOR THE PROGRAM

04:57.000 --> 04:58.100
TOMORROW NIGHT.

04:58.100 --> 05:00.167
>> WELL, AS YOU KNOW, THERE WAS

05:00.167 --> 05:03.167
THIS ATTACK LAST WEEK INVOLVING

05:03.167 --> 05:04.500
TWO TEENAGERS.

05:04.500 --> 05:09.100
YOU HAD A 13 YEAR OLD ARAB

05:09.100 --> 05:11.033
PALESTINIAN ATTACKING A JEWISH

05:11.033 --> 05:11.900
BOY.

05:11.900 --> 05:14.067
HE WAS, IN A LOT OF THESE CASES

05:14.067 --> 05:16.400
THE ATTACKERS ARE SHOT DEAD

05:16.400 --> 05:17.367
INSTANTLY.

05:17.367 --> 05:19.033
HE HAD BEEN HIT BY A CAR, THAT

05:19.033 --> 05:20.167
VIDEO WENT OUT THERE WAS A GREAT

05:20.167 --> 05:22.133
DEAL OF ANGER IN THE ARAB WORLD

05:22.133 --> 05:23.500
BECAUSE IT SEEMED THAT NOBODY

05:23.500 --> 05:24.933
WAS DOING ANYTHING TO HELP THE

05:24.933 --> 05:25.300
BOY.

05:25.300 --> 05:26.567
HE'S NOW IN HOSPITAL.

05:26.567 --> 05:28.667
WE HAVE SPOKEN TO HIS-- SOME OF

05:28.667 --> 05:31.067
HIS FRIENDS, HIS FAMILY.

05:31.067 --> 05:32.733
AND WE TALKED TO PEOPLE ON THE

05:32.733 --> 05:34.033
OTHER SIDE, ON THE JEWISH SIDE.

05:34.033 --> 05:35.533
WE HAVE GONE TO THAT SETTLEMENT

05:35.533 --> 05:38.033
TO TRY TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT

05:38.033 --> 05:39.033
THAT IS DONE THIS.

05:39.033 --> 05:40.467
WE ARE TRYING TO DO A STORY OF

05:40.467 --> 05:41.833
SOMETHING THAT HASN'T REALLY

05:41.833 --> 05:42.967
BEEN SEEN BEFORE IN ISRAEL.

05:42.967 --> 05:44.967
FIRST OF ALL THESE LONE ATTACKS,

05:44.967 --> 05:46.233
AND THE ATTACKERS GETTING

05:46.233 --> 05:49.633
YOUNGER AND YOUNGER.

05:49.633 --> 05:50.333
>> Sreenivasan: MARTIN

05:50.333 --> 05:52.267
SEEMUNGAL, LOOKING FORWARD TO

05:52.267 --> 05:58.367
YOUR PIECE TOMORROW.

05:58.367 --> 05:59.367
>> Sreenivasan: 1,000 MIGRANTS

05:59.367 --> 06:00.367
CROSSED THE BORDER FROM SLOVENIA

06:00.367 --> 06:01.167
INTO AUSTRIA TODAY .

06:01.167 --> 06:02.400
BECAUSE OF HUNGARY'S CLOSURE OF

06:02.400 --> 06:04.133
ITS BORDER WITH NEIGHBORING

06:04.133 --> 06:05.233
CROATIA YESTERDAY.

06:05.233 --> 06:06.167
BUT SLOVENIA SAID TODAY IT WILL

06:06.167 --> 06:07.033
NOT ACCEPT AN "UNLIMITED" NUMBER

06:07.033 --> 06:08.467
OF MIGRANTS.

06:08.467 --> 06:10.133
MEANWHILE, GERMAN CHANCELLOR

06:10.133 --> 06:11.233
ANGELA MERKEL MET WITH TURKEY'S

06:11.233 --> 06:12.933
PRIME MINISTER TO TRY AND

06:12.933 --> 06:14.100
ADDRESS THE CRISIS CLOSER TO

06:14.100 --> 06:15.133
WHERE MOST REFUGEES FROM SYRIA,

06:15.133 --> 06:16.600
AND AFRICA ENTER EUROPE.

06:16.600 --> 06:17.767
MANY COME INTO TURKEY BEFORE

06:17.767 --> 06:19.400
LAUNCHING ON BOATS FOR GREECE

06:19.400 --> 06:20.300
AND ITALY.

06:20.300 --> 06:21.467
THE ITALIAN COAST GUARD RESCUED

06:21.467 --> 06:22.433
600 SUCH MIGRANTS FROM THE

06:22.433 --> 06:27.100
MEDITERRANEAN SEA THIS WEEKEND.

06:27.100 --> 06:28.100
HAWAII IS NOW FACING THE HIGHEST

06:28.100 --> 06:29.033
RATE OF HOMELESSNESS PER CAPITA

06:29.033 --> 06:32.167
IN THE UNITED STATES.

06:32.167 --> 06:33.700
THE STATE NOW COUNTS 7,600

06:33.700 --> 06:34.900
HOMELESS PEOPLE, WHICH IS 465

HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS FOR EVERY

100,000 RESIDENTS.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.033
THAT'S A 23% INCREASE IN THE

06:39.033 --> 06:40.767
PAST YEAR.

06:40.767 --> 06:41.867
HAWAII'S GOVERNOR DECLARED A

06:41.867 --> 06:44.067
STATE OF EMERGENCY AFTER

06:44.067 --> 06:45.167
CLEARING OUT ONE OF THE STATE'S

07:06.933 --> 07:08.300
WITH THE INCREASING SIZE OF

07:08.300 --> 07:09.333
CARGO SHIPS, AND BILLIONS OF

EVERYTHING WE TRADE WITH THE

07:24.500 --> 07:26.033
WORLD COMES THROUGH THESE PORTS.

07:26.033 --> 07:27.267
SO SHOULD THESE CITIES MAKE

07:27.267 --> 07:29.267
THEIR PORTS DEEPER?

07:29.267 --> 07:31.100
OR ARE THE COSTS, BOTH ECONOMIC

07:31.100 --> 07:33.667

BIGGEST U.S. PORTS BY CARGO

08:27.033 --> 08:29.033

THRIVE.

09:30.600 --> 09:31.700
SPENT TENS OF MILLIONS OF

09:31.700 --> 09:33.300
DOLLARS IN THE PAST DECADE TO

09:33.300 --> 09:35.033
MODERNIZE AND TO COMPETE WITH

09:35.033 --> 09:36.700
PORTS TO THE NORTH, LIKE

09:36.700 --> 09:37.700
SAVANNAH, GEORGIA, AND

09:37.700 --> 09:42.133
CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA.

09:42.133 --> 09:43.467
IN 2009, THE PORT COMPLETED A

09:43.467 --> 09:44.767
HIGH-TECH TERMINAL WITH 275-FOOT

09:46.700 --> 09:49.033
DOCK HERE.

09:49.033 --> 09:50.500
IT INSTALLED STATE-OF-THE ART

09:50.500 --> 09:52.033
TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE SHIPS

09:52.033 --> 09:53.567
ENTERING THE PORT BETTER

09:53.567 --> 09:55.067
NAVIGATIONAL INFORMATION.

09:55.067 --> 09:56.300
AND TO SPEED UP CARGO DELIVERY,

09:56.300 --> 09:58.467
THE PORT IS NOW BUILDING A

09:58.467 --> 09:59.300
FACILITY TO TRANSFER CONTAINERS

09:59.300 --> 10:00.333
DIRECTLY FROM SHIPS ONTO FREIGHT

10:04.867 --> 10:06.600
BUSINESS OF SERVICING NEW SHIPS

10:06.600 --> 10:08.067
POWERED BY LIQUEFIED NATURAL

10:08.067 --> 10:09.033

SHIPS.

10:13.167 --> 10:14.867
BUT ALL OF THESE INNOVATIONS

10:14.867 --> 10:16.633
MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH FOR JAXPORT

JAXPORT C.E.O. BRIAN TAYLOR, WHO

10:19.700 --> 10:20.467

10:20.467 --> 10:23.267
DEEPENED BY SEVEN FEET.

10:23.267 --> 10:25.333
>> DEEPENING THE PORT IS TO

10:25.333 --> 10:27.400
ALLOW US TO COMPETE AND HANDLE

THE SHIPS OF THE FUTURE THAT ARE

10:29.067 --> 10:30.033
GOING TO BE CARRYING THE CARGO

10:30.033 --> 10:31.800
TO THE EAST COAST PORTS.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.167
>> Reporter: IN THE LAST TWO

10:33.167 --> 10:34.767
DECADES, THE SHIPPING INDUSTRY

10:34.767 --> 10:36.033
HAS BUILT BIGGER AND BIGGER

10:36.033 --> 10:36.800
SHIPS, TRIPLING THE CAPACITY OF

10:36.800 --> 10:38.767
THE LARGEST ONES.

10:38.767 --> 10:40.300
TODAY, THE BIGGEST SHIP IS A

10:40.300 --> 10:41.733
QUARTER-MILE LONG, LONGER THAN

10:41.733 --> 10:42.633
THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING IS

10:42.633 --> 10:44.967
TALL.

10:44.967 --> 10:46.567
AS A RESULT, THE 101-YEAR-OLD

10:46.567 --> 10:48.300
PANAMA CANAL, WHICH CONNECTS THE

10:48.300 --> 10:50.233
PACIFIC AND ATLANTIC OCEANS, IS

10:50.233 --> 10:52.000
EXPANDING TO ACCOMMODATE THE NEW

10:52.000 --> 10:53.700
SHIPS, DOUBLING ITS CAPACITY BY

10:53.700 --> 10:54.467
DEEPENING AND WIDENING ITS

10:54.467 --> 10:56.567
CHANNELS.

10:56.567 --> 10:57.833

11:04.033 --> 11:06.067

11:06.067 --> 11:07.733
LEAD TO 10% OF WEST COAST SHIP

11:07.733 --> 11:09.033
TRAFFIC SHIFTING TO THE EAST IN

11:09.033 --> 11:11.467

11:11.467 --> 11:13.200
PORTS UP AND DOWN THE EASTERN

11:13.200 --> 11:14.900
SEABOARD ARE SPENDING BILLIONS

11:14.900 --> 11:17.033
TO SNAG A SHARE OF THAT TRAFFIC.

11:17.033 --> 11:19.033
JAXPORT'S TAYLOR SAYS HIS HARBOR

11:19.033 --> 11:21.033
NEEDS TO BE DEEPENED BY SEVEN

11:21.033 --> 11:23.867
FEET, OR ELSE.

11:23.867 --> 11:25.833

11:27.833 --> 11:28.767
BIGGEST GROWTH SEGMENT OVER THE

11:31.867 --> 11:33.033
FOOT DEEP CHANNEL IS ALREADY TOO

11:33.033 --> 11:36.033
SHALLOW.

11:36.033 --> 11:37.533
IT REQUIRES SOME LARGE SHIPS TO

11:37.533 --> 11:38.767
CARRY LESS THAN A FULL LOAD TO

11:38.767 --> 11:40.167
AVOID SCRAPING THE BOTTOM.

11:40.167 --> 11:41.100
AND THAT RESULTS IN LESS REVENUE

11:41.100 --> 11:45.233
FOR THE PORT.

11:45.233 --> 11:47.100
>> IF WE DO NOT DEEPEN THIS

11:47.100 --> 11:48.500

11:48.500 --> 11:50.433
BUSINESS THAT WE'VE WORKED SO

11:50.433 --> 11:52.033
HARD TO GAIN TO GRADUALLY MOVE

11:53.800 --> 11:55.000
JOBS THAT WE'VE WORKED TO GAIN

11:55.000 --> 11:57.200
WILL MOVE THERE AS WELL.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.667
DREDGING PROJECT, SIMULATED IN

12:00.667 --> 12:02.800
THIS JAXPORT VIDEO, HAS A BIG

12:02.800 --> 12:05.067
PRICE TAG: NEARLY $700 MILLION.

12:05.067 --> 12:06.333
ALL OF IT IS EXPECTED TO COME

12:06.333 --> 12:08.367
FROM THE GOVERNMENT.

12:08.367 --> 12:09.733
LAST YEAR, CONGRESS PASSED A $12

12:09.733 --> 12:10.867
BILLION BILL TO IMPROVE THE

12:10.867 --> 12:13.033
NATION'S PORTS.

12:13.033 --> 12:15.667
BUT SO FAR, JAXPORT HASN'T SEEN

12:15.667 --> 12:17.133
ANY FEDERAL FUNDING.

12:17.133 --> 12:19.067
SAVANNAH AND CHARLESTON HAVE;

12:19.067 --> 12:20.500
THEY MOVE MORE CARGO AND GOT AN

12:20.500 --> 12:21.700
EARLIER START ON THEIR EXPANSION

12:21.700 --> 12:24.133
PROJECTS.

12:24.133 --> 12:25.333
THE STATE OF FLORIDA HAS GIVEN

12:25.333 --> 12:26.533
SOME MONEY, BUT NOWHERE NEAR THE

12:26.533 --> 12:28.133
AMOUNT NEEDED.

12:28.133 --> 12:29.500
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT HASN'T COME

12:29.500 --> 12:31.467
UP WITH THE FUNDING, EITHER.

12:31.467 --> 12:33.033
OPPONENTS OF THE JAXPORT

12:33.033 --> 12:34.667
DREDGING PROJECT SAY IT JUST

12:34.667 --> 12:36.433
ISN'T WORTH THE ENVIRONMENTAL

12:36.433 --> 12:38.233
RISKS, OR THE HIGH COST.

12:38.233 --> 12:39.233
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S DO OR DIE

12:39.233 --> 12:41.267

12:47.667 --> 12:49.600

12:49.600 --> 12:51.133
HE SAYS THERE ARE MANY OTHER

12:51.133 --> 12:52.500
COSTS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN INCLUDED

12:52.500 --> 12:54.033
IN THE PRICE TAG, LIKE FURTHER

12:54.033 --> 12:54.633
TERMINAL UPGRADES AND

12:54.633 --> 12:56.467
MAINTENANCE.

12:56.467 --> 12:57.967
>> I DON'T THINK IT WILL YIELD

12:57.967 --> 13:00.167
THE BENEFITS THAT THEY'VE

13:00.167 --> 13:01.733
CLAIMED, AND I THINK THE COSTS

13:01.733 --> 13:03.233
THAT THEY HAVE ESTIMATED ARE

13:03.233 --> 13:04.767
GROSSLY UNDERESTIMATED.

13:04.767 --> 13:06.133
SO WHEN YOU PUT ALL THAT

13:06.133 --> 13:07.567
TOGETHER, THAT DOESN'T EVEN

13:07.567 --> 13:08.833
INCLUDE THE INCALCULABLE COST TO

THE RIVER ITSELF.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.633
IT'S A PROJECT THAT IT

13:11.633 --> 13:12.433
UNNECESSARY AND, IN MY VIEW,

13:12.433 --> 13:13.333
WOULD BE A MONUMENTAL WASTE OF

13:13.333 --> 13:14.933
TAXPAYER DOLLARS.

13:14.933 --> 13:17.167
>> Reporter: JAFFEE POINTS OUT

13:17.167 --> 13:19.433
THAT JACKSONVILLE IS ALREADY

13:19.433 --> 13:21.033
BEHIND SAVANNAH AND CHARLESTON,

13:21.033 --> 13:22.500
AND HE THINKS THE PROJECTED

13:22.500 --> 13:24.033
TRAFFIC THROUGH THE PANAMA CANAL

13:24.033 --> 13:25.300
WON'T BE SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY

13:25.300 --> 13:26.367

13:37.067 --> 13:38.333

13:44.367 --> 13:47.000
DESTRUCTIVE FORM OF COMPETITION,

13:47.000 --> 13:51.767
MY PROPOSAL WOULD BE THAT

13:51.767 --> 13:53.267
JAXPORT AND JACKSONVILLE FOCUS

13:53.267 --> 13:54.967
ON THEIR STRENGTHS.

13:54.967 --> 13:57.033

16:29.533 --> 16:31.933
BUT BEFORE WE CAN SAVE THE

16:31.933 --> 16:33.033

16:33.033 --> 16:34.700
LOOK AT THE PEOPLE.

OTHER WORLD POWERS TO ROLLBACK

17:49.333 --> 17:50.967

BEGIN DISMANTLING URANIUM-

17:56.733 --> 17:59.100
ENRICHMENT CENTRIFUGES.

17:59.100 --> 18:00.867
BUT IRAN SAID THAT STEP IS

18:00.867 --> 18:02.633
CONTINGENT ON RECEIVING FORMAL

18:02.633 --> 18:04.600
NOTIFICATION FROM THE U.S. THAT

18:04.600 --> 18:05.867
LONG-STANDING ECONOMIC SANCTIONS

18:05.867 --> 18:07.067
ARE BEING LIFTED.

18:07.067 --> 18:08.333

18:17.033 --> 18:20.300
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF ALL THE

18:20.300 --> 18:21.733
LOGISTICS NECESSARY TO DO THIS.

18:21.733 --> 18:23.167
>> IRAN HAS CREATED A VERY LARGE

18:23.167 --> 18:25.700
NEW CLEAR PROGRAM AND HAS

18:25.700 --> 18:27.667
PARTICULARLY A LARGE URANIUM

18:27.667 --> 18:29.767
ENRICHMENT PROGRAM THAT HAS 18,

18:29.767 --> 18:32.033
1-9D,000 CENTRIFUGES AND IT HAS

18:32.033 --> 18:34.200
TO DISMANTLE AROUND 10,000 OF

18:34.200 --> 18:36.167
THOSE CENTRIFUGES AND PUT THEM

18:36.167 --> 18:37.600
IN MONITORED STORAGE.

18:37.600 --> 18:40.567
AND THOSE CENTRIFUGES THAT ARE

18:40.567 --> 18:41.800
DISMANTLED WOULD BE INSPECTED BY

18:41.800 --> 18:44.300
THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY

18:44.300 --> 18:45.400
AGENCY T SAY LARGE JOB.

18:45.400 --> 18:47.767
HOW QUICKLY COULD IRAN DO IT, NO

18:47.767 --> 18:50.300
ONE KNOWS, THEY COULD BRING IN A

18:50.300 --> 18:51.100
BULL

18:51.100 --> 18:52.500
BULLDOZER INTOED HALLS THAT HOLD

18:52.500 --> 18:53.767
THE CENTRIFUGES AND BULLDOZE

18:53.767 --> 18:54.567
THEM INTO SCRAP.

18:54.567 --> 18:55.667
BUT IF THEY WANT TO TAKE THEM

18:55.667 --> 18:57.333
OUT CAREFULLY ONE BY ONE AND

18:57.333 --> 19:00.233
STORE THEM SO THEY COULD

19:00.233 --> 19:01.233
REFUSE-- REUSE THEM AT A LATER

19:01.233 --> 19:03.600
DADE IF THEY RENEGED ON THE

19:03.600 --> 19:05.200
DEAL, FOR EXAMPLE, THEN IT COULD

19:05.200 --> 19:06.500
TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS.

19:06.500 --> 19:07.733
>> Sreenivasan: THERE SEEMS TO

19:07.733 --> 19:09.400
BE DIFFERENT INCENTIVES FOR HOW

19:09.400 --> 19:11.767
FAST THIS ALL COULD HAPPEN.

19:11.767 --> 19:13.633
>> WELL, I THINK THE U.S. HAS AN

19:13.633 --> 19:15.033
INCENTIVE TO HAVE IT GO ON AS

19:15.033 --> 19:16.567
LONG AS POSSIBLE THEY WANT

19:16.567 --> 19:18.167
THE JOB DONE THOROUGHLY.

19:18.167 --> 19:20.133
THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE IRAN

19:20.133 --> 19:22.000
HASN'T SORT OF DONE ANY

19:22.000 --> 19:23.533
SUBTERFUGE THERE ARE A LOT OF

19:23.533 --> 19:24.633
THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE DONE.

19:24.633 --> 19:26.500
AND SO I THINK FROM THE U.S.

19:26.500 --> 19:28.200
POINT OF VIEW SLOWNESS IS GOOD.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.633
FROM THE IRAN POINT OF VIEW THEY

19:29.633 --> 19:31.833
WANT TO GO AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.

19:31.833 --> 19:33.433
THEY WANT TO GET THIS DONE THIS

19:33.433 --> 19:33.900
FALL.

19:33.900 --> 19:36.100
THEY WANT TO GET THE SANCTIONS,

19:36.100 --> 19:37.533
THE MAJOR PART OF THE SANCTIONS

19:37.533 --> 19:39.833
OFF ON IMPLEMENTATION DAY.

19:39.833 --> 19:41.367
AND HOPEFULLY HAVE THAT DONE

19:41.367 --> 19:42.833
BEFORE THEY HAVE THEIR NEXT

19:42.833 --> 19:43.700
ELECTION.

19:43.700 --> 19:45.900
WHICH COULD BE AS EARLY AS

19:45.900 --> 19:47.600
FEBRUARY FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.633
>> AND THERE'S ALSO BEEN

19:49.633 --> 19:52.200
TENSIONS AT LEAST ON THE LEFT ON

19:52.200 --> 19:54.067
WHO INSPECTS WHAT, QUESTION.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.567
IRAN HAS SAID CERTAIN SITES WILL

19:55.567 --> 19:57.433
BE INSPECTED BY THEIR OWN PEOPLE

19:57.433 --> 19:58.867
WHICH HAS CAUSED A LOT OF ALARM

19:58.867 --> 20:01.033
BELLS TO GO OFF ELSEWHERE IN THE

20:01.033 --> 20:03.033
WORLD.

20:03.033 --> 20:06.333
>> ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES IN THIS

20:06.333 --> 20:08.033
WHOLE PROCESS IS HOW GOOD ARE

20:08.033 --> 20:10.500
THE INSPECTIONS GOING TO BE.

20:10.500 --> 20:14.167
IRAN HAS REFUSED TO ALLOW THE IA

20:14.167 --> 20:16.300
ACCESS TO MILITARY SITES EXCEPT

20:16.300 --> 20:17.200
UNDER EXTRAORDINARY

20:17.200 --> 20:18.467
CIRCUMSTANCES.

20:18.467 --> 20:21.167
ONE OF WHICH HAPPENED RECENTLY

20:21.167 --> 20:23.900
BUT THE IAEA WAS NOT ALLOWED TO

20:23.900 --> 20:28.167
DO ITS NORMAL PRACTICE OF TAKING

20:28.167 --> 20:29.667
ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLES.

20:29.667 --> 20:32.400
THE IRANIAN DID IT UNDER

20:32.400 --> 20:33.933
SUPERVISION, THERE ARE CONCERNS

20:33.933 --> 20:35.267
IT'S WEAKER THAN WHAT IS NORMAL.

20:35.267 --> 20:36.467
FOR EXAMPLE, WHAT JAPAN ACCEPTS

20:36.467 --> 20:38.933
IN TERMS OF ACCESS,

20:38.933 --> 20:40.267
INTRUSIVENESS OF INSPECTIONS,

20:40.267 --> 20:41.800
IRAN IS RESISTING.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.167
AND IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THAT IS

20:43.167 --> 20:44.000
GOING TO COME OUT.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.100
BUT WHERE IT REALLY DOESN'T

20:45.100 --> 20:47.967
MATTER MUCH IN JAPAN, I MEAN,

20:47.967 --> 20:49.800
WELL, WE TRUST JAPAN IT SURE

20:49.800 --> 20:50.567
MATTERS IN IRAN.

20:50.567 --> 20:52.433
AND HOW THIS PLAYS OUT OVER THE

20:52.433 --> 20:54.033
NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS WILL BE VERY

20:54.033 --> 20:54.867
IMPORTANT TO SEE WHETHER THIS

20:54.867 --> 20:56.800
DEAL IS ACTUALLY NEVER VIABLE IN

20:56.800 --> 20:57.333
THE LONG RUN.

20:57.333 --> 20:59.600
>> AN NONE OF THIS HAPPENS IN A

20:59.600 --> 20:59.967
VACUUM.

20:59.967 --> 21:01.733
THERE IS IRAN'S SUPPORT OF

21:01.733 --> 21:02.767
HEZBOLLAH, THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN

21:02.767 --> 21:03.767
THE SYRIAN WAR.

21:03.767 --> 21:05.433
I MEAN ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE

21:05.433 --> 21:07.500
STILL PLAYING ON THE MINDS OF

21:07.500 --> 21:09.267
EVERYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD

21:09.267 --> 21:11.467
WATCHING WHILE THIS SPECIFIC

21:11.467 --> 21:13.500
INSPECTIONS PROCESS WORKS.

21:13.500 --> 21:14.533
>> WELL, THAT'S RIGHT.

21:14.533 --> 21:16.067
IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS A VERY

21:16.067 --> 21:17.167
TOUGH PLACE.

21:17.167 --> 21:19.300
BUT THE NEW CLEAR DEAL WAS

21:19.300 --> 21:21.433
DESIGNED TO WORK IN THAT TOUGH

21:21.433 --> 21:22.433
ENVIRONMENT.

21:22.433 --> 21:24.267
NOW WHERE ONE ISSUE THAT HAD

21:24.267 --> 21:25.667
TOUCHES UPON THE DEAL WHICH IS A

21:25.667 --> 21:26.733
LITTLE MORE PROBLEMATIC IS THE

21:26.733 --> 21:28.700
WHOLE QUESTION OF MISSILES.

21:28.700 --> 21:31.067
AND IRAN'S RECENT LAUNCH OF A

21:31.067 --> 21:32.933
MISSILE VERY CORROSIVE ON THIS

21:32.933 --> 21:35.800
DEAL BECAUSE IN THE END, IF IRAN

21:35.800 --> 21:37.867
DOES RENEGE ON THE DEAL OR JUST

21:37.867 --> 21:39.433
OUTLASTS THE DEAL, IT DOESN'T

21:39.433 --> 21:40.900
LAST THAT LONG BASED ON THE TIME

21:40.900 --> 21:42.767
LINES IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AND IT

21:42.767 --> 21:44.667
BUILDS NUCLEAR WEAPONS, THOSE

21:44.667 --> 21:46.000
WEAPONS WILL ONLY HAVE MEANING

21:46.000 --> 21:47.200
IF THEY ARE PUT ON BALANCE

21:47.200 --> 21:48.300
STATISTICS MISSILES.

21:48.300 --> 21:49.633
AND THOSE BALANCE STATISTICS

21:49.633 --> 21:50.833
MISSILES WILL HAVE TO BE

21:50.833 --> 21:51.867
ACCURATE AND FAST.

21:51.867 --> 21:52.800
AND IRAN IS WORKING ON THOSE

21:52.800 --> 21:53.467
NOW.

21:53.467 --> 21:55.067
SO I THINK THE UNITED STATES HAS

21:55.067 --> 21:59.567
TO FIND A WAY TO START LIMITING

21:59.567 --> 22:01.267
IOWAN-- IRAN'S ABILITY TO

22:01.267 --> 22:05.167
CONTROL BALLISTIC MISSILES.

22:05.167 --> 22:06.200
>> DAVID ALBRIGHT, THANKS SO

22:06.200 --> 22:07.200
MUCH.

22:07.200 --> 22:12.100
>> THANK YOU.

22:15.767 --> 22:17.033
>> Sreenivasan: THE ORGANIZERS

22:17.033 --> 22:18.900
OF NEXT SUMMER'S OLYMPICS IN RIO

22:18.900 --> 22:20.733
DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL, SAY THEY DO

22:20.733 --> 22:22.033
NOT PLAN TO TEST THE WATERWAYS

22:22.033 --> 22:22.700
THAT WILL BE HOME TO AQUATIC

22:22.700 --> 22:25.500
EVENTS.

22:25.500 --> 22:26.200
FOR VIRUSES THAT ATHLETES FEAR

22:26.200 --> 22:27.333
COULD MAKE THEM SICK.

22:27.333 --> 22:28.367
THE NEWSHOUR'S MEGAN THOMPSON

22:28.367 --> 22:30.500
EXPLAINS.

22:30.500 --> 22:32.267
>> Reporter: THE CONTROVERSY

22:32.267 --> 22:33.567
COVERS RIO'S DIRTY WATERWAYS

22:33.567 --> 22:35.833
THAT WILL BE USED FOR SAILING,

22:35.833 --> 22:37.033
ROWING, CANOEING, TRIATHLON, AND

22:37.033 --> 22:38.667
OPEN DISTANCE SWIMMING.

22:38.667 --> 22:40.233
RIO'S GUANABARA BAY AND OTHER

22:40.233 --> 22:42.033
WATER VENUES ARE POLLUTED WITH

22:42.033 --> 22:43.767
TRASH AND UNTREATED HUMAN

22:43.767 --> 22:45.767
SEWAGE, AND INDEPENDENT TESTS

22:45.767 --> 22:47.633
COMMISSIONED BY THE ASSOCIATED

22:47.633 --> 22:49.333
PRESS IN JULY FOUND HIGH LEVELS

22:49.333 --> 22:51.867
OF VIRUSES IN THESE WATERS.

22:51.867 --> 22:53.167
DOCTORS FOR THE U.S. OLYMPIC

22:53.167 --> 22:55.600
TEAM BLAMED WATER CONTAMINATION

22:55.600 --> 23:00.433
FOR CAUSING 13 AMERICAN ROWERS

23:00.433 --> 23:01.800
TO GET SICK DURING AN AUGUST

23:01.800 --> 23:02.900
PRACTICE RUN ON THE LAKE WHERE

23:02.900 --> 23:04.567
THE ROWING COMPETITION WILL BE

23:04.567 --> 23:05.700
HELD.

23:05.700 --> 23:06.633
VIRUSES CAN CAUSE SEVERE STOMACH

23:06.633 --> 23:08.333
AND RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES THAT

23:08.333 --> 23:09.100
WOULD PREVENT AN ATHLETE FROM

23:09.100 --> 23:10.800
COMPETING.

23:10.800 --> 23:12.033
AND VIRUSES LIVE LONGER THAN

23:12.033 --> 23:13.267
BACTERIA IN TROPICAL CLIMATES

23:13.267 --> 23:15.367
LIKE RIO'S.

23:15.367 --> 23:16.400
BUT AT A PRESS CONFERENCE

23:16.400 --> 23:17.667
FRIDAY, BRAZIL'S OLYMPIC

23:17.667 --> 23:19.100
ORGANIZERS SAID THE WORLD HEALTH

23:19.100 --> 23:20.200
ORGANIZATION'S LATEST GUIDELINES

23:20.200 --> 23:22.067
BACK THEM UP.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.933
THAT TESTS FOR VIRUSES ARE NOT

23:23.933 --> 23:25.767
NEEDED "BECAUSE OF A LACK OF

23:25.767 --> 23:27.033
STANDARDIZED METHODS AND

23:27.033 --> 23:27.667
DIFFICULTY INTERPRETING

23:27.667 --> 23:30.033
RESULTS."

23:30.033 --> 23:31.400
>> SO WE FULLY RESPECTED THEIR

23:31.400 --> 23:33.333
INSTRUCTIONS.

23:33.333 --> 23:35.133
AS FAR AS WE UNDERSTAND, IT IS

23:35.133 --> 23:37.400
THE FINAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR RIO

23:37.400 --> 23:39.700
2016, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP

23:39.700 --> 23:40.867
MONITORING BUT WE ARE GOING TO

23:40.867 --> 23:41.900
IMPLEMENT IMMEDIATELY THEIR

23:41.900 --> 23:43.600
SUGGESTIONS.

23:43.600 --> 23:45.133
>> Reporter: RIO 2016 WILL ALSO

23:45.133 --> 23:46.500
SAVE MONEY BECAUSE VIRAL TESTING

23:46.500 --> 23:47.600
IS MORE EXPENSIVE AND DIFFICULT

23:47.600 --> 23:51.667
THAN BACTERIAL TESTING.

23:51.667 --> 23:53.300
AS FOR THE TRASH PILING UP ON

23:53.300 --> 23:54.633
THE SHORES OF GUANABARA BAY, RIO

23:54.633 --> 23:56.400
IS RECRUITING VOLUNTEERS TO HELP

23:56.400 --> 23:57.200
PICK IT UP IN EXCHANGE FOR A

23:57.200 --> 23:58.000
CREDIT ON THEIR ELECTRICITY

23:58.000 --> 24:00.133
BILLS.

24:00.133 --> 24:02.033
ORGANIZERS HOPE THE CLEANUP

24:02.033 --> 24:06.033
EFFORTS WILL HELP ACHIEVE RIO'S

24:06.033 --> 24:10.200
GOAL OF REDUCING WATER POLLUTION

24:10.200 --> 24:10.900
BEFORE THE GAMES BEGIN NEXT

24:10.900 --> 24:12.200
SUMMER.

24:15.733 --> 24:16.900
>> Sreenivasan: AND FINALLY,

24:16.900 --> 24:18.033
SOME FIVE STAR CUSTOMER REVIEWS

24:18.033 --> 24:19.600
YOU'VE SEEN FOR PRODUCTS SOLD

24:19.600 --> 24:22.933
FOR AMAZON.COM ARE FAKE AND THE

24:22.933 --> 24:24.767
COMPANY IS TRYING TO STOP THAT.

24:24.767 --> 24:25.900
AMAZON IS SUING MORE THAN A

24:25.900 --> 24:27.400
THOUSAND WRITERS PAID TO POST

24:27.400 --> 24:28.933
GLOWING REVIEWS TO BOOST PRODUCT

24:28.933 --> 24:30.000
PURCHASES.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.367
AMAZON ALLEGES SOME PRODUCT

24:31.367 --> 24:34.067
MAKERS PAY AS LITTLE AS $5 FOR

24:34.067 --> 24:35.967
REVIEWS THAT ARE "FALSE,

24:35.967 --> 24:38.267
MISLEADING AND INAUTHENTIC."

24:38.267 --> 24:39.467
AMAZON PROHIBITS REVIEWS PAID

24:39.467 --> 24:40.933
REVIEWS OF ANY KIND.

24:40.933 --> 24:42.867
AND ON TOMORROW’S NEWSHOUR,

24:42.867 --> 24:44.733
CELLIST YO-YO MA REFLECTS ON A

24:44.733 --> 24:46.267
LIFE OF MAKING MUSIC.

24:46.267 --> 24:47.433
THAT'S ALL FOR THIS EDITION OF

24:47.433 --> 24:48.833
PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

24:48.833 --> 24:50.033
I'M HARI SREENIVASAN, THANKS

24:50.033 --> 24:52.133
FOR WATCHING.
