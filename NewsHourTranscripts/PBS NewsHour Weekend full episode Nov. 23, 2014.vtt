00:27.594 --> 00:28.629
CAN IT WORK HERE?

THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:47.247 --> 00:48.081
AFTER MONTHS AND MONTHS OF

00:48.081 --> 00:48.982
NEGOTIATIONS, THE DEADLINE FOR

00:48.982 --> 00:49.983
THE WORLD'S MAJOR POWERS TO

00:49.983 --> 00:51.018
STRIKE A PERMANENT DEAL WITH

00:51.018 --> 00:52.052
IRAN TO CURB ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM

00:52.052 --> 00:53.253
IS TOMORROW.

00:53.253 --> 00:55.255
AND THE TWO SIDES ARE STILL SAID

00:55.255 --> 00:57.124
TO BE SOME DISTANCE APART.

00:57.124 --> 00:58.191
IN AN INTERVIEW BROADCAST THIS

00:59.459 --> 01:00.894

01:00.894 --> 01:02.496
SAID THE INTERIM DEAL REACHED

01:02.496 --> 01:04.364
LAST NOVEMBER HAD SLOWED IRAN'S

01:04.364 --> 01:06.700
NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.035
>> THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE

01:08.035 --> 01:09.569
INTERIM DEAL THAT WE ENTERED

01:09.569 --> 01:13.206
INTO HAS DEFINITELY STOPPED

01:13.206 --> 01:14.141
IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM FROM

01:14.141 --> 01:16.276
ADVANCING.

01:16.276 --> 01:19.513
SO IT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL.

01:19.513 --> 01:21.281
>> BUT A DEAL WOULD BE A

01:21.281 --> 01:23.050
ROLLBACK, WOULDN'T IT?

01:23.050 --> 01:24.718
>> WELL NOW, SO THE QUESTION IS,

01:24.718 --> 01:25.719
CAN WE GET TO A MORE PERMANENT

01:25.719 --> 01:26.987
DEAL?

01:26.987 --> 01:28.522
AND THE GAPS ARE STILL

01:28.522 --> 01:30.290
SIGNIFICANT.

01:30.290 --> 01:31.558
>> Sreenivasan: THE PRESIDENT

01:31.558 --> 01:32.326
ALSO COMMENTED ON HOW A NUCLEAR

01:32.326 --> 01:33.226
DEAL MIGHT CHANGE OVERALL

01:33.226 --> 01:35.562
RELATIONS WITH IRAN.

01:35.562 --> 01:37.698
>> WHAT A DEAL WOULD DO IS TAKE

01:37.698 --> 01:39.866
A BIG PIECE OF BUSINESS OFF THE

01:39.866 --> 01:41.601
TABLE.

01:41.601 --> 01:44.538
AND PERHAPS BEGIN A LONG

01:44.538 --> 01:47.808
PROCESS, NOT JUST BETWEEN IRAN

01:47.808 --> 01:49.810
AND US, BUT THE RELATIONSHIP

01:49.810 --> 01:51.278
BETWEEN IRAN AND THE WORLD, AND

01:51.278 --> 01:53.714
THE REGION BEGINS TO CHANGE.

03:38.351 --> 03:39.219
>> Sreenivasan: MARION BARRY WAS

03:39.219 --> 03:40.520

04:35.942 --> 04:37.811
RESEARCHERS OFF MONTEREY HAVE

04:37.811 --> 04:39.212
CAPTURED PICTURES OF THE

04:39.212 --> 04:40.413
ANGLERFISH; A CREATURE YOU OR

04:40.413 --> 04:41.948
YOUR CHILDREN HAVE PROBABLY ONLY

04:41.948 --> 04:43.550
SEEN IN THE MOVIE "FINDING

04:43.550 --> 04:45.185
NEMO."

04:45.185 --> 04:47.053
THIS IS THE REAL DEAL, CALLED A

04:47.053 --> 04:48.989
"BLACK SEA-DEVIL."

04:48.989 --> 04:50.524
IT WAS CAPTURED ON VIDEO IN IT'S

04:50.524 --> 04:51.625
NATURAL HABITAT APPARENTLY FOR

04:51.625 --> 04:56.429
THE FIRST TIME EVER LAST WEEK,

04:56.429 --> 04:57.998
ALMOST 2,000 FEET BELOW THE

04:57.998 --> 04:59.699
OCEAN SURFACE.

04:59.699 --> 05:01.067
DESPITE ITS SCARY APPEARANCE

05:01.067 --> 05:01.968
IT'S ACTUALLY THREE-AND-A-HALF

05:01.968 --> 05:02.903
INCHES LONG.

05:02.903 --> 05:03.837
JUST LIKE IN THE MOVIES, THE

05:03.837 --> 05:04.604
ANGLERFISH USES A FLASHLIGHT-

05:04.604 --> 05:05.505
LIKE APPENDAGE TO LURE SMALLER

05:05.505 --> 05:09.876
FISH INTO ITS MOUTH.

05:09.876 --> 05:11.378
>> Sreenivasan: AS WE SAID

05:11.378 --> 05:12.512
EARLIER, THAT DEADLINE FOR A

05:12.512 --> 05:13.513
NUCLEAR DEAL WITH IRAN IS

05:13.513 --> 05:14.381
TOMORROW.

05:14.381 --> 05:15.515
FOR MORE ABOUT THE STATE OF THE

05:15.515 --> 05:16.816
NEGOTIATIONS, WE ARE JOINED NOW

05:16.816 --> 05:18.018
BY MY COLLEAGUE, WILLIAM

05:18.018 --> 05:19.052
BRANGHAM, WHO REPORTED EARLIER

05:19.052 --> 05:20.120
THIS YEAR FROM IRAN, AND BY

05:20.120 --> 05:21.154
DAVID SANGER OF THE NEW YORK

05:21.154 --> 05:22.322
TIMES.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.089
HE'S IN VIENNA COVERING THE

05:23.089 --> 05:23.857
TALKS AND JOINS US NOW VIA

05:23.857 --> 05:27.994
SKYPE.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.462
>> THANKS HARI.

05:29.462 --> 05:30.597
DAVID THANKS FOR JOINING US.

05:30.597 --> 05:31.765
THE PRESIDENT THIS MORNING SAID

05:31.765 --> 05:33.066
THERE ARE STILL SOME SIGNIFICANT

05:33.066 --> 05:34.134
GAPS IN THE NEGOTIATIONS.

05:34.134 --> 05:37.204
WHAT CAN WE LIKELY EXPECT IN THE

05:37.204 --> 05:38.605
NEXT DAY AS THE NEGOTIATIONS

05:38.605 --> 05:39.472
WRAP UP?

05:39.472 --> 05:41.107
>> WELL I THINK YOU CAN EXPECT

05:41.107 --> 05:42.275
THAT THESE NEGOTIATIONS ARE NOT

05:42.275 --> 05:43.476
GOING TO WRAP UP.

05:43.476 --> 05:44.678
THAT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HERE

05:44.678 --> 05:46.279
IS THAT YOU'LL GET AN EXTENSION

05:46.279 --> 05:49.683
THAT MAY WELL BE WRAPPED IN SOME

05:49.683 --> 05:51.384
KIND OF DESCRIPTION OF THE

05:51.384 --> 05:52.819
PROGRESS THEY'VE MADE SO FAR.

05:52.819 --> 05:56.223
YOU KNOW WILLIAM, THEY HAVE VERY

05:56.223 --> 05:58.024
EXTENSIVE DRAFTS AND ANNEXES OF

05:58.024 --> 05:59.492
AN AGREEMENT BUT THEY DON'T HAVE

05:59.492 --> 06:01.962
POLITICAL DECISIONS FROM THE

06:01.962 --> 06:05.098
SUPREME LEADER IN IRAN OR FROM

06:05.098 --> 06:07.334
PRESIDENT OBAMA ON SOME MAJORS

06:07.334 --> 06:09.869
ISSUES OF DISPUTE INCLUDING HOW

06:09.869 --> 06:12.572
MANY CENTRIFUGES IRAN COULD BE

06:12.572 --> 06:15.375
LEFT WITH, THE FUEL STOCK PILES,

06:15.375 --> 06:16.910
WHICH ONE WOULD BE SENT TO

06:16.910 --> 06:18.144
RUSSIA AND THE QUESTIONS OF

06:18.144 --> 06:18.878
SANCTIONS.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.213
AND ALL OF THESE REQUIRE

06:20.213 --> 06:21.815
DECISIONS THAT NOBODY'S BEEN

06:21.815 --> 06:23.950
WILLING TO MAKE EVEN THOUGH THIS

06:23.950 --> 06:24.751
NEGOTIATION HAS BEEN GOING ON

06:24.751 --> 06:25.418
FOR A YEAR.

06:25.418 --> 06:27.787
>> HOW DO YOU FORESEE US EVER

06:27.787 --> 06:28.755
GETTING TO AN AGREEMENT?

06:28.755 --> 06:30.757
>> WELL I'M NOT SURE THAT WE

06:30.757 --> 06:32.792
EVER WILL GET TO AN ENTIRE

06:32.792 --> 06:33.960
AGREEMENT.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.196
I KNOW THAT PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES

06:36.196 --> 06:37.664
HOPE THEY WILL BUT IT'S ALSO

06:37.664 --> 06:38.398
POSSIBLE THAT TO THE UNITED

06:38.398 --> 06:40.033
STATES THIS COULD BE A

06:40.033 --> 06:41.301
MANAGEABLE ISSUE IF YOU KEEP

06:41.301 --> 06:43.336
ROLLING IT FORWARD, TO SOME

06:43.336 --> 06:44.337
DEGREE.

06:44.337 --> 06:46.306
AS THE IRANIANS THAT'S NOT

06:46.306 --> 06:47.741
COMPLETELY THE CASE BECAUSE IT'S

06:47.741 --> 06:49.175
THEIR OIL THAT IS BEING KEPT OFF

06:49.175 --> 06:51.077
THE MARKET AND THEY WANT TO HAVE

06:51.077 --> 06:52.545
THE NORMAL BANKING RELATIONSHIPS

06:52.545 --> 06:54.014
AND THE NORMAL RELATIONSHIP WITH

06:54.014 --> 06:54.881
THE WEST.

06:54.881 --> 06:57.550
I THINK THAT'S THE REASON THAT

06:57.550 --> 06:59.019
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TEAM IS

06:59.019 --> 07:00.854
CALCULATING THE TIME IS PROBABLY

07:00.854 --> 07:02.055
ON THEIR SIDE.

07:02.055 --> 07:04.858
BUT THAT COULD BACK FIRE AS WELL

07:04.858 --> 07:06.893
IF PEOPLE IN IRAN BEGIN TO PICK

07:06.893 --> 07:09.696
UP A NARRATIVE THAT IN THE END

07:09.696 --> 07:11.164
THE UNITED STATES WON'T TAKE YES

07:11.164 --> 07:13.333
FOR AN ANSWER OR WON'T EVEN TAKE

07:13.333 --> 07:14.467
A PARTIAL YES FOR AN ANSWER.

07:14.467 --> 07:17.070
>> THE WEST'S CONCERN HERE

07:17.070 --> 07:18.338
OBVIOUSLY IS ABOUT IRAN'S

07:18.338 --> 07:20.307
ABILITY TO BUILD A NUCLEAR BOMB.

07:20.307 --> 07:21.174
WHAT IN THE NEGOTIATIONS RIGHT

07:21.174 --> 07:22.842
NOW ARE THE STUMBLING BLOCKS

07:22.842 --> 07:24.544
ABOUT WHAT THE IRANIANS ARE

07:24.544 --> 07:25.578
ACTUALLY DOING IN THAT REGARD?

07:25.578 --> 07:28.381
>> WELL, THE CONCERN IS THAT

07:28.381 --> 07:29.649
SINCE IRAN SAYS IT HAS NO

07:29.649 --> 07:30.717
INTENTION OF BUILDING A WEAPON,

07:30.717 --> 07:33.219
YOU HAVE TO DESIGN A SYSTEM THAT

07:33.219 --> 07:34.921
WOULD LENGTHEN WHAT'S CALLED

07:34.921 --> 07:35.588
BREAKOUT TIME.

07:35.588 --> 07:38.058
THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT WOULD TAKE

07:38.058 --> 07:40.627
TO PRODUCE ONE WEAPON'S WORTH OF

07:40.627 --> 07:41.828
FUEL.

07:41.828 --> 07:43.763
NOW RIGHT KNEW THAT'S DOWN TO A

07:43.763 --> 07:45.432
FEW MONTHS THE WAY THEY'VE

07:45.432 --> 07:47.767
CONSTRUCTED THIS AND THE WHAT

07:47.767 --> 07:49.135
THE UNITED STATES AND THE

07:49.135 --> 07:51.338
EUROPEAN ALLIES RUSSIA AND CHINA

07:51.338 --> 07:54.374
WANT TO DO IS TO EXTEND THAT SO

07:54.374 --> 07:57.944
THAT ANYBODY IN IRAN EVEN IN A

07:57.944 --> 07:59.746
DIFFERENT REGIME COULD RAISE FOR

07:59.746 --> 08:04.684
A BOMB, YOU WOULD HAVE TIME TO

08:04.684 --> 08:06.186
ACT DIPLOMATICALLY OR

08:06.186 --> 08:07.087
MILITARILY.

08:07.087 --> 08:09.189
>> KEEPING THE IRANIANS AT THE

08:09.189 --> 08:10.056
NEGOTIATING TABLE, CERTAINLY

08:10.056 --> 08:11.725
WHEN I WAS IN IRAN EARLIER THIS

08:11.725 --> 08:14.027
YEAR I SAW HOW THE SANCTION HE

08:14.027 --> 08:22.035
WERE SQUEEZING THE SANCTIONS

08:22.035 --> 08:23.737
WERE SQUEEZING THE ECONOMY.

08:23.737 --> 08:26.106
>> ACUTELY THE SANCTIONS HAVE TO

08:26.106 --> 08:27.907
COME OFF BUT IT'S THE SUPREME

08:27.907 --> 08:29.342
LEADER WHO IS MAKING THE FINAL

08:29.342 --> 08:30.543
DECISION HERE.

08:30.543 --> 08:33.480
AND HE'S GOT A DIFFERENT

08:33.480 --> 08:36.149
CONSTITUENCY, THE IRANIAN

08:36.149 --> 08:37.150
REVOLUTIONARY GUARD CORPS AND

08:37.150 --> 08:39.285
OTHERS, WHO HAVE INVESTED VERY

08:39.285 --> 08:40.720
HEAVILY IN THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.655
SO HE'S UNDER SOME VERY

08:42.655 --> 08:44.357
COMPETING INFLUENCES HERE ON THE

08:44.357 --> 08:46.059
QUESTION OF WHETHER IT'S BETTER

08:46.059 --> 08:48.194
TO LIVE WITH THE SANCTIONS AND

08:48.194 --> 08:49.896
KEEP A BIGGER PART OF THE

08:49.896 --> 08:52.165
NUCLEAR PROGRAM OR GET RID OF

08:52.165 --> 08:55.201
THE SANCTIONS, VIEW IN

08:55.201 --> 08:57.937
THE IRANIAN MILITARY VIEW IS TOO

08:57.937 --> 09:02.242
HIGH.

09:02.242 --> 09:05.812
IF THE TALKS BEAR NO

09:05.812 --> 09:07.180
FRUIT, IS SOMETHING OTHER ON THE

09:07.180 --> 09:08.348
TABLE?

09:08.348 --> 09:10.650
NO ONE HAS EVER EXPRESSED THAT

09:10.650 --> 09:12.352
THE MILITARY SOLUTION IS MORE

09:12.352 --> 09:14.120
THAN A TEMPORARY SOLUTION.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.022
YOU COULD BOMB THE FACILITIES

09:16.022 --> 09:17.123
AND CERTAINLY SET THEM BACK A

09:17.123 --> 09:20.427
YEAR OR TWO YEARS OR MAYBE EVEN

09:20.427 --> 09:20.994
THREE YEARS.

09:20.994 --> 09:23.196
BUT YOU COULD REDOUBLE IRAN'S

09:23.196 --> 09:26.132
DETERMINATION TO REBUILD THOSE

09:26.132 --> 09:27.400
FACILITIES DEEPER IN THE GROUND

09:27.400 --> 09:29.769
WHERE YOU COULD NOT GET AT THEM.

09:29.769 --> 09:32.138
>> DAVID SANGER, FROM THE NEW

09:32.138 --> 09:34.240
YORK TIMES, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

09:34.240 --> 09:43.516
>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.

09:43.516 --> 09:46.052
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW TO OUR

09:46.052 --> 09:48.621
SIGNATURE SEGMENT.

09:48.621 --> 09:49.889
TONIGHT, WE EXAMINE A NEW PLAN

09:49.889 --> 09:50.757
TO DRAMATICALLY REDUCE ONE OF

09:50.757 --> 09:51.825
THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH IN

09:51.825 --> 09:52.792
THE U.S., ESPECIALLY AMONG YOUNG

09:52.792 --> 09:54.160
PEOPLE.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.061
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT DRUGS OR

09:55.061 --> 09:56.095
SHOOTINGS, BUT ABOUT TRAFFIC

09:56.095 --> 09:56.729
COLLISIONS.

09:56.729 --> 09:57.430
THEY KILL MORE THAN 33,000

09:57.430 --> 09:58.264
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY EACH

09:58.264 --> 09:59.032
YEAR, INCLUDING MORE THAN 4,700

09:59.032 --> 09:59.833
PEDESTRIANS.

09:59.833 --> 10:00.600
NOW OFFICIALS HERE IN NEW YORK

10:00.600 --> 10:01.501
CITY AND IN SEVERAL OTHER STATES

10:01.501 --> 10:02.368
HAVE BORROWED FROM A PLAN THAT'S

10:02.368 --> 10:03.470
BEEN IN EFFECT IN PARTS OF

10:03.470 --> 10:04.904
EUROPE FOR SOME TIME.

10:04.904 --> 10:05.705
TONIGHT, WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE

10:05.705 --> 10:06.539
COSTS WHEN THE SYSTEM DOESN'T

10:06.539 --> 10:07.373
WORK, AND WHAT'S BEING DONE TO

10:07.373 --> 10:13.413
MAKE OUR STREETS SAFER.

10:13.413 --> 10:15.014
>> Reporter: A REMARKABLE AMOUNT

10:15.014 --> 10:16.182
OF THE TIME, ALL THESE BUSES AND

10:16.182 --> 10:17.784
TAXIS, CARS AND BICYCLES,

10:17.784 --> 10:20.520
JOGGERS AND WALKERS, MANAGE TO

10:20.520 --> 10:22.388
COEXIST ON THE STREETS OF NEW

10:22.388 --> 10:24.924
YORK, BUT WHEN SOMETHING GOES

10:24.924 --> 10:26.759
WRONG, IT CAN BE HORRIBLE.

10:26.759 --> 10:27.760
LEAVING FAMILIES DEVASTATED.

10:27.760 --> 10:28.495
LISTEN TO WHAT HAPPENED IN FRONT

10:28.495 --> 10:29.295
OF DANA LERNER'S HOME LAST

10:29.295 --> 10:32.165
JANUARY.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.033
>> I GOT A CALL FROM OUR

10:34.033 --> 10:35.635
DOORMAN.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.103
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL I

10:37.103 --> 10:38.438
WAS GONNA FIND.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.406
SO I RAN DOWN THERE.

10:40.406 --> 10:41.941
AND I SAW MY HUSBAND, YOU KNOW,

10:41.941 --> 10:43.776
JUST SCREAMING, LYING IN THE--

10:43.776 --> 10:46.079
LYING IN THE ROAD.

10:46.079 --> 10:49.048
BUT HE WAS-- I COULD SEE HE

10:49.048 --> 10:50.650
WASN'T HORRIBLY HURT.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.418
AND I LOOKED OVER AND MY SON

10:52.418 --> 10:53.653
WAS, YOU KNOW, LYING THERE.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.121
>> Reporter: LERNER'S NINE-YEAR-

10:55.121 --> 10:55.889
OLD SON COOPER HAD BEEN WALKING

10:55.889 --> 10:56.623
ACROSS THE STREET, HAND-IN-HAND

10:56.623 --> 10:57.323
WITH HIS FATHER.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.191
THEY WERE IN THE CROSSWALK WITH

10:58.191 --> 10:58.992
THE LIGHT ON THEIR SIDE, WHEN A

10:58.992 --> 10:59.792
CAB TURNING LEFT HIT HER HUSBAND

10:59.792 --> 11:00.527
AND THEIR SON.

11:00.527 --> 11:01.394
>> HE WAS LYING COMPLETELY

11:01.394 --> 11:02.128
STILL.

11:02.128 --> 11:02.929
THERE WAS BLOOD COMING OF HIS

11:02.929 --> 11:05.098
EARS.

11:05.098 --> 11:09.502
AND I'M A REAL OPTIMIST.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.705
AND I, KEPT SAYING... AND MY

11:12.705 --> 11:13.773
HUSBAND... KEPT SAYING, "IT'S

11:13.773 --> 11:14.507
BAD.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.174
IT'S BAD.

11:15.174 --> 11:15.942
IT'S BAD.

11:15.942 --> 11:16.776
I WAS LIKE, "NO, HE'S BE OKAY.

11:16.776 --> 11:17.477
WE'LL BE OKAY."

11:17.477 --> 11:18.745
AND, AND HE WASN'T.

11:19.946 --> 11:20.914
FOR MAYOR OF NEW YORK, BILL DE

11:20.914 --> 11:22.015
BLASIO HAD MADE TRAFFIC SAFETY A

11:22.015 --> 11:22.982
TOP PRIORITY.

11:22.982 --> 11:24.017
JUST WEEKS AFTER BEING

11:24.017 --> 11:25.218
INAUGURATED AND FOLLOWING THE

11:25.218 --> 11:26.553
DEATHS OF SEVERAL PEDESTRIANS,

11:26.553 --> 11:27.620
INCLUDING COOPER, THE MAYOR, A

11:27.620 --> 11:28.521
FATHER OF TWO HIMSELF, LAUNCHED

11:28.521 --> 11:29.556
WHAT WAS KNOWN AS VISION ZERO AT

11:29.556 --> 11:30.456
A PRESS CONFERENCE SURROUNDED BY

11:30.456 --> 11:31.824
PARENTS WHO HAD LOST LOVED ONES

11:31.824 --> 11:32.992
TO TRAFFIC COLLISIONS.

11:32.992 --> 11:35.995
>> WHEN I READ ABOUT THESE

11:35.995 --> 11:38.831
HORRIBLE MOMENTS, WHEN I READ

11:38.831 --> 11:41.568
ABOUT THESE TRAGEDIES, AND THIS

11:41.568 --> 11:46.339
LOSS OF LIFE IT'S VERY PERSONAL

11:46.339 --> 11:47.941
FOR ME, BECAUSE I CAN SEE IT

11:47.941 --> 11:48.975
THROUGH THE EYES THROUGH MY

11:48.975 --> 11:51.077
FELLOW PARENTS.

11:51.077 --> 11:52.345
AND OF COURSE EVERY ONE OF US

11:52.345 --> 11:53.713
THINKS WHAT IF THAT WAS MY

11:53.713 --> 11:55.181
CHILD.

11:55.181 --> 11:56.716
AND THE GOAL IS LITERALLY TO

11:56.716 --> 11:57.951
REDUCE FATALITIES ON OUR

11:57.951 --> 11:59.185
ROADWAYS TO ZERO.

11:59.185 --> 12:00.420
>> Reporter: THE MAYOR SAID

12:00.420 --> 12:01.788
ZERO, THAT INCLUDES ALL TRAFFIC

12:01.788 --> 12:03.156
DEATHS.

12:03.156 --> 12:04.223
178 PEDESTRIANS DIED IN THE CITY

12:04.223 --> 12:05.925
LAST YEAR.

12:05.925 --> 12:07.360
NOW GIVEN, NEW YORK CITY STREETS

12:07.360 --> 12:08.561
ARE DRAMATICALLY SAFER THAN THEY

12:08.561 --> 12:09.929
WERE 25-YEARS-AGO, BUT TRAFFIC

12:09.929 --> 12:11.965
FATALITIES, INCLUDING MOTORISTS

12:11.965 --> 12:12.966
AND PEDESTRIANS, HAVE STARTED TO

12:12.966 --> 12:13.800
TICK BACK UP SINCE A LOW IN

12:13.800 --> 12:15.268
2011.

12:15.268 --> 12:16.970
>> SOME PEOPLE HERE THE PHRASE

12:16.970 --> 12:18.404
VISION ZERO AND THEY ASK WHAT'S

12:18.404 --> 12:23.843
REALLY POSSIBLE.

12:23.843 --> 12:25.712
THEY ASK WHETHER THESE ARE NEW

12:25.712 --> 12:27.614
IDEAS, SPECULATIVE IDEAS.

12:27.614 --> 12:28.581
BUT WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE TODAY

12:28.581 --> 12:29.549
IS THAT THESE ARE TRIED AND

12:29.549 --> 12:30.316
TESTED IDEAS.

12:30.316 --> 12:33.019
IDEAS THAT WORK.

12:33.019 --> 12:34.954
THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING IN OTHER

12:34.954 --> 12:37.323
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, THEY HAVE

12:37.323 --> 12:38.958
BEEN WORKING AROUND THE WORLD.

12:38.958 --> 12:41.995
MOST NOTABLY IN SWEDEN.

12:41.995 --> 12:44.397
>> SO IT'S GOING FROM VERY SAFE

12:44.397 --> 12:46.232
TO SOMETHING MUCH, MUCH SAFER.

12:46.232 --> 12:48.635
>> Reporter: MATS BELIN HELPED

12:48.635 --> 12:50.670
DESIGN THE VISION ZERO APPROACH

12:50.670 --> 12:52.905
IN SWEDEN.

12:52.905 --> 12:54.440
WE CAUGHT UP WITH HIM WHEN HE

12:54.440 --> 12:56.342
WAS IN NEW YORK FOR A SYMPOSIUM

12:56.342 --> 12:58.211
ON THE SWEDISH INNOVATION.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.079
BELIN SAYS THE INITIATIVE STARTS

13:00.079 --> 13:01.981
WITH THE IDEA THAT IT'S NOT

13:01.981 --> 13:04.417
ACCEPTABLE FOR A SINGLE PERSON

13:04.417 --> 13:07.020
TO DIE ON THE ROADS AND THAT

13:07.020 --> 13:10.423
ENGINEERING, NOT ENFORCEMENT, IS

13:10.423 --> 13:13.226
WHERE THE EMPHASIS SHOULD BE.

13:13.226 --> 13:16.796
>> IN VISION ZERO, WE PUT THE

13:16.796 --> 13:19.432
MAJOR... THE... THE FIRST

13:19.432 --> 13:21.401
RESPONSIBILITY ON THE SYSTEM

13:21.401 --> 13:24.937
DESIGNER. AND, OF COURSE... THE

13:24.937 --> 13:26.839
ROAD USERS... STILL HAVE A

13:26.839 --> 13:28.941
RESPONSIBILITY.

13:28.941 --> 13:32.011
BUT IT COME.. GOES BACK TO...

13:32.011 --> 13:40.486
THE SYSTEM DESIGNER.

13:40.486 --> 13:43.122
BELIN POINTS TO THE EXAMPLE OF A

13:43.122 --> 13:44.424
BUSY INTERSECTION WITHOUT A

13:44.424 --> 13:45.758
TRAFFIC LIGHT.

13:45.758 --> 13:46.959
THE TRADITIONAL APPROACH IS TO

13:46.959 --> 13:48.127
PUT ONE UP. BUT BELIN SAYS

13:48.127 --> 13:49.495
THAT'S FLAWED.

13:49.495 --> 13:50.797
COLLISIONS WOULD GO DOWN

13:50.797 --> 13:51.964
DRAMATICALLY, BUT THOSE THAT

13:51.964 --> 13:53.199
STILL OCCUR WOULD LIKELY BE AT

13:53.199 --> 13:54.667
HIGH SPEEDS AND SEVERE.

13:54.667 --> 13:55.802
BELIN SAYS THE BETTER APPROACH

13:55.802 --> 13:56.736
WOULD BE TO CREATE A ROTARY OR

13:56.736 --> 13:57.603
ROUNDABOUT, FORCING DRIVERS TO

13:57.603 --> 13:58.271
SLOW DOWN.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.072
>> THE CRASHES WILL PROBABLY

13:59.072 --> 13:59.706
INCREASE.

13:59.706 --> 14:00.673
BECAUSE IT BE-- BECOME A LITTLE

14:00.673 --> 14:01.774
BIT MORE COMPLICATED FOR-- FOR--

14:01.774 --> 14:02.575
FOR THE TRAFFIC.

14:02.575 --> 14:03.643
BUT THOSE THAT WILL HAPPEN WILL

14:03.643 --> 14:04.343
BE LESS SEVERE.

14:04.343 --> 14:05.178
AND ACTUALLY THE-- THE

14:05.178 --> 14:06.112
ROUNDABOUT MIGHT BE THE

14:06.112 --> 14:07.013
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND

14:07.013 --> 14:07.914
DEATH.

14:07.914 --> 14:09.048
>> Reporter: AS PART OF VISION

14:09.048 --> 14:10.249
ZERO IN SWEDEN, THE COUNTRY

14:10.249 --> 14:11.050
ADDED THOUSANDS OF MILES OF

14:11.050 --> 14:12.218
DIVIDERS, ADDED BREATHALYZERS IN

MANY CARS, AND RUNS ONE OF THE

14:13.586 --> 14:14.687
LARGEST SPEED CAMERA SYSTEMS IN

14:14.687 --> 14:15.855
THE WORLD, NOT TO MAKE MONEY,

14:15.855 --> 14:17.056
BELIN SAYS, BUT TO SLOW DRIVERS

14:17.056 --> 14:18.491
DOWN.

14:18.491 --> 14:19.592
SWEDEN ROLLED OUT ITS VISION IN

14:19.592 --> 14:20.693
1,997 WHEN SEVEN PEOPLE PER

14:20.693 --> 14:21.728
100,000 DIED IN TRAFFIC,

14:21.728 --> 14:23.062
IN TEN YEARS, SWEDEN CUT ITS

14:23.062 --> 14:24.297
RATE IN HALF, AND TODAY THE

14:24.297 --> 14:25.131
UNITED STATE'S RATE IS MORE THAN

14:25.131 --> 14:27.633
THREE TIMES AS HIGH

14:27.633 --> 14:29.135
AND OTHER PEOPLE OUTSIDE NEW

14:29.135 --> 14:32.004
YORK HAVE NOTICED SWEDEN'S

14:32.004 --> 14:33.473
SUCCESS, MINNESOTA, UTAH, AND

14:33.473 --> 14:34.640
WASHINGTON STATE HAVE ALL

14:34.640 --> 14:36.342
IMPLEMENTED VISION ZERO-STYLE

14:36.342 --> 14:38.578
PROGRAMS AND SEEN REDUCTIONS IN

14:38.578 --> 14:41.547
FATALITIES FALL FASTER THAN IN

14:41.547 --> 14:42.715
STATES WITHOUT THEM.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.016
AND MANY OTHER CITIES, INCLUDING

14:44.016 --> 14:45.585
LOS ANGELES, SAN FRANCISCO, AND

14:45.585 --> 14:47.120
CHICAGO, HAVE JOINED NEW YORK IN

14:47.120 --> 14:47.820
RECENTLY IMPLEMENTING VISION

14:47.820 --> 14:52.058
ZERO-STYLE INITIATIVES.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.726
HERE IN NEW YORK, THE PLAN CALLS

14:53.726 --> 14:56.195
FOR INCREASED PUBLIC EDUCATION,

14:56.195 --> 14:57.463
VISION ZERO STREET TEAMS MADE UP

14:57.463 --> 14:58.931
OF POLICE AND TRANSPORTATION

14:58.931 --> 15:07.106
WORKERS HAVE RAISED AWARENESS

15:07.106 --> 15:08.341
HANDING OUT PAMPHLETS AND PSAs

15:08.341 --> 15:09.842
HAVE BEEN PRODUCED ABOUT THE

15:09.842 --> 15:11.577
IMPACT OF RECKLESS DRIVING:

15:11.577 --> 15:13.112
AND LIKE SWEDEN, NEW YORK'S

15:13.112 --> 15:14.113
VISION ZERO CALLED FOR MORE

15:14.113 --> 15:15.281
CHANGES IN INFRASTRUCTURE,

15:15.281 --> 15:16.549
BEYOND THOSE MADE IN THE

15:16.549 --> 15:17.817
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION WHICH

15:17.817 --> 15:19.185
HAD ALREADY SEEN DECREASES IN

15:19.185 --> 15:20.620
FATALITIES.

15:20.620 --> 15:21.888
THE CITY HAS PUT ASIDE MORE THAT

15:21.888 --> 15:22.922
$40 MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE PLAN

15:22.922 --> 15:24.457
THIS FISCAL YEAR.

15:24.457 --> 15:25.558
AS PART OF VISION ZERO, THE

15:25.558 --> 15:26.793
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

15:26.793 --> 15:27.760
PLEDGED TO MAKE SAFETY

15:27.760 --> 15:28.895
IMPROVEMENTS AT 50 LOCATIONS

15:28.895 --> 15:30.563
EACH YEAR, SOME OF THOSE CHANGES

15:30.563 --> 15:32.098
ARE ALREADY HERE, THE

15:32.098 --> 15:35.067
INTERSECTION WHERE COOPER WAS

15:35.067 --> 15:36.369
STRUCK AND KILLED.

15:36.369 --> 15:37.970
THE DOT INSTALLED PEDESTRIAN

15:37.970 --> 15:39.939
ISLANDS, ADDED TIME TO THE WALK

15:39.939 --> 15:41.174
SIGNALS, AND TOOK OUT THE

15:41.174 --> 15:42.208
PARKING SPACES ON THE CORNER TO

15:42.208 --> 15:44.076
INCREASE VISIBILITY.

15:44.076 --> 15:45.411
THE PLAN ALSO CALLED FOR CHANGES

15:45.411 --> 15:47.113
IN LAWS, INCLUDING ONE THAT

15:47.113 --> 15:48.848
WOULD CHANGE HOW TAXI DRIVERS

15:48.848 --> 15:51.617
WHO KILL OR SERIOUSLY INJURE

15:51.617 --> 15:53.820
SOMEONE ARE TREATED.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.621
LIKE THE ONE THAT STRUCK COOPER.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.557
>> AFTER A FEW DAYS, WHEN I WAS

15:57.557 --> 15:59.625
SORT OF GETTING A LITTLE BIT

15:59.625 --> 16:01.460
MORE, YOU KNOW, SORT OF WITS

16:01.460 --> 16:05.164
ABOUT ME, I THOUGHT, "WHERE'S

16:05.164 --> 16:07.066
THE GUY THAT KILLED HIM?"

16:07.066 --> 16:08.401
"WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS GUY?"

16:08.401 --> 16:10.036
AND THEN I FOUND OUT THAT YOU

16:10.036 --> 16:11.037
CAN KILL SOMEONE IN NEW YORK

16:11.037 --> 16:15.208
CITY AND YOU DON'T GET CHARGED

16:15.208 --> 16:17.243
WITH ANYTHING.

16:17.243 --> 16:19.612
SO IN OTHER WORDS, THIS CAB

16:19.612 --> 16:21.214
DRIVER LITERALLY COULD'VE KILLED

16:21.214 --> 16:23.182
MY SON, STAYED ON HIS SHIFT AND

16:23.182 --> 16:24.283
GONE ON, MADE-- TAKEN ANOTHER

16:24.283 --> 16:25.184
FARE.

16:25.184 --> 16:26.285
>> Sreenivasan: HOW IS THAT

16:26.285 --> 16:27.386
POSSIBLE?

16:27.386 --> 16:28.821
>> IT WAS POSSIBLE THEN BECAUSE

16:28.821 --> 16:30.489
THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO LAW THAT

16:30.489 --> 16:32.124
SAID THAT THAT DIDN'T HAVE TO

16:32.124 --> 16:34.126
HAPPEN.

16:34.126 --> 16:35.528
>> Sreenivasan: LERNER AND OTHER

16:35.528 --> 16:36.796
ACTIVISTS HELPED PUSH FOR NEW

16:36.796 --> 16:38.831
YORK CITY TO ADOPT PROPOSED

16:38.831 --> 16:39.999
LEGISLATION.

16:39.999 --> 16:40.967
IN APRIL LERNER TESTIFIED BEFORE

16:40.967 --> 16:45.705
THE CITY COUNCIL IN FAVOR OF A

16:45.705 --> 16:46.639
BILL DUBBED COOPER'S LAW.

16:46.639 --> 16:47.473
IT WOULD SUSPEND LICENSES OF

16:47.473 --> 16:49.175
TAXI DRIVERS PENDING AN

16:49.175 --> 16:50.543
INVESTIGATION.

16:50.543 --> 16:51.577
AND LERNER WAS LOOKING ON AS THE

16:51.577 --> 16:52.678
MAYOR SIGNED IT INTO LAW, ALONG

16:52.678 --> 16:55.448
WITH 10 OTHER BILLS RELATED TO

16:55.448 --> 16:56.148
TRAFFIC SAFETY, IN JUNE.

16:56.148 --> 16:56.983
AND JUST THIS MONTH, THE NEWEST

16:56.983 --> 17:02.722
LAW RELATED TO VISION ZERO WENT

17:02.722 --> 17:04.023
INTO EFFECT.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.358
NEW YORK CITY RECENTLY CHANGED

17:05.358 --> 17:08.928
ITS SPEED LIMIT FROM 30 TO 25

17:08.928 --> 17:09.795
MILES PER HOUR UNLESS OTHERWISE

17:09.795 --> 17:10.863
POSTED. THAT MIGHT NOT SEEM LIKE

17:10.863 --> 17:11.831
MUCH, BUT STUDIES SHOW THAT THAT

17:11.831 --> 17:12.765
TINY DECREASE ACTUALLY DOUBLES

17:12.765 --> 17:13.666
THE CHANCE OF SURVIVAL IF A

17:13.666 --> 17:14.967
PEDESTRIAN IS HIT BY A CAR.

17:14.967 --> 17:16.302
BUT ASKING NEW YORKERS TO SLOW

17:16.302 --> 17:17.103
DOWN ISN'T WITHOUT DETRACTORS.

17:17.103 --> 17:18.237
DARKUAH ADIGUN-BOMANI IS A NEW

17:18.237 --> 17:18.938
YORK CITY CAB DRIVER, AS A

17:18.938 --> 17:20.373
MOTHER OF 3 SHE SYMPATHIZES WITH

17:20.373 --> 17:21.507
THE DESIRE FOR SAFE STREETS, BUT

17:21.507 --> 17:22.441
SAYS THAT FOR CAB DRIVERS LIKE

17:22.441 --> 17:23.776
HER, BEING FORCED TO SLOW DOWN

17:23.776 --> 17:24.977
LITERALLY COSTS HER MONEY.

17:24.977 --> 17:26.078
DARKUAH ADIGUN-BOMANI:

17:26.078 --> 17:27.046
THE MORE YOU PICK-UP THE MORE

17:27.046 --> 17:28.881
MONEY YOU MAKE, SO WHEN IT'S

17:28.881 --> 17:29.815
PRETTY BUSY, YOU JUST CAN'T MOVE

17:29.815 --> 17:33.886
WITH A 25 MILES PER HOUR, YOU

17:33.886 --> 17:35.922
JUST CAN'T MOVE.

17:35.922 --> 17:37.023
AND ADIGUN-BOMANI SAYS THAT HER

17:37.023 --> 17:37.924
CUSTOMERS - FAMOUSLY IMPATIENT

17:37.924 --> 17:39.258
NEW YORKERS - WANT HER TO STEP

17:39.258 --> 17:43.529
ON IT.

17:43.529 --> 17:44.297
>> THEY PRETTY MUCH, PICK IT UP,

17:44.297 --> 17:45.131
PICK IT UP BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

17:45.131 --> 17:46.065
THE CUSTOMERS ARE USED TO, YOU

17:46.065 --> 17:46.999
KNOW, SPEEDING UP, MAKE UP THIS

17:46.999 --> 17:49.035
LIGHT.

17:49.035 --> 17:50.036
>> Sreenivasan: BUT IF SHE DOES,

17:50.036 --> 17:50.970
A LEAD FOOT MIGHT MEAN A BETTER

17:50.970 --> 17:54.340
CHANCE OF GETTING A TICKET.

17:54.340 --> 17:59.979
THAT'S BECAUSE IN NEW YORK,

17:59.979 --> 18:01.480
UNLIKE IN SWEDEN, VISION ZERO

18:01.480 --> 18:02.415
DOES INCLUDE STEPPING UP

18:02.415 --> 18:03.516
ENFORCEMENT, FOR INSTANCE MORE

18:03.516 --> 18:04.684
AGGRESSIVE TICKETING BY POLICE.

18:04.684 --> 18:05.584
THE NUMBER OF TICKETS ISSUED FOR

18:05.584 --> 18:06.352
SPEEDING AND FAILING TO YIELD

18:06.352 --> 18:07.119
THE RIGHT OF WAY TO PEDESTRIANS,

18:07.119 --> 18:07.887
IS UP 50% COMPARED TO LAST YEAR.

18:07.887 --> 18:08.721
IT'S BEEN TEN MONTHS SINCE

18:08.721 --> 18:09.822
COOPER DIED AT THIS INTERSECTION

18:09.822 --> 18:10.990
AND MAYOR DE BLASIO ANNOUNCED

18:10.990 --> 18:12.825
VISION ZERO. FROM JANUARY

18:12.825 --> 18:15.294
THROUGH THE END OF OCTOBER HERE

18:15.294 --> 18:16.762
IN NEW YORK CITY, 209 PEOPLE

18:16.762 --> 18:20.299
HAVE DIED IN TRAFFIC CRASHES,

18:20.299 --> 18:24.570
INCLUDING 101 PEDESTRIANS.

18:24.570 --> 18:26.005
A DECREASE FROM LAST YEAR.

18:26.005 --> 18:26.706
BUT STILL A LONG WAYS FROM

18:26.706 --> 18:28.607
ZERO.

18:37.750 --> 18:38.718
>> Sreenivasan: DO YOU AGREE

18:38.718 --> 18:39.585
WITH THE 'VISION ZERO' APPROACH

18:39.585 --> 18:40.353

18:47.994 --> 18:48.928
EXPECTED THAT THE GRAND JURY

18:48.928 --> 18:49.962
CONSIDERING THE FATAL SHOOTING

18:49.962 --> 18:50.830
OF MICHAEL BROWN WOULD HAVE

18:50.830 --> 18:51.597
DECIDED BY NOW WHETHER OR NOT TO

18:51.597 --> 18:52.498
INDICT THE POLICE OFFICER WHO

18:52.498 --> 18:53.099
KILLED HIM.

18:53.099 --> 18:53.866
BUT ITS DELIBERATIONS WILL

18:53.866 --> 18:54.567
CONTINUE TOMORROW AND MAYBE

19:22.728 --> 19:23.396
HELP PEOPLE.

19:41.647 --> 19:44.183
THOUGHT ABOVE OR BETWEEN THE

19:44.183 --> 19:45.818
POLICE FROM KEEPING ANY MORE OF

OUR YOUNG PEOPLE FROM GETTING

BUT THAT'S NOT TO SAY POLICE AND

20:48.714 --> 20:50.216
